1jj1lc,1,2013-08-01,Question Regarding Lab Experience,WhamBot,biology,https://www.reddit.com/r/biology/comments/1jj1lc/question_regarding_lab_experience/,"I'm in my final year, about to graduate with a BS in biology and I'm hoping to move into a masters or graduate program, but I don't have any lab experience (outside of lab classes). 


I've been trying to get into a lab ever since I changed my major three years ago, but I've had no luck. I don't have work study, and paid positions require the student to have work study, so I haven't been able to get any of those. Being taken on as a volunteer is extremely difficult as well. I've been refused by almost every professor in the department at this point (over the course of three years, not all at once). Some say they don't like volunteers because they aren't ""driven"" enough (i.e. won't work that hard if they aren't getting paid), some say they have no room in their lab, and others just say they don't think I, personally, would perform well. I've even built rather strong relationships with a few select professors, in the hopes that I could eventually be given a position in their lab, but I've just been refused over and over.


Not wanting to give up yet, I was going to just run through another round of begging and pleading for my last year, but just found out that if I get another job, or even a volunteer position, I will be terminated from my other student job (which is also biology related, just not in a lab setting). 


So, now I'm basically screwed-- I simply will not be able to graduate with lab experience. But, everyone keeps telling me that getting lab experience is the most important part of my undergrad, and that without it I don't stand a chance. Everything I've done up until now will be useless and I'll never get anywhere in the field-- I probably won't even be able to get an internship.
 


**TL/DR;**
Basically, my question is: are there ways to get research experience after graduating? Or should I just give up at this point? Am I really *that* behind the other students, or is my experience somewhat common?

Do I stand any chance of being hired or taken on as an intern post-graduation if I don't have this experience yet? 




EDIT: Also, I'm sorry because I'm sure questions like these are posted all the time. I searched through old threads, but they didn't seem to really answer my questions, just hammered in the point that I need research experience. I just want to find out from people in the field if I'm totally screwed at this point or not.

1jixtz,17,2013-08-01,"Females vs. Males [spoilers from all seasons] This is a long post, so come prepared. Looking for serious discussion please.",AuchnotOuch,PrettyLittleLiars,https://www.reddit.com/r/PrettyLittleLiars/comments/1jixtz/females_vs_males_spoilers_from_all_seasons_this/,"Okay, so I have been really trying to understand the clues and riddles that A (producers really) have shown us. Although it's totally probable and sensical for A to be a female, I honestly don't think A is. The entire show is very ""female"" heavy. There are main male characters, but not as prominent as the rest of the girls in the series. Anyways, A's actions scream masculine resentment. Not trying to be stereotypical (girls are fully capable of committing ""A"" like acts, e.g. Mona). Before I go into my theories, I do understand that there are females that work for A, obviously, but none of them are going turn out to be A (UNLESS they decide to go down the twin route, but I don't think they will). Okay, here it goes:

**Wren**- I'll start out with the most likely male A. This is a theory that is rather popular with watchers of PLL. First, he is a doctor. He has access to medical supplies and instruments, drugs, and many connections with other people who have more resources for him. This all explains how Mona was never apprehended when she snuck out of Radley. She honestly doesn't know who A is, but nonetheless, Wren helped her otherwise. This also could explain why Ali's body was never shown or witnessed by many people (opening montage never directly shows the body in the casket). Being a doctor, he had connections with the Morgue, and honestly I believe that Wilden was helping him as far as Ali's ""supposed"" dead body. A, Wren, figured out that Ali faked her death and had used another body to cover that up because it allows him to work more freely in his actions because no one is looking for Ali; Except for A, themselves. The show isn't just about torturing the girls. A is trying to find Ali, and through hurting the girls, he believes it will give him an opportunity to ultimately hurt Ali because Ali will try to protect the girls, and as we saw in Season 3's finale, she ""supposedly"" pulled the girls and Mona out of the fire. Hannah was not hallucinating. Okay, so why does Wren hate Alison? I think that the theory that Ali was pregnant is true, and he was the father, but didn't want anyone to know, as it would tear his relationship with Melissa at the beginning of the series. This also explains the whole pregnancy fiasco with Melissa. Melissa knew that Wren got Ali pregnant, and I think they might have tried/or succeeded in making her get an abortion. If she didn't get one, Wren and Melissa tried to get Ali (murdering her), to prevent anything from coming out in public (thus Ali ran away to protect herself and the baby.) It sounds not plausible, but there is a whole lot that the producer's and writers haven't, but will, reveal. Lastly, Wren being A would explain the lack of attacks on Spencer's family. Melissa is on the A-Team, and as we we saw earlier in the mask episode, she told Spencer that she is trying to protect her. Wren doesn't care, so he will try to hurt Spencer anyways (probably partly due to their short affair that caused his relationship to Melissa to crumble). However, Wren respects Melissa by not harming her parents. Also on the A-Team is Jenna (her anger towards her blindness.), Melissa (does resent Spencer, but more mad at Ali because of the possibility she was pregnant with Wren's child), Wilden (helped Wren fake Ali's body and gave Wren resources through the police and I believe he had a relationship with CeCe and Ali hurt it somehow), Mona (obviously, but not anymore. She is realizing that she needs to be on the good side because of her treason with A. She confessed to murder to protect herself by being locked up. HOWEVER, in a sneak peak I swear I saw Mona in Radley again, which is bad because Wren has access, and she doesn't know he is A. We could see her being the character killed off this season, possibly the same way Toby's mother died; Murder turned suicide), and lastly one of the minor females or males that don't seem important in the A scheme: Possibly Paige, Mike, Byron, Mr. Hastings, and maybe Shanna (I feel she isn't on the A-Team, but is willing to help Jenna because she is in love with her). Also, the ending montages with A show a lot of things Wren has been seen to have or do. He's British, so the tea fits the profile, A likes alcohol and Wren had quite the collection, and despite being a crazy psychotic cunt, A is very classy and Wren is a very classy and well-mannered guy.

**Ezra**- This is my second choice. I really don't have too much evidence, but I really don't like his character because he is so vague. He is a teacher, and therefore sees the girls everyday. This explains Aria's lack of A attacks because he does truly love her. He also has a TON of money, even if he denies using it, because of his families wealth. There was a clue the producers gave that I read on another thread that said something long the lines of A **resents** one of the girls more than the other three, but A **likes** one of the girls more than the other three. This is a clue that it's Ezra because of Aria. However, the producer's clues also open up the possibility that A could be Byron, Aria's father, or Mike, Aria's brother. 

**Other theories not quite likely but plausible**- Like I said Byron because of Ali revealing his affair to Aria. Also, Mike, I think we will learn a lot more about him this season and next season. Mike's character is shady to me. 

**Bonus Theory**- Okay, so besides my belief that it is a male, I do however enjoy the theory that A is one of the girls. The only one that it  could be is Aria. Her lack of attacks makes her a very interesting character. She is very eclectic, but she is smart and cunning. I've noticed that sometimes in the show they will have transition scenes and although all the girls do it, Aria is more shown to be using her cell phone when no one is really aware or around her. Also explains knowing all the girl's secrets. The opening sequence, the only girl that has a full frontal shot is Aria, and she of course puts her finger to her lips to shush. Aria is a definitely possibility, but would be very hard to explain to the audience if she is revealed to be A. A does a lot of things that Aria doesn't seem to really be able to do, but then again the show is one big chaotic confused drama. 

Okay, I wrote a novel. Sorry! But I love this show, despite the really frustrating aspects that make me want to cunt punch the girls. Please, I really want to have a decent discussion on these theories and hear from you all on your own theories, or even debunk mine. Thanks. My name is Alex, soooo...

kisses xoxo
               -A


**Clarification**: Melissa was with Ian before the series, not with Wren. However, I think they might have been having an affair behind Ian's back.

**EDIT**: Okay, so a lot of people have been giving me their interpretations of the clue the producers gave when they said A likes one of the girls more than the other three, but dislikes one of the girls more than the other three. Ezra is still a possibility with that, but as you guys have mentioned, it was said at the beginning of the series, and most likely referring to Mona being the only A that we all were aware of. 

**EDIT 2**: A lot of you don't think A is a male, and I fully respect that theory and can see that possibility. However, I feel like if A was a female, she would be doing things a lot differently. I'm not trying to be sexist or stereotype females, I just feel that the things A has done, and the way they have been able to get what they want and need screams a character that easily can access those resources. I mean, Ali is a pretty resourceful girl, but highly unlikely to be A unless their is a twin. The other girls in the series obviously have the attitude and motive to do those things, but I feel that they don't have those resources. Which leads me to believe it is a male, specifically either Wren (access to numerous resources being a doctor. Also, Melissa supposedly goes to London for an internship(?), and who haven't we seen in the show for a while, and who is British and from London? Wren.) Also Ezra (despite denying it, he has access to tons of money through his mother, and sees the girls on a daily basis because he is a teacher. Also, after him and Aria broke up, A started doing more serious attacks against them and their families).

**EDIT 3**: Still waiting on a source, but apparently the producers shot all four of the girls putting their finger to their lips to shush in the opening credits, and they chose Aria's because it was the best. So that rules out a hint for Aria, however still a possibility. Still though, the fact they don't directly show Ali's body in the casket in the opening credits, MUST be a clue.

We're talking about those huge-ass industrial ones that process thousands of pages a day. There are a few smaller home-office type of printers around each cluster of cubicles for convenience.

I had to finish a pretty important report by 4:00pm today, and I needed it signed off... which meant printing it. It's a 9 page report, but there are *440 fucking pages* in the appendices. Client's request that we include every last presentation and associated document. Obviously I'm going to be printing to one of the huge printers, but the one on my side of the floor isn't installed through Windows, and it's 3:30. I don't have time for IT to come install it, so I simply print to the other huge printer across the hall.

About 75% of the way through the print job, the office secretary (who supports everyone on that side of the floor, and who I've never met) comes over and gripes about how I need to use the printer on my side of the floor. I apologize and explain my situation, and even promise to re-stock all the trays when I'm done. She leaves without saying anything. 2 minutes later she's back and lets loose a rant about how I ""need to stop tying up her resources"" with my ""inconsideration."" I had checked the printer status and my document was the only one in the queue. I just shrugged and reiterated how I would resupply everything. Then, as I'm getting my finished document together, she comes by *a third time*, with a guy who needed to print something. ""This gentlemen needs to print something! And you're still using my printer!"" I was about to point out that I was already done, and was actually about to open the tray to resupply it, but she stormed off like I personally offended her.

I said ""sorry about that"" to the guy (who clearly was as confused as I was) and headed back to my side of the floor. Time to make her day.

After I took care of my report, I headed to the guest computer and sent ""her printer"" 2000 copies of a blank page to all 5 trays. Enjoy restocking them one by one, bitch. The printer has a feature where you can make it a secure job, so you need to enter a pin number to cancel or pause the job. I took this opportunity to make my print job untouchable. I plan on sending another one in the next 20 minutes.

Deal with it, crabby bitch."

I'm a rising 3rd year CS major at Georgia Tech. We have two career fairs, one in the fall and one in the spring. My goal is to get an internship with one of the big ones (Google, Microsoft, etc.), but I haven't decided whether I want to do it next summer or next fall. I've never had a technical interview, and I'm worried that I'll mess up any interviews I get from the fall career fair. I've taken a data structures and algorithms class (got an A), but I'll be taking another algorithms class this fall, and I feel that if I wait until the spring, I'd have an extra semester to program more and practice technical questions. I'll know by December whether I want to do a summer or fall internship.

Thanks for any advice and help!"

When is on cycle versus off cycle hiring?

Should I expect there to be lots of hiring this fall with the current outlook in  the US economy?

I am use Linkedin, career builder and monster to find jobs what else can I do?

I just got an offer from a firm in Philly for a position I am not really that into and seems low paying 30k. Should I take it or strive for what I really want to do in New York. 

I will be my computer and can respond if you have specific questions.

1jikqe,14,2013-08-01,"Story (it was ""Short story"" but then, well...)",liveforthelikes,civ,https://www.reddit.com/r/civ/comments/1jikqe/story_it_was_short_story_but_then_well/,"Maria Loukas took another swig off coffee and tried to focus her blurry vision on the document in front of her. ""Arsenal of Democracy"" by Professor Theophanis, of the University of Adrianople. ""The power of the Byzantine Empire comes not from military force, but by the force of cooperation. We often hear our foremost diplomats talk of the importance of our city state allies - if this is to be anything more than political hot air, aimed at furthering our position within the World Congress, then we must make sure that these allies are capable of protecting themselves from the rampant military expansionism of these so-called Zulu Firsters-"" Maria's head slammed against her desk. It was 10pm and she'd be lucky to be out of the office by midnight. Her boss's boss's boss needed to brief the President on ""City State Diplomacy in the Atomic Era"", and that meant she had to read every crackpot radical paper published in the last decade. Apart from a few interns moving boxes and gossiping, she was alone in the office. 


Except suddenly, she wasn't. The doors swung violently, a gaggle of men in suits with furrowed brows came bursting through, throwing their hands around. She recognised the Secretary of State, and in her sleep-deprived condition it almost seemed like he was talking to her. 


""Loukas, you still working on city states?"" 

""Yes, yes sir. I have to say it's starting to look like-"" 

""Forget about that. You need to take a message to the President.""

""The.. the president?""

""Yeah. That gonna be a problem?""

""Well, I... I don't know if I have clearance to-""

""You won't be counselling foreign policy, you're simply to tell her that Ife is under attack, and get her initial orders on whats to be done.""


The twenty minute walk to the Hagia Sofia seemed like a blur. She waved her pass at the guards and was startled at how quickly a pair of double doors were being opened in front of her, and she was looking at President Theodora and her senior staff. As she walked in they turned to her, hard and unforgiving looks; except the president, it seemed to her, who had a warm and inviting stare, that Maria felt piercing her all the same. She felt like a child as she pressed the piece of paper into a hand thrust towards her.


The adviser read for a moment and then looked up. ""Madame President. Chancellor Shaka has launched an attack on Ife, a city state under our protection. It was unilateral, the Congress didn't even know about it until troops were on the borders."" 

The silence made Maria's heart race. She tried to fade into the wallpaper pattern. Maybe she could get out the door without it creaking... But the President began to speak, slowly and deliberately, and she felt herself mesmerised.


""Gentlemen. What are our options?""

""We can't denounce him, to say nothing of going to war. Our borders stretch for miles and we just don't have the military for a full scale invasion.""

""The policy of appeasement has been a great success for over three thousand years, and has allowed us to focus on becoming the cultural centre of the world.""

""The policy of appeasement"" spat Theodora ""was formed at a time when we were friends with the Zulus. Before they pursued this path of.. of Autocracy! And wasn't it you who told me that we're a beacon of democracy. What does that mean if we let this happen?""

Her advisers glanced nervously from one to another. Maria suddenly wanted to say something, anything, to break the tension. The President sighed. ""I don't know why I asked that question when I know the answer. There's nothing we can do, is that what you're going to tell me?""

""Madame President"" a senior looking man began to drawl ""This unprovoked attack will not go unanswered. Our interests are at stake here. We will lose a profitable relationship with Ife, which has long been a centre for pilgrimage in the Orthodox church. Not to mention a vote in Congress."" The others muttered their agreement, as if Congress was a deity that needed prayers muttered every time it was mentioned. Theodora looked up and fixed her drawling adviser with a fiery gaze. 
""Pilgrimage. A VOTE in CONGRESS!"" The men were visibly taken aback by this sudden show of rage. ""And what about the people. Shaka will put half of them to the sword. How long can we keep letting him do this in the name of..."" She clenched her teeth and hissed ""*Diplomacy*"".

Maria was beginning to feel like she would forever be able to bear any awkward silence, and the next one seemed to last for a full minute. She hoped her mouth wasn't open as she gazed at the enraged politician and her cowering entourage. Once again it was the central figure who spoke, with a sudden calm sent a chill up Maria's spine.

""Gentlemen. In the long term I would like to discuss a less morally bankrupt approach to foreign policy, but there's nothing that can be done now. Send the troops we have to the territory of Ife, see if we can..."" She sighed deeply. ""'Get in the way' of Shaka's troop movements. That might buy them time. If questioned, just say they're conducting land surveys. Now if you please."" The hardened military experts scurried out of the room, passing Maria as if she was a shadow. It was only when they she was alone, with the president, that Maria remembered what she had to do and her stomach performed a series of what would undoubtedly be gold winning gymnastic displays. She could be watching the games in Constantinople right now, but here she was and there was no escape.

The fiery eyes were on her, and the calm voice was back. 

""Why hello there. What can I do for you?""

Words. Words would be really good right now. Come on Loukas, any words, but if you feel up to it something about, y'know, your job.

""M-Madame President, I need...""

""What's your name, young woman?""

""Maria. Maria Loukas. I work in the Foreign office, I'm..""

She was floundering, she didn't know why it came out of her mouth, but: ""I'm working on a new foreign policy for city states.""

WHAT? Are you? Are you personally writing a book called City State Diplomacy in the Atomic Era, by Maria Loukas, world's biggest-

""Well what do you think?""

""Of.. of foreign policy?""

Her laugh was loud and warm.

""Of this.. this situation in Ife. What do YOU think I should do."" 

She must be going crazy, but she thought she saw a heaviness in her Presidents eyes. Did she really want HER opinion?

""Well, I... I read an interesting article recently."" She stopped as if she expected to be cut off, and then continued gingerly. ""A professor at Adrianople. He was talking about how we should help to.. arm city states to protect themselves.""

""Did you find his arguments persuasive?""

""Well, Madame President, I... he did say that we could gain more influence by granting units than monetary gifts. If we made a policy of it, and with the new policy due to be adopted next year-"" She froze. ""Oh my god, I didn't mean to make a suggestion for your new policy, obviously that's way above my-""

""No, it's alright. Go on."" 

Alright, just focus on not getting fired. Or executed. It was Theodora who abolished capital punishment the year Maria started working as an intern, but maybe she'd make an exception. Do they execute people for stupidity? Let's find out shall we?

""The most persuasive thing he said, in my own view, was about The Arsenal of Democracy. For him, the Zulus recent move into an autocratic regime is deeply troubling. This is a lasting policy, the main goal of which would be to guarantee the continued sovereignty of city states in the face of military aggression.""

""You're telling me this policy would protect city states without the need for direct military intervention?"" 

""It seems to be, ma'am.""

""You mentioned that influence could be gained.""

""Well, the professor was vague on that. In all honesty, ma'am, the main aim is the protection of the states.""  

""We could do it."" She wasn't talking to Maria; to herself, maybe, or to the air. 

""I'm sorry ma'am?""

Theodora looked up. If she had momentarily let her presidential air slip, it was back.

""Thank you, Miss Loukas. I will look into what you brought me. Ife.. It's too late for Ife, but maybe... maybe there never has to be another Ife."" A smile spread across her face. ""Could you imagine?""

It was time to leave, she knew that. Maria smiled and nodded, and made for the door. As she passed the door, something made her turn back one last time. 

""Madame President?""

""Yes, Miss Louka?""

""That would be-"" She inhaled deeply. ""I know that would be the world I would like to live in."" 

She left the President to her own world, as she smiled, and nodded, and dreamed about peace."

One night I was chilling out in the electronics department about 1 hour before close and this chubby nerdy girl in her 20's comes up to my counter and says, ""Hi I need to pick out a Free DS.""      
I first thought she was being sarcastic so I responded with, "" I don't know about the free models but over here are the ones I have. I do have some of the Mario bundles left.""     
She Smiled and said, ""I'll take the Mario one then.""     
I go to ring her up and she hands me a piece of paper with a clearly home printed coupon on it. The coupon itself looked very official except it said it was for a free Nintendo DS. The girl had a wonderfully thought out sob story about how her DS burned her hand and that Nintendo felt bad for her so they offered her a new DS.     
     
Little back story (can be skipped) Now at this point in my life I was no stranger so retail especially video games. I ran a Gamestore for 5 years and did 5 years in the blue big box electronic store.  10 years in and this was a first. Not to mention less than 6 months ago my DS went tits up Nintendo most certainly did not send me a coupon.    
I asked her point blank, ""Why didn't Nintendo send you a new unit? I've been doing this awhile and this is a first.""     
     
She said, ""Because the felt bad about the DS burning me they wanted to give me a new one.""     
Me, ""Were they out of new ones?"" 
Her, ""Yes, plus I wanted the Mario bundle."" 
Me, ""Lets do this, you buy the DS and send in the receipt to Nintendo and they will reimburse you.""  
Her, ""No I need one today, thanks but I'll just take that one."" 
Me, ""No. there's no reality in which you are leaving with this DS without paying. I'll help you out in any way I can that's not going to cost me my job.""    
Her, ""Well than why don't you help me out by getting your manager.""  just under her breath she called me a fucking douche nugget asshole.     
Me, ""Why didn't you go to the GameStore right next door?  Tyler's the Gamestore manager is there now why wouldn't honor your coupon.  I'm going to go ahead and call him to see how he's doing.""    
Having literally grand opened that store I kept up with the staff as I moved on with life. As my clueless store manager (GM) is taking her time getting to me and the Nerdy girl is continuing to impress me with insulting vernacular under her breath I call the Gamestore next door.     
Nerdy girl pulled the GM aside claiming that I was being very rude and intimidating (all 5'6"" 150lbs of me). I get a picture text from Tyler of the Gamestore email showing me the coupon stating that people are trying to pass this off to get free DS and scanning the bar code will in fact 0 out the item.    
I slide up next to my GM and showed her the pic, she gets on her head set and asks for Brandon to come over to help this customer out.     
We head back to the cash wrap and my GM scans the DS and coupon, The coupon gave us an error. Right about this time Brandon made it to us.     
The GM said, ""Brandon's going to go ahead and get your picture and escort you out of the store, please don't come back.""     
As Brandon the security guard escorted her out my GM turned to me and said, ""Fuck I almost gave her the DS.""

1ji4b1,11,2013-08-01,Prop Trading: Torn between Systems Engineering and Software Engineering - where should I focus my first real job?,brobi-wan-kendoebi,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1ji4b1/prop_trading_torn_between_systems_engineering_and/,"A bit of background: I am completing my BS in Computer Science this fall, and am in the process of pursuing a MS in Computer Science (or software engineering; I have enough pull either way to settle into a specialty). I have had PHP web development internships in the past, and this summer, I got a really nice internship at a financial company in downtown Chicago as a Systems Engineer Intern. I'm talkin' $60k salary as an intern, catered lunches, super casual work environment - it's pretty much the perfect atmosphere for me. I'm able to start working full time come January, and they have heavily alluded to me that they'd like to pull me on full time at that time - if that's what I want.

The catch: I really, really would like to have a development or programming role versus this ""Systems Engineer"" role. Object Oriented programming is just more interesting to me. The Systems Engineering role is a lot of software configuration, deployment, Linux administration, and scripting. It's interesting, and requires a very high level understanding of how our software and hardware systems work as a whole, but I'm not utilizing the programming skills I've built up in the past. I thought it might feature more programming on a lower level, such as driver implementation or messaging systems, but that's a role I've learned that's encompassed by our Software Developers and Software Engineers.

I go to DePaul university. I thought it was an excellent program, especially the masters classes I've taken so far, but I've realized that the people at my company who are Developers are students from MIT, Caltech, Harvard, Northwestern and Carnegie Mellon. I'm competing with the big leagues. If I want to try and apply for a more developer focused position, there's going to be a LOT of heavy competition, and I'm not prepared right now. I really need to review a lot of stuff from the past couple years of schoolwork that I've done, and I need to step up my game and develop more personal projects with any free time I have.

My question is this: I really, really want to stick with trading firms. I love the work, I love the atmosphere, I love the industry, and I love the google-like benefits that they all provide. It's top-tier work, and I want a bite of the action. I could always apply to some web dev or application dev job around here and probably succeed, but I'm hungry for that foot into the door to the financial industry. Should I stick with this ""Systems Engineer"" role right out of school? Or should I try and apply for the Development/Software Engineering role, and if I don't get it, apply at every other prop firm in Chicago that has that kind of role? Any advice from people who are older and more experienced than me, especially if you work in finance, is greatly appreciated!"

1jhxwi,2,2013-08-01,Feeling extremely depressed about life (F21) before one of the greatest experiences one can have.,Lovebethefire,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1jhxwi/feeling_extremely_depressed_about_life_f21_before/,"I need a place to vent. Every area of my life seems to have dismantled. I'm at the brink of what could be one of the greatest experiences of my life ( I'm studying abroad for 5 months in Europe). But every day I wake up feeling like my heart is being ripped from my chest.

My family-
I have almost no relatives. I'm an only child. My Dad's side of the family is somewhat large, but they all live far away and don't keep in contact. We met up for my Grandmother's funeral a few months ago, and no one cried or even said anything nice about her. They're very cold people. 

My Mom's side almost all have mental disorders. I won't even go into the extent of any of it, because it makes me too sad to type out. My grandma has severe dementia (possibly paranoid schizophrenia for most of her life, but is now being coined as dementia?). She gets kicked out of every hospital/home she's been to. It's all we talk about at every family get together. She goes to the bathroom all over herself. She hallucinates. She physically assaults people. Nothing is done about it. This has been going on for a decade. My mom goes over there 4+ times a week (over half an hour away) to clean for them. 

My mother and I fight almost daily. She is very emotionally abusive. I don't live with her during the school year as I live at college.  She also has severe paranoia. She calls me 5+ times/day, even when she knows where I am. She leaves several voicemail a day even when I tell her I don't check them. Even when I don't live with her, she comes to my apartment unexpectedly and starts fights. She has been nothing but un-supportive about my study abroad trip. She tells me everyday that I'm going to be raped, killed, etc. She tells me that I'm too young to be going. She thinks that hostels are brothels. I could go on forever.

My Dad also doesn't support my study abroad trip. I have to hear it when I visit him as well. Him and my stepmom are constantly fighting. She doesn't like me/American dynamics (she's from South America), so she treats me poorly some of the time. I have to buy dinner before I come over there because she refuses to cook for me (even though I don't ask her to??) but there's also no food in the house for me to cook, because they don't go grocery shopping.  

My boyfriend-
We broke up in the beginning of the year and got back together in the summer. It's a dysfunctional relationship, and every time it starts to look up, it crumbles again. I stay in it with false hope that things will change (as they sometimes do). 

My friends-
I have 3 groups of friends, so I wouldn't consider myself a loser. But I'm very detached from all of them. I don't have a girl best friend, etc. 

My friends from college are fair weather friends. I saw one of them last night, who self proclaims himself as my ""best friend"" and it was awful. He sat there on his phone the entire time and made conversation for maybe 3 minutes out of 2 hours. I am okay with sitting in silence, but I might as well hangout alone at that point? I was talking about how my boyfriend's dad says very little (in context to a story I was telling) and my friend said ""did you ever think that you're just boring?"" That really hurt my feelings, because I try everything I can to keep a positive mindset. I always ask people how they're doing, what's new, and talk about their problems. I act excited to go explore and do things, I bring up ideas, and I try to talk about interesting topics. I don't know anymore.

My other friends from college are flaky. Seems they're only friends when it's convenient for them.

My friends from home are flaky too. And when they're not flaky, they're just straight up boring. Their idea of weekend fun is going to the movies every weekend. I hate to sound condescending, but I just don't want to waste every weekend doing the same thing. 

My third group of friends are my boyfriend and I's mutual friends. They are a little more exciting/adventurous than the other 2 groups and we all have a lot in common. Only downfall is that they're very negative at times, and don't make the effort to actually keep in touch. And it's not just with me, they don't really keep in touch with eachother very well either. 2 of my close girl friends from this group became close and now are leaving me out. Same old story.

So I feel really lost. I don't feel I have anyone at this point, so I just keep it all to myself. I told my boyfriend about my problems at home and he didn't have any response. He actually said he didn't. 

Work-
I work for a ritzy financial company (big mistake!!!!!!!). All of the 14 employees are from the same town, went to the same college, and still talk about high school as though it was yesterday (they're all AT LEAST 30). They're never made an effort to get to know me. They treat me like a dog. There's 3 new interns in the office, but yet I'm the only one to answer phones. All 14 employees give me projects to do all day long. If I make a tiny mistake, I get yelled at. They're always condescending. I'm a hard worker and it seems as though no one else cares to notice. They only focus on the bad. None of the interns work, but they don't get yelled at because their family's hold money with us. 

SOLUTIONS?
Well, I'll be going abroad in 2 weeks. Time for a clean slate, but I wish I wasn't carrying this feeling of sadness and fear with me. I want to pursue a Ph.D. when I return, but won't be able to for about 2 years. I want to focus on my music and try to make something more of it during that time frame. I'm just feeling really hopeless. I've gone to therapy for a year. I tried medication. Maybe I should try a different one. I'm happy when I'm alone. But I also need to be around other people. I unfortunately don't find interacting with others as rewarding anymore. I try to uplift myself by reading something inspirational, going somewhere beautiful, but as soon as I interact w/ others, I feel back to square one. My only hope is that I'll move somewhere far away where the people aren't like what they are here, but I know that's not realistic.

Tl;dr Depression is settling in before I leave the country. Any tips on managing this?"
1jhp8o,394,2013-08-01,A Ridiculously Comprehensive Guide to Buying Used Allen Edmonds Shoes on Ebay,jdbee,malefashionadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/1jhp8o/a_ridiculously_comprehensive_guide_to_buying_used/,"If you're looking for business casual or dress shoes on a budget, hunting down a used pair of Allen Edmonds on ebay is often one of your best bets.   It's basically a stock response for newcomers who ask which pair of shoes from DSW to buy.   However, there's much less advice about how to do it *well*.  That should be rectified, eh?  This thread started as a comment [in this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/1jf506/purchasing_used_aes_on_ebay/) , and thanks to a bunch of folks over there for suggestion improvements and extensions.  I added quite a bit onto the original comment, and I think it's a much more comprehensive guide now.

Here's what I'd look for, in no particular order.  *(Note that 90% of this information is relevant for buying other high-end shoes on ebay too, although the suggestions for models, prices, and recrafting aren't necessarily correct for Aldens, vintage Florsheims, etc.)*

 * **Model.**  AE makes a lot of stinkers, so don't take the brand name as a guarantee that you're getting good-looking, stylish shoes.  Avoid square-toes, kiltie tassels ,moc-toes, and bicycle stitching, to name a few.  It's probably easier to say what to look *for* - classic models, even if they have different names the the current line-up.  Strands, Park Avenues, Fifth Avenues, MacNeils, McAllisters, Player's Shoes, Kenilworths, Kenwoods, and Waldens are all good options - in other words, simple captoe balmorals, plain-toe bluchers, wingtips, longwings, and penny loafers.  

 * **Sizing.**  AE sells shoes in [quite a few different lasts (the overall shape of the shoe)](http://www.allenedmonds.com/aeonline/AllAboutLastsView?catalogId=40000000001&amp;langId=-1&amp;storeId=1) in addition to the traditional sizes and widths (from narrow AAA through extra-wide EEE).  If you don't know your size,  you can use [AE's at-home guide](http://www.allenedmonds.com/aeonline/TheFitRightView?catalogId=40000000001&amp;langId=-1&amp;storeId=1) or go to any shoe store in the world and measure yourself on a Brannock device.  If you're new to buying shoes sized by width (instead of the middle-of-the-road D that most big-box shoes are sold in), it's extra important to get your measurements.  If you measure 12C, then a pair of 12AA Strands will strangle your feet and a 12E pair will have them rattling around.  If you measure above or below average in width or length, there's good and bad news.  The good news is that auctions for your size will be less competitive and the final bids will be lower.  The bad news is that your size will show up far less often than average lengths and widths.  Those of you with 10D feet can invert the good and bad news.

 * **Condition of the uppers**.  You want shoes that were conditioned regularly and stored with trees.  Look for minimal creasing and absolutely zero cracks or tears in the leather.  Also keep an eye out for stains, spots and discoloration, especially on the toes (where things were most likely to drip *and* the stains will be most noticeable).  [Here are a few pairs in really good shape.  This should be your goal.](http://imgur.com/a/cQsvv)

 * **Condition of the insole and lining**.  Again, avoid anything with cracks or tears.  If the logo printed on the insole is worn away, that's a sign the shoes have seen a lot of wear.  [These two pairs look totally acceptable](http://imgur.com/a/kCfc0), while [this pair is on the verge of being too worn out to consider buying (depending on the condition of the uppers and soles).](http://i.imgur.com/bgVggAm.jpg)  When there are so many available, there's no reason not to hold out for a lightly-worn pair. Like many better shoes, AEs are constructed with a cork footbed that slowly takes on the shape of your foot.  A well-worn shoe's footbed will be so compressed by the previous owner that they may never feel comfortable.  However, [AE's $125 recrafting/resoling process includes a new set of cork footbeds](http://www.allenedmonds.com/aeonline/RecraftingView?storeId=1&amp;langId=-1&amp;catalogId=40000000001), so that may or may not be a deal-breaker for you.

 * **Condition of the soles and heels**.  Don't worry about the forefoot being scratched slightly. [ As a recent thread on MFA demonstrated](http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/1j9f7r/is_this_normal_for_first_day_wear_with_leather/), that's something that happens the first few wears.  What you want to watch out for are soles that are ready to be replaced, *unless* you're getting a great pair so inexpensively that the [$125 recrafting/resoling charge from AE](http://www.allenedmonds.com/aeonline/RecraftingView?storeId=1&amp;langId=-1&amp;catalogId=40000000001) still makes them worth it.  For me, that would have to be shell cordovan for under $100.  [Here are some soles that are ready for a replacement](http://imgur.com/a/5B6Na).  The hole in the top layer of leather and the welt stitching being ground down so far it's invisible are both signs that you should either pass on the auction or mentally include the cost of recrafting/resoling.  [These, on the other hand, still have a ton of life left in them.](http://imgur.com/a/EhUoW)   To reiterate, don't let superficial scratching scare you away, but be wary of soles that are worn through.

 * **Secret shell**.  Go back to [this pair of longwings I posted earlier.](http://i.imgur.com/LLN7amu.jpg)  They're made from shell cordovan, which is very special, high-quality leather made from horses' asses.  Most sellers know when they have shell shoes and price them accordingly, but once in a while, they don't and you can pick up a pair for an absolute steal.  You've got to know what to look for for though.  The biggest tell-tale signs are (1) the color, which is often a purply-red on older shoes (but not always, especially on newer shoes), (2) a distinct puckering around the eyelets which occurs because shell is much thicker than calf leather, and (3) creasing on the forefoot that looks more like large gentle waves than small wrinkles. [Here's a beautiful pair that shows all three characteristics.](http://i.imgur.com/Rb0C7Yl.jpg) If the model number inside the shoe is still visible in the auction listing, it's often possible to match it with a list of known shell models. [ The ""Shell or Not Shell"" thread on AAAC has been running for about four years, and it's the best resource for learning to spot secret shell.](http://www.askandyaboutclothes.com/forum/showthread.php?100929-Everybody-s-favorite-game-Shell-or-Not-Shell-\(Warning-Big-Pics\)/page59) [Shell is gorgeous, and as this image from Nick Horween's blog shows, it's worth the treasure hunt.](http://i.imgur.com/D0rvajX.jpg)

 * **Price, including shipping cost**.  Even AEs in really shitty shape go for $30-40, so don't expect thrift store prices on ebay.  There's just too much competition and too many idiots bidding based on brand name.  Don't be one of them.  If the uppers and inners are in good shape and the soles have minor and acceptable wear, you should be willing to pay $75-100 for a used pair.  You can get factory seconds (with minor blemishes or stitching errors) for around $150 regularly ([sometimes even $125](http://www.reddit.com/r/frugalmalefashion/comments/1jdwdf/allen_edmonds_seconds_sale/)), so don't overpay for used shoes.  Watch out for ridiculous shipping costs too, especially if the price seems too good to be true.  Shipping a pair of shoes with insurance and delivery confirmation should never be more than $15-20 (unless it's crossing an international border).  

 * **Using Ebay Effectively**.  [PTO's general ebay guide](http://putthison.com/post/318472789/clothesshoppingonebay) is absolutely worth reading, but I want to draw attention to three super useful tools.  (1) [Saved searches](http://pages.ebay.com/help/buy/save-searches.html) will save you the hassle of scrolling through the listings every day.   Be as specific as you can be to separate the wheat from the chaff, but I would *strongly* suggest adding additional saved searches for common alternate and misspellings.  If you find an auction for a pair of ""Alan Edmonds"" or ""Allen Edmunds"", you may be one of the lucky few who stumbled across it.   Note that you can use boolean operators in your saved searches, which will help you find listings by both model name (""MacNeil"") and description (""wingtips"").  (2) Using a sniping service like [Gixen](http://www.gixen.com/index.php) will let you bid at the absolute last second and avoid some of the bidding wars that artificially drive up the final price.  (3) [Search completed auctions](http://pages.ebay.com/tr/en-us/completedlistings/) to get a sense of what your model and size have been selling for recently.  [This search for Park Aves in my size](http://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_sacat=0&amp;_from=R40&amp;_nkw=allen+edmonds+park+ave+12d&amp;LH_Complete=1&amp;rt=nc) tells me that if I want a pair in a reddish-brown like merlot/cognac/burgundy, I can be patient and expect to win an auction for around $65-75.

★★**Important note:  It may take some time to find shoes in the size, quality, and price you're looking for.**★★  

If you don't need shoes in a hurry, that's no problem.  If your internship starts on Monday or you have a wedding this weekend, this guide probably isn't for you (at least not yet).  But do yourself a favor and look for good shoes ahead of time so you're not in an emergency-buying situation.  As /u/JesseThorn [wrote on PTO yesterday](http://putthison.com/post/57036068618/when-you-need-it-now-you-shoulda-got-it-then), ""Great-Uncles don’t die on your schedule, and once-in-a-lifetime job interviews don’t happen right when you expect them. So be prepared.""

I'm sure there's something I'm leaving out, but that seems like a good start.  Happy bidding!"

Before I get to the main point, I think it would help if I said something about myself. Currently, I am a 3rd year mechanical eng. student studying at a Canadian University. My future career related goals are to start at the bottom and work my way to the top (I want to learn and experience the most I can). I hope to get into designing, and from there work my way to a  Project Manager and eventually, a Professor.  
Currently, I am still learning SolidWorks and just started AutoCAD.  I have also taken then initiative to learn C++ by myself, and I plan to keep learning as much as I can throughout my school life and career. 
  
This being said, the company I would like to work for at the moment is at Bombardier, they manufacture trains and aeroplans and such and would love to be managing projects there. 

On the other hand, I've also been told I have bad communication skills (got an A- in a communicatons course though), is there a way I can improve this situation ? 

I'm also a very shy person, but I plan to get out of my shell this year and start networking with representatives from companies through events; are there any tips on how I'd make an impression on companies that are there ? 

My concern is, what steps should I take to achieve my future goals, are there any design related companies that hire engineering students as interns? (willing to move for the period). What other skills should I learn and perfect ?  MATLAB etc .. ?

Any advice would be much appreciated !"

1jhbap,3,2013-08-01,[20/m] My girlfriend (19/f) and I have been apart for the summer. She has expressed possible interest in another guy. Thoughts? Details inside.,-jgs-,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1jhbap/20m_my_girlfriend_19f_and_i_have_been_apart_for/,"My girlfriend of 1.5 years got an internship over the summer in a different state; I have a job at home.  Since we normally are able to talk face-to-face multiple times per day (we go to the same college), having to be separated for extended periods of time is never an easy transition for us.  We try to skype every day, but that's not always possible given our different schedules.

Up until recently, I thought our relationship was going very smoothly (as it always had).  Then, we came to what she thought was a ""fundamental disagreement"" on how we defined relationships.  Her definition of a relationship allowed her to be considering other guys as potential bf's while still in a relationship with me.  My definition was different; I said that I would not consider any girl as relationship material since I was already in a relationship - I want to honor the commitment aspect of the relationship and wouldn't want to put her through the pain of giving her up for someone else.  In my view, the only way a relationship could end would be through internal disputes rather than mine or her preference for someone else.  

Directly after one of the few days I got to visit her this summer, she told me things felt ""weird"" that day.  We had a long conversation that ended up with us debating our differing views on relationships and that she thought I was too clingy (in that I was physically pushy; too much affection, apparently) and had distanced herself from me for the past few months because of that.  We came very close to breaking up.

Over time, I had noticed her talking more and more frequently about a guy with whom she works.  I never thought too much of it, and, in her defense, she works in close proximity to him for 8 hours a day - who else is there to talk about?  Interestingly enough, I found out that she had ""feelings"" for this guy; by feelings I mean that, in her own words, she thought ""he's physically attractive and we're really good friends"".  They talked with each other about relationships and about how they could never be in a relationship because they were too different.  But then things got weird.  They told each other how they felt (he's attracted to her too) and he started saying bad things about me - how I'm ""not right"" for her and how she deserved someone better (presumably him?).  Nothing physical happened between them (I'm taking my gf's word for it) and she eventually confessed this all to me, explaining that that one day was ""weird"" because she had been hiding that from me.  The guy supposedly felt really bad and said he was sorry, but I don't have good reason to trust him (my gf said before that he mentioned how he would never go after another guy's gf).  After all of this confession, she said that she wouldn't hide anything else from me and would be extra super careful.  I just now found out that she wrote a letter to him saying ""to a romance that could never find its roots"" and ""a friendship that will never waver"" as well as ""yours forever"".  She never told me about this (I found out via social media - the guy had posted it).  

She still talks to him on a regular basis.  Should I be worried?  Why didn't she lose respect for him after he obviously tried to ruin our relationship?  Am I being immature by wanting her to cut off ties with him? How do genuine romantic feelings relate to what she described as ""physical attraction combined with strong friendship""?  

This is my first romantic relationship, and I need all the advice I can get.  Hopefully I've clearly articulated my thoughts (although I feel like I really haven't) in order for you all to assess the situation properly.  Thank you in advance for reading this book of a post and for any advice you may give; I deeply appreciate it.

tl;dr Girlfriend of 1.5 years is attracted to and considers relationship with other guy who has no respect for me (he doesn't even know me), but now says she will be careful.  Don't trust her very much at this point nor do I trust the guy.       "

So I figured I'd just forego beating around the bush: I am going to need work when I get there. Like, right away.

I'm a freelance writer by trade. I have a ton of experience in entertainment journalism, both as an editor and a writer. I can and love to write marketing copy, though I don't have a lot of documented experience in it. I have a good bit of experience writing press releases, and have done bare-bones PR work for a few bands around my current area. In that vein, I love writing press kit bios for bands (had a surprise small business grow from it, actually), and I've also put together a few electronic press kits from start to finish.

I would love the opportunity to learn grant writing in a nonprofit arena -- I've done some research and attended a short seminar on the basics, but haven't actually done it yet. From what the seminar showed me, I have reason to think I'd be excellent at it, but I want guidance starting out. Where I'm from, that usually involves some unpaid intern time, but for the right nonprofit, I'll make it work.

So, to all FoCo editors/freelancers who might be reading this:

-What is the writing market like in Fort Collins, for real?

-What are some things/organizations I should *stay away* from?

-What are the highs/lows of freelance journalist rates? 

-If you're interested in further chattery, please PM me! I want to be friends with you!

AND, for the non-editors/writers of Fort Collins: What publication do you read most often? Which one sucks so bad that everyone knows it? And of course, PM me if you wanna be pals!

Thanks! Looking forward to chillin' hard in the Rockies next spring!"

I’m trying to get a job in New York City. I just graduated with an EE degree in May 2013 with 2 research internships under my belt. I have a few questions that noone else could help me with as well as this community:

•	If offered a job where do I go from there? How would I buy myself some time to see if another place wants me or something?

•	What is a typical interview at an engineering firm like? A startup?

•	As I stated, both my internships revolved around research at other universities. To my dismay, I’ve heard that the industry doesn’t respect this stuff as experience. Your opinion?

•	I’ve been sending my cover letter and resume in the same .pdf file. Should I keep them separated or is this okay?

•	Any advice on trying to get a job in a totally different city with no connections (obviously NYC). I’ve heard how impossible this is and that companies usually just hire employees’ relatives and friends, but I don’t care. NYC is where I must be!

•	Any other fields outside of engineering in NYC that an electrical engineer can get a job in? How would I go about doing that (making myself desirable, etc.)

•	When do I follow up on an application/resume submission? Do I call or email?

•	How do I do salary negotiations? I’ve read different things on reddit; some say it looks assertive and direct to ask about salary on first interview, others say this is a big mistake.

•	Are startups generally more lenient than huge companies when it comes to hiring entry-level people? I know the hours may be more strenuous but I’m willing! I would really like to be a part of a great idea blossoming.

•	Any job search sites that I should be using? I already know about indeed, monster, engineerjobs.

Thanks for your help and patience with this guys. As you can see, I’m quite the noob when it comes to industry work. I know my chances are slim so I came to the only people I know to do the impossible on a regular basis.

1jgwuv,4,2013-07-31,Need some advice on turning things serious (going from dating to relationship),Iaintstayinglong,dating_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1jgwuv/need_some_advice_on_turning_things_serious_going/,"Hello everyone,

So here's my situation: I'm a guy and three weeks ago I met an intern my age at work (well, really it was during an office party). She asked me out of the blue what kind of music I liked, turned out we listened to the same thing, we talked for a bit, etc.


Now, our dialogue alone was enough to get me interested, and so two weeks later after I learned she would like to try airsoft I invited her to a game. Later that evening we went to a concert.


We went out again the next week, last Saturday in fact, I invited her for a drink. I think we really hit it off and she seemed quite happy, but nothing happened (not that I mind, I don't think I was ready anyway).


I asked her if she wanted to go out again the same day, she said yes, I offered Friday, she said she'd be on vacation so she proposed Thursday. We were planning on seeing the fireworks display in town (her idea) but strangely she asked me if I had any plans for food (on our Saturday date we didn't eat anything, truth is none of us were hungry) so I asked her preferences and she said if it was better for me she could come over (she already saw my home once and met my family on our airsoft day, we killed the time between the game and the concert there).


So she's coming over this evening for a while and probably we're going to see the fireworks. My question thus: I really, really want to do something this evening to drop the game of cat and mouse and come out clean about my feelings. I'd still hang out with her as a friend, but I don't want to look too pushy. I'm not really afraid of rejection, but if she rejected my advances I'd need some time alone and really what scares me is that I might not have it (since I'd be stuck there with her for an evening).

What should I do to make it clear I'd like to form a relationship with her?


Also, on a side question, can it be considered I'm dating her even though we just went out twice? Or is it still on the level of friends seeing each other?


tldr: seeing a girl, she's coming over and we're going to a fireworks display this evening, want to do something conclusive, don't know what."
1jgriq,3,2013-07-31,M[22] broken up with by F[20]. I just need to talk. 2 years gone.,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1jgriq/m22_broken_up_with_by_f20_i_just_need_to_talk_2/,"I just need to talk. Met her at college and it was great. She became a big part of the family. She was well liked by them and came on vacation. She supported me when I had my breakdowns for my future, when I lost my grandfather, and I helped her lose weight and figure out how to tackle her classes. I helped her stand up to her parents. I taught her to see the beauty in herself. In return, her parents hated me. They could not stand me. They acted like I took her away from them; all I could do is respond with kindness. Last year they said they'd stop paying for her school if she saw me over that break.


Fast forward to now. She took an internship in May and when she left became distant. Sunday I told her I was feeling like she was just going through the motions. That the emotion wasn't genuine. Monday she told me that she was, and has been for months - putting up a show for my sake. That she had stopped loving me. That all her ""I love you"" and plans to visit or see me were just hot air.


She never gave me a reason why. Just said it happened. And then tried to talk to me like we were best friends and I lost it. I just asked her how she has the gall to act like this. Then she told me it was my fault. But never gave me a reason. I took down the photos I had of her. I keep going for walks to try to get away. She says she wants to be friends (I haven't talked to her since it ""ended"") and became a completely different person. I asked her to call me, to talk to me, but she became almost snake like, avoiding words, trying to maintain control of the entire conversation. When we finally talked, it was foreign.


I'm just so angry and upset. I want to cry. I'm at work and I'll just break. I try to keep busy because if I don't it's there. I've been walking a lot, as if walking will make it go away. I've been walking for hours these past three days. I think the night time is the absolute worst. I just can't turn my mind off of memories and thoughts and questions. How last week she wanted to Skype and was planning a week to see me, and now nothing. Sexual escapades she wanted to try out. I can't escape any of those thoughts. If I drink or smoke, it just reminds me. I walk or run or exercise and it just blocks it for a bit. And I fought to keep it going, I really did, the relationship. The 5 stages of acceptance or whatever. And then I try to create an answer, and it depresses me more. There WAS no answer.


I watched Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind and cried watching it. I remember showing it to her and she didn't get it. I keep get angry at her, but I refuse to say anything like, ""she's a bitch"" or ""fuck that cunt"" - I just say, ""it ended and that's it."" I have no intention of dragging her name through mud. And then I remember the times I broke up with girls, and I feel worse for thinking I made others feel like I feel now. Like I deserved this. I'm a strong believer in karma. I'd get the ""operation"" from Eternal Sunshine easy.


I work with a bunch of ""men"" (a landscaping job) and while they've offered words of encouragement, I just can't feel better. I've bothered my closest friend to hell and back and he's been there for me, talking to me. If he didn't have to work and I didn't either, he'd be here with me. I've been suffering from depression, which runs in my family, and it's so hard to not lay in bed. I didn't go to work yesterday, I just napped. My best friend tells me to focus on the good, what I learned about myself, and when I do it just drops me.


What do I do? I finally got my appetite back today. How do I stop this? I go to work and will be with the guys happy, joking around, then just have to disappear and look down to avoid looking sad. But I'm also so angry at myself for not being strong enough to get over it. To walk it off. I'm the guy who everyone says is always happy, always optimistic, and always bringing the brightest out of people. But then I look at other problems people have and this is so minuscule to what they have; so why does this matter?


I loved her.

1jgqrt,5,2013-07-31,RSD Tyler - HOW TO BEFRIEND CELEBRITIES,rsdnation,rsd,https://www.reddit.com/r/rsd/comments/1jgqrt/rsd_tyler_how_to_befriend_celebrities/,"This is a topic that most people have little interest in, but I thought it was interesting because it resembles so closely to how to befriend, date, and sleep with hot women.

So examining how to befriend celebrities is a way to get ""outside the box"" and develop better social calibration on how to get hot girls.

This is my assessment and my rules, that worked for me. Other people may have their own ideas on this, and any celeb may agree or disagree.

**BACKGROUND**
Most people assume you have to be a celeb yourself to make friends with celebs, this simply isn't true.

Rather. celebs have a shortage of cool people to be friends with, and an over abundance of people who want things from them and can't be cool.

This over abundance of people who can't be cool is EMOTIONALLY DRAINING and EXHAUSTING.

People watch them for a long time, and when they finally work up the nerve to talk to them, if the celeb doesn't act EXACTLY how they want, they feel offended because the way they imagined it playing out in their heads didn't match up in real life.

The ultimate irony of the people who can't be cool is the celeb realizes they're more or less a regular person, and that people placing all this value on them is bizarre. They don't WANT to have this effect on people.

Human tendency = everyone in life just wants what they want. Everyone's favorite topic is themselves, and analyzes everything through a lens of ""how does this affect or relate to me?""

If you are talking to a celeb, you have to BEAT this human tendency in yourself, and consider how THEY are experiencing you. It's not all ME ME ME, and MY experience, but rather how to relate to ANOTHER PERSON.

**Rule #1:** Be cool about who they are and what they do.
Most people are either gushing fans, or try to insult it and pretend to be above it as a cheap / transparent gimmick to appear ""not like those other fans"".

""I know it's just a regular person, I'm not intimidated, blah blah blah"". Sure it's TRUE, but 99% of the people who take the time to SAY this don't actually believe it themselves, and are trying too hard to appear cool. Simply say ""Oh ya you do cool shit..."" and move on from it, same as telling a hot girl ""You're a cutie"" and but at the same time not making a big deal out of it, instead of saying ""I'm not intimidated that you're hot, you know...""

(After all, if you don't like it, why did you walk up and start talking to them? It's best to just mention you like their stuff, and then move off of it.)

I personally LIKE being fans of people, and if I saw them I'd tell them how awesome they are and take a picture. I've taken Eckhart Tolle's and Anthony Robbin's programs, and am a major fanboy of these guys.

At the same time, I understand the division of roles. I don't personally want to become friends with those guys because I want them to stay in my life as teachers.

A friend is a special type of chemistry where you just like cracking jokes to each other and make each other have a good time, shared experiences, etc, it's not a chance to leach off of someone for value. There's no ""hybrid friendship"" with someone you idolize where you hang out, but then also bug them for help.

So for example, because I actually WANT to leach off of Tony Robbins for tips, I'd rather simply pay him his fair price to take a program or do an internship with him than try to be his friend, where I can't keep bugging him for tips any more.

Simply realize that there is a division.

Again with the Tony example, that dude may want as much feedback as possible on his material, but if you're going to be his FRIEND you now play a different role in his life, where he's opening himself up to you as someone to make him feel good.

There's a ""time and place"" for feedback, and to do his best when he's teaching he also needs that time away from all the criticism and feedback where he can replenish and recharge, so if you're interjecting that into the friendship it's a violation of that space, and you're slotted back in as a fan.

**Rule #2:** Be pure positive and emotionally self sufficient.
It it not you being ""authentic"" to emotionally dump on someone you've just met. People go out and meet new people to be emotionally uplifted, they already have enough ""reality"" in their own lives.

While it may be authentic to be negative if you feel negative, more important is to manage your life effectively enough that you ACTUALLY ARE able to enjoy a night out or meeting new people without being depressed.

Realize that the ""default"" that most people get is others being negative and dumping on them, since most people in general are negative. Learn to control this in yourself before you try to befriend other people, especially busy celebs who are overwhelmed with people trying to be their friends.

**Rule #3:** Be financially self sufficient and eliminate all envy.
If you hang out with successful people, still offer up to cover your portion of the bill. Never ask for anything.

At the same time if they want to pay, don't be obnoxious about it to the point it comes across paranoid. Say THANKS if they do, by looking them in the eye and saying you liked it.

Never feel envious of their situation, fully own and be happy with your own. If they offer to go somewhere you can't afford simply decline, don't spew negativity about how that place sucks anyway, etc, as you are simply in a different financial space and may arrive there someday yourself.

**Rule #4:** Have your own life that's cool and that you like.
People who have cool lives want to be around other people who have cool lives. This is what makes you an interesting person.

Be grounded in your own movie. Your RAS is focused on your own reality and experience of life, not trying to live through someone else's reality and experience of life.

Other people are welcome into your reality, but they are still GUESTS of your reality.

**Rule #5:** Be non-needy.
Be the type of person who is open to meeting other cool people, but ultimately doesn't care whether you're friends with any ONE particular person or not. You don't ""target"" celebrities to meet them, rather you're just open to it if you have fun hanging out.

You don't care at all whether or not you hear from them, because your own life is filled up with so much good stuff you don't notice.

You should be the type of person where if there's a big dinner, you don't proactively try to sit beside the cool people or where the energy is. Rather, be the type of person where even if you're all surrounded by introverts, the ""cool end"" of the table is looking over at you to see why all the fun is at your table.

If you're at a celebrity gathering, just start having so much fun wherever you are that they start glancing over, and want to be a part of your group.

**Rule #6:** Treat the person as a person, not an object
Don't go around bragging to people you're friends with the person. Don't bring other people out to meet the person, to show off to them.

Don't ask for pictures, don't ask for them to say something about you on their social media, etc.

(Make a choice, if you want the pic that's fine, but you are now officially a fan. You don't get the pic to brag to your friends AND to be their real friend. It's one or the other.)

**Rule #7:** Learn Stephen Covey's emotional bank account principle.
A person's willingness to absorb negative energy, be compliant to your requests, and invest into you, is based on how much good emotions have been put into the bank account.

You can withdraw from the bank account only if you have a lot of positive emotions built up.

Hit people up with funny texts, Facebook messages, emails, and phone calls just to shoot the shit.

Put in a lot of positive emotions before asking for anything or venting any negative emotions, because they are sensitive about people wanting things from them.

**Rule #8:** Accept the person for their pros and cons, don't expect them to be ""on""
Everyone has good and bad qualities. Celebs can FEEL the judgement seething off of most peple who approach them.

The persona that a celeb brings to the public is their ""best self"" and requires REST to maintain. Nobody can be that charismatic or positive ALL THE TIME.

Most people DEMAND that the celeb is that persona they've seen in order to feel happy with the experience, and will shit talk them if they don't get what they want.

""I met that guy and he wasn't all that...""

Okay cool, so you just proved you're one of those guys who was pretending to be cool, but secretly needed the person to be ON ON ON around you at all times. AKA you were a value leach the entire time.

High profile people have had too many of these experiences and find it to be a waste of time, so if you come across in this way it's no buenos. Simply be non judgemental and accept the person for their pros and cons, like any other human being.

**Rule #9:** Understand the overwhelmingly busy nature of the person's life
People who live super busy lives will maintain friendships on a more proacted timeline than a typical person.

When busy people hang out, they do it a few times a year. It's not abnormal to catch up as if nothing at all has changed.

**Rule #10:** Be carefree, bring them into your world, and provide a sanctuary from their concerns of life.
Everyone is tired and scared, it doesn't matter how successful or famous.

Be someone who doesn't judge them at all, has their own life under control, and makes them feel safe and fun when you're around.

Make them feel that the world is a light, easy place for you, even if you've been through many challenges.

Provide an ESCAPE from all the bullshit and idiots they deal with on an ongoing basis, by providing authentic human interaciton.

**CONCLUSION**
Notice how all this relates to picking up hot girls.

Hot women have that same ""high value"" effect and similar problems. They are like miniature versions of celebs.

Ultimately the lesson is to handle your own shit, realize where people are coming from, and provide a fun exchange.

We are entering our junior year of college and about to live 45 minutes apart for the next year. That won't be bad considering this summer I ""abandoned her"" to take an internship 12 hours away in the Midwest. 

The problem is this summer she has broken down a lot, except for when she came out for a week and didn't really like the location. It seems like nearly every other day she has been pouty that I left to the point I hate talking to her because she makes me depressed. 

I'm sure she would be back to normal if she knew I was coming back and not leaving next summer, but the offer is just too good to pass up, and the full time position is even better. She didn't like the area, because it is a typical Midwestern medium sized city, and we come from the rural northeastern mountains. 

She wants to stay at home it seems, where our family is, but I won't even be able to find a job, and the median income is only like $30k. Staying there would be a big fish/small fishbowl situation for me, and I will not stay there, even if she feels like she wants to. 

The company I am interning at has the availability to move to Phoenix which is something I would really want and she isn't thrilled about. 

I'm sure some of you have been in situations like this. Did you guys split up or one of you gave in? It's been a 6 year relationship remember, and I really love her and couldn't imagine my life without her. 
I feel like I've lived there 20 years, and know enough to know I don't want to live there as an adult, while she wants her entire life to be familiar."

I got a summer internship in Seattle and I'm here until about September 16. 

While I'm here I want to take the opportunity to ride FR trails which won't be available when I go back to the midwest.

My goal before arriving was to pick up FR quickly then go to Whistler sometime during mid-summer. Instead I chickened out for the first part of the summer (never caught air on a bike before in my life), but now I'm starting to make lots of progress towards bigger features at Duthie Hill (getting pads definitely helped confidence). Now, I want to get more practice in at Duthie, then hopefully visit Stevens Pass or Whistler in late August or September.

Does anyone:

- want to ride XC and beginner (blue, green) FR trails at Duthie, anytime during the weekend or 6:00-later on a weekday? especially if you'd be able to coach me

- make a trip to stevens pass in about a month

- make a trip to whistler in about a month

About 3 years ago, I bought a Sony Vaio laptop with a Radeon HD5470. I've always played WoW just fine, but after this years expansion, I'm having a hard time. I think I pushed my laptop too hard, now he keeps his 90ºC when browsing the web and often shutsdown when playing videos. 

Since I'm starting college next year (and with internships help) I'm planning to buy a new laptop til the end of this year, but I don't wanna make the same mistake again. I'm looking for a powerful laptop that can handle more than 3 years of light gaming without frying.

Country:

* Brazil. We don't have many laptop models around so I'm going to import from US.

Price:

* $2,000 tops

Purpose:

* I'm starting college next year so I'll be doing a lot of coding (Computer Science). I'm looking for a portable desktop replacement since my college is ~1,5h from where I live.

Looking for:

* Haswell i5 or i7
* HDMI port
* 8GB of RAM minimum
* At least 256 GB SSD
* Long battery life
* Smaller than 14""
* Lighter than 2kg and thin (I'm small)

Gaming requirements:

* WoW, Dota2, LoL, etc.

Any particular style that you like:

* I really like the XPS 14 syle.

Which of the following qualities would you prefer?

* Long battery life -vs- Low weight: Both

* Build quality -vs- Low price: Build quality

* Low noise/heat -vs- High performance: High performance

Would you pay a premium for something that has:

* High resolution screen: Yup

* A great keyboard: Yup

* A great touchpad/mouse buttons: Yup

* Great audio: Don't care



I thinking about the Razer Blade 14"" and Haswell MBP. The point is, the MBP is unlikely to have a dGPU, so I'm afraid that after 3 years I'll have to buy a new laptop. The Razer has a terrible screen, so I don't know if it's worth.

Thanks!

Questions|Answers
:--|:--
[, I just want to say that NaughtyDog is my favorite game company of all time, I think you guys do an amazing job. Jak and Daxter is my childhood game and The Last of Us just topped it for my all time favorite game. I still want to get the Crash Bandicoots, and the Uncharteds are awesome. You guys can make a game about reading a phonebook and I will pre-order and platinum that game.  Ok, now for the questions. I understand if you choose not to answer some of them.  Do you see yourselves ever making games for all platforms, or are you guys sticking with Playstation?  What was the biggest challenge NaughtyDog as a team had to go through?  I've read that during the development of Uncharted 3 you split into two teams, the second began working on The Last of Us. Are there still two separate teams? If so, does this mean you work on two different games simultaneously?  On /r/thelastofus I've seen some debate on whether or not Bill is gay and if David intended to rape Ellie. So, just to put the questions to rest, are those true?  In The Last of Us campaign, why weren't there any 3 way fights between Joel, hunters, and infected? Was it a technical issue?  In the Last of Us, when and how does an infected become a bloater? I know the four stages (runner -&gt; stalker -&gt; clicker -&gt; bloater\), but it was said that when an infected feels like it's about to die it finds a corner to release more spores. So does the bloater happen before of after the spore release stage?  I have a friend whom I regularly play The Last of Us with. He's currently attending DeVry University and is currently working toward a degree in graphic design, It's his dream to work with you guys at NaughtyDog. What are his chances?  Do you guys plan on making a big entrance into next-gen with your next game?  Is it likely you will ever return to Jak and Daxter? And do you consider The Lost Frontier canon? Basically (this is the big one\), **will there be a Jak 4?**](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jg952/hi_were_neil_druckmann_creative_director_and/cbecogt?context=5)|4) There are still two separate teams working on two different projects. 5) Open to interpretation.  I will say Bill was written to be a gay character, but W. Earl Brown has said his performance is open to interpretation. \ 6) Both. 7) Don't know yet.  Entertaining some ideas, though. 8) What do you think?  :) 9) A lot.  10) Not a technical issue.  We actually had the tech to do it, it just never fit with the story. 11) No plans 12) Bloater happens if the body is strong enough to survive for longer than a clicker.  It's a rare occurrence. 13) Relative to his skill &amp; passion. 14) Don't know yet. 15) We always make a big entrance.  :) 16) No plans.  We gave it a shot at the beginning of the project and couldn't make it work for ourselves.
[(Spoilers\) Can you clear up whether or not Ellie ""knew"" at the end? Or is that supposed to be left unknown?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jg952/hi_were_neil_druckmann_creative_director_and/cbed78e?context=5)|It's open to interpretation.
[Spoilers: The toy that Sam grabs in the store is a transformer. Was that done purposely to show his eventual turn or is it just coincidence?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jg952/hi_were_neil_druckmann_creative_director_and/cbecqzq?context=5)|Lol... we're not that clever. 
[1\) How difficult was it bringing a new IP to the table with Sony this late on in the PS3's life?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jg952/hi_were_neil_druckmann_creative_director_and/cbecr5y?context=5)|1) It was surprisingly much easier than we thought It'd be.  Sony has a lot of trust with us.
[Thanks for the AMA. I loved the ending of TLOU, I felt that it was so selfish, but so human at the same time. The world took something from Joel, so he took something from the world.  What other thoughts were there on the table for the ending for The Last of Us? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jg952/hi_were_neil_druckmann_creative_director_and/cbecq6v?context=5)|We had a happier ending at one point... where Ellie &amp; Joel were driving completely contented &amp; satisfied with their adventures off into a glorious sunset... but that didn't feel right. It just wasn't honest to the world or the characters we created. This ending felt right for us.
[The last shot of Ellie saying ""okay"" has to be one of the most powerful shots in gaming history.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jg952/hi_were_neil_druckmann_creative_director_and/cbed7v3?context=5)|Just an aside... it's nice that our opening image is Sarah, and our closing image is Ellie... I think it's nice at least. Good job us! haha :P.
[I have loads of questions, so I'll try the number I ask brief.  One of my favorite moments in the game (alongside the giraffes and David's death\) was the truck ambush in Pittsburgh, and one of  the reasons for that was the music. Was Hank Williams always your choice to complement the scene, or would you have used something else in hindsight?  As female Hunters/cannibals/Fireflies/military exist in concept art and in the multiplayer mode, why do we only fight male humans in the game? (There are female soldiers but Joel doesn't fight them in-game\) Is there any story based explanation, like keeping all the women and kids at the home base? Or was it for creative reasons, given the brutality of the combat?  What were some infected concepts and stages that you cut from the game? Looking at the artbook, there are a lot of concepts that seems pretty far-fetched for the universe you created, like the infected wielding tools.  Why are there no pictures of Sarah's mother in Joel's house? Is it because even before he lost Sarah, Joel wasn't one for holding onto the past?  Does Joel's last name start with an M or an N? I'm asking this because one of the ND forumers found the certificate in Joel's house with Sarah's (obscured\) full name on it, and we were wondering if you had any last name for Joel in mind.  Regarding David: How long do you suppose it took for a man like him to lose grasp on his morals, accept the new world order as it is, and turn to cannibalism with his buddies? Furthermore given the rather hebephilic overtones of his interactions with Ellie, was this an intentional character trait or just part of Nolan North's performance? If intentional, did David always have such tastes or was that just a byproduct of post-pandemic lawless living conditions?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jg952/hi_were_neil_druckmann_creative_director_and/cbed4cn?context=5)|1) Hank wasn't the original choice, but he did turn out to be the best choice. 2) Development time &amp; memory prevented us from seeing the female hunters to completion. 3) Fungus growing on the environments that shot poison darts at the player were at one point in the game. 4) The backstory was that she left Joel after Sarah was born.  Not someone he looked up to to keep a picture around. 5) We didn't reveal the last name. 6) David's cannibalism came after the outbreak.  His other traits (both good &amp; bad) were always there.
[If you'd made the game for PS4, what would you have done differently?  Thanks for helping to make such an awesome game! ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jg952/hi_were_neil_druckmann_creative_director_and/cbecqcf?context=5)|Memory wouldn't be as much of an issue. we had to jump through so many hoops to get this game streaming (no load screens in our games still.

[Hey guys, congrats on the huge success on TLOU! I actually have several questions for you to avoid a repetitive question.   What game was better to work on, TLOU or Uncharted?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jg952/hi_were_neil_druckmann_creative_director_and/cbecu84?context=5)|Shit. both have their ups and downs (in production terms). For me U2 was my first time stepping into the game director role, so that was a fresh &amp; exciting (maybe naive but super open) time, but TLOU was something special, and challenging. I saw a video of U2 the other day and had some pleasant feelings of nostalgia bubble up, and seeing the fan art and people's reactions to TLOU has been extremely exhilarating. They both win! :)

 |Shipping the game. actually maybe watching the boot-up sequence with the ND logo &amp; TLOU logo fade into the start menu. I fucking love that. It feels DONE at that point.
 |But as far as the actual game... there are too many to count. I love this game!

[I suppose I’ll try and tackle the “elephant in the room” question.   Will there ever be more story content from the universe that Ellie and Joel live in centering around the two characters?  Also, as a more personal question, what was the hardest part about setting up a story and characters that were not entirely clichéd and set apart from the vast amount of other films and games based around zombie mythos?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jg952/hi_were_neil_druckmann_creative_director_and/cbecoe8?context=5)|It's possible.

[I wrote your studio a letter about a month and a half ago basically thanking you for all of the hard work that you put into The Last of Us. It got me through the recovery of a pretty serious and painful surgery.  Now time for my question!  **Question:**  What made you decide to keep the original ending for The Last of Us even though it did not necessarily test well with your focus groups?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jg952/hi_were_neil_druckmann_creative_director_and/cbed9lk?context=5)|It felt honest.  Anything else felt like we were pandering.

BUT you COULD say Marlene was weary of Joel and/or you don't reeeally know how long Joel was unconscious for.
 |And regarding the choice - 1. it's just the story we wanted to tell and 2. it's not a story-choice-based game, so to cram a major choice in at the last, final, epic set-up would've felt forced (to us)
 |Ellie was too important to the Fireflies to offer any kind of choice to either Joel or Ellie in regards to her fate.
[What are your plans for the future of The Last of Us?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jg952/hi_were_neil_druckmann_creative_director_and/cbecp0w?context=5)|Currently working on single-player DLC.  Talking about other ideas.

We give those scenarios to the concept artists (in this case Hyoung Nam) to help us find the characters. So in stead of just doing flat orthographics or guesses at poses to sketch the characters in, we found that if you put them in a situation, it tells us way more about their design. 
[Awesome AMA, guys!  So I've heard, that according to the Japanese *The Last of Us* instruction manual, Joel and Ellie's last names are *Miller* and *Williams*.  Is that really true?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jg952/hi_were_neil_druckmann_creative_director_and/cbecr5b?context=5)|Those were names that were used in early docs, but we decided to remove all last names for main characters pretty early in development -- no sure how they made it to any released manuals.  So no, Ellie's and Joel's last names aren't revealed.  The only main character who's last name you can find is Riley's.

No Country for Old Men was a much bigger inspiration for us.
 |That book was awesome. Neil &amp; I both read it... I think back during U2 development. It's a very impactful story. yeah, it was one of many influences. mainly the lengths the father is willing to go for his son, and the darkness of the world that surrounds them. it really shines a light on the things humans are willing to give up (morally) to in order to survive. we also read City of Thieves, the movie No Country for Old Men, the movie Children of Men, and the Walking Dead comic... among some more non-fiction reads about how the world falls apart in ""World without Us"" and ""The Last Town on Earth""... check 'em out. 
[Amy Henning mentioned in several interviews that the create process for Uncharted (specifically 3\) involved deciding what would be challenge them on a technical level, and what kind of levels would be interesting to go to. To a certain degree, they built the story around those levels.  Was your philosophy the same with The Last of Us, or did story come before gameplay? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jg952/hi_were_neil_druckmann_creative_director_and/cbecu7d?context=5)|The concept of structuring an entire game around a relationship between two characters came first and was always at the heart of development.

[Now that the game has been out for awhile now you have no doubt heard some criticisms made about the game. Some of these hold water and some are in my opinion just people nitpicking in order to get attention.

Thanks for sharing.  1) Don't know.  Still trying to figure it out ourselves. 2) Ending is open to interpretation.  
[Seeing as you've been looking over the game from the very beginning and through the development, was there anything that took you by surprise or anything you noticed when finally playing through the finished result that you were not aware of during the development? Or is it difficult to fully immerse yourself and enjoy the game after you've spent years making it? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jg952/hi_were_neil_druckmann_creative_director_and/cbecq50?context=5)|Well, it's always hard playing a game that we've been so 'attached at the hip' to for so long without seeing the flaws. I mean, ""art is never finished, just abandoned"", right? And with video game development it's even worse. But I can say when playing through the game more strung together, I teared up at moments that I KNEW were actually going to happen. That was cool! I think some of it was the relief of 3+ years and a lot of blood, sweat &amp; tears manifest on the joystick. What a relief! 
[Internally, was the ending of The Last Of Us controversial??  I liked it but personally would have written it differently, how many possible ideas did you have for it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jg952/hi_were_neil_druckmann_creative_director_and/cbecqtk?context=5)|Initially, yeah... ending we ultimately went with didn't sit well with some members of the team.  Once it was more fleshed out, it became an easier sell.  We went through about 3 or 4 ideas before finding the ending that worked best for the story we wanted to tell.
[Can you elaborate on the alternate endings?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jg952/hi_were_neil_druckmann_creative_director_and/cbed4m5?context=5)|We'll share some of them at a panel Bruce and I are doing at PAX.  More info to come.

[Was it easier to create a completely fictional world like Jak and Daxter or was it easier to create a world based on real life like in The Last of Us?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jg952/hi_were_neil_druckmann_creative_director_and/cbecpgp?context=5)|AREYOUKIDDINGME?!?! haha. Jak and Daxter would be a luxury to design in that world again. Story would be hard to have depth though. Those characters are who they are now - it's hard to infuse them with the motivations &amp; choices we'd need them to have to make a compelling story (we tried early before we decided to make TLOU). A grounded world is a difficult solution space to design in though. But nothing good comes for free...

[Also please give us a Joel Ellie sing along.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jg952/hi_were_neil_druckmann_creative_director_and/cbed57p?context=5)|We started with the idea of building a bond between two characters over the course of an entire game - and then a confluence of events happened that just fell into place for us that made the survival world a perfect backdrop to create the tension we needed for those characters to make interesting choices... so characters, then world I guess.

That was some good fun! Not on the all-time list, but on a 2013 best of for sure OH! Limbo was awesome...  'nuff...

The Last Guardian is my most anticipated game.  
[I'm an author, and one of the most difficult things I find myself doing at the start of writing a novel is naming my characters something that is appropriate to their personality. I also share my name with Joel, and when The Last of Us was first announced, I flipped shit because Joel isn't a very common name. What made you want to use Joel for the main character of a post-apocalyptic tale, as opposed to more 'rugged' names?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jg952/hi_were_neil_druckmann_creative_director_and/cbecvux?context=5)|His original name was Ethan, but we felt it was too close to Nathan.  I'm sure that can lead you to find out where the name Joel came from.  :)
[Hello Bruce and Neil. Thanks for taking the time to do this AMA. As a programmer with an interest in AI, I enjoyed the ""Balance of Power"" system in TLoU. Can you talk about some of the hurdles and/or compromises the team had to make in order for the AI to help or challenge the player?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jg952/hi_were_neil_druckmann_creative_director_and/cbeco8b?context=5)|All sorts of trials &amp; tribulations with our adventure in making great AI. maybe too many to get into here - but a couple things... having an Ally with the player in stealth encounters is probably the most difficult problem we could have tried to solve, and ""we"" (the royal industry we) need time to implement, iterate, and find solutions to the problems that will only come up by having actual set-ups in the game to help steer the tech direction... dunno if I'm answering this well... another early goal for the enemies what we had to create a ""dynamic front"" due to the flexibility we wanted the players to be able to take with our more wide-linear layouts. it meant the AI had to be able to recognize a new ""front"" where they'd be safe - and analyze the environment &amp; collision to create new dynamic flanks based on wherever the player was... ok I'm rambling. Max Dyckhoff did an AMA earlier, maybe he said something smart about the AI! haha.
[Hey you two. Your company has made some of the most memorable games ever. So I was wondering if you ever got the chance would you guys make another Crash Bandicoot? Another question. TLOU actually inspired me to write book, it's about zombies. Do I have your permission to use the quarantine zone idea?

 |Funny thing, is we really just make games that we think would be fun to us.

[Thanks for doing the AMA Naughty Dog and for the amazing adventures you have provided with The Last of Us and your previous works...here are a few questions. :\)  What phases of development did the Naughty Dog team have to go through when creating The Last of Us? Was any code reusable from the Uncharted Series?  Any plans for the lab to be introduced in The Last of Us multiplayer…? If not, will you guys still be updating it in Uncharted 3?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jg952/hi_were_neil_druckmann_creative_director_and/cbed6et?context=5)|It's somehow become an unspoken naughty dog tradition to put a precursor orb in all of our games. so no.. nothing is being said with that  The lab was a fun concept for us too. who knows if it works with TLOU. we're working on our DLC stuff now, we'll have to see what the future brings... 
[Any plans for a stats page for The Last of Us similar to what you guys have on for Uncharted 2 &amp; 3 multiplayer? On that note, how does the rank system work for The Last of Us multiplayer?

And yeah, the foundation we started with was the Uncharted engine. we ended up rewriting the AI system from scratch and added some features to our rendering engine (along with misc other stuff), but most of the core tech was the Uncharted engine.
[Hi Bruce and Neil. Excellent job on TLoU, this game actually made me buy a PS3. It just had to be played.  As a computer science student in the United Kingdom passionate by the gaming industry, I ask how would a student go about learning in a studio such as Naughty Dogs? It seems that most studios all look for previous experience, which I do not have and is completely understandable.  Does Naughty Dog ever plan to run any internship schemes?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jg952/hi_were_neil_druckmann_creative_director_and/cbed4x4?context=5)|Naughty Dog doesn't hire interns.  Although, I started here as an intern by bugging Jason Rubin and Evan Wells.  
[Hey Neil and Bruce, big fan here of Naughty Dog and looking forward to play future releases.

We got a lot of morbid out of our systems.  We did tone down some of Ellie's deaths during the David boss fight as they felt like too much to us.

I have a internship now doing chem informatics software coding, and I plan to get some lab work during the winter.

From what I understand going for masters/phD is damn near required to be successful in the field, and at the moment I don't think I want to go to school for that long.

I do enjoy both the computer science aspect and biology of the major, but if I'm going to be stuck doing low level lab work for the rest of my life, I might have to change majors.

1jleu6,19,2013-08-02,[UPDATE] Other intern stole from me and I'm so pissed off but have to have patience,WolfBro,rant,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/1jleu6/update_other_intern_stole_from_me_and_im_so/,"Original Post:
http://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/1i64ny/other_intern_stole_from_me_and_im_so_pissed_off/

So I'd gotten tired of telling everyone the same long story over and over again so I hadn't updated here, but I'm finally getting around to it.

So on the Friday that I posted the original post, the police came by and I gave them everything I had. However, most of what I had was not solid enough for the police. The officer told me that the case would be passed along to an ""investigator"" and he'd be calling me at some point.

After that I'm thinking, if I were a police detective who is kept moderately busy, how much am I going to care about a $300 theft? My answer was not at all, and I knew my case would require some digging to be 100% solid. So I became very upset. I'd felt that I'd lost and the bitch had bested me. 

I drove to my dad's house because my room mates idea of calming me down was to try and convince me via devil's advocate that I should assume she's innocent and look at that from her perspective. This absolutely infuriated me as I knew I was right.

So I drove to my dad's house so I could rant and calm down. My parents raised me to have a strong belief in what is right and wrong as well as honesty. And it wasn't so much that I was upset about the money. Honestly, I didn't give a shit about the money. Yes, I wanted the money back, it was $300 and I'm not rich, but $300 isn't going to make or break me. Instead I couldn't stand that someone would do this. It didn't even compute in my head how someone could do this. Especially since I'd thought we were friends. We sat next to each other at work, were constantly interacting and I thought it was a good relationship. 

And then there was the whole fact that someone who should be smart to be going to UCSD and able to get an internship at Sony. When I first learned that someone else had used my cash card, I was terrified because I knew that if I had committed this crime, I wouldn't have gotten caught. It really wouldn't be that hard and I assumed that the person would be at least as smart.

So before I'd calmed down talking to my dad, I was literally shaking with rage. And I wanted justice, not just my money back. Not necessarily justice for me, just for someone who is so stupid and wrong to be held accountable for what they did. And that's another reason the police felt worthless to me. The officer made it clear that their only concern was to get my money back, to retrieve what had been lost. It wasn't important to catch the person and hold them accountable. I didn't say this, but my thought was, ""But wait, I'm not reporting a loss, I'm reporting a CRIME!""

While I was talking to my dad in the kitchen, my older sister comes through and I let her know about the whole thing and everything I have. She's a lawyer who just took the bar this week. She told me that I could file a law suit against the person and after filing I could get subpoenas to get the security footage from Staples and my company, which is conjunction is very solid evidence. This surprised me because I didn't realize subpoenas were something that I alone could get.

I turned to my dad and said, ""I've won."" I felt immeasurably better. I had felt for sure that even though the evidence existed, I'd need the police in order to get it, and at that point I'd felt they would be worthless (understandably, I get that my evidence was purely circumstantial from their standpoint and they need to be impartial in the way they pursue justice, but it still pissed me off). 

So I knew I'd won and now I turned my attention to enjoying giving the bitch exactly what she deserved. At that point I'd been so pissed that I wanted my money back, I wanted her fired and I wanted her arrested. 

So on Monday I got all the paperwork from the court's website and began filling it out. My sister gave me instructions on how to write a declaration with everything I knew and then she made it all pretty and legalized for me. I printed off the subpoena forms as well and contacted my company to figure out who I needed to name in it. I had been nervous about that part. I was scared they might resent me for subpoenaing them, but after I got a response they seemed cool with it and told me who to name. 

My plan at this point wasn't to actually file the lawsuit. I wanted to get it all ready so that it just needed to be filed at the courthouse. I was going to take the stack of paper and confront her about it and I felt that if I made it clear that this wasn't just a typical ""I'm going to sue your ass"" kind of threat, and I was actually ready to do it, that it would carry more weight and scare her into just taking the easy way out.

I met with the HR manager again on Monday and updated her that I felt the police wouldn't be of help and told her my intentions of filing a law suit. At this point I told her she could go ahead and talk to the suspect. I'd asked her to hold off until I spoke with the police because I'd felt that the only way to definitely prove her guilt was if the police could find the purchased items in her apartment. And I didn't want to clue her in that I knew she'd done it so she could get rid of the evidence. The talk revealed nothing because all the HR Manager could do was tell her that someone had stolen it from me and ask her if she knew anything about it. Obviously she responded that she didn't.

But now I didn't care because I knew I'd get the video evidence I needed and it didn't matter what she did with the merchandise.  I also stopped being nice to her. Up until that point I'd been reigning everything in so I was still acting perfectly normal with her. Now I just flat out ignored her and it was kind of fun watching her reaction to it. Obviously I'd respond to anything purely work related, but that was the extent of it.

The HR Manager had also told me that I needed to handle this outside of work and asked me not to talk to her about it at work. This was a bit of a problem because we worked different schedules so I didn't know how to get to her in person. I also didn't have her number or personal email. My room mate was facebook friends with her, so I just messaged her on there which was also nice because it could show me that she'd read it.

My dad had been strongly advising me that I can't just flat out accuse her of it so I chose the words carefully. I just said that on Wednesday night I'd found out that my warranty card had been used and that Staples managed to bring up the security footage of the person who used it. Then I said that the footage showed her using my card to buy the stuff. I said that I'd already drafted all the paperwork to file a lawsuit against her and if we hadn't resolved this by lunch time the following day, I would be taking the paperwork to the court house. I asked her to please pay me back my money.

So the next day I went into work. I was feeling really anxious because I don't like confrontation. I just didn't want to deal with it. But I walked past her cube and sat at my desk like normal. After a minute she pinged me on microsoft communicator, asking for me to help her with something. It felt vague compared to how she'd normally ask that, so I assumed it was related to the money.

With that inkling I went all spy-mode and I brough up the voice recording app on my phone and tucked it into the breast pocket of my shirt. When I entered her cube, she pulled the receipt from the purchase out folded up to just show the giftcard number used to pay for it. She asked me if that was the number for my card. I looked at her sceptically and said yeah. She then started the worst acting I've ever seen, like seroiusly, Hayden Christensen's performance in Star Wars felt like an academy award performance compared to this. She pretended to freak out like she couldn't believe it.

She asked me to follow her and we went outside. And this is the best part. Are you guys ready for this? It's awesome.

Her story... was that on Wednesday a friend of her's that she's in business with called her up and gave her a Staples giftcard code and pin number to use to buy some business supplies. She said that he'd gotten it off craigslist and she couldn't believe that it was mine.

For a minute I just stared at her. I could not believe that this was the best story she could come up with. It was so fucking ridiculous. I honestly couldn't believe for a second that she could honestly ever expect me to believe it. She wants me to believe that someone else at work, a full-timer who was an adult and been working at the company for years, stole the cash card and put it on craigslist. Even though the ONLY PERSON I told at work was her. And that somehow, by astronomical odds, it just happen to be her fucking friend who bought it and just happened to give it to her, the only person at work who knew and that sat ... right... next... to.... me....

But I went along with it, tried to play it cool. I said that if this in fact true, that she'd need to show me the craigslist ad. She said but what if it isn't there. I said a big site like craigslist wouldn't delete any of the post data. It may not be visible to us, but they'd definitely have it and I would be surprised if they didn't make tape backups of everything and such.

1jlakt,3,2013-08-02,My Internship Ends Soon - What Should I Ask My Bosses Before Leaving?,CharlieTango92,sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/1jlakt/my_internship_ends_soon_what_should_i_ask_my/,"Hello SysAdmins, and happy Read-Only Friday.

I have been serving as an IT intern for a small-ish firm for the summer doing tech support and jr sysadmin type work.

I have blocked out a time with my direct report and his boss both of whom I interact with daily, to have a bit of discussion before leaving.
Aside from performance (what i've done well and what i could use to improve upon) - what would be prudent to ask them?

A little background if it helps - Currently an IT student, about to enter last year. Hoping to get a sysadmin job, after graduation (Linux would be preferable, but i know i have quite a bit of learning to do before I reach any kind of RHCSA level)

Our environment is Windows, and most of my work aside from vanilla tech support has been doing O365 Admin work (pretty basic stuff.)

So, knowing what you know know, what do you wish you'd asked earlier in your career?
Or if you had an intern, what would he do well to ask from you?

I don't want to be a nag, it just seems it would be remiss if I did not have some kind of definitive take-away advice upon leaving (my boss has echoed the same sentiment.)

Thanks in advance, and you all enjoy your weekend! "

I've had a few good things happen but all the bad seem to outweigh the good and I'm not handling it well. 

* Last September my fiance was arrested and has been in prison/treatment since then. (He comes home in a couple weeks and I need to change my mood before he gets here)
* I have been short on money since December, my hours were cut and now I have no job. (I was a student employee, but graduated so I couldn't work there anymore)
* My mom has been funding my life while I do the internship and I can tell sometimes she is hostile about it.
* I have smoked cigarettes for years, but lately I've been smoking more and it is helping stress less
* I have been attempting to go to the doctor to get BC before my boyfriend gets out to no avail because appointments take forever. (could have something to do with my mood since I've been taking BC for 6 years and no longer am... does it cause mood changes?
* I have been unable to find work since graduating in May
* My lease runs out in 2 weeks and I have no where to go but back home, 2 hours away from here...3 hours away from my fiancé.
* My career choice is causing more hostility between my father and myself
* My family does not approve of my fiancé 


**Positive:**

* I graduated in May with a BS
* I am 2 weeks away from being a certified Substance Abuse Counselor
* I have a wonderful supportive handsome caring fiancé
* My mother is mostly supportive of me.


I can't think of any more positive things and none of those things seem to make me feel any better about life.  I don't know what to do to make myself feel better.  I live alone and lay alone all day besides when I am at my internship waiting for something to happen.  I've tried running/walking daily, but that doesn't seem to help either. I've gone to see a counselor, but I no longer have the funds to do it since my mom is supporting me and I'm not a student.

...I'm sorry for the long post I don't even know if this is where I should be at or how I should post.  I'm just so lost I need help.  Everything makes me cry or want to go curl up in a hole and not come out."

Now that summer is coming to an end, I've gotten an offer to continue part time work over the semester and then take another summer's internship. The problem is I feel like I didn't learn that much in this internship and it's not something I can see myself doing in the longterm. To be honest, I'm more interested in hardware or low level computer engineering stuff, but I have no industry experience so I could be completely off. On the flip side, if I took the offer, I could graduate debt-free (pretty important for my family)

So my question is should I be financially responsible and take the offer, and hope to transition later? Or should I try to get another job with another company and experiment to see if I like something else better?"

**Jason Salfi (Co-founder and Bossman)**: ""I picked up my first skateboard in 1977 and learned how to carve.  In the eighties, I was fortunate enough to be a part of small skate scene in Western NY.  We had a few small hills and vert ramp.  I graduated from Cornell (Ithaca, NY) in 1992 with a degree in Natural Resource Management.  During that time in college, I got my first taste of hill skating and galvanized both my passion for standing sideways and creating solutions for the myriad problems that our society was creating for all living things on the planet Earth.  I moved to San Francisco in 1992.  After many full moon skate missions on Mt Tam, and enjoying the empty swimming pools left after the Oakland fires, I co founded Comet Skateboards in San Francisco in 1997 as a way to combine all of my passions.  
In 2008, Comet moved operations to Ithaca, NY where we now make our skateboards.  Our goal remains to make the best skateboards on the planet with respect to the environment and all around shredding.""  

**McLovin (Sales and Team Manager)**: ""A few things about me! Got my start working at Concrete Wave Magazine as an intern in college. Lead to me helping to start up a then new Website known as www.SkateSlate.com, but have since moved on. Worked with the skate house media crew on filming for several things, but mostly Skatesgiving. Spent some time working for a Longboard Distributor as a Brand Manager. Which has brought me to my current position as a Jack of All trades for Comet Skateboards.""

My husband and I had a good sex life for the first few months we were together. For the remainder of our relationship and engagement I was unable to have sex with him. We went through several months of infrequent sex, 9 months of absolutely no sex, and then went back to very infrequent sex. 

Emotional issues and physical pain combined with my inability to get very wet and a a general lack of sexual desire caused my LL. I am also a very busy person. Working full time, in school full time, part time internships, planning a wedding for about eight months, etc. I was always tired. I AM always tired. So that didn't help either.

A few months ago (about a month before the wedding) I decided I wanted to do something about it. I was sick of being the problem. We have ZERO other relationship issues. My husband is so understanding and never made me feel guilty about being unable to have sex with him. 

We slowly started having sex again. About once a month or so. And doing other sexual things about once a week. Thats when I found this subreddit. I had lurked on reddit before but never had an account. I decided to make an account and got pretty active all over the site. 

Hearing the stories everyone tells on this site had me more motivated than ever to fix my DB. I took some advice. I've stopped masturbating when I'm in the mood. Instead I wait until my mood matches up with a time that we're both home. The longer I do this, the more often these times seem to arise. I frequent subreddits like /r/sex, /r/porn_gifs and /r/porn which honestly helps to put me in the mood when I wouldn't usually be. I am starting to adopt the overall attitude reddit has toward sex.

We are having sex roughly once a week now. Both of us really enjoying it. We aren't exactly where I want to be. But we're getting there and you guys are helping me.

I'm in the process of teaching myself Access with a large practice dataset.  I often know what I would like the end result to be but I don't always know how to get there.  Google has been my friend but I'm struggling to find the best workflow/solution for my problem.  I would appreciate any insight into my current problem.

I'm creating a form so future interns can update a fairly robust dataset with a basic front end.  Data is collected for a variety of variables and a year suffix is added.  Data has been collected yearly since the 1950's.  I'd like my form to allow the following functionality:

Intern selects the inventory date.  This is parsed on the backend to create a four digit count year.  I'd then like the count year field to alter the fields the form is entering data into.  For example, intern selects 06/01/2013 as the inventory date.  This makes the count year = 2013.  I'd like the form to then adjust to the respective field for VarA2013, VarB2013, etc.  If they entered 06/01/2010, it would enter the data into VarA2010 and so on.

I'm sure this is possible but I can't quite figure out how.  I apologize if this has a simple answer I'm missing.

Also, for bonus credit, can I make Access create new variable fields for future years when the intern enters 06/01/2015?  It would be awesome if it would automatically generate VarA2015, VarB2015, etc and populate.  If not, I can simply create 10 years worth of fields and that should suffice for future use.

Thanks again!

I've been having an ongoing issue that recently led to my severance as an intern at a Police station. It's caused other problems as well. I'll do my best to bullet point it. It was a false complaint made about me. 

* I was class VP at my school and they students were unhappy with the administration (specifically the dean of students and the head of campus security) so I did what I was supposed to and spoke up for the students. After confronting the admins, nothing changed, I tried a second time, nothing again. I then pursued attempting to have them dismissed. They both were.

* Early the next year, I was visited by 2 Nashua PD units and 1 ATF agent for ""a tip made to them that I was a danger to the school"" they likened it to someone concerned about a ""columbine incident"". They also stated that I violently approached the Pres. of the school (which the President said was false) I allowed them into my rental house, showed them my guns and all of my safety course certificates (not required) and they left. I was able to get info that the head of campus security put in the report the last year.

* Talked to my Dads company attorney, he said don't worry about it right now.

* I applied for the job of a lifetime in May and was hired then fired the next day ""because they were too disorganized"". My advisor was able to get out that the investigation had a part in the dismissal too.

* In June the Nashua PD came for a follow up to basically say there was no issue/case

* I was then hired by the Goffstown PD as an intern. Along my first ride along they asked if I wanted to work for the feds (because I study Intelligence) I said no. They asked why, I said because I do not agree with the Federal Government and their policies. Apparently me talking about being a libertarian sparked a red flag where they looked deeper into me and discovered the case. They sent 2 detectives to my house, I was dismissed.

Here I stand today with a complaint and an investigation into me that was completely unfounded. I do not know how to proceed. I feel like my entire college career was just tossed down the drain. If I can't even work at a small PD, how will I ever get a higher clearance? I feel so stuck, I just don't know how to proceed. Please help."
1jkfb7,5,2013-08-02,An update: 60 days into my nofap journey!,cpunit13,NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/1jkfb7/an_update_60_days_into_my_nofap_journey/,"A little background on me: I am a 19 year old guy who has been a PMO addict for the last 5 years. I really never got into anything hardcore, but I loved porn. I thought everything was going great up until last year. See, in high school, I never got to notice the negative effects of (at least) daily PMO. I went to an all-boys high school, completely sheltered from any contact with real women besides those in my family. The whole time, my family was none the wiser about my addiction. 
       So fast-forward 4 years, I am entering my first year of college. I get about a month or so into it and I meet this girl. She is the coolest, funniest, just all around best girl I have ever met. I fall for her, hard. We spend a lot of time together and I think it's going great. Without even realizing it, I go without PMO for at least a month because it was just unappealing compared to her. But after that month, my brain rationalizes that I am not good enough for her, she would never be interested in me, etc etc. I was so close to asking her out on a date, but I didn't have the balls to do it. So, what do I run to for consolation but good ol' PMO. I just stop talking to her. Naturally, she is curious why I suddenly stopped talking to her. She starts trying to keep contact but I am already checked out mentally with all of this porn-induced dopamine rushing through my brain. Eventually, she gives up. Fast-forward to second semester and I realize that I am about to miss out on any chance with her because I am pretty much never gonna see her again. I go to a school with over 30,000 people and we are in majors that are on opposite sides of campus. So, in a last ditch effort to try and get something going again, I ask her to go to a formal dance that our residence hall is holding. It was out of nowhere and she was surprised, but said yes, if she could. Unfortunately, she had a doctor's appointment and had to go home. That was the last time I ever talked to her.

Summer break starts and I continue spending most of my time PMOing away rather than looking for a job. I am getting less and less satisfied with it and eventually decide I am gonna talk to that girl again, if I can stay away from PMO for the rest of the summer. I check out YBOP and  make the decision to go cold turkey on porn. However, for the next two weeks, I continued to MO. But it still didn't make me feel satisfied. In fact, I was craving porn so bad, that I almost relapsed. So, on June 3rd, after I MO'd for the last time, I found nofap. I decided to take on the challenge. It hasn't been easy, but I think it's been easier for me than for most people.

The results have been great. I got not one, but two jobs this summer. I had the energy to work those two jobs (around 55-60 hours a week). I feel more comfortable talking to people in general, especially women. Eye contact, much better as well. I feel more comfortable just being me and I have a lot more confidence. I know I have a long way to go, but the changes I've been able to make are already amazing in themselves. I also decided that I'm not gonna talk to that girl again once I get back. I ruined my chances by trying to go with her to that dance. I'll find someone else. If not, that's ok too. I am gonna be super busy this semester with classes. I am hoping to improve my gpa because it's a little too low if I want to get an internship. I am also gonna try to be more social with people in general.

I think I've said about all I want to. I know it's a long read, but I spent a long time writing it so I would appreciate the 5-10 minutes it takes you to read and comment on it. And so, my fellow fapstronauts, I thank you for your support and keep fighting the good fight!

1jk9kw,10,2013-08-02,Qualifying for a mortgage with limited employment history,notcreative1,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1jk9kw/qualifying_for_a_mortgage_with_limited_employment/,"I am considering buying a house right now so am doing some research. after a recent post in /r/realestate I decided I will probably wait at least a few months to have some more saved up for unexpected repairs etc.

I have not gone to a bank for pre-qualification yet, as I don't want a hard credit check on my report until I know I am ready.

A lot of what I have read says you need 2 years employment history for a mortgage. I graduated in spring 2012 with an IT related degree. I am been working at a large corporation in IT for just under a year. Before this I worked an internship/temporary job in the summer of 2012 and 2011 that was IT related and while at school I worked in the university IT department.  In terms of job security I have above average experience for someone my age, but I don't know if lenders care about that.

Obviously my internship and work during school I was making significantly less than I am at my ""real,"" salaried job. Although at the end of my internship my hourly pay would have been close to what I make now. 

Does the fact that I am working in the field my degree was for help me towards qualifying? Does my work history during school mean anything? I only worked about 15-20hrs while in school and 20-30hrs during the two summers.

1jk8jq,4,2013-08-02,Choices after Associates,Andvaried,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/1jk8jq/choices_after_associates/,"So I am graduating after this Spring with an associates of Technical Services, Software Development, and E-Commerce. 

I plan on getting a Bach sometime, I'm not satisfied with just stopping after Associates.

The thing is, right now, I'll be graduating debt-free, all I've had to pay is for books so far.

Is going for a Bach worth it if I then have to incur debt? Because how my tuition is working for my Associates will not work for my Bachelors too.

If it is worth it to go for a Bach, then what would be a good choice? Continuing with Computer Science? Or going for Business?

If it makes a difference, I am also in an IT Internship, so i will also have experience in the field as well, so I'm not sure what my next valid option should be. Incur debt and go for a Bach, and go for ComSci or Buss. Or not?"

Fox is seen running down the hallway and as he is running he pushes all the helpless interns out of the way. Fox arrives at the door with the words ""STEVEN SCOTT"" on a plaque. Fox pushes open the door to Scott's office. The door flies open as Fox makes his entrance.*

**Fox**: ALRIGHT, SCOTT! WHAT IS THIS BULLSHIT!? What's the big idea of keeping me off of the show this week?

*Scott seems to be working on some papers and he looks up and coughs into his handkerchief.*

**Scott**: You could at least kno- oh. It's you... what do you want?

**Fox**: You don't know?! There seems to be an error made with this week's card because I didn't see my name on it. I want a damn good reason why I am not on it.

**Scott**: You should know why, Fox. Creative... has nothing for you. And I'm fairly certain they never will. You're lucky i still have you employed, and even that is only on contract. You are uninteresting, untalented, and just plain boring, Fox. You bring nothing to my show. So, run along like a good little boy. 

*Fox just smiles*

**Fox**: You know you just don't get it do you? I have already proven myself. Everyone out there already cheers me. I've got the looks, I've got the charisma and I've already defeated the best of the best. The only who hasn't gotten with the program is YOU! If you had any sense you would book me in a title match TONIGHT! But instead you have me doing NOTHING! There seems to be something else that you have against me and I want answers!

**Scott**: You think you've got charisma? Hahaha! I've seen more charisma from a questionably wet sock. And you were tapped out... by Ransom. You don't deserve to be in this fed. You can be damned sure I wont be renewing your contract when it comes time.

**Fox**: You've got some nerve! Have you forgotten the award show? The PEOPLE said I am the most underrated superstar here. So I doubt my ability is the reason why I'm being held down. But this has been going on for awhile. I never got the proper spot in the struggle, I never got a title shot, and now THIS! You know, I don't think the problem is me. I think the problem is....you. I can tell you've been jealous of me ever since I've made my debut. And this just proves it. You thought your boy toy, Remy would shut me up but after I pinned him that just angered you even more. So why don't you just shake my hand right now and admit that you are wrong.

**Scott**: Jealous? Of you? All you do is stand around and say how good-looking you are, hoping to float by on your looks. You've done nothing to better this company and would rather spend your time in front of the mirror than to get in that ring and train. I'll not be touching your hand, thanks. You disgust me, Fox. Maybe if you put in some effort, maybe then we could find whe, but I severely doubt it. Someone like you is going to go nowhere in this business, especially not in MY business. Get out of my sight. 

**Fox**: You son of a bitch! IF I EVER GOT MY HANDS ON YOU-

**Scott**: I don't think you will. Security!

*Four large security guards come in and grab Fox by the shoulders and they zip tie his hands together and escort him out*

**Fox**: JUST YOU WAIT, SCOTT! I'M GOING TO MAKE YOU RESPECT ME! YOU'RE GOING TO BE SORRY!

**Scott**: I doubt it.

*Scott calmly sits back down in his chair and goes back to his paperwork*"
1jjpbf,1,2013-08-02,"Soon to be Homeless, Hoarder, Too Depressed To Figure Out How To Avoid It.",[deleted],needadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/1jjpbf/soon_to_be_homeless_hoarder_too_depressed_to/,"My family is dysfunctional. They have all done things to me that I can not forgive, or even come to terms with. (Verbal, physical abuse, sexual abuse, endangerment.)

I moved back in because I could not survive on my own. (Boyfriend would not work, could not work and go to school, did both on different sides of the city every day.)

Because of what has happened to me, I am anxious, and depressed. I also believe I have become a hoarder. Having once been a neat and tidy person I now have a bunch of useless possessions that I can't seem to get rid of. I know I need to clean my room, but I can't. I cleaned one box of hair products yesterday and was so proud of myself. Otherwise, I have not cleaned anything in almost a year. You can imagine how this could look. I use a wall freshener to keep it smelling natural, at least. 

My real problem is I got in a fight with my grandmother, and now she wants me gone. To make a long story short, she respects my loud, rude, mooch of a sister who lied about her children and herself being abused by her husband, and all her many other lies, but not me. This isn't a sister, she molested me relentlessly throughout our childhood, exposing me to things I was uncomfortable with and then would beat me into submission, if I refused.

I have no where to go, I have almost no money. (I get paid tomorrow, maybe $300 or less, just started this job.) I have never been in a shelter, I have never been homeless.

My brain can't make this into a reality. I can't rationalize how/why and I am not sure what to do. I have no friends, I have no supporting family members. 

I have sought help. They told other psychiatrists what I said, and they talked to me about it. They didn't tell me that this was happening but because I thought they were there to help, I let them. Then I heard someone who's an intern for the clinic, not a doctor, has no reason to know anything about me, crack a joke about something very personal that happened to me that I confided with my therapist. Now i don't know how to seek help, or who to trust. The medicine helped for a while, but once this happened I got anxious about the clinic and just stopped going. 

I don't need help with my family issues, I know they are toxic and I must leave them someway, but has anyone been in this situation before? How was being homeless? Any aids that helped? Anything, all I hear is static and then, silence.

1jjp8k,9,2013-08-02,Everything is going right and I feel like my life is too good to be true.,[deleted],happy,https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/1jjp8k/everything_is_going_right_and_i_feel_like_my_life/,"In April of this year, I was notified of my acceptance to the University of Nevada, Las Vegas William F. Harrah College of Hotel Administration. It was my dream school I applied to and I immediately accepted their offer of admission. Months of excitement and anticipation went by to move from a tiny beach town in Southern California to Las Vegas to begin my new life. Originally I wanted to move in late August right before school started so I could save as much money as possible to be financially secure being away from my parents. My great uncle agreed to let me rent a room from him so I didn't have to house hunt or find a roommate before getting here.

Tension and hostility in my household created a very uncomfortable environment to live in. I was having constant anxiety issues and stayed out as much as possible to avoid the problems. So, as of June 14 I decided I would move to Las Vegas on June 30th because I had nothing to lose and there was already a bed waiting for me at my uncle's house. No looking back and I gave no fucks.

I've worked for Enterprise for three years so I was able to transfer my job with no problems. On July 1st, my very first day in Las Vegas I got right to work and was enjoying my new city. A week later I was offered a promotion at Enterprise and I excitedly interviewed for it. That same week I went to a meet and greet for Wynn Hotel and Casino without having any expectations of what it exactly was but I was told to bring a resume. At the meet and greet, it was an interview and I was chosen to go on to the second interview for the hiring process. I instantly rejoiced because my major and passion in life is hospitality so having Wynn on my resume for after graduation will hopefully open many doors. At the second interview, I had a lot of confidence in my abilities and experience compared to the other people being interviewed by a panel of managers from various departments. I was chosen for the third and final interview! For the third interview, I was interviewed one-on-one with the front desk manager I will be working with. The interview went extremely well and he offered me the slip for the drug test where they chop off a nice chunk of hair (not cool being a girl). Two days later I got the call I got the job for front desk! My life seemed surreal at that moment. I also gained a friend out of it. A girl I went through the interview process with at Wynn also got hired and is now one of my good friends.

To top off my two new amazing opportunities, I randomly got a call from my HR at Enterprise from a recruiter offering me an internship I didn't even apply for. Getting recognized for my abilities and history with the company really made my day. It was a great boost of confidence.

Within two weeks I got a promotion and a new job in my industry. For now, I will juggling both jobs and going to school. I've done it before back home and still did well at school. On top of having two incredible jobs, I just signed an apartment lease for an apartment complex just for UNLV students where I'll have my own private bedroom and private bathroom and I'll be moving in August 15th. 

Moving to Vegas in June was absolutely the best decision I could have made for myself. It seems to be like all of the right opportunities presented themselves at the right time and I'm really looking forward to what the future brings. Cheers, everyone!"

1jj8t0,66,2013-08-01,[F21] Sharing some of the best breakup insight I received after ending it w/ on-again-off-again first love [M24] of 3 years,westerrrr,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1jj8t0/f21_sharing_some_of_the_best_breakup_insight_i/,"I'm absolutely devastated after finally ending things with my on-again-off-again, very dysfunctional relationship with my first love. We met 3 weeks into my freshman year of college, began as FWB and evolved from there. He was a senior who still has yet to graduate or know where he's going with his life; I'm now going into my senior year after securing an amazing summer internship with plans of going to grad school, etc.. Very different places in our lives, but that's not the point. We were just fire and ice, constantly at each other's throats, and it wasn't healthy, no matter how insane our chemistry was and how much passion we had for each other.

I lost my virginity to this boy. He was my first love, first everything. I'm terrified I'll never meet someone who understands me the way he does. I've never had to deal with a breakup like this. Ever. I've cried for 3 solid days and just want the world to swallow me whole because I feel like I threw away something so rare and crazy and beautiful. But this is what my mom told me:

""Sometimes we grieve more for the loss of what the relationship could have been rather than what it actually was.""

And it really hit me that maybe that's what I was grieving for the most. I loved the fuck out of him but we just clashed so horribly all the time that I would have been miserable staying in the relationship as well. In my head, I saw what we could have been if one or two or three things had been different. But they weren't things I could change. So there's no point in me pining for this ideal of a relationship we never would have been able to achieve... although I guess I'll never know if we could have or not.

Just a thought. Maybe some people will find this helpful.

TL;DR: ""Sometimes we grieve more for the loss of what the relationship could have been rather than what it actually was."""

[How are graduate engineers/new guys treated upon arrival to these rigs?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jmi8o/i_ama_oilfield_worker_currently_on_a_rig_in_the/cbg507i?context=5)|I've never been treated with hostility or anything like upon arriving to a rig. Typically if you're nice, and treat everyone equally, noone is gonna give you shit for being a 'new guy'. That being said, I've been given shit in a joking way since I had a degree and I look pretty young for my age especially when I'm clean shaven. On more than one occasion I've been asked if I had a note from my mom with permission to be out here.
[Do you feel safe/ are there ever instances where you see safety compromised for the sake of say, uptime?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jmi8o/i_ama_oilfield_worker_currently_on_a_rig_in_the/cbg507i?context=5)|I've never felt unsafe out here. Never seen safety been compromised for the sake of reducing NPT. I have seen stupid things done, that could ruin equipment, and things thrown together that probably shouldn't have for the sake of reducing NPT, but never endangering anyone.
[What are the amenities like on the rig?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jmi8o/i_ama_oilfield_worker_currently_on_a_rig_in_the/cbg507i?context=5)|I typically work on shitty 'Shelf' aka not deepwater rigs. This rig is a 10 man room, bunk beds. A TV room that is terrible. And a prison yard gym, outside etc... 
[I am also currently on a rig, in the North Sea though, your accommodation doesn't sound great, I share a room with my back to back so there's only ever one person sleeping in there. We get a telly with sky+ in the room too.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jmi8o/i_ama_oilfield_worker_currently_on_a_rig_in_the/cbg6gjo?context=5)|Im on a pretty crummy rig right now that was built in the early 80s. Some of our deepwater rigs sound a lot like yours though. And have great gyms, even saunas and what not.

[What is your degree/background?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jmi8o/i_ama_oilfield_worker_currently_on_a_rig_in_the/cbg55mh?context=5)|I studied Mechanical Engineering... wish i had studied petroleum though.
[Are you on a formal graduate training programme?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jmi8o/i_ama_oilfield_worker_currently_on_a_rig_in_the/cbg55mh?context=5)|No formal graduate program or anything like that, but typically they want engineering graduates in the field for a while so that they can eventually become managers.
[How often, in your experience, do people in the industry ""job-hop"" around different companies? I hear it's quite common for people to jump ship for better salaries. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jmi8o/i_ama_oilfield_worker_currently_on_a_rig_in_the/cbg55mh?context=5)|There's a super high attrition rate, not necessarily for salary, but more they don't like the field lifestyle. I've contemplated it a few times, but there are peaks an valleys like with every job. J.

[What is the quickest way to advance in the industry? Are you company or service? Background before getting on rig? Is the money worth the lifestyle?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jmi8o/i_ama_oilfield_worker_currently_on_a_rig_in_the/cbg4ygy?context=5)|Quickest way to advance: Know people and make a name for yourself. If you make people depend on you, that's a great way to get ahead. Become indispensable.
 |I work for a service company: MWD side of things.
 |I got an engineering degree from a large state school in the south.
 |I think they money is worth the lifestyle for now (i'm unmarried and no kids, in my 20's etc...) and, I end up getting more time off than if i had an office job. Although i overall probably work more hours total. There's few sweeter things in life than sitting by the pool on a weekday and getting drunk.

[Do you think you are safe from the zombie apocalypse out on a rig?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jmi8o/i_ama_oilfield_worker_currently_on_a_rig_in_the/cbg5ra5?context=5)|At first it seems like an ideal place to be really, but then I start thinking about food water etc. Food maybe not such a big deal if you can effectively fish off the rig. There's always some sort of sea life you can see swimming below you. I think the main issue would be fresh water. They ship in all food water and fuel to the rig, there are some filter systems on board, but nothing to desalinate water, and after the fuel stops showing up, we have no power for the filters. So, no I don't think i'm completely safe out here from that.
 |But as far as starting a meth lab...
[Have you been in any bad storms? Are they completely terrifying? How much money would you say your rig churns out in a day (not sure if that's even remotely possible to estimate lol\)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jmi8o/i_ama_oilfield_worker_currently_on_a_rig_in_the/cbg58aw?context=5)|For the Record: I FUCKING LOVE HURRICANE SEASON. I'm considered ""non-essential personnel"" so any sign of a bad storm, I'm flown out of there.
 |I work on the drilling side of things, and money isn't made until after a well is drilled and it starts actually producing the oil. Currently the rig i'm on is just sitting on top of a production platform, which currently is producing about 10,000 bbls of oil a day. So 10,000bbls * $100/bbl = 1,000,000 dollars a day not including expenses in operating the rig/platform etc...
[Does the rig float up and down with waves like a boat or is it wired to the sea floor?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jmi8o/i_ama_oilfield_worker_currently_on_a_rig_in_the/cbgmshs?context=5)|There are different kinds of rigs depending on how deep the water is. The deep water rigs float. Shallower rigs are resting on the sea floor.
[Time to be upfront... How much do you get paid?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jmi8o/i_ama_oilfield_worker_currently_on_a_rig_in_the/cbg9vvz?context=5)|Close to 100k a year right now.
[What's the craziest thing you've seen while on a rig? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jmi8o/i_ama_oilfield_worker_currently_on_a_rig_in_the/cbg5hwj?context=5)|I've seen sharks,  water spouts, alligators, some sea turtles, a fight cause one roughneck spit on another. Not necessarily something i've seen, but there was a derrickhand on a rig I was on who left the rig on a wednesday, and strangely hugged everyone goodbye saying he'd miss them, and then that Friday homeboy committed a murder suicide with this wife.
[Curious what your schedule is like. I've heard people going 2 weeks on and 2 weeks off. Do you get to leave the rig or are you there for a while? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jmi8o/i_ama_oilfield_worker_currently_on_a_rig_in_the/cbg8hrt?context=5)|I wish i had a schedule, but I do not. Most jobs do though. I've been out here for almost 4 weeks now with no end in sight. Im usually ready to jump overboard by day 21, i'm just surviving day to day right now. Using this to deal with boredom.
[Whats the food like while working?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jmi8o/i_ama_oilfield_worker_currently_on_a_rig_in_the/cbg65xg?context=5)|Well, this is one of the things I found most interesting coming out here. There's a lot of tradition in the food for lack of a better word. For instance, every Saturday and Tuesday is Steak Night. Every Friday dinner is seafood night, and there is usually one Junk food lunch or dinner a week. This has been true on every rig i've been on.
 |The food is often fried, and unhealthy, but usually tastes pretty good.
[Follow up...do you live close to helipad? I know some guys that live in GA and work in Dakota, they lose days just traveling.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jmi8o/i_ama_oilfield_worker_currently_on_a_rig_in_the/cbg5617?context=5)|Longest drive to helipad or dock is about 5 hours, but we hire a driving company, so I can sleep off my hangover on the way there. Pretty dope.
[You might not want to do that. bp houma actually does ""random"" drug testing, as in every third person.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jmi8o/i_ama_oilfield_worker_currently_on_a_rig_in_the/cbg8o4o?context=5)|If i've still got alcohol in my system after a full nights rest and a 5 hour carride, i think i'd be close to dead. I never drink if i know i have an early morning carride coming. It's mostly those 9/10am calls telling me to be ready to leave in a couple hours.
[So what exactly does your job require out on the rigs?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jmi8o/i_ama_oilfield_worker_currently_on_a_rig_in_the/cbgbnt3?context=5)|Drinking others milkshake.
[What colour is your toothbrush?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jmi8o/i_ama_oilfield_worker_currently_on_a_rig_in_the/cbg5iey?context=5)|Clear, with green on it. But you bet your ass that the case i keep it in is hot pink.
[I am fascinated by oil platforms, how they are built, moved, installed and removed. I always look for articles to read about them online etc. I thought the tv series ""oil, sweat and rigs"" was cool. I saw a show about the ""troll a"" and Hibernia Platforms. Just massive cities at sea. I couldn't hack that kind of work though. You have a cool workplace and a hard job. thanks for the a.m.a.  Edit for question. What is the purpose of that cargo net on a helipad? I see it gets landed on but what does it do? Seems silly to ask but...asking.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jmi8o/i_ama_oilfield_worker_currently_on_a_rig_in_the/cbgcfwp?context=5)|Just in case someone were to accidentally walk off the helipad that little 'net' is there as an extra safety precaution. Often people will run, jump rope, or walk around on the helipad for exercise.
[Ok, I get the safety thing but I'd see video of helicopters landing on the pad where the net was stretched over the whole pad so maybe it's all connected together. Just wondering. thanks for reply.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jmi8o/i_ama_oilfield_worker_currently_on_a_rig_in_the/cbgdvyd?context=5)|Hmm i've never seen that before.

I was considering doing both, since my schedule allows it. Are there benefits for doing two separate internships in one semester? Or should I tell the unpaid internship hiring manager that I got a better offer elsewhere? Any direction would be much appreciated."
1jn7ns,46,2013-08-03,Social Anxiety...Irrational fears of being judged. Advice anyone?,acescracked7,socialanxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/1jn7ns/social_anxietyirrational_fears_of_being_judged/,"I'm a 20 year old, male, college student. I'm an introvert. I'm proud of that, I don't think there's anything wrong with being one, and I have no desire to change.

However, I also have social anxiety. And I think there's a difference between the two. It's starting to get worse now and I don't know how to deal with it.

Whenever l go to the mall with a friend, I get so much anxiety whenever I go into stores. I don't feel comfortable looking at clothes for myself, or trying anything on. I went into Sunglass Hut to look at some sunglasses, but I was too nervous to try anything on. And I hate when sales clerks bother and stalk me.

Most of this fear extends from the ""they're judging me"" mentality. I found that to be my issue. I'm not scared of people. I don't mind speaking with other people. Do I like to? No, not really. I usually avoid socializing with people I don't know or don't care to know. That's just the introverted side of me.

The social anxiety side is the irrational fear of judgement and rejection. I'm afraid people are going to think I look stupid trying certain things on. They're going to think I'm an idiot for even trying.

Also, the fact that I have applied for so many jobs and the only ones I've gotten hired for are office/phone customer service positions doesn't help. You know how that makes me feel? Shitty. Am I not 'attractive' enough for a customer-facing job? Am I too short? Fat? Ugly?

I never wear new clothes because I don't want people to notice the change, or bring attention to myself. I always wear jeans, t-shirt, and a hoodie or jacket. I would never feel comfortable wearing shorts, different colored jeans, flip flops or a button up shirt or anything. I feel vulnerable and exposed when I do. 

I applied for this healthcare internship at the hospital since I want to be an RN. The interview is in a month. But they offer a free workshop that gives you more information, helps with interview skills, and gives you preparation on the scenario-based questions they use during the interview.

This workshop was today.

Well, I drove all the way there and decided not to go to the workshop. I was getting a lot of anxiety and doubting myself. Basically, I was extremely vulnerable since I was wearing business attire (not my usual) and going to meet a bunch of people whom I've never seen. 

I saw a couple people walking to the building when I was driving buy. One was a guy around my age, and he looked so much more put together than me. He was up to date with the current style and everything, whereas I was just wearing plain black slacks, belt, shoes, and a nice shirt. 

People would have judged the living hell out of me. Thought I was weird. No one would have wanted to engage in conversation with me since I was the 'weird' one.

That was my logic. I know it's irrational. But I can't convince myself otherwise when I'm in the moment. 

I don't need acceptance. I don't fear rejection. I just want respect; no weird long stares or dirty looks people often give me. I'm just imagining it, but I feel that everyone I come across, whether it's a coworker, classmate, the girl at the cash register, etc...I feel that they form this opinion of me that I'm a creep and just weird as hell.

I am a little different. I'm only 5' 6"". Like I said, I'm quiet and mellow and speak softly but have a voice on the deeper side. I don't wear a false smile on my face, and my facial expression is not something I think about, so usually I'm expressionless. And making eye contact with an expressionless gesture is just creepy! 

I feel like I come across as 'that guy who would go somewhere and shoot up a bunch of people'. 

But I'm totally not. I'm a super 'soft' guy; I'm a really nice person if people actually gave me a chance.

On my drive home I was feeling so lost and upset knowing I have to remove myself from the applicant list for the interview since I won't be prepared for it now. I was thinking that I need to find a different career aspiration, because I obviously can't be an RN and have these fears. I do feel that if I could get over these issues, though, that I could be a good nurse. I genuinely care about people and love helping others.  

I smoke weed, and it does actually help with this. I feel a bit more confident in my abilities to engage in social situations and meet new people.

But I obviously can't be high all the time, haha. This is only good for social outings and stuff.

Anyways, if you read all this, thank you. I appreciate the help and advice. :)

1jmvbp,3,2013-08-03,"""Curing"" depressive bouts by extreme life changes?",koryisma,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1jmvbp/curing_depressive_bouts_by_extreme_life_changes/,"I've gone through several bouts of major depression in my life. The one thing that has totally changed and gotten me out of these slumps every time, without fail, has been to make major life changes. 

The first time, I went from being very depressed (clinically, on meds) to absolutely fine, medication-free by studying abroad. Getting myself out of the situation I was in seemed to ""Switch off"" the depression. 

The next time it happened, I felt like I was in a dead-end job, super stressed, super-depressed... so I joined the Peace Corps, and that-- as before-- got me out of it. 

Recently, my job was causing serious anxiety, self-esteem problems, and horrible depression. I was diagnosed with ADHD, and this spring, I was taking stimulants in the morning to help with ADHD and get through the day, an anti-depressant during the day, and a benzo at night so I could sleep without nightmares. I was barely paying bills. I didn't want to leave the house. I was too depressed to go to work at least 1-2x/month. 

On a whim (well, I thought about it for a few weeks), I applied for grad school for my dream career and am starting an internship on Monday, grad school in the fall, and cannot wait. 

Literally, within 1-2 months, I have more energy, am cooking more, my house is cleaner, I'm more social, I am excited about the future, and my confidence has skyrocketed. I don't know how to describe it: I've gone out of my way to network, gone out of my way to take risks and make this work for me. I've had coffee or lunch with two alums from the program to learn how to ""work it,"" I've taken on some new responsibilities in a volunteer internship job, my social life has blossomed, I am closer to my family than I was before, and I don't take any benzos at night. I haven't taken aderall since leaving my job either, though that might change once classes start! I'm even exercising slightly more, though not enough. 

It's really odd to me, but it makes me worry: will I always have to run away and make big life changes to get out of my depression? In my 20s, it was fine to take these opportunities, but I am married now, we want to start a family soon, so it's not really sustainable. 

Do any of you have any insight? I'm really happy this has worked for me three times in my life, but it doesn't seem like it's... right? "
1jmssq,24,2013-08-03,"I'm secretly preparing to move out of my parents' house, but I'm experiencing a lot of guilt, sadness, and anxiety. I'm starting to feel indecisive.",[deleted],AsianParentStories,https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianParentStories/comments/1jmssq/im_secretly_preparing_to_move_out_of_my_parents/,"My parents and I did not have a good relationship when I was growing up. I was a pretty good kid in high school who studied hard, never partied, obedient and was in a bunch of extracurriculars, but they always screamed at me about how stupid and useless I was and beat me for trivial things. I remember being savagely beaten with a baseball bat, punched repeatedly in the face, choked, and kicked while I was curled up on the ground for being shy and thus embarrassing them. However, when I went away to college, our relationship got better.

In college, although my parents pushed me to be premed, I had no idea what I wanted to do, so I tried a bunch of different jobs and internships and did not commit to the premed track. I ended up graduating early and decided to continue working at the job I held while in my last semester to figure out my career aspirations. To my dismay, I eventually realized that I wanted to go into medicine, so I made plans to work part-time and take the pre-requisites one by one. My parents, however, encouraged me to come home again, telling me that they missed me, that in Korea, kids live at home until they are married, and that they needed my help at their business. I believed them and made the stupidest, most regretful decision of my life and moved home.

Immediately, my parents started screaming at me and hitting me again. Now that I was financially dependent on them, their favorite threat was kicking me out and telling me good luck with being homeless and without a job. I had already spent my meager savings on tuition and had a significant amount of student loans, so I didn't want to take on more to move out, so I just applied desperately to any job available. I eventually and thankfully got a low-paying, part-time, entry level medical job and things got better, but now my parents are giving me an ultimatum to quit my job and focus on the MCAT in August or kicking me out immediately. I felt trapped, depressed and suicidal.

I would love to study full-time for the MCAT, however I will not make the same mistake again. I could keep my job and take the MCAT in January instead and still apply early, but my parents refuse to compromise. I feel like my parents want me to be in a vulnerable position, because it is easier to control me. As a result, starting next week I am working full-time and am looking for housing with my friend. 

I no longer feel suicidal, but I've been emotionally distraught. Fearing further violence and being homeless, I've been lying to my parents that I will quit my job, but as a normally honest and sincere person, the guilt is eating away at me. After I started lying, my mom has started being nice to me again (the abuse/nice treatment is cyclical), and it kills me to think of hurting her feelings and disappointing her even if I apply to med school a few years down the line, because her dream is for me to marry a doctor pff and I'll be too old then. Now that she's being relatively nice again, I'm starting to feel crazy, that my perception of reality is warped, that I'm overreacting, that they aren't abusive like they keep telling me and that the problem is me. If I were a better ""child,"" I would be treated better, that they will keep being nice. These thoughts and emotions keep battering away at me and my fears of ending up homeless are almost making me change my mind. It makes me anxious that in my budget estimations, I will only have approximately $250 left over per month to put into savings. But, I keep reminding myself that this ""nice"" period never lasts and all it takes is setting the table ""wrong"" or not cleaning something adequately enough to trigger the abuse again. I'm just so scared.

tl;dr parents are abusive, so I'm preparing to move out, but I feel guilty, depressed, and scared. My perceptions of reality feel warped and now I'm indecisive."

1jmjv8,4138,2013-08-03,I compiled data on representatives who have consistently voted pro-surveillance. Here they are.,Deradius,politics,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1jmjv8/i_compiled_data_on_representatives_who_have/,"[**HERE IS THE LINK FOR THE DATA**](https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B8_USrDOQxfdX18xbHpGbzJtNzA/edit?usp=sharing).

[**DROPBOX MIRROR OF THE .XLSX FILE**](https://www.dropbox.com/s/73h1pk6xx7wxzoi/Surveillance_For_Reddit%202%20-%20Copy.xlsx).

**EDIT**:  Getting questions about accessing the data.  Click 'file - &gt; download' to save a .xlsx spreadsheet to your hard drive for easy manipulation.

The list includes congressional members' names, party, chamber (house or senate), and their votes on the patriot act (2001), the reauthorization (2006), the Protect America Act (2007), FISA (2008), the patriot act extension (2011), the FISA extension (2012) and the Amash amendment (2013).  

It then attempts to tabulate an intrusion score based on the number of bad and good votes each number has made.  A high intrusion score means a member has done more damage to our privacy, and a low intrusion score means they have done less damage (or acted to protect our privacy).

Some of these data were tabulated from a table [shared in this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1jkmjf/what_real_reform_of_the_nsa_looks_like_holts/cbfy1kn), other data I assembled myself.  If you see an error (and there will be errors) let me know or correct it yourself if possible.

There are three tabs:

**Master List**:  This is the first tab, which contains all of the data.

**Key**:  This is the second tab, which explains the column headings in the master list.

**Priority Contacts**:  Right now, the Holt ['Repeal the Surveillance State Act'](http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/113/hr2818#overview) is sitting in committee.  I have ranked the House Judiciary Committee (roughly) by the priority with which they should be contacted, and included my reasoning and their DC office numbers.  The higher the name on the list (ideally), the more worthwhile the call should be.

---

**What You Can Do**:

**I.  Call the names on the priority contacts list.**  

The list is in the data file linked above, and I've also copied the names and numbers below.

When you dial the number, you'll be connected to an intern sitting in front of a clipboard or computer screen with check boxes.  Wasting your breath with long-winded discussion helps no one.  Keep it as clear and simple as possible, and be kind to the person you're talking to; they control whether your message goes up the chain.

""Hi, I'm calling to ask representative X to support Rep. Holt's 'repeal the surveillance state act, HR 2818.  I'm very concerned about PRISM and XKeyscore.  Please pass my message along to the representative.""

If you are not asked for your zip code and you are not a constituent, don't provide it.  

If you are a constituent, make sure they get your zip code.  

If you are asked for your zip code and you are not a constituent, say, ""I'm calling Rep. [X] in connection with his role on the house judiciary committee, where s/he is making decisions that affect me directly, and I'd like my message passed along though I am not a constituent.""

**II.  Call your own reps.**  [Here's the link to find their contact information.](http://www.usa.gov/Contact/Elected.shtml)  Use the data above to let them know you're familiar with their voting record and it will be influencing your vote.  Again, keep it brief.  Ask them to support Holt's 'Repeal the Surveillance State Act, HR 2818'.



**III.  Reach out to friends and family and get them to call.**  

This is the second most important thing you can do.  Especially family that are in the districts of high priority contacts.  For every person you convince to call, you are (doubling, tripling, quadrupling) your impact.

Every step you help them take increases the probability they will call.

Looking up their reps for them and sending them the phone numbers probably doubles the chances they'll call.

Explaining the situation, how to talk to interns (as I explained to you above), then dialing the phone for them and sticking it in their hand probably puts you close to 100% success.

**IV.  Share this post or something like it.**

I don't care how you do this.  The spreadsheet is public domain.  This post is public domain (within whatever terms Reddit imposes in their agreement) as far as I'm concerned.  Copy it, claim it's your brilliant idea, or link people directly to this post.  Change it however you want.  Just share this information (Facebook, Twitter, Carrier Pigeon, Pack Mule, etc.) so others can have access to it and will be encouraged to contact their friends and loved ones as well.

**EDIT 2**:  Barbara Lee (D-CA) voted *for* the Amash Amendment ([roll call](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2013/roll412.xml#Y)) but it's not listed in the spreadsheet.  I can't edit the GDrive version right now, but posting here to make people aware.  Thanks, /u/malchyk!  The Dropbox mirrored version has been fixed for this.

**EDIT 3**:  /u/wannadipmyballsinit has made a handy [map by state](http://i.imgur.com/Mkt2Uyx.jpg) of 'good' to 'bad' vote ratios.  [Here's how the calculation was done.](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1jmjv8/i_compiled_data_on_representatives_who_have/cbg9x6v)

**EDIT 4**:  Alternative/color coded Gdocs spreadsheet is [here](https://docs.google.com/a/schooledbook.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AvUFfzqJ0mmHdHIwNEZHdFhKZlhqeDJsQlgxcnphR0E#gid=0), courtesy of /u/PandemicSoul."
1jmhq1,967,2013-08-03,A detailed analysis of congressional votes on privacy and an action plan for 1984 day and beyond.,Deradius,restorethefourth,https://www.reddit.com/r/restorethefourth/comments/1jmhq1/a_detailed_analysis_of_congressional_votes_on/,"[**HERE IS THE LINK FOR THE DATA**](https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B8_USrDOQxfdX18xbHpGbzJtNzA/edit?usp=sharing).

The list includes congressional members' names, party, chamber (house or senate), and their votes on the patriot act (2001), the reauthorization (2006), the Protect America Act (2007), FISA (2008), the patriot act extension (2011), the FISA extension (2012) and the Amash amendment (2013).  

It then attempts to tabulate an intrusion score based on the number of bad and good votes each number has made.  A high intrusion score means a member has done more damage to our privacy, and a low intrusion score means they have done less damage (or acted to protect our privacy).

Some of these data were tabulated from a table [shared in this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1jkmjf/what_real_reform_of_the_nsa_looks_like_holts/cbfy1kn), other data I assembled myself.  If you see an error (and there will be errors) let me know or correct it yourself if possible.

There are three tabs:

**Master List**:  This is the first tab, which contains all of the data.

**Key**:  This is the second tab, which explains the column headings in the master list.

**Priority Contacts**:  Right now, the Holt ['Repeal the Surveillance State Act'](http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/113/hr2818#overview) is sitting in committee.  I have ranked the House Judiciary Committee (rougly) by the priority with which they should be contacted, and included my reasoning and their DC office numbers.  The higher the name on the list (ideally), the more worthwhile the call should be.

---

**What To Do**:

**I.  Call the names on the priority contacts list.**  

The list is in the data file linked above, and I've also copied the names and numbers below.

When you dial the number, you'll be connected to an intern sitting in front of a clipboard or computer screen with check boxes.  Wasting your breath with long-winded discussion helps no one.  Keep it as clear and simple as possible, and be kind to the person you're talking to; they control whether your message goes up the chain.

""Hi, I'm calling to ask representative X to support Rep. Holt's 'repeal the surveillance state act, HR 2818.  I'm very concerned about PRISM and XKeyscore.  Please pass my message along to the representative.""

If you are not asked for your zip code and you are not a constituent, don't provide it.  

If you are a constituent, make sure they get your zip code.  

If you are asked for your zip code and you are not a constituent, say, ""I'm calling Rep. [X] in connection with his role on the house judiciary committee, where s/he is making decisions that affect me directly, and I'd like my message passed along though I am not a constituent.""

**II.  Call your own reps.**  [Here's the link to find their contact information.](http://www.usa.gov/Contact/Elected.shtml)  Use the data above to let them know you're familiar with their voting record and it will be influencing your vote.  Again, keep it brief.  Ask them to support Holt's 'Repeal the Surveillance State Act, HR 2818'.



**III.  Reach out to friends and family and get them to call.**  

This is the second most important thing you can do.  Especially family that are in the districts of high priority contacts.  For every person you convince to call, you are (doubling, tripling, quadrupling) your impact.

Every step you help them take increases the probability they will call.

Looking up their reps for them and sending them the phone numbers probably doubles the chances they'll call.

Explaining the situation, how to talk to interns (as I explained to you above), then dialing the phone for them and sticking it in their hand probably puts you close to 100% success.

**IV.  Share this post or something like it.**

I don't care how you do this.  The spreadsheet is public domain.  This post is public domain (within whatever terms Reddit imposes in their agreement) as far as I'm concerned.  Copy it, claim it's your brilliant idea, or link people directly to this post.  Change it however you want.  Just share this information (Facebook, Twitter, Carrier Pigeon, Pack Mule, etc.) so others can have access to it and will be encouraged to contact their friends and loved ones as well.

1jme14,4,2013-08-03,Writing numbers in 'standard form' but in base 2,soutioirsim,askmath,https://www.reddit.com/r/askmath/comments/1jme14/writing_numbers_in_standard_form_but_in_base_2/,"OK, this might poorly worded but I'm a physics undergrad doing a research internship and I need a bit of help with something.

* To start off we all know that to write a number in standard form means to write it in the format: n = b*10^a (where 1&lt;b&lt;10 and a is some positive or negative integer)...

* ...but the work I'm doing at the moment requires that I convert my numbers into a kinda 'standard form' but in base 2, and what I mean by this is to write a number in the form n = c*2^d (where 1&lt;c&lt;2 and d is some positive or negative integer).

* Now here is what I need help with. If I take a million real numbers from the interval [0,100] and then convert it into its 'standard from in base 2' described above, then I find that the distribution of the 'c' values is not uniform even though I sampled the real numbers from a uniform distribution in the interval [0,100].

* [Here's a way to visualise what I am trying to say.](http://i.imgur.com/wLEVIlg.png) The bottom graph shows the distribution of the million real values I used and the top graph shows the distribution of the 'fraction' values (where c = 1 + fraction). You can see that the values in the top graph are not uniformly distributed.

My question is, is there any literature/work been done into this? My work depends highly on the distribution of the 'c' values but I do not know the rules of how it is calculated. Or if there is any literature at all on writing numbers in the 'standard form in base 2' (sorry if this is the wrong wording).

New year, new me. At least that's what everyones been talking about lately. It's funny how half of the nation thinks that a clock striking midnight on the last of the year will somehow substantially turn their lives around. New flash, your diet won't last and come mid april you'll have decided to blow off your resolutions until the next year rolls around anyway.


I'm glad to have a loving family and all, but here I was again sitting in the living room with my mom and dad watching an extremely scripted overadvertised new year's countdown. I sat there on my phone head rolled back on the couch cushion generously liking all of the pictures of parties and fun nights out to celebrate the end of the year. 11:52 At least it was down to the final minutes before the fireworks went off and the neighbors yelled and we all went to bed to wake up to another routine day of pretending to be productive. Everyone will be too hungover to do anything tomorrow anyways so there's another day of sitting in my room aimlessly browsing the internet. 11:55. I mean going away to college in August was fanastic. Sheer freedom. I maintained my grades and enjoyed flourishing social interaction and didn't have rules. It was nice, but being home for the holidays feels like lockdown. Oh, well two more weeks and I'm back on plane to a different state to resume a more enjoyable day to day living. 


11:59. Here comes the countdown. All the way from sixty. I swear time moves slower when people watch it. I know it's just saying, but seriously there has to be some phenomenon in the universe that slows time. I'm calling it now, they will discover something years from now that explains how the more intent someone is on observing time the more it changes. Actually, I think all this time back home has just driven me insane. 


Thirty seconds to go. Ryan Seacrest's voice echoes through the living room. My mom is on the edge of the couch as if she's about to win the lottery. I set down my phone and put my attention on the giant ball dropping in NYC. Man I'd love to go to New York, maybe someday. Fifteen seconds to go. You can hear the younger kids gathering by the front door ready to run outside and bang pots and pants and scream and cheer. I miss the days of childhood. The sheer innocence and love for the world. Times when nothing wasn't solved by a good night of sleep. I know I'm going back to my wild time theories again but I swear time was slower as a child. I'm not talking about those five minute timeouts that seemed to last forever, just genuine second by second 
was different. 


Ten seconds. The countdown is across the screen in huge font. Nine. Here we go, another calender year about to start. Eight. Maybe I will make a last minute resolution. Seven. Who am I kidding? Six. I guess I'll miss them when I go back to school. Five. The freedom is just too addictive. 

Five.

Wait. I swear the time didn't change. Four. Okay now it changed but it hovered there for a second, someone had to have seen that. Time froze. Not like a permanent outage of time, but it stalled. It was almost like life lagged in real time. Like a youtube video buffers, life just buffered.

The fireworks went off. Mom yelped. Kids ran outside. The confetti poured down in NYC.

But I just sat there. I swear on my grave time froze for a second. Everything just stopped. 

""Dad give me the remote""

""Why?""

""Just real quick""

I rewind. Play again, maybe the program stuttered. Six. Five. Four.
Nope. It didn't happen that time. Am I losing my mind? No I promise it was like the universe for a second just timed out and ceased to exist. I'm tripping out. Maybe my minds just out of it. It had to have just been me.

""Mom did you feel that, during the countdown?""

""Feel what?""

""Like did you feel like everything stop for a second, like time freeze?""

""I'm telling you Jake, you need to get sleep at night, you always stay up""

""I'm not joking Mom, it happened""

""I never know when to believe you""

I ran to my room. Nineteen years old and I ran through the house like a child. This is too weird to even be a coincidence.

Google.

Did anyone feel time freeze tonight Dec 31st 2014

No results pertaining. 

Okay maybe I'm just overthinking this. I do it all the time I just psych myself out. I'm going to put myself in a mental hospital one day. Okay here I have an idea. I'll just start my phones stopwatch and count with it to one minute and if it goes off without a glitch I'll disregard it as my mind messing with me.

Start.

One. Actually, another good thing about being home is all the food. Man, I haven't had a homecooked dinner in months and a fully stocked fridge feels like heaven. I just hope I can land a solid internship and get a job straight out of college. I can't be that guy who moves back in after my parents already stretched their paychecks to cover my tuition. I'm so lucky my parents do well, I mean the cost stresses them but its still doable. I have friends taking out loans worth more than their organs on the black market. 


Fifteen seconds in and we're good. I had to have just been freaking out. Maybe mom is right. I do stay up until sunrise, I bet my REM cycle or whatever they call it is all thrown off. Okay, I'm making a resolution. I'm going to start sleeping during the night like I'm supposed to. 


Sudden Darkness.

""What the hell!?""

""Honey are you okay?""

""Mom?!""

""He's fine, he has his phone""

""Jake are you okay?""

""Yeah I'm fine""

""Power's out""

""Yeah, good work sherlock""

""I don't need attitude""

""Oh my god, calm down""

""Don't talk to your mother like that""

""Use your phone and come help me find the flashlights""

I look back to my phone. 

Not possible.

I'm losing my mind right now.

The power went out and my phone was on thirty six seconds. I know that for sure. I was so focused. And when I looked back down it was at thirty four. There is no way time went backwards. The stopwatch doesn't even have a feature to do that. I'm losing it.

""Jake hurry up!""

""WAIT.""

""Hurry!""

""Okay, jesus I'm coming""


I disregard the stopwatch app and go to find my flashlight app instead. I know it's in one of these folders. Damn I'm unorganized.

The lights come back. Not even a flicker just a sudden return to full up and running power.

""Hurry Jake""

""Why?! The lights are back on""

""What?""

""Huh..?""

""Just come out here it's almost time""

""Time for wha-"" I start as I round the corner back into the living room with my mom and dad.


I turn and look at the TV. 

What is happening?

There on the screen is the picture of times square with the countdown at nine seconds.

""It's already new years, why are you watching this again?""

""Shhh, we wait all night for this""

""Mom you're joking?!""

The ball drops at times square, the crowd erupts, the new year lights flash. 

""Seriously Jake?! You couldn't not screw around for five seconds for New Years? Unbelievable""

""Mom, bu-""

""Stop it, I'm going to bed.""

I look down at my phone so confused. And then it hits me. The air is sucked out of my gut and my hands feel heavy. My phone time says 12:00. I look up the clock on the wall says 12:00.

""Dad what time is it?""

""12:00""

I've already lived this. I seriously am reliving time. It's freezing and skipping forward and backward and no one is going to believe me, I don't know how to stop it, and my nose is bleeding. My nose never bleeds. I'm going to bed now and I hope when I wake up this was a dream, but something tells me it isn't. 

Maybe it's the fact that as I'm typing this I can faintly hear in the background Ryan Seacrest starting the countdown from ten for the third time tonight.

&lt;/endtext&gt;

1jm9uy,31,2013-08-03,Day 90 Mission log,DarthInvade-her,NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/1jm9uy/day_90_mission_log/,"Made it to 90 days brahs.  
A little bit of history...  
Started nofap in 2011,  I found this site on the misc forums at bodybuilding.com (theres a huge nofap thread there but be warned also a lot of triggers in other topics)  
Ive had 5 or so 50 day streaks since Ive started (with a lot of relapsing in between). Mainly did this challenge to get better at interviews. Have been socially awkward/with anxiety pretty much my whole life, so I was willing to try this out even if it was for only that placebo effect.   
I started applying for internships in spring 2012, did horrible in my first 2 interviews and gave up after that and started PMOing again. Fall 2012, my dad lost his job and my parents were both incredibly depressed. I realized that I had to get my act together again so I started no fap again and applying for interviews in spring 2013. This time I had a 40 day streak going into my first interview, and Im happy to say I nailed it. Relapsed after that but this current streak has been on-going from my first day on the job. To be honest, I dont think I wouldve been able to achieve this on my own, it was pure desperation mode at this point due to the situation my family was in.  

So fast forward to my summer internship...  
First 2.5 months I was pretty much a machine at work and at home. Established some consistent habits (cold showers and exercising). My supervisor has also been impressed. I attribute it all to nofap. As for any other superpowers, I did notice them in my earlier streaks but have not really noticed them in my current one. I have a feeling its because pretty much 99% of my relapses always ended up in me binging on porn, so in each streak it takes longer and longer for my brain to get back to normal.  I came across a NSFW image recently and I literally got a slight headache from the dopamine rush in my brain.  
  
The past 2 weeks  
The journey seems to be getting harder....  
Ive been flatlining, losing focus... also getting frustrated and depressed combined with moments of self-loathing... Its almost been as bad as it was when I was regularly PMOing.  
Its probably a combination of reasons, my parents have been fighting, Im getting a bit disillusioned with my work. Also Im nowhere near where I want to be with regards to the goals I set out at the beginning of this streak. I have been letting my mind wander and think about porn, its not an incredible urge but its constantly there in the back of my mind. 
  
Ive lost some of that desperation I had been using for motivation earlier. I need to establish some new habits, I found a topic on here mentioning how keeping your mind focused/meditating can help with depression/frustration, that seems to be the answer Ive been searching for so I will definitely look into that.

(versus trained),[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1jlx3r/web_dev_how_much_is_expected_on_day_one_versus/,"I have a pretty basic understanding/working knowledge of XHTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP and MySQL (in order of most knowledge to ""I can write a couple lines of code, depending"").

I'm trying to find a job or internship as a junior web developer, and I have found some that sounds like something I could do (and am mostly qualified for), but I'm concerned how much I would be expected to know on the first day. As of right now, I still need to look up things while I code. 

I am aware that I'm nowhere near intermediate or expert proficiency, but I really just want to get my foot-in-the-door, so to speak, and hope to learn most on the job (or at least have something to put on my resume), but I don't feel confident as I have only had one paid job before where I worked as a *very basic* help desk. (I'm also currently unemployed, btw). I've spoken to my former programming TA about this and he insists that I really do have the knowledge to get a job in the field, but I don't know... 

So can anyone tell me what's it's like? Things that you're expected to know? (I know this varies by employer, but could you share your experience?) What were things that you got trained for? How bad is it if I have to rely on notes? (As in, I code with them by me and/or have my ""cheatsheet"" in a background tab of Notepad++). Also, what would your advice be to someone like me? (both in the short-term and long-term wise)

Obviously we miss each other like crazy but there have been to short visits. I have asked her if she would like to find a place together when she gets back and she is as excited about the prospect of cohabitation as much as I am.

1jphvt,83,2013-08-04,Some rubrics for success with undergraduate research,[deleted],biology,https://www.reddit.com/r/biology/comments/1jphvt/some_rubrics_for_success_with_undergraduate/,"I spent this summer supervising probably my umpteenth undergrad researcher and I had to sit back and watch as he often made so many classic and easily avoidable mistakes.  I tried to warn him about things, but alas I could not predict everything.   Basically, all the problems boil down to the same thing: doing research, regardless of the academic setting, is not like school.  Sure, in some ways all research is like school, but it some important ways it is the opposite, thus applying your student skills to your research can have either unsatisfactory or even disastrous results.

There are three main rules you need to live by as an undergraduate researcher:

**(1) Be there for the lab, don't expect the lab to be there for you until you have proven yourself.**  In class, the professors are there for you, in lab you are there for the lab.  Never forget this.   Regardless of the teaching mission of your school, although the professors are 100% obligated to take you into their classes and teach you there, they are 0% obligated to take *you* into their lab.  There are always other students, keep that in mind.  Everything you do in that lab is a small bit of payback for the time and energy people are putting in to teach you and work around you.  Don't kid yourself about this, you need to prove your worth, not the other way around.

**(2) It's not about grades anymore.** Doing well in school is all about finding the path of least resistance to the best possible grade, in research there are no grades and the path of least resistance almost always passes through cutting necessary corners. Don't do this.  And don't waste time looking for the ""right"" answer, the whole point of research is that we don't know it -- this is not your cookbook lab exercise from Chem 102.  Ask plenty of questions along the way, no matter how harried or irascible we seem, we would much rather deal with something when it is small and brought to our attention than when it is big and buried in the incomprehensible results you have dumped on us. In classes, there is only a finite amount of return you can get for an investment of time and effort -- once you have worked hard enough to get an A, the rest of the time is free. *Research is the opposite, the more you put into it, the more you get out of it.* Show that you know this and not only will you get *much* more out of the experience, you will get a great recommendation that puts you among the best students.

**(3) Be professional.** In classes you are only responsible for yourself: if you don't show up, show up late, or don't do the work, etc. no one suffers but you.  All these behaviors, however, will negatively impact the lab, your work, and your reputation.  I had a very promising undergrad torpedo his whole internship by showing up 15 minutes late (and loudly) to the only two lab meetings during the internship (they were 9:30 in the morning). The very famous and very busy PI of that lab never saw the student except for lab meetings, and all the PI saw of this guy was that he was lazy and unreliable -- that student could kiss his golden recommendation good-bye.  If you miss deadlines or do shoddy work, those who depend on that work will suffer, and they will not look kindly on you in return. And don't get defensive if someone cares enough to call you on any of this unprofessional behavior, believe it or not we all have car trouble/cell phone trouble/other obligations/real lives outside the lab and still manage to show up and be on time and when we can't we know how not to leave people in the lurch and make up what we missed. Be aware that all research jobs are a link in a chain, you may just be washing bottles now, but if you do that well you will to fill those bottles, then use what is in them, eventually you can have your own research which you are in charge of, but you have to show you can do even seemingly menial tasks well.  And for the love of Pete, finish your project before you leave the lab [EDIT: or bring it to a good stopping point where someone else can pick it up easily]. The chance of any of your work going anywhere or meaning anything to anyone if you just drop it and leave is probably about 0.1%.

I know this may seem harsh, but it just breaks my heart to see so many bright students shooting themselves in the foot, squandering their chances for good research, or wasting the time of good grad students and postdocs who have their own careers to look after.  Good luck to you all!

1jpbov,50,2013-08-04,What can I learn to be a better software developer?,someonlinegamer,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1jpbov/what_can_i_learn_to_be_a_better_software_developer/,"Right now I'm currently going into my Sophomore year of college with a major in Physics and a concentration in Computer Science. I'm taking a python class next semester and an object oriented class centered around Java in the spring. I already have been chewing away at learning Python this summer and when I showed up to my internship they wanted me to basically be their low pay software engineer (despite not being told ahead of time this was going to be my task). Because of this I've been spending 40+ hours a week programming and  made them some stuff in python and then launched a private android app written in Java with Eclipse.

Besides the real programming experience I have I've completed Multivariable  (3D+) Calc, Differential Equations and will be taking Linear Algebra next semester. I also have an obvious background in Physics (I'll be starting Quantum this year, hooray!). 

With that said what skills can I pick up? I need to dive deeper into more programming concepts, but are there any in particular that I should be tackling? Should I start learning a new language after my Python course? Is there anything else that I can learn to become a better software developer? 

Despite my major I won't necessarily be diving into Physics R&amp;D, but I will be doing some research while I'm still in school. Thank you!"

I'm not even sure this is the right place for this, but y'all are the most supportive subreddit I'm subbed to, so maybe if this is not the right place someone can direct me to one? 

Backstory: I'm 22, just graduated college and moved back in with my parents. I've had depression likely since I was 15, diagnosed since 19. On ssris for about three years. Currently on cymbalta, which I like way more than my old lexapro. 

So, I majored in television scriptwriting in college. It's been what I always wanted to do, and I've had some good internships. Naturally, you'd think I'd go out and snap up a tv job like my classmates, but I haven't yet. I'm scared. I'm scared I'll fail a drug test, I'm scared I'll hate it (and my dream/goal of 13 years will be dashed), and I'm scared of being trapped in this country/city my entire life. 

About the drug test: see, before I went to college I was a straightedge, raised in an ""average"" American environment. I also was really lonely. I had never been bullied, beyond a few isolated incidents, but I also really had never had anything more than a ""school friend"" (never hang outside of school) before. I'm also not your average lonelynerd. I mean, I'm plenty nerdy, but I'm also a bit weirder than your average nerd. Like, an art nerd, I guess? Angsty emo kid for a while too. 

Anyways, so I finally go to this college, and I end up meeting some really cool people. Most of them smoke and drink, and I go out drinking my first weekend and hit a bowl by September. I end up really ""coming out of my shell"" and meeting all kinds of crazy (literally) artists and music enthusiasts by the end of my sophomore year. I also date one of two dudes I've fallen in love with Sophomore year, and he's a pot dealer, as well as completely nutters. 

Fast forward two years, break up with potdealer, meet and date and break up with aspie-writer-pothead. I've been living for my last two years in this weird apartment that tons of people chill in. It has a reputation as a commune/rage house, but it really isn't. I should also mention that at this point I average about an 1/8 a week, sometimes up to a q or down to 2 grams. 

Whatever, I graduate, move home. Realize that outside of my hippie college town,  everywhere drug tests. Now I can't quit weed. Well, I probably could, but it would take a lot of xanax to replace my self medication. Amd I've known too many xanax ghosts to fuck seriously with that shit. When I don't smoke, I get so fucking angry I cry. At America, at myself, at my family. I don't know what to do or how to get a job. 

Also, I'm haunted by the thought that I'm just using weed as an excuse to not get hired, that I'm really scared or failing or of putting down roots. I haven't written a script in over a year, and I'm not sure I can. I'm also driving my family crazy with my rages and weirdness, not to mention the smoking. 

I know I'm entitled, and that I just have to nut up and solve my obviously first-world problems, but I don't know how. I'm lonely and angry and wasting my education. But I also don't want to blend into the society here (wash dc) because its so conservative and bland I could scream. I don't know how to fix my problems. I tried moving to ny, but it was the same there, which makes me think I'm the problem. 

Any advice? I know this probably isn't explained very well, so just ask for explanation/elaboration and I'll try my best.

The following is a redacted document originally submitted to the U.N. council by their diplomat for Global Climate Research. It has since been discovered by an American intern at a foreign consulate and spread virally through Wikileaks by an internet group known as The Midnight Society:

To the U.N. Council:

My research into aqua-parasitic growth in small water bodies has turned up significant evidence of a looming global pandemic. The continuing change of the Earth’s climate has led to a slight but highly problematic change of 0.017 degrees Celsius in an [redacted]. Though the research is far from complete, the evidence gathered thus far calls for greater man-power, more intense studies worldwide, and a global plan to prevent the growth and spread of a specific pathogenic parasite known as structure 2321 Alpha, or what we call the Adam Parasite.

Two research teams were sanctioned by the council: my team is the Adam and we’ve been stationed between [redacted] and [redacted] in the [redacted]; the second team, the Eve, is stationed in [redacted] in [redacted]. Our positions were determined by local population and distance from the equator. The Eve has not yet reported a similar finding; we have also contacted many foreign preservationists and found no sign of the parasite in Europe, Australia, and some of Asia, though large parts of Asia, Africa, and the warming Antarctic, as well as many other locations, have yet to be verified and pose a serious risk of hosting a similar intracellular parasitoid.

I would like to reiterate a case study from seven weeks ago, as it has also been the most public. On May 26, a man in Florida was found eating the face of another man. When confronted by police, the man was incommunicable and highly violent which ultimately led to a fatal shooting. This man’s name was [redacted] and we had, until a week previous to this incident, been in constant communication with him as he had been contracted to work as our lead bacterial consultant. His lab was located in Miami and, until he disappeared, we had been sending him samples of our findings. His disappearance occurred two days after he received our initial samplings of the Adam Parasite.

Not one week later, we tragically, inadvertently found a host to composite the Adam Parasite’s effect on the peripheral nervous system when our lab technician, [redacted], also became infected. As I thoroughly detailed those events in my previous case study to the council when asking permission to section off portions of [redacted], I will skip the harrowing events and merely re-explain the results: it entered [redacted] bloodstream through nasal inhalation; attacked the sub-cortex of the brain, overheating the skull and outer brain tissue; [redacted] temperature raised to 104 degrees Fahrenheit, wherein [redacted] began violent hallucinations much like a fever dream; then, in the final stage, there was a liquefaction of the brain stem, causing the death of the host.

We have been in communication with the [redacted] on these proceedings. They have done a good job preventing mass hysteria thus far and their [redacted] have helped us section off the southernmost area of [redacted], the only area we have found to contain the Adam Parasite. As of now the parasite continues to exist in an incubational stage though a time will come in the near future, as temperatures continue to rise, where the parasite will surface like mosquito larvae to be carried on the wind and spread with the weather front.

This communication is to state further emphasis on a global plan to handle this inevitable situation when it begins, as it is far too late to prevent it entirely. Unless climate change can be halted 100% right now – it can’t – this parasite will grow in size and spread exponentially, likely to occur in the second half of 2013. There needs to be a plan in place for the exodus of country dignitaries and top political figures to the southern- and northernmost portions of Earth, where this parasite will be unable to infect. The rest of the population will have to prepare for the spread as if it were a flu pandemic. A vaccine may be possible if work begins now, in large numbers, across the world; this needs to be a global effort. We cannot make predictions on population effects or R-naught unless we were able to conduct more case studies.

We must begin to alert foreign dignitaries on a global scale to prepare for what could amount to the extinction of the human race. The ice on which we currently stand melts more each day and it will take but a short time before it cracks and we fall under.

As always, thank you for your time and I await further orders.

At the moment, I'm ready to buy four WQHD monitors from [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BUI44US/ref=gno_cart_title_3?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1&amp;smid=A2UP5XAILMISJE). Constraint: each one requires a dual link DVI connection.

To satisfy this constraint, I'm thinking about getting a pair of 770's from [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00CU9GOAO/ref=gno_cart_title_1?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1&amp;smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER), but I have a few concerns. 

First off, will each of these cards support two WQHD monitors (Again, each running at 2560x1440)? The [Gigabyte spec page](http://www.gigabyte.com/products/product-page.aspx?pid=4647#sp) claims the max digital resolution is ""4096 X 2160(via a single HDMI connector and not supported with two DVI connectors)"". Please translate &gt;_&lt;

Second, my [current motherboard](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813128378)'s 2 PCIE slots have 2 slots between them. Does this mean I can't run these cards in SLI (time to get a new mobo)?

Finally, what kind of PSU am I going to need for these cards? The Gigabyte page and Amazon page both read ""600W (with one 6-pin and one 8-pin external power connectors)"". Will [this](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817139015&amp;nm_mc=AFC-C8Junction&amp;cm_mmc=AFC-C8Junction-_-na-_-na-_-na&amp;cm_sp=&amp;AID=10446076&amp;PID=3938566&amp;SID=) suit my needs?

Hoping I don't have to dump my existing parts, but if that's what it takes, my internship work-ethic is ready. Thank in advance, Reddit!"

Mainly I'm trying to gain perspective on what's going on right now and some advice on how I should approach this situation.

Same info: Me - 23/m; ""B"" - 22/F; History of friendship ~ 3 years; History of FWB-like/dating situation ~ 6 months

I did not see B before she left at the end of my school year. I cut my losses, moved on, and talked to B every now and then through IM or text every so often while I continued dating others this summer.

However, B ended up getting the internship in my town. See hasn't moved here yet, but she is taking classes currently at one of the other theaters around here so I've been seeing her more as a result. Probably about once or twice a week. I've honestly been surprised that B got her internship in my city, because I thought she was bullshiting. She will be living in my city for a year here in about a week or so.

As you can tell by the tone of my last post, I've liked B for almost the whole history of our friendship. B's feelings and intentions however have been questionable at certain points in time. I always proceed things with her with caution.

I guess you can say the relationship feels pretty casual. When we hang out now, begin to jump straight into making out and fooling around pretty early on. She spends the night at my place before she goes back home. I've even went and visited her for a day trip/hike in her city a couple weeks ago. I always have a great time, and I feel like she does too. I've been discovering more and more lately that it's better to try and show someone how you feel then to tell them. Overanalyzing the situation seems to only make me nervous or obsess over it (much like the tone in my last post).

With this new advice however, it's hard for me to try and determine how to proceed with the relationship. At the moment, I'm comfortable with the amount of time we've been seeing each other, but I eventually would like to maybe escalate things more than they are currently. At the moment we don't communicate daily. The only time we communicate is to set up hanging out.

So how should I proceed with this? At what point is it acceptable to talk about what's going on, or should I not do that at all and continue to not overanalyze things? Should I be doing something on my end to try and escalate things? I've been single for almost two years and haven't been stuck in a dating ""limbo"" or anything like this in awhile, so I'm completely clueless on how to continue.

---

**TL;DR**: Me and my friend start to reconnect in the past month since she is moving back. I've liked her for a while and I think she might be liking me back more recently, but I'm unsure. Our relationship is very casual. I'm trying to take things slow and not seem too eager. Am I doing the right things or should I be trying to escalate things a bit more? I'm stuck in a dating limbo.

1joqat,2,2013-08-04,How would you handle a family with NO discipline? [long],thesistergeek,Nannies,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nannies/comments/1joqat/how_would_you_handle_a_family_with_no_discipline/,"Before I start off, I want to say this isn't hyperbole.  You'll have to read on a bit to understand, but the parents actually don't believe in discipline at all.

I have been babysitting on and off since my teens, and I'm now 22.  I was recruited to nanny this summer while completing an internship in New England.  I will probably continue to nanny through college, so I'm reaching out and looking for advice about what happened with one of my families a few weeks ago.  I've never really had an issue before this, I've always been able to handle it on my own, but I want to make sure I handled it well.

The parents seem to be really lovely people.  The mom is taking time off corporate, working from home in a consulting job.  I have no idea what the dad does, but he's friendly enough.  There are two kids, a little girl who is 6 and a little boy who is 8.  I've sat for them two days a week throughout the summer.

I recently spoke to one of the other nannies they employ (she's basically a house manager) and learned a few things.  The parents spend something like $3600 a week on household help (babysitters, gardeners, two housekeepers, etc).  There is a sitter or nanny in the home 80 hours a week, and they pay for 30 hours a week of housekeeping.  A landscaping team comes every single day.  

Because of all of this, I think, the kids have a serious complex when it comes to the people their family employs.  This has been backed up by talking to the other nanny.  According to her, the parents are at a loss as to how to fix it.  The kids can't even help load a dishwasher.  I have been frequently ordered around by the 8 year old.  Obviously that was not okay, and I didn't let it stand, but it was a small red flag that lead to what happened a few Saturdays ago.

The family had gotten back from vacation that day, and I was warned that the kids would be grumpy.  The parents left for dinner, and the kids wanted to take a bubble bath.  The mom said they always take one together, and to just hang out in the hallway and keep an ear out.

Being siblings, they started to fight.  I come in, and they're hitting each other.  I do the logical thing and warn them to calm down, or they will have to get out of the bath.  The 8 year old looks at me in total disbelief and says, ""That sounds an awful lot like a punishment, and we don't do punishments in this family.""  I had no response, so I stammered out something about asking his mom what she wanted me to do and if I had to come back in one more time I'd be following through.

I texted the mom, asking for clarification on timeouts, etc.  During the interview, this is what she had told me they do.  I thought the 8 year old was just putting me on.  She responded that they indeed do not do punishments, they just have a discussion then distract the kids with a toy or task.  She said to keep in mind that, ""The only discipline we do is a discussion and distraction, not anything beyond that.  Tell them the consequences of their actions in the situation, and then let them go back in that situation to make their own decisions.  Tell them if they're good they can watch Scooby-Doo.""

I suddenly felt like I had zero power over the situation.  At about that time, I hear yelling from the bathroom again.  The little boy is yelling, with increasing volume, over and over again, ""[Sister] I am losing my patience, you are making me raise my voice.  [Sister] I am losing my patience, you are making me raise my voice!""

I told him not to raise his voice, and that I would be standing in the doorway while they took a bath to make sure they behaved.  He tried to raise his voice to me, so they took the rest of their bath in complete silence.  I felt like it was the only thing I could do.

I ended up making dinner while they made a small fire in the firepit, and we roasted marshmallows.  After I put them to bed, I had to wait the three hours for the parents to get home, so I picked up the kitchen.  I had prepared a conversation with them when they came home.  But they just walked in, handed me a check, and walked up to their bedroom, asking me to lock the door on my way out.

I'm returning for one final Saturday, only for a couple of hours.  It's my last day of the summer.  I feel like I'm leaving a huge loose end not talking to them about this, but I don't know how to handle it or if it's even my place.  Did I do the right thing?  What would you have done?

**tl;dr - Nannying for a family that doesn't believe in discipline, what would you have done?**"
1joky1,44,2013-08-04,[FR] First lay and FWB.,possibleaddict,seduction,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/1joky1/fr_first_lay_and_fwb/,"I'm 21m, intern in an office [doesn't matter what kind of, where, meaningless info].

3 weeks ago 3 new girls were hired in our office.

20f, 21f, 23f - all of them around HB7-8.

At first I focused on the 20f one, too bossy, too bitchy [WAY too bitchy]. **X**

Then I moved on to 23f one. At first, we hit it off, we went out once but after that her ex came in to the game, things complicated, she wasn't ready [bullshit], ejected before she came up with ""let's be friends"". **X**

After me ejecting from the 23f one... well, she started walking around the office, teasing me a lot harder and telling everyone how she would not date me and any other girl in the office wouldn't do so [?]. She also started calling me narcisstic. I assume she has some kind of weird sense of humor.

Anyway,  I didn't care much [and I still don't].

Before I even had a chance hitting on the last one she invited me to come over. Her friends were staying at her place for the night, jacuzzi, wine, movie. I was tired so I thanked for the invitation, wished her good fun and went to sleep.

The next day, in the evening I texted her something [it was something about girls at office being mad at me]. 30 minutes of texting back and forth and guess what? She tells me she's tired, alone and wants to watch a movie at her place. [oh wait, is that the famous and legendary ""booty call""? could it be true?]

I packed my external drive [no, it's not an euphemism], some alcohol and I ran to catch a train.

I'm at her place. We're drinking wine, a lot of wine, watching a movie, tease a little bit, share some laughs. 

Wine runs out, we're cuddling on her couch. My hand travels over her body, no rejection. 

She offers me to sleep on a couch in her room [ok!]. We're upstairs, alone, in the dark, I sit on a couch, she brings me some sheets and pillows. I grab her hand and tell her to lay down with me.

* There isn't enough space for both of us, let's move to your bed.

No rejection, she plays along. We're in her bed, making out and after literally 3 minutes we're... You guys know best what happened.

_______________
Since then, we became FWB. We're both 21, students, we're both living with parents. Plus, I live far away from her place.. so whenever she has a free place, she texts me if I want to come so we can ""chill out"".

I KNOW, I know I played it like a sloth. Next time I'll try to work a little faster BUT... I still got laid !

PS

I didn't dig in to the conversations or how heavy the kino was because it would be a wall of text and no one wants to read posts like that. I tried to keep it short and simple. 


PS2

Before I got to seddit I wouldn't even think that there are girls out there willing to have sex with no strings attached.

So, thank you guys !

**EDIT**

Forgot to add that thanks to this community I boosted my confidence and learned how to deal with women. I am no longer afraid of ""putting my foot down"" and setting the borders. Damn it feels good.

**EDIT2**

Following /u/asad16 advice I'll elaborate on how I ""charmed"" this girl. 

As I said before, I am not afraid of putting my foot down. There are only 3 guys and like 10 girls in our office. Sometimes those girls become a little too cocky and I have to show them that I will not accept any shit they throw at me. 

""FWB"" was a witness of 2 or 3 times when I had to tell our colleague to tone herself down a little bit. We're like a bunch of friends, some teasing is always fun but not when you have to concetrate, you got a work to do, you have something to say or they're just crossing the line.

The second thing, DHV. It's a parliamentary office. We meet politicians, solve people's problems, contact with some high social value people - it's all complicated. So since I am more experienced I was showing her how to do that and that.

I also know some people, know who is who, who does what and so on. I found her intersted in this topic so whenever I had an opportunity I was telling her a different story or simply introducing her to new people.

KINO, when we met, simple handshake. Since the beginning I was treating her like an old friend. Hi five, frontal hugs, friendly touching - lots of it and actually with everybody. When we were at her place I was little more forward. 

Before the ""jacuzzi invitation"" we had a dinner [me, her, her friend]. Being able to maintain a small talk with her friends is a big plus [I guess]. 

And teasing, I think that played a big part here. She's a ""lady"", good girl from a good house. Wealthy parents, had only 1 boyfriend in her life who turned out be an insecure douche [1 year long LTR] and an army of guys putting her on a pedestal telling her how beautiful or how awesome she is.

Well, I didn't do that. We had several neg wars. After the night together she told me that no one has ever treat her like that. I'm ""different"" - and apparently, she likes it and wants more.

I treat her like any other girl. I don't even consider that dinner in 3 as a date."

I should probably clarify - I was a stripper when we first started dating, this was not a new development. I quit when I decided to focus on graduating from college. I went back to it because I wanted some extra money once we moved back down to Atlanta. When he told me to quit, it was because I was falling behind on my school work, and I did. I had promised him that I would quit if he ever felt uncomfortable with it. He told me, ""you can do whatever the fuck you want after you get your degree."" He just wanted me to get my diploma and make that my priority. So I got my degree, and dancing is NOT what I'm choosing as a career - it's just something to hold us over financially until I find what he calls a ""real job"". When he said ""you didn't go to school to be a stripper,"" I *thought* he meant he wanted me to get a job in my field. (Other comments he's made: ""That's what you get for going to school for biology. You should have majored in something useful, like engineering."" He's an engineer.) What irks me is that once I did get a ""real job"" (my internship, in the other city, and yes, it is paid) he said, ""I meant a REAL job, like at a company that pays decent.""

**EDIT 2**: I drove two hours to go home and get some of my stuff, not expecting him to be there. He was, and I said, ""oh, I didn't think you'd be here."" He didn't say anything to me, just put on his shoes and left the house. I put 3 months rent (cash) and two books (""Five Languages of Love"" and ""Things I Wish I Knew Before I Got Married"") on his desk, in front of his computer, and left a note. ""Here's rent for the next three months and some recommended reading. Call me when you're ready to talk. I'll be back to get the rest of my stuff when I come back from [my internship]. Don't throw it out. Still love you."" Did I handle this right?

My husband and I have been together for 7 years now; we were married in a courthouse 3 years ago and had our big ""official"" wedding a year ago. 

I moved down to Georgia for him 3 years ago because he was going to school here, and I wanted to be with him. I got a MS; he just finished his BS and is staying on get his MS at the same school. Our first year together was rough on me, he would spend 12-14 hours a day at school (leave home at 8AM, come home at 10 or 11PM) and being new to the city, I was lonely and spent most of my time cooped up at home, getting frustrated. He would come home and expect me to have all the housework done because I didn't have ""as much to do as [he] does"". I chafed at this (I had lived with my parents before this) but eventually I got used to it and just did the housework without further complaint. 

Our second year together, he had to do military service, so for about the first 6 months of the year he was away, training, and we kept in touch by calling, mail, and occasional visits. I was living alone in our apartment, and felt reasonably happy because I knew eventually he'd come back to me. He came home and then spent the rest of the year working at the local military base (part of his service) 5 days a week, normal 9 hours a day. Again I was annoyed that he didn't help out with the housework, but his reasoning was that he worked 5 days a week and was TIRED, while I was just a student and had way more free time on my hands. Well, okay. I dealt with it. At this point I had taken on a job of dancing at the local strip club to earn some extra money. He was okay with this - I had danced before, and it was keeping me occupied. Didn't hurt that I saved up enough to give him $3000 to buy a motorcycle for his birthday.


Our third year together, we were both in school, and I was still dancing part time at the club. I was falling behind on my research project that I needed to complete for graduation, so he made me quit dancing. In hindsight, it was a good idea because I did eventually get my focus together enough to finish my project, but it has never left me that when we fought about it, he said, ""you're not doing anything special, you're not a performer or anything. Guys aren't there to see you dance, you're basically being a whore."" That hurt, a lot. I almost moved out at that point. But again, I dealt with it.


Throughout our time together in Georgia, I have constantly struggled with communicating how lonely I felt, and how I felt he wasn't showing enough affection for me. I felt like I was basically a convenience to him -- I cooked, cleaned, took care of the household duties, and was available for sex. I was on the verge of leaving him, but I read ""the five love languages"" and it really made a lot of sense, and gave me the vocabulary to express my feelings. I communicated this to him the best I could, and he thought it was ""retarded"", but he listened. I tried to get him to read the book, but he brushed it off as some ""obvious advice for dumbasses."" Nevertheless, things did get better for a while, and we had our wedding and honeymoon. 


Eventually I graduated. He had another semester to go, so I tried finding a local job, but no luck. Continued to dance at the club, now at 3 nights a week and earning a pretty good amount of money. We don't have financial issues. He didn't like that I danced (""You didn't go to school to be a stripper"") but hey, it was stable and it brought in a good amount of money without taking up too much time. It didn't exclude me from pursing other job opportunities. He graduated this past semester, but decided to stay for his MS. We agreed that if I couldn't find a job here in Georgia, it would probably be best for me to move back home with  my parents where there were more job opportunities. 


Last month I started an internship in a different city a couple hours away, so I rented a hotel room and decided to stay there for the month. I came home every other week, and invariably I would find dishes stacked up in the sink, dishes still in the dishwasher from the last time I washed them, refrigerator decimated and him complaining about being hungry. I was annoyed by this - whatever happened to ""I work 5 days a week so I'm tired, you don't have as much to do""...? My internship got extended, so I moved on to renting a room in a house with a couple other women. I am finding that I am pretty darn happy on my own - I can take care of myself, and I can support myself easily on the money I earn from dancing (which I DO enjoy) while doing internship work to put on my resume. He doesn't have a job, other than going into the military base one weekend a month for training. After graduation, he's spent this entire summer sitting in front of the computer, reading Reddit and Game of Thrones, and occasionally working on a project for school. If I'm home for the weekend, we'll cuddle and have sex, but once I stop being entertaining, he goes back to school to work on his project where he can focus better.


I really, really, really don't believe in divorce. I would stay with him if I could work things out. To me, it seems like he is not willing put forth the effort to work on our relationship. He is uncommunicative - he rarely answers my text messages with more than a single word, rarely tells me anything about his day or what he's doing. A minor, petty, materialistic thing that has bothered me for a while is the fact that he never got me an engagement ring, even though I was very clear that I wanted one. It wasn't that I wanted a huge diamond, or even a diamond at all -- I would have been happy with a CZ. I really just wanted him to pick *something* out for me to wear with pride. But he couldn't even make the effort to do that. ""What do you want a ring for anyway? It doesn't DO anything. You might as well buy a car with that money."" He later explained that he didn't want to spend the money on something he considered frivolous, but if he were to get me something, he wanted to get me something nice, which he just couldn't afford right now. 

I don't think he's ready or able to take on the responsibilities of being a family together with me, and at this point, I think it's best we move on. We have talked about having children before, and it's basically always boiled down to, ""just have them and give them to my mom and grandma to raise."" I know he's joking, but he was raised by his grandmother because his mother was a young parent, so there's probably a grain of truth to that statement.


I expressed all this to him last night, and he was not impressed. He probably thinks I'm just crying wolf, since it's not the first time I've been so frustrated with him that I've threatened to leave. He simply asked me ""when are you coming to pick up your stuff?"" and ""Okay, just leave me the cat."" His response to ""I think we need to go to marriage counseling"" and ""I'm thinking about a divorce"" was simply, ""K.""


I originally told him that I would come by next week to get my stuff, but since he's out of the house for the weekend doing training, I think I might as well do it today so I don't have to see him and get sucked back in. I really do love him, and it's hard for me to not stay. I don't want anyone else. One of the effects of my job as a dancer is that I meet a lot, a lot of men, and I have never met anyone that has piqued my interest enough to want to leave my husband. I'm pretty jaded when it comes to men. I still want to give him another chance. I'm hoping that maybe he'll realize how much he loves me with a little time and distance. I'm planning on coming back to our city and renting a separate room or apartment so he can have his space. Like I said, money isn't really an issue -- but I can't really afford to rent two places at once. Would it be mean of me to stop subsidizing his living costs? What else should I do?

---

**tl;dr**: I am finally realizing that my husband has gotten complacent and contributes nothing to my life, so I want to leave him. He is not a bad person or anything, just not ready for the responsibilities of being a family together. How do I do this as painlessly as possible?"

I'm gonna dump a lot of background information here.  Feel free to skip to the TL;DR section if you only care about the current situation and not what's lead up to it.  I'm sorry if some of the phrasing is awkward; I only have 10 minutes to write this.

Both of my parents are first generation immigrants from China.  They have PHDs in their respective fields of study and graduated from one of the top colleges in China.  Ever since I was a little kid, my parents would remind me of their humble beginnings (they grew up during Mao's era) and how they overcame adversary.  That's simple enough.  I appreciate what my parents went through to come to America during the peak of Chinese communism. However, they are accustomed to a much harsher culture. My Dad's started his own IT company and ended up selling it to the largest computer company in China.  This meant that my Dad had very frequent business trips (probably 1-2 weeks each month).  Because of this, I never had a close relationship with my Dad.  This also created a situation where my Mom was the most influential person in my life.  I don't really understand how my Mom's mind works but she has a very short temper and has a history of depression.  She insists on being very involved in my life, to the extent where she has to know what I wear to school each day, *even though I go to a boarding school*.

I remember being pulled out of my day care to start kindergarten a year early.  I have a very vague recollection of my first kindergarten experience but I remember being extremely afraid of my teacher.  I don't know how much of this I imagined in my 4 year old mind but I have memories of her consistently calling me stupid and dumb.  It got to the point where I would hide in the bathroom because I missed my friends in pre-school and feared my new teacher.  By the end of the year, it was clear I wasn't ready for 1st grade.  My Mom started hitting me because of this.  That summer she decided that I was 'too lazy' and enrolled me in an accelerated academic program.  She also signed me up for Piano lessons because I needed to learn the importance of hard work. 

Initially, I loved the academic program.  I remember sitting on my bed reading through all of the books I could find.  I also remember finding a chapter book in the back of the classroom and feeling very compelled to read it.  I felt so proud of myself when I taught myself the required vocab necessary to finish the book.  I don't think my self-esteem has ever been that high since.  My mom told me that book was for kids who couldn't read real books and that she was ashamed I couldn't read it without learning new words.  I was crushed.  Towards the end of the summer I developed an interest in the 'Encyclopedia Brown' set of books because the riddles required the reader to pay close attention to details (easily done when you have to slowly read word-by-word). My mom told me that if I continued to waste my time reading ""books of no value"" she would leave me on the streets.  So, I stopped reading the books I liked and started reading the books she gave me.   At this point I was about 4 years old.  

The situation with piano was fairly similar.  I didn't enjoy it as much as I enjoyed reading but my Dad would always beam whenever he saw me practicing so I wanted to practice a lot.  Unfortunately, my mom thought I wasn't making enough progress so she started monitoring me while I worked.  She would tape knives to the arch under the piano keys so I would keep my wrists up.  She would hit me if I stopped playing to scratch my nose mid-song.  She would force me to sit in front of the piano for 3 hours a day, even when my friends came to my house and asked my mom if I was allowed to go outside and play.  Even after all these years, I still irrationally hate pianos.

Things have progressively gotten worse.  Since then, my parents have gotten much more aggressive.  I think the worse time my dad beat me was when I was 8.  We were on vacation and I had lost my hotel key.  My dad took off my shoes and beat me with them until the soles were too worn out to actually hurt me.  My mom's worst beating is up for debate.  There was one time when my friends and I accidentally broke off a piece of a wooden door and my Mom beat with the broken off piece (there were multiple nails in it) in front of my friends.   There was also an instance in 7th grade where she beat me with her high heels because I got a 92 on a pop quiz in Math.  I think that was the first time I actually wanted to die.  She kept on hitting my head, despite my screams, until I started to bleed.  I ended up needing stitches.  My mom refused to go to the hospital with me.  I lied and told the people at the ER that I slipped and fell on something sharp because I didn't know what would happen to her if I told the truth.  There are a lot of days when I wish I told the truth but I guess it's way too late for that now.

Then there's the issue with my parent's marriage.  My dad has cheated on my mom at least 3 times since I was in 1st grade.  Each time he cheated, my mom made me read what my dad wrote and told me that he had another family.  She said that he didn't love me and that was the reason he was cheating.  I was really scared that they were going to get a divorce and I  begged my parents to stay together.  That was clearly the wrong thing to do.  Any aggression they didn't use on me, they used on each other.  They would constantly fight, throw things at each other, and even scream at our neighbors.  I don't remember if it was my dad or my mom but I know for a fact that one of them told me I was the cause of their fights.  He/She told me how happy their marriage was before I was born.  That night, I locked myself in the car until the morning.  Then I walked myself to the bus stop for school.  My parents hadn't seen me for at least 20 hours but neither of them looked concerned when I got back from school the next day.

Anyways, this is my current situation: I'm 16, go to a boarding school and I'm home for the summer.  Early on in the year, I had secured an internship at Wharton.  I had to go to countless interviews, send a ridiculous amount of emails, and ask for a lot of favors but I had finally gotten it.  My mom tried to get it cancelled.  Both my parents tell me that I **have** to major in some sort of medical field.  I'd personally like to major in economics because I find it far more interesting.   My interests don't matter.  At first my dad reluctantly agreed to drive me to my internship but more often than not he would ""forget"" to pick me up and I would have to ask one of my friends to help me get a ride home.  I managed to get through the internship but right now I have a SAT program that I need to do.  This was something I initiated on my own.  It's for students who have already received higher than a 2250 and want to get the last 150 points for a perfect score. The application process for this was a little less rough but it cost a significant amount.  I knew my parents had the money but when I asked them about the program they told me that I should just study on my own (which is what I did to get a 2310 but I couldn't get anything higher than that on my own).  I ended up spending the money I earned from my internship and pulling out of my savings to pay for the program.  No problem right?  Well, the place where it's run is located around 45 minutes from my house and the hours are 8:30AM-8:30PM.  I know I shouldn't expect my parents to drive me to this but it's something that is really important to me.  Also, I know the route to the area quite well.  If my mom leaves the house 15 minutes early, she can drop me off and still be on time for work.  Then, I can take a taxi back home.  I tried to explain this to her but she said that she ""doesn't want to leave 15 minutes earlier"".  I really don't know what to do anymore.

Does anyone have advice regarding how I can deal with them reasonably?  I'm pretty sure my mom is in some sort of depression right now but she refuses to acknowledge it.

**tl;dr**: My parents are unable to take me to a SAT class even though it would only take up 20 minutes of their time.  They also refuse to allow me to pick a college major that I think is meaningful and interesting."

We have been away from each other for the summer at our respective internships. I'm in Northern Germany, she is in Aspen, Colorado. It's been seven weeks since we've seen each other; we have exactly three weeks left. The eight hour time change coupled with shoddy internet has proven  difficult, but we make it work. 

I feel like we have grown so much individually and simultaneously as partners. It's been very difficult for me to be away from her because my internship turned out to be terrible, whereas hers is incredible. She's having the summer of a lifetime and I'm having a pretty rough time. I work around forty hours a week with lots of travel around the state of Germany, and she works a little less per week. I've never missed someone so much in my life, but I am so happy to miss her. I can't wait to reunite. My days off move so slow - right now is a day off and it's really slow. 21 more days, you guys. This is a great community. 

The goal now is to just get through the coming days - rinse and repeat. It's so hard to enjoy the present and my shitty internship knowing I'll be seeing her so soon when we return back to school together. I just wanted to share. We've been together eight months total, two of which will have been spent away. 

Hope everyone else is hanging in there! "

Im just writing this now how it comes to my mind (after writing edit: Sorry about the format and possible grammar errors, I dont want to reread it though).  
I have a lot of friends and know many people in my social enviroment but somehow Idk I feel lonely ? I mean I can go out with them, party, chill, do sports whatever. But somehow I feel terribly alone. I know its sounds stupid and doesnt make sense and I dont know why. Whenever Im not with them, everything is just plain shit and I know they arent my caretakers and I dont expect them to. They have their own lives, girlfriends and so on.   
They actually ask me all the time why I dont have a girlfriend or at least a fuckbuddy. They know I used to have them in the past but now I dont even feel like dating. In fact when we're out in a club I dont even try to get laid all Im doing is to get myself hammered I enjoy that. Heck I sometimes have this absurd idea to get myself drunk every day because its fun like atm Im thinking about making myself a mojito and get myself wasted again(leftovers). I dont think I have a problem with alcohol. Its not like I need it and I recently did 6 weeks of abstinence to check if I can party without it and all (got a bit worried). I enjoyed it the same when we went out and didnt have a problem with everyone asking why im not drinking (well it was annoying tho).  
  
I should be studying now I plan to write my final exams in one and a half years. Thats the usual time to prepare. However I dont. Im sitting at home doing nothing browsing the web, wathcing movies, play games eat. My parents even pay for some rather expensive preperation course I visited for 2 weeks, then I somehow stoped. I didnt go, then I felt like shit for that, but instead of thinking - ok you skipped two times, now go - Idk I was afraid what the others might think and stopped going at all. Now Im living a lie in front of my parents, who think Im studying while Im not doing anything. My friends kinda asked me out on it and I admitted it, however told them some bullshit about being better able to learn at home. Ofc I dont do that. Actually Im thinking about stopping my studysubject, but Im afraid of what my parents think about it. They never had the chance to do that and invest a lot of money into it. I went two times abroad one time for a one year exchange and one time for an internship. They paid for all of that cause they say - its my job to study - yeah I just suck at my job. Im 26 so changeing subjects now, would mean In the best case Im finished with 29 thats really old for a undergrad degree. So im kinda stuck with what Im doing now. Acutally I like too, its interesting, challenging  but Idk I have zero motivation. And now im thinking about my future, because I dont see one? Its shitty and I feel totally powerless to do anything.  
I hate it, I hate my life atm. Sometimes I just wish to disappear. Not suicide or sth. I would never do that to my parents. But Idk hard to explain - just feel at peace not worrying everyday about my life, thinking of what should I do but not doing anything. Thats actually the most annoying part. I KNOW its shit but I dont care. I think that might be a bit related to the fact that money is not really an issue for me. Its not like im getting shitloads but its enough to live of it and when Im in dire need of it I can always ask my parents. And this no motivation attitude is not only with studying I used to go to the gym, playing soccer, healthy diet all that is nonexistant now. Sometimes I eat like one meal and cereals a day most of the time its junkfood I order. I dont sleep well. Well most of the time im just staying awake until im too tired to be awake anymore. I hate my life and I really dont know how it changed to that. Sometimes I think I should see a doctor, but what is he going to do he will probably give me some pills and his job is done. I dont want pills I want it to change. This is so stupid. Im saying I want it to change and Im not doing it. haha. And this self pity is even more disgusting.  
Well felt good to say that."

This is something that seriously traumatized me and changed my outlook on life. Here it goes.

For context, I'm a female. I was 26 years old at the time. I had just moved to Kansas City from California for a year long internship.
It was early evening in the summer, it was still light outside but the sun was just starting to slowly fade. I decided to go for a quick jog. I was about a mile in when I noticed a red pickup truck slowly pass by me. The driver was checking me out, but not in flirtatious way. It felt predatory. The hair on the back of my neck stood up. I was in a residential area, not too many people out and about and I remember feeling acutely vulnerable. I instinctively took my headphones off.

A few minutes later, the pickup truck drives by again. This time it was coming towards me so I got a better look at the driver. Hispanic male, light goatee, black shirt. I looked him in the eyes and I still remember exactly what he looks like.

I turned the corner, ready to jog back to my house when comes back around again, this time from behind me. He slowly creeped by, close enough to where I could reach out and touch the passenger side door. My heart was pounding. This sounds corny, but I felt like prey.

I quickly turned down a one way street. By now, I'm no longer jogging, I'm full on running and I feel adrenaline pumping through by veins. He drives by me again, this time he doesn't look at me but he parks his truck on the side of the road about 50 feet ahead of me. There was no house where he stopped. There was no reason for him to stop. FUCK! I immediately turn around and start sprinting. I hear the car door slam, I hear footsteps. I glance behind me and see him chasing me, quickly gaining ground. I've never been so afraid, I've never had so much adrenaline. I knew I was running for my life and he was catching up. I ran towards a tall fence and scaled it in two seconds. I knew he couldn't drag me over the fence without making a huge scene. I was right and he didn't follow me. I stayed in that backyard for a while before I climbed over the other side of the fence (it took me a while to climb over this time. Fight or flight syndrome is no joke! ).

I called the police as soon as I got back to my house, they took a report over the phone but they never bothered coming over. About three days later, I heard on the news that a girl disappeared from a near gas station about ten blocks away from where I was jogging. They never found her. She was in her early twenties and fit my physical description. As I came to find out, there had been a string of missing women from that area for the past year or so. I called the cops back several times, but they never followed up on the lead. I'm sure that it was the same guy. Another woman went missing shortly after I moved back to California.

I brought gun after that and I've never jogged outside again. I always fantasied that, instead of running scared, i would have been able to calmly turn around and blow his fucking brains out. It sounds so morbid but it would have saved so much grief."

I plan on going into the systems administration route, but my degree is in Software Development so I can easily move to Developing jobs as well.  I will have had 3 years consulting experience for many small businesses  (system administration, desktop software, company intranets, and multiple websites), I worked as tech support and customer service in a call center for electronic accessories (printers, digital picture frames, ipad accessories, etc.), and will have 2 internships under my belt upon graduation.

1jnx49,7,2013-08-04,[Offer] I really want to buy some pizza for 3 different people here (story inside).,celticbinne,Random_Acts_Of_Pizza,https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/1jnx49/offer_i_really_want_to_buy_some_pizza_for_3/,"Well, this exact time last year I was couch surfing. I left my hometown the day after graduation to get the hell out of dodge and started college in the beginning of the summer. I got a job as soon as I got here and came to love/hate my co-workers. The majority of them graduated (I'll be a sophomore in the fall) but they really helped me out. I had to send home every dollar possible and I wasn't able to pay for my own living or food expenses. My dad is 65 and disabled so he really had no source of income.

Now, I'm about to get a promotion and am in line for an internship (I had to pass up in the Spring because of money issues..) and a kick ass second job in the fall. Not to mention ROTC really had my back.

So why 3? Well I could bombard someone with 60$ or so worth of pizza. But I had three friends in particular who didn't ask for ANYTHING in return and really helped me out when I was in a bad state. Think of this as me paying it forward and I expect you to do the same. It would be awesome to have 3 people do the same to another person and have a ripple effect.

I'm in the US and it'd be easiest for me to order it for you to pick-up, to have it delivered to your address or a building close by if you're on a campus or something of the sort. 

If not I can send an eGift Card but then your order is kind of capped, for example you want two medium pies and bread sticks but it's $24 and I sent you $20. 

I'm just looking for someone who is genuine and will do this for someone else as soon as they can. Whether they got short-changed this paycheck, moved to a new town, or whatever the case I know how helpless you feel. Some pizza and good friends helped me out WAY more than you can imagine. Oh and since it's 12AM here (everywhere delivers until 4AM here) if you can't get it tonight, I can order it for you for lunch/dinner/late tomorrow if that works.

EDIT: Orders are being sent, I hope everyone pays it forward!
* /u/Kicken is getting a medium 2-topping, breadsticks and large cheese pizza 
* /u/DownByLaw524 is getting a medium 2-topping and cheesy bread
* /u/juhlee is getting a large cali chicken bacon ranch 
I hope you all enjoy! :) pleaseeee pay it forward guys, really, it makes a difference."
1jnwwn,9,2013-08-04,My depression is ruining my relationship,tadp116,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1jnwwn/my_depression_is_ruining_my_relationship/,"I've always been depressed, and I don't really know why. My quest to find my self-worth has always ended in failure. I get all my validation from the people around me, and as a result I have no self-esteem. I feel stupid and incapable in everything I do, and I am terrified of public speaking, which really makes me feel terrible about myself. For the longest time I have wished I could give my lifespan to someone on this earth who would appreciate being alive.

These sentiments are usually accompanied by stories of neglectful or abusive parents, but mine were neither. However, they never pushed me to do anything because they thought I was perfect, which might have been just as bad. I wish they had forced me to go out and make friends rather than operating on the notion ""If his grades are fine, then why not just let him do what he wants to do?"" (which was play World of Warcraft pretty much 24/7)

I have done well in college so far in addition to the part time jobs I've had, but I never attribute it to me working hard or me being smart or capable. I always brush it off as me being lucky, or that anyone can do what I do and that once my bosses figure that out I'll be out the door. 

I met someone in October who has really turned my life around. She makes me go out, make friends, and socialize. She is such a positive person, and it is often extremely contagious. Around her, I am happier than I have ever been. However, she has been away on a summer internship for two months, so we've seen each other a lot less. In the time she's been gone, my subsiding depression started coming back in full swing, and I became cold and distant towards her. We started feeling disconnected, and she even said she felt like she was talking to a stranger.

She always says that she doesn't have it in her to try to make both of us happy, and that I need to find a way to make myself happy. I completely agree with her, I just don't think I ever will."

I was always quiet when with groups of people. Now its more like the days that I don't have someone to hangout with I'm almost depressed and desperate to find someone to talk to, and the few times I've had people to hang out with, I've actually been kind of loud and happy. The problem is after a bit 20 years of introversion, I have no idea how to go about gathering people to hang out with. It doesn't help that I'm currently in an entirely new city, in the last few weeks of a 3 month internship where I don't really know that many people well enough to comfortably ask people if they want to hang out, I get anxious about whether or not they will want to or if I'm really good enough friends with them to hang out or think I'm weird or just blow me off. It doesn't help that a few times I've tried to make plans with people and they've just never showed/never confirmed that they were going to make it, leaving me texting/calling/messaging them the day/hours before (depending on the size of the event..semi-long trip or just lunch) asking if the plan was still on, getting no answer and finding myself alone again.

I only have a couple of weeks left in my new city, but even going back home it'll be hard, I'll be back with the same people I've known for years who have already gotten to know that I'm introverted, people I don't know well at all since I never wanted to be around people before. 

I don't know what to do anymore and it's gotten to the point over the last few weeks that I've ended up in tears from loneliness and not knowing what to do. I suppose at this point I have some amount of social anxiety"

[I have a lot of respect for everyone who choses a job with a lot of value to society. unfortunately i think that teachers, doctors etc. somewhere along the way forget what used to motivate them. whats your experience with other teachers at your school? what do u think is the reason for the drop of motivation to help?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jmvi0/iama_another_hs_teacher_with_proof_ask_me/cbg91vo?context=5)|Wow. Big question. I agree that some teachers do forget the reason they began teaching. I attribute it to several factors: Internal pressure to reach goals that are neither conducive to true learning or attainable. Growing class sizes, sometimes 35+ students per class, which relegates you to the roll of a baby sitter. Sadly, money. In SC we've had a pay freeze since I've been teaching. Burnout. Last I checked, a huge % of teachers will leave within 7 years. Also, many teachers who are miserable don't leave and bring everyone down.  
[Anyone ever tell you, you look kinda like Gaius Baltar?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jmvi0/iama_another_hs_teacher_with_proof_ask_me/cbg9bmj?context=5)|No. I have no idea who that is. I will look it up and probably be sadder for it. I have been told by a student that I look like a short, beardless Abraham Lincoln. That too saddened me.
 |I just looked him up. I'll take that as a compliment. 
[Link to en.wikipedia.org.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jmvi0/iama_another_hs_teacher_with_proof_ask_me/cbg9gbu?context=5)|Did anyone ever tell you that you look like the person that you find to be utterly attractive? Because you do.
[A friend of mine's dad had a similar job, except it was middle school. I know he sometimes had to physically restrain students and received threats pretty regularly. Have you ever experienced anything like that? If so, how did you handle it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jmvi0/iama_another_hs_teacher_with_proof_ask_me/cbga0hh?context=5)|Luckily, I've never needed to restrain a student. I've been threatened a few times, but not lately. Normally, threats are the result of putting a kid in a compromising position wherein he is made to feel disrespected in front of his peers. I don't do that. Two years ago I asked and was given a student's cellphone as he wouldn't put it away. A few minutes passed and the kid started walking towards me with his fist closed. I happened to be behind my desk and had no way of removing myself from the situation. As such, I stood up, took off my ID and told the kid to put it in his pocket so he would remember who knocked him out. Another one of my kids stepped in between us and class continued on. He was cool the next day.
[Wow, thanks for answering my question. I feel like teaching is already one of the hardest jobs around, when you throw in students who are at risk for whatever reason I can only imagine that it makes it that much harder. Good on you for doing something most people would never think of doing.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jmvi0/iama_another_hs_teacher_with_proof_ask_me/cbgb46x?context=5)|Really, like most jobs, if you enjoy what you're doing, it isn't that hard.
[*I stood up, took off my ID and told the kid to put it in his pocket so he would remember who knocked him out.*  That is amazing and you are amazing.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jmvi0/iama_another_hs_teacher_with_proof_ask_me/cbgi85e?context=5)|Well, in retrospect, it probably wasn't the best thing to say but that's what came out. It's funny how the brain works in those situations.
[Why did you decide to teach high school? high schoolers, to me, are the worst human beings to teach because that's the age when they don't give a shit about anything and are very anti-authority. that's also when drugs and sex become ""cool"".](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jmvi0/iama_another_hs_teacher_with_proof_ask_me/cbg9abr?context=5)|I decided to go HS because I didn't want to teach middle schoolers. Also, I was a God awful HS student and was only passed because they didn't want me to stick around. I felt like I could help out students who were like myself.
[Also, in your years of teaching, have you ever had students so attractive it was hard for you to not have dirty, sexual thoughts about them? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jmvi0/iama_another_hs_teacher_with_proof_ask_me/cbg9abr?context=5)|Attractive? No. They are children to me. I view them in the same way I would view young children, as in ""What a cute little girl."" Although, a teacher in a nearby HS got caught banging several of her male students last year. 
[I appreciate your response to this. It bothers me when grown people find teenagers sexually attractive. Unfortunately, it seems acceptable in main stream society. I wish there was more discussion about this.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jmvi0/iama_another_hs_teacher_with_proof_ask_me/cbgeci5?context=5)|In my opinion an adult having sex with a teen is sexual abuse. The age of consent in SC is 16 years of age. However, any adult wishing to sleep with a sixteen year old should be taken into the public square and beaten mightily. It is reprehensible for a teacher to engage in sex with a student. We are entrusted to educate and care for our students. Sentences for teachers who sleep with students should be far, far harsher than they are. 
[If you weren't a teacher, what would you be doing now?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jmvi0/iama_another_hs_teacher_with_proof_ask_me/cbg8wud?context=5)|Probably construction as I didn't begin Univ. until I was 21 and had worked in construction prior to that.
[Why did you become a teacher? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jmvi0/iama_another_hs_teacher_with_proof_ask_me/cbg8vb7?context=5)|I was in a Philosophy  program with an eye to becoming a Phd.  I was working within the Phil. dept. We had a job opening and received 100's CV's. I read one of a Prof. who'd been at Notre Dame for 10 years. It then occurred to me that the job market was slim. As I still desired to teach and always enjoyed English, it seemed to make sense.
[What is the best part about teaching English? I've never seen the appeal in the subject myself but the English teachers I've had always seem to be some of the most enthusiastic teachers I've had.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jmvi0/iama_another_hs_teacher_with_proof_ask_me/cbg91bt?context=5)|The best part of teaching English for me, given that I work with extremely academically weak students,is watching the look come over their faces when the finally grasp something as minor as the difference between there, their and they're. I love watching as their confidence grows over the course of a year.
[ what area of philosophy did you focus on? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jmvi0/iama_another_hs_teacher_with_proof_ask_me/cbg91bt?context=5)|I focused on Existentialism and Medical Ethics.
[That ""eureka!"" moment is awesome to experience and witness :\) best of luck with your teaching! ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jmvi0/iama_another_hs_teacher_with_proof_ask_me/cbg95ey?context=5)|Thank you. Another high point is gaining enough trust so that they feel comfortable enough to seek me out when something serious is about to go down. Too many of my students are involved in gangs. Last year I was able to intervene in a planned drive by. I convinced several of my guys to lay low. While the rival gang did drive by and shoot, no one was hurt. The following Monday one of my guys gave me the name of the shooter.
[I'm curious, what specifically in medical ethics? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jmvi0/iama_another_hs_teacher_with_proof_ask_me/cbghvlm?context=5)|I was mostly concerned with ethics regarding decisions made by medical staff. For example, at what point is it ethically permissible to begin discussing organ donation with the family of a patient who is near death? Furthermore, are there any ethical guidelines in place to guide such a discussion?  Is there a line that shouldn't be crossed as to how hard a Doctor should push a family to donate? Is it ethically permissible to cross that line say if it would save the life of a child, or multiple people if multiple organs could be harvested? Stuff like that.
[Yo, teach, you may want to consider deleting this specific comment since snitches tend to catch stitches. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jmvi0/iama_another_hs_teacher_with_proof_ask_me/cbghk3k?context=5)|As I tell my students, I'm an adult who cares about them, I'm not a ""snitch."" If I knew that they could possibly be harmed or endangered in any way and didn't do everything in my power to intervene I wouldn't be able to sleep at night. I'd also be a poor excuse of a man.
[Interesting.   I am a doctor.   Often the ethical decisions paper and spoken about, don't happen that way in the real world. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jmvi0/iama_another_hs_teacher_with_proof_ask_me/cbgigzs?context=5)|If you don't mind me asking, and if you're in a hospital setting, is there an ethicist on staff? Would you even find such a person useful? Or would it be viewed as another layer of red tape?
[I'm in a hospital.   I don't believe we have a full time ethicist.   All decisions are left up to the physicians.   If there is an issue we will have a committee meaning full of hospital staff.  Such a person would be red tape and impede our ability to practice medicine. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jmvi0/iama_another_hs_teacher_with_proof_ask_me/cbgioxp?context=5)|Ah! I was right not to go into medical ethics! Well, that's good to know.
[I am in a teacher preparation program right now, and in a couple weeks I will start my student teaching.  Was there anything you wish you had known before you started teaching?  Any advice or helpful tips on improving as a teacher?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jmvi0/iama_another_hs_teacher_with_proof_ask_me/cbgamzu?context=5)|What would I've liked to know? Definitely more tips on classroom management. Unfortunately it's a skill that only develops with practice and experience. Tips...always meet your students where they are at the time and not the place you expect them to be academically. Remember that pass rates on standardized test are in no way a measurement of your ability. They are but a snapshot of a student on that given day. Never ever let them see you lose your temper. I've never raised my voice or yelled. Also, never take work home with you. Too many teachers spend countless hours outside of the classroom grading papers. I'm at my desk every morning at 6:30. I've never needed to take any work home.
[Is your school in an urban setting or suburban, etc?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jmvi0/iama_another_hs_teacher_with_proof_ask_me/cbg8xx3?context=5)|The school is in a fairly wealthy suburban setting. However, several housing projects feed into the school. These housing projects are home to the vast majority of my students.
[What kind of wine is that on top of your fridge in the pic? edit: you kind of remind me of beavis and buttheads high school teacher.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jmvi0/iama_another_hs_teacher_with_proof_ask_me/cbg8nun?context=5)|Ha! Actually, it's a small fire extinguisher. Beavis and Butthead? That's a damn shame. 
[What vintage is that fire extinguisher then?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jmvi0/iama_another_hs_teacher_with_proof_ask_me/cbg9kqb?context=5)|Sadly, probably 10 years old as it was in the home when I purchased it. We're a big proponent of the stop drop and roll method. 
[What is your opinion of online education at the HS level?  I ask because of the free courses being offered by universities.  What do you think of Khan Acacadmy?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jmvi0/iama_another_hs_teacher_with_proof_ask_me/cbg9d7s?context=5)|I've never heard of Khan, sorry. I think online courses which allow you to acquire a full HS diploma are excellent if you are driven and self-motivated. Sadly, many students who are pushed in this direction are usually failing, are old for their grade level or big discipline issues. The majority of those students end up dropping out all together. 
[If it is the school I'm thinking of, in a place named after trees...then how does the social economic status play out?  Are the poor vs rich kids treated differently?  I know that place has tons of rich folks in it.  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jmvi0/iama_another_hs_teacher_with_proof_ask_me/cbgezkp?context=5)|Oddly enough, the school was named after a man who happens to have that last name. While the poor aren't expressly treated differently from the rich, they have, as a general rule, not had the vast resources afforded the wealthy. It is easy to focus on academics when you come from a home nestled in a safe neighborhood. School is easy when you don't have to worry about food or the power and water being cut. Working in school isn't a big deal when you don't have to go straight home and care for your younger siblings so your parent can go to their 2nd job. The biggest difference between the wealthy and the poor seems to be the simplicity of life. While I know wealthy kids have their own struggles, they are not on par with the struggles faced by the vast majority of my kids. 
[Have you ever had a moment so discouraging that you had to think about why you wanted to be a teacher in the first place?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jmvi0/iama_another_hs_teacher_with_proof_ask_me/cbg9elv?context=5)|At least twice a week. My guys will begin to turn it around academically and get expelled for some dumb shit. Or my girls will get pregnant. Some go to jail. My discouragement almost always comes in the form of some aspect of their lives not wholly related to academics.
 |Just ran the numbers from last year and I lost nearly 25 percent of my total students to either, expulsion, jail, pregnancy or drop-outs. It's stunning when you put it into perspective.
[I finally made the decision that I want to become a HS teacher. I just finished my degree in economics this last semester. Completing the teaching credential seems daunting. How did you do it? How long should i expect the credential to take?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jmvi0/iama_another_hs_teacher_with_proof_ask_me/cbgaapn?context=5)|I'm sure it differs from state to state and country to country. As I was not an Education major, I attended a graduate program which took two years. Within those two years I completed three unpaid internships referred to as student teaching. There were two national tests that had to be passed. One of which is based on content knowledge while the other is based on pedagogy. I wasn't considered a full teacher until I completed my first two years of teaching and passed all of my evaluations. If you know your content and learn how to manage your class, it is a breeze. Although I've seen some would be teachers get hung up on the pedagogy exam. However, like most exams, it's based wholly on rote memorization and is of no real value.
[Damn, that sucks. How do you feel towards the students that weren't expelled, arrested, etc.?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jmvi0/iama_another_hs_teacher_with_proof_ask_me/cbgazle?context=5)|I mostly feel sad for them. Most of them have led lives that I wouldn't wish on anyone. While they certainly share some of the blame, most of the events that shaped them as people were totally beyond their control. Sadly, many are victims of circumstance.
[Do you notice any bullying? Have you ever encountered kids that seemed ""dangerous""?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jmvi0/iama_another_hs_teacher_with_proof_ask_me/cbgawuo?context=5)|I do indeed see bullying far too often. It is something I talk about on the 1st day of class. I'm fairly lenient. However, if I see you bullying someone I'm going to do my best to get you the harshest punishment I can. Dangerous students...I've only had one student that truly concerned me. He was 15 and was slipping into paranoid schizophrenia. He didn't come from a loving, safe environment and the higher ups didn't think that me and another teacher knew what we were talking about regarding his delusions. After about a month and some disturbing events, he finally began to receive the help he needed.
[I noticed on your badge that is says AC Flora. I'm from Columbia myself, and I was under the impression that they kept the schools in good neighborhoods (like Forest Acres\) separated from the bad neighborhoods. Which areas of the city do the majority of your students come from?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jmvi0/iama_another_hs_teacher_with_proof_ask_me/cbgagwn?context=5)|Small world...uncomfortably small perhaps. Here's hoping you don't rat me out to the man...
 |Indeed the school is located in Forest Acres. However, each school's population is pulled from the school zone it is located in. The majority of my students, given the population I work with, come from Gonzales Gardens Plaza, the Starlite neighborhood and parts of Leesburg Rd.
[I would never rat you out but if I did then you'd have just as much dirt on me. I can't believe they bus kids in all the way from Leesburg Road. Is it because the school you work at has specially-trained educators like yourself to do with at-risk type students that closer schools like South Richland don't have?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jmvi0/iama_another_hs_teacher_with_proof_ask_me/cbgba2n?context=5)|The lines for the district are very odd. Kids that you think would go to Dreher come to us. In fact, there is a street near Lower Richland HS wherein kids on one side of the street come to us and the other side goes to LR. It has nothing to do with specialized training.
[How comfortable is that sofa?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jmvi0/iama_another_hs_teacher_with_proof_ask_me/cbga026?context=5)|Not as comfortable as my bed but infinitely more comfortable than my chair at school. 
[Which would you rather be, a Pirate or a Ninja?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jmvi0/iama_another_hs_teacher_with_proof_ask_me/cbgggvn?context=5)|I grew up on the coast and lived minutes from the ocean. It is the place I love being the most. As such, I would lean toward Pirate. However, I'm prone to motion sickness and would be made to walk the plank for incessant puking. I must therefore select Ninja.
[Do you take the individual student into account when you grade something?  For instance a kid you know is smart that gives you a shitty paper, and a kid that obviously struggles with the material, but you can tell he's really trying... would you grade them equally?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jmvi0/iama_another_hs_teacher_with_proof_ask_me/cbgh5mv?context=5)|Given that I work with at risk students, I grade them based on their current abilities. That is to say that I would not grade someone who is reading and writing on a 4th grade level in the same way I would grade someone reading and writing on a 9th grade level. In fact, they wouldn't even be given the same assignment.
[I performed the same work as another student at one time, and was given an F when he was given an A. When I confronted the teacher about it, he said it was because he expected so much more from me. I was furious.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jmvi0/iama_another_hs_teacher_with_proof_ask_me/cbgi600?context=5)|If you completed the same assignment at the same level as another student you should have been given a similar grade.
[As an aside, the reason I wanted to reply to this thread was to ask what you feel your role is with at risk students for depression and mental issues. Do you feel like you know of students with major depression or possible suicidal thoughts, and how do you deal with such things?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jmvi0/iama_another_hs_teacher_with_proof_ask_me/cbgi600?context=5)|I have no advanced training as it regards mental health issues. It is my hope that my students trust me enough to approach me and let me know if issues arise. Certainly, as the year progresses and I get to know my students I can usually tell when something is up. It's like Spidey sense. If the Spidey sense tingles I know it's time for me to let someone know.
[I've heard that a lot of kids in that situation (being at-risk, or whatever their case may be\) can be more eager learners, since I had a co-worker who taught at a halfway house once. He said it was one of the best classes he'd ever taught. Is that true in this instance?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jmvi0/iama_another_hs_teacher_with_proof_ask_me/cbgb13n?context=5)|While I've had some eager learners, they are not the norm. Most of these kids have been bombing in school all of their lives. Many of them have had teachers who simply placed them in a back corner and largely ignored them as long as they weren't causing a disturbance. They act out because, to them, being thrown out of a class is better than being in a class that only serves to reinforce their own belief that they are failures. Personally, I love these students and wouldn't want to teach anything else. Once you've convinced them that you care about them and only want them to succeed, most of them will bend over backwards for you. So, eager? No.  Pretty motivated by the middle of the year? Mostly.
[How often do you notice students that are stoned or otherwise intoxicated?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jmvi0/iama_another_hs_teacher_with_proof_ask_me/cbgg45f?context=5)|I see and smell stoned students a fair amount. However, the school really has their hands tied. Unless the student has drugs in their possession, little can be done.
[Recently my states governor decided to deunionize the teacher, which i fully supported.  People dont understand that our schools were filled with lazy old battle axes who didnt teach, just assigned homework.  Do you see this often in your school?  Whats your thoughts on teacher unions?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jmvi0/iama_another_hs_teacher_with_proof_ask_me/cbgh69o?context=5)|Unions aren't a part of South Carolina's landscape. While I can see the benefits of having a collective voice, I can't really make a claim for or against unions as I've had no experience with them. I personally don't assign homework. The vast majority of my students wouldn't do it if given, and I see no reason to make academics anymore difficult than it already is for them. Furthermore, if can't teach you something over the course of a class period I find it highly unlikely that you'll somehow magically catch on once you get home. 
[What literature do you teach?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jmvi0/iama_another_hs_teacher_with_proof_ask_me/cbgc7ze?context=5)|I will use any text that works with the lesson I have in mind. I don't care if it's a comic book, newspaper, magazine or a children's book. If the students can connect with the text and learn in the process I'll use it.
[Do you have any curriculum-required reading? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jmvi0/iama_another_hs_teacher_with_proof_ask_me/cbgi6gn?context=5)|Because I have such a wide variety of learners with vastly different abilities my situation is rather unique. So, in short, no, I do not. 
[What's the most awkward hookup/sext/high school hormonal shenanigans you've come across and/or interrupted, and how did you handle it? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jmvi0/iama_another_hs_teacher_with_proof_ask_me/cbgaqpu?context=5)|Just answered above.
 |My answer seemed to vanish. I'll try again. Hookup? Two freshman trying to sneak into a bathroom during lunch to engage in probable unprotected sex. Luckily we got in there just as they were locking the stall door. They were taken to the principal.
 |I also had a troubled soul who once shouted out in class, ""Hey! Ya'll wanna see somthin?"" He then proceeded to show everyone a Polaroid of a very fat, very naked woman. Sad really, he got expelled the 1st week of school. 
[Ive been in 20 fights in middle school and 8 in hs.  I didn't start any of em.  What would you say about me?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jmvi0/iama_another_hs_teacher_with_proof_ask_me/cbgh15a?context=5)|Knowing only that you've been in many fights, there's not much I can say about you. My hope is that you don't run across someone that would just as soon shoot you as fight you. What do you think could be the reason that you find yourself in so many fights?
[Were kids in high school when you first started teaching different than the kids you're teaching now?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jmvi0/iama_another_hs_teacher_with_proof_ask_me/cbgio0z?context=5)|Nope. Nor do they seem to be much different than they were when I was a student way back in the '90's.
[Holy shit AC Flora. I know a ton of people that went to that school. I went to Dutch Fork myself.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jmvi0/iama_another_hs_teacher_with_proof_ask_me/cbgf6qv?context=5)|Sweet Jesus. The world of reddit is far too small.

[Went to Spring Valley, now we're up to 3!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jmvi0/iama_another_hs_teacher_with_proof_ask_me/cbggz1j?context=5)|Why do I have the nagging feeling that when I return on the 12th the Principal is going to want to see me?
[Yeah but I did sociology/accounting in university, and there really wasn't an easy shortcut for either of them. I did the exact same shit in the one university English course that I took and I did well. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jmvi0/iama_another_hs_teacher_with_proof_ask_me/cbgfpsi?context=5)|Indeed, one can't really fake numbers and data. Still, your ability to play other subjects is proof of your keen mind. Kudos to you pixelthug.
[In an earlier comment, one of the people mentioned working with kids that just don't give a shit about life... how do you motivate a kid who just plain doesn't give a shit about anything. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jmvi0/iama_another_hs_teacher_with_proof_ask_me/cbgap1q?context=5)|That is an extremely difficult task. I try to show them that they don't give a shit about the life they are currently leading. I need them to recognize the life they can have if the stick with it. I also make it clear that I understand that their current life is hard given that they live in an environment that is rife with crime, drug abuse and violence. It would be hard to give a shit about school when the place you live in is so violent that your mother won't let you walk to the mailboxes without remaining on the phone in case something bad happens.
[I just wanted to tell you thanks.  I didn't have a lot of good teachers, at least I think, but the ones I really connected with made a huge impact on my life that I didn't realize at the time.  I still think about them years later, and I'm glad they were there and I could tell they cared.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jmvi0/iama_another_hs_teacher_with_proof_ask_me/cbggz19?context=5)|Thank you. I'm glad you did have some that you connected with. I can assure you that those same teachers think of you from time to time as well.
[90% of the teachers I ever had were completely useless. A lot of people I know are also just starting teaching careers and most of these are people who I personally think have no business teaching.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jmvi0/iama_another_hs_teacher_with_proof_ask_me/cbgcgbf?context=5)|I would disagree, based on time spent with teachers over the years, that  90% are useless. I have indeed seen and been taught by my fair share of useless teachers. The schools I've been a part of make a genuine attempt to rid themselves of said teachers.  I also disagree with the notion that ""those that can't teach."" I have found it to be the case that the vast majority of the teachers I know most indeed ""can"" and are simply driven to show others how to do the same. Those teachers that seem to aimlessly drift into the profession soon realize that it is infinitely harder to do than one would think. Most of these types leave the profession within a couple of years.

He's trying to get a job in IT because hes a computer science major. He has internship experience that hes gotten through connections but his weight is preventing him from getting a job because he thinks employers will see him being overweight as a liability. Hes trying to lose weight now. Is he being realistic or just making up excuses?

I got a summer internship with a medium-size software company that has an office near my college. After working with them this summer, they want me to work with them part-time during the school year.

How much would working for them part-time help my career? While the money would be nice, I don't really need it, so the only reason I would do this would be for the career benefits.

I'm worried about how this will affect my schooling. I had a lot of trouble last year. I was even on academic probation after my first semester. I'm no longer on it, but my last semester still wasn't great, and I'm worried that this part-time job would be a big distraction, especially since I want to do more with clubs and hackathons and making friends this semester.

However, they're very flexible with hours, so I could not work at all during finals and midterms, and I could even work from home. And I don't need to make a commitment, so I can just quit if I think it's taking too much of my time.

I'm not really sure what decision to make here. How much would a part-time job help my resume? Has anyone else balanced work with school that can give me some advice?"

Degree in Computer Science. I've had a fair number of internships, some major ones in the Defense industry, as well as working for smaller companies and projects. My desire is to focus on software development but I can be flexible in the IT field depending on the job. 

For some further background, I've spent about 8 months staying in a small village in the southwest of France for educational purposes and traveled around France and other EU countries. I've completely fell in love with the culture, people and the way of life in France, especially that area of France. There's not a day I do not miss being there. 

My best case scenario would be finding employment in southern France, but I realize unemployment is a problem in France. I'd be happy to find work in other countries such as Germany, UK, etc... Keeping in mind though the only language other then English that I know to any extent is French. Currently it's basic/broken French but I'm continuing with classes to improve upon it. 

I'm wondering about how feasible it is finding employment in my field of study in France/Europe/UK. Is it promising for someone in my situation? And, are there places that are better then others for looking for jobs and researching online? I assume the easiest solution would be to find a US company with foreign offices.

1jrn50,3,2013-08-05,I (21F) have a thing for someone (22M) in a complicated relationship.,throwawaynumber5014,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1jrn50/i_21f_have_a_thing_for_someone_22m_in_a/,"At the start of the year I met a guy through some friends who I really clicked with. We got really close and ended up liking each other a lot, but I had a boyfriend at the time so we stopped talking. 

Flash forward to a few weeks ago. We started talking again, but not as often and not as easily as before. I'd just gotten out of my relationship, but he'd just gotten into one. The thing is, I still have feelings for him.

His relationship is a little bit complicated. It's long distance with no chance of changing any time soon. As well as that no one knows if they're officially in a relationship as such, or just seeing each other while they're together for the summer. 

I've really liked this guy since I met him, and I want to see if he still has any feelings for me, but I don't know if I should say anything. He looks happy with his new girl, and my first instinct is that I should let it go and let them be happy without my interference. However I was talking to a friend about it, and she thinks I should say something, because I'll never know what could have happened if I don't.

There's one more complication: I'm moving away soon for an internship. It's only for five months, but for that time I'll only be home once or twice for two week breaks.

So what should I do? Do I say something to him in case it could go somewhere, or do I let him go and accept that I missed my chance?

1jrcau,1,2013-08-05,Any advice for a CS major about to graduate with a low GPA?,[deleted],learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1jrcau/any_advice_for_a_cs_major_about_to_graduate_with/,"So I'm going to graduate soon with with a bachelor's in computer science from a State University. I'm worried about my 2.6 GPA (yea know, its pretty bad). After a directionless and poor first two years of college and a 2.1 GPA I took a CS class and realized that I loved it. I switched my major and have been able to raise my GPA slightly. However, I've got a lot of anxiety about my GPA and not being able to find a job out there. Its not because I don't know what I'm doing when it comes to programming, I'm just not the type of person that is well adapted to formal education. I'm much more of a hands-on/social-learner/learn-by-doing type of person (in fact I think this is what drew me to programing in the first place). 

Anyways, should I be as worried as I am about this? I want to apply to internships but so many of the ones I've looked through say ""3.0 GPA minimum"" that I'm feel pretty nervous about this. Any advice on what I should do. Will I be forced to work at a miserable job and work my way up?

* Going into third year of college at private business school. (Marketing Degree, minor in computer science)

* No debt--(Got a job at 14 and started saving. This and scholarships mean school is financially plausible.)

* No savings--I work full time during the summer and 20 hours a week during school, but all this money goes towards my education and living expenses.

* I live at home, rarely go out or spend my money, and my credit score is 720 at last check. (auto loan paid off and credit card.)

I do well in school and going into my junior year already have had two internships in my field. I hope to get a job with a decent salary after graduation. 

So my question is: Should I be worried I don't already have some savings? If not, why? If I should be worried--what can I do?

I am hoping someone here might be able to give any tips on where to look or point me to some of the companies that have software engineering jobs.  Any help would be appreciated.

Juneau sounds ideal to me because of the milder AK temperatures, extra winter daylight and the great sailing community, but I would consider Anchorage for the right situation (It looks like it'd be easier to find a job in Anchorage as the city is much larger).

1jqrcs,20,2013-08-05,"ROK Military vets, share your stories and answer questions!",zootia,korea,https://www.reddit.com/r/korea/comments/1jqrcs/rok_military_vets_share_your_stories_and_answer/,"So I was browsing through this sub and read the post about the guy wondering if 308보충대 would send him up to the DMZ and realized there were a good number of 예비역s on here! I'm assuming as you guys are all fluent in English and browse reddit, most of you were brought up somewhere outside of Korea.




Coming from a lifetime in a western country straight into the ROK military can be a jarring experience, and I thought it would be cool if we could talk about are times in the service, share some stories...etc.


Also, if there are kids out there who are like us and are considering joining the ROK military, they can ask us questions. I know I would have loved a resource like this before I had signed up to ship out to Nonsan. 


I guess I'll start. (long post, TLDR at bottom)


I grew up in the States, in rural Indiana for most of my life. I have acceptable Korean, almost fluent but can't talk very fast or use advanced vocab. I moved back and forth to Korea a few times in my life but never for long. I was going to University here and my grades were shit (got academic probation) and hated my major. My parents said maybe I should join the ROK Army and get some sense knocked into me. I thought it would be a good experience too. (Be all you can be, Army strong, you know?)


Feb 2009 I flew to Korea and went to Nonsan to start my training. No specialty MOS.. just as a 1111 소총수. The first week I was there, they did a aptitude screening and obviously I scored very high in English. Apart from that, the Drill Instructors there didn't give a shit that I grew up in the states and I got the exact same treatment as all the other recruits. About 2 weeks in it kinda dawned on me that the ROKA wasn't anything like the US Army which I'd been seeing commercials and movies about my entire life.


When I graduated boot camp, they changed my MOS to 3111.E (English translator/interpreter) and shipped me off to bumfuck Changwon. It's a little industrial city about 30 minutes west of Busan. I'm not going to say exactly what base it was (정보통신보안 ㅋ) but the enlisted presence there was very small. We had 2 undersized companies, so around 200 enlisted personnel. Being in the rear, we had very strict 똥군기. Basically, it's stupid 군기 that is mostly pointless. I think that the mentality was that because our post wasn't a physically demanding place like the DMZ, the senior enlisted guys thought that they should keep us in check by applying mental strain instead. Corporal punishment was very much still alive and kicking, and the first few months as a 이등병 were pretty rough. I remember being kicked in the back while I was squaring away(literally your blanked needed to have a 90 degree angle 각!) my 모포 sitting cross-legged, because apparently, you're supposed to do that shit while kneeling. I did the invisible chair stress position a few times while standing post at night because I couldn't memorize all the 군번s of everyone in the company, the 10대 군가s and 초병의일반수칙. I couldn't use the PX or internet room(싸지방) until I was a PFC, etc.. the list goes on. Also, the menial tasks I had to perform was endless. Basically cleaning gross shit all the time (scrubbing urinals with a hand sponge and no gloves, anyone?) and being pretty much a slave to the senior guys, doing their laundry and cleaning up after them.. lol


Moreover, I never really got to translate much. I only spent a few hours at my ""work"" a day because I had to go stand post(each shift is 2 hrs, 1.5 in the winter) twice a day and we had some sort of training exercise or march at least once a month.


Needless to say the first few months I wasn't a happy camper.

 
I think a lot of the issues did stem from the fact that western culture is inherently different from Korean culture. Western countries have more lax hierarchy and everyone seems to be more on the same level. In Korea, hierarchy is everything and the entire respect system revolves around seniority (not only age but how long you have been doing something for..)  For me, at first anyway, it was hard to take orders for somebody who had enlisted 1 month prior to me and salute them. It felt insulting or something. However, eventually I got the hang of it and just kinda developed a different version of me. I had the normal me, who was a normal college kid and the ROKA soldier me. Once I was in the persona, I had no problem fitting in.


Once I started putting my time in, I eventually got to the midpoint of the corporal rank (상꺾) which is widely accepted as the time when you are considered ""senior"" enlisted. As long as you weren't a shitbag during your time as PVT and PFC (respect is earned, not given), You can basically order your privates around and you can do anything you want around the barracks for the most part. Want something from the PX and don't wanna leave the room? Send a private. Squad bay looking dirty? Make the privates scrub down the floors with brushes. Even the 병장s will now recognize that you've earned your ""짬""(salt) and accept you as part of their senior club. By this time, I had spent more than a year with most of them anyway so everyone was pretty buddy buddy and the hierarchy was very relaxed. I ended up being good friends with guys 3-4 months senior to me that used to smoke me when I used to be a private.


Eventually, I made sergeant, and would spend my days lurking around the barracks trying to not get sent to work. It's kinda funny because when I was a private, I really wanted to go to work and translate but when I was a sergeant, I hated going. I would volunteer for 작업(working parties) whenever they were available and just chill outside and shoot the shit with the other guys while the privates and PFCs did most of the work..lol! Hands down the last few months were the best.


Finally by Christmas of 2011, I walked out of the base gate with a 개구리(Reservist patch.. does anyone know why the fuck these are called 개구리s? Nobody in our company knew..I thought because they looked a like a frog maybe..) embroidered on my left chest pocket. I flew back to the states not even a week after my EAS(End of Active Service) and started school again the week after. I had quite a bit of a culture shock again, as the ROKA 병장 persona had taken over almost completely. I would see freshmen chewing gum with their legs crossed in front of the professor during lecture and would get pissed and think '저 개새끼봐라 조또 빠져가지고...' and realized that I was not in the army anymore or even Korea for that matter and it was okay to act like that here. I still woke up at 6AM everyday for a good semester after my EAS and went on runs. Sometimes if nobody was around I would even sing cadence to myself (moto!)... I'd say it took me a good year to get my normal persona back.


In retrospect, even though at first it was a shit experience, I think that my time in the ROKA was definitely a positive experience for me. I learned to appreciate the life I had here in the states more than anything, and I learned to not take anything for granted. I have gotten pretty much straight As in school since and gotten my shit together. Also, because I've experienced all this nasty shit like bootcamp, doing demeaning shit for months, training, 유격, and a few 30km full gear marches, I feel like that whenever something shitty happens in real life I can be like..'Oh this sucks but not as bad as that time when I had to duckwalk around the soccer field all night because the retard private I was standing post with had a negligent discharge...' Weirdly, it also made me super patriotic and now I fly a Korean flag patch on my backpack. 


Some nights when I'm sitting at home doing nothing, I reminisce about my time in the Army. I actually do miss it, all the good parts and bad. There was something there that civilian life doesn't have. It was the only really ""worry free"" time of my adult life. I mean there were things you had to worry about, but it was stupid shit, like.. 'oh fuck I'm gonna get smoked tomorrow by the staff sergeant because so and so didn't get done..' and not important stuff like 'oh fuck if I don't get this internship I'm probably not going to get a job..'


Anyways, I would totally do it again if I could!


TL:DR - My time in the ROKA was shit but in retrospect it helped me out in life and I miss it.

1jqo9l,9,2013-08-05,[Request] Family is out of options and no where to turn to.,[deleted],Assistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/1jqo9l/request_family_is_out_of_options_and_no_where_to/," I want to reach out to you guys, because honestly, I dont know who or where else to turn to. This will be somewhat long, but please read it all. I've tried posting in Assistance and Christianity before with no avail. So I'm going to post my situation here and if God moves you to help my family in some way, then so be it. I'm really hoping that someone here can help us.

My family has fell on some seriously hard times. Currently, I'm married with two sons and a daughter from a previous relationship. I am currently the only one working because my wife had went back to school to become a Medical Assistant. She, over about 2 years, did this successfully and is taking her final exam tomorrow, and is supposed to start her internship on Aug 27th. I've been the only one working this whole time because she's been a full time student and housewife, and mother. She's amazing. Financially, everything was fine until April of this year when a garnishment began on my paycheck. Ever since, it has been an uphill battle for anything. 

Currently, our power is set to be cut off Weds, our internet access is set to be turned off today, and our phones have been off for 3 weeks. We have no food. And our car is out of allignment with 3 tires showing balding and wire. I am absolutely terrified in this situation. I've done everything I can and called everyone I knew for any help of any kind, to no avail. I got help for my power a few months back at our local Action, and they told me they could only help once a year. Not only that, but we get a small amount of food stamps, and because of that, the local food banks wont help us with food.

Under any normal circumstances, the internet being off with the phones would be fine, but my wife needs to be able to communicate with the Doctors office about the internship as well as talk to the doctor about my sons toe (that is scheduled for surgery this month as well), and we cant even do that. I dont know what to do. Our bank account is currently negative where we had to pay for car ins last month and I havent been abel to bring it current. Driving our car is becoming dangerous because at any moment, the tires could blow out and used tires here are around $30 each. We started posting alot of the things we own on yard sale pages on Facebook just to get by, but $5 here and there can only do so much. 

I know this is alot, but I dont know what to do. I've exhausted every outlet and all I have left is my Christian brothers and sisters. I turned to my local churches over the past couple of months and none of them seem to want to help either. I had a single church tell me they only help those in the church family, and that absolutely baffles me. You guys are quite literally my last hope to help. Is there anyone here that can help my family?

EDIT 1: I've currently taken some pics of the tires on the car to give you guys a better idea of the situation. I have to wait until my break in about an hour to post them though. Bear with me. I was able to work out a deal with the internet company to by us a week. I'm hoping that'll be enough time for that. The power advised me yesterday that it would definitely be turned off tomorrow if no payment could be made though, so they arent trying to wrok with me at this point. And finally, the food banks. There are several food banks that I stopped at yesterday upon leaving work in the Athens, GA area and they stated the same policies as the Madison County one ""if you get any food stamps, you arent eligible for any donations from the food bank"". I was able to pull this information from their website: 
http://www.madisoncountyga.us/Dir/Departments/Madison-County-Food-Bank/39/    Phone 706-795-5465
Tuesday 8:00AM - 4:00PM
Wednesday 8:00AM - 4:00PM
Thursday 8:00AM - 4:00PM

Edit 2: tires
http://imgur.com/86SrcoV
http://imgur.com/2SrgXAE  I can post the rear ones too, but they're the same as these two. I was having a hard time getting a decent picture of them. I drive a Mazda so the back end sits lower.


EDIT 3: I was able to catch some extra work yesterday and pay almost the entire power bill, but they're holding with $61 left to pay on it. So if it's not taken care of today, they're shutting it off. Also I was able to go to the food bank yesterday and they made a ""one time exception"" for our case. Providing us with about 2 days worth of food. I'm absolutely getting desperate here. If ANYONE can help in any way, please help. "
1jqf5o,48,2013-08-05,IWTL How to start a political based NGO in the U.S.A.,Ohuma,IWantToLearn,https://www.reddit.com/r/IWantToLearn/comments/1jqf5o/iwtl_how_to_start_a_political_based_ngo_in_the_usa/,"From the U.S.A., I've become quite passionate about the local politics in my city. It is in a top 35 metro area. There are NGOs in my area that focus on one specific topic, like expanding public transportation. 

But I want my NGO to focus on anything and everything that can my city one that caters to the creative class. This means reviewing laws, proposing new ones, heavy research. I would like to employ people from several disciplines, including: Law, city planning, GIS, ...ect

The obvious problem is MONEY (it is always money). I thought one good way to circumvent paying mega salaries is hiring interns instead. I would like to bring in interns from the creative cities in Europe, because it is great to get ideas from outside sources. 

However, the problem still stands, MONEY. Given that these are interns, I think legally, I need to at least provide them with housing or the equivalent. How do I get money for my NGO. I also realize that NGOs are not profitable, but how long before someone can make a decent living from their NGO?

I am finish college in one semester and starting an NGO has been alternative to finding a job abroad. My guess is that the top comment will be soliciting for donations, but Ive never done so and the amount of donations we would need seems quite troublesome.

We would need:

* An office
*  Computers, phones, ect
* Housing/Compensation for interns? -- There are many office/house type spaces in my city which could function as both for us
* Money -- Donations, but HOW? What bigwig would donate to a kid fresh out of college?

1jq65y,3,2013-08-05,Questions and Concerns,biggmeat,engineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/1jq65y/questions_and_concerns/,"Hey Everyone,

I am going to be a senior ChE this coming fall. I have been concerned about getting a job after graduation. I have 3.2 GPA which will probably be the same when I graduate. I have no work experience and have been doing research with fuels this summer. I will have taken a variety of engineering topic classes when I graduate (besides CHE).
I was wondering if you guys have any advice for my senior year to help get hired. I didn't really have any luck with interviews last year. I was thinking on asking a graduate student and my professor to review my resume for the fall and perhaps ask them for advice or if they can get me in touch with someone. I don't know if that would be appropriate though. I do plan to do some research in my spring semester if I can. I also am unsure if I should apply to internships as a senior but I am open to internships after graduation.

I have had no luck with my university's online career postings. And if someone is willing to review my resume for the fall, that would be great.

Any advice, resources, or help is appreciated. I am also open to oversea job opportunities if someone has worked overseas.
Thanks,

1jq216,2,2013-08-05,Relapsed after a successful week,[deleted],NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/1jq216/relapsed_after_a_successful_week/,"Last week was relatively successful for me, as far as NoFap goes: I hit the week mark for the first time in quite a while (a couple months, at least). This weekend, though, I relapsed and binged a bit. As one might imagine, after fapping three times in two days after being clean for a week, I was feeling rather introspective, trying to figure out what happened. I did learn a couple lessons - for example, I have the tendency to look for small mistakes earlier in the day that disposed me to give in later (i.e., clicking an NSFW link, leering at a classmate, etc), and, while those earlier choices are significant, I tend to discount the fact, when actually faced with temptation, I didn't have to give in, but I still chose to do so anyway. However, possibly the most significant lesson I've learned is something more positive, in the sense that it leaves me with a task. 


I'm going to be graduating from college in the spring. Until this year, my father paid for all of my schooling; I contributed nothing of my own, except some cash to buy used books. I realized, some time ago, that this has changed my outlook on my education. Because it wasn't costing me anything to go to college, I didn't take it as seriously as I should; I goofed off; I didn't study for exams; my sophomore year, I basically went to class (where I barely paid attention), and then went back to my dorm, fapped, and watched TV the rest of the day. As I go back for my last year, though, I'm basically paying my own way, and I've already noticed a different outlook on the upcoming semester. 

This was on my mind as I was thinking about this weekend's relapse. The attitude that I had toward college, I've come to realize, is only an extension of my attitude towards life in general. Until now, almost everything has been provided to me with no effort. I got a (fairly generous) weekly allowance in high school, without having to earn it; my college experience (including books, room, and board) was completely paid for, despite poor performance; I've had three internships, but I can't say I really earned any of them by my own merits.  You can add on to all this a consistent usage of pornography since age 12, and masturbation since around 13, and you have a recipe for aimlessness. 

See, the problem is that I've never had to ask myself what I really want from life. I spent three years stumbling from one easy major to another, never with a really clear idea of what I wanted to do afterwards, or what I wanted my life to look like after college. All I really knew was TV, video games, and, especially, porn; so, when I did think about the future, it looked like a lot of TV, video games, and porn, and hopefully a job to fund my habits.

Part of my recovery, then, has to include deciding what I want from life. I'm an Orthodox Christian, so, obviously, the easy answer is 'I want to try to live a holy life'. That's great, as far as it goes; but it doesn't go as far as one might think. Holy lives are lived in a particular context, not in a vacuum. Do I want to become a computer programmer? A writer? A lawyer? Do I want to become a priest, or a monk? Do I want to get married and have kids? Will I live in a big city, or out in the country? What will I do with my free time? These are all questions that I need to deal with as part of my recovery; not just removing PMO from my life, but building something better - a life lived with a solid foundation, and built up with gold, silver, and precious stones, as Saint Paul exhorts us. *Господи Иисусе Христе, Сыне Божий, помилуй мя грешнаго.* (Yes, learning Russian is one of my new goals.)

**TL;DR: Too bad. I know it's a bit rambling, but take 5 minutes to read it anyway; hopefully it will help someone besides me.**"

Bottom line is, I am transferring from a community college after next year and I don't have any money for college and will have no financial aid (parents combined income &gt; 250k, so I'm fucked)

Chico is looking really good in terms of smoothly transferred classes and very affordable cost of living. 

The three concerns I have are 

1. The value of their CS program. I can't find very much info online about it.

2. How good the school will look on my résumé. Im not a snob, but the school obviously has a reputation for partying and I do not want that to hinder me in the future.

3. The difficulty of getting internships. I do not know that many people will be hiring interns out of that area?

1jpiql,1,2013-08-04,Just lost my job and looking for advice.,[deleted],getdisciplined,https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1jpiql/just_lost_my_job_and_looking_for_advice/,"At 4:56pm (local time) I was informed that I do not need to come into work on Monday.  Thankfully, I am still in my early 20s and have a lot of energy.  As much as I want to mope, I am determined to make the best of the situation.  I have already talked to family members and they are great, but I would like additional brainstorming power.  I will happily answer questions in the comments, but here is my question for Reddit:  What steps do I need to take to minimize the long term damage this is going to cause me and where should I go from here?

Here is my situation in a nutshell:

1.	Got a Mechanical Engineering degree with a minor in Mathematics.

2.	I had one year-long internship after graduation at a manufacturing facility (went pretty decent and paid well)

3.	I moved into town and got let go after training for a couple months at a biomedical firm.

4.	Currently living in the mid-south, with family recently moved to the west coast and friends moved to the east coast, very few local contacts.

5.	Locked into about 9 months of a 12 month lease on my apartment.

Here is what I have to work with:

1.	A loving family (On the west coast)

2.	Bachelor’s in Mechanical Engineering (with math minor)

3.	Serious art hobby (*Currently* unlikely to enable a career path, but worth mentioning, and something I love 
to do)
4.	Strong interest in programming and computer science

5.	THANKFULLY no debt and over $15k in savings (not trying to brag, just laying out the tools at my disposal for your consideration)

Here are the career issues I am trying to balance looking for as I begin my job hunt:

1.	Money (Duh)

2.	Creativity (Technical creativity, such as math and programming as well as artistic creativity)

3.	Location (Rather not be in the mid-south)

While of course sympathy and motivational advice are appreciated, I am really looking for suggestions and actionable items.  I want to be working again, and this time with a lot more “fire” in my belly.  Also, because I may need to move soon anyway, and I have basically zero obligations and commitments, I am open to suggestions that require major life changes or year-long commitments.  I don’t think I’m cut out to work on an oil rig, but you get the idea.

1juikc,1,2013-08-06,"Me[20M] with my GF [20F] of 8 months, broke up because she said she doesn't think we are in love and she doesn't love me.",csdbifda,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1juikc/me20m_with_my_gf_20f_of_8_months_broke_up_because/,"A little background first. We are in college and hooked up for a couple of weeks before we decided that we should actually try dating. I had known her before then and had hung out with her. We have had a couple of fights and most of them were honestly probably my fault. But we have made up and I thought we were doing well. We were away from college for 2 months this summer so didn't see much of each other. When we came back we have been hanging out but haven't done anything special. We both started internships and have been under stress and haven't had much time. I wish I had taken the time to take her to dinner or do something for her in the past month but we were meeting up so often just to hang out, I didn't really think of it. I think the problem started when we had a pregnancy scare a couple of weeks ago. I think she really freaked out and finally snapped. She has done this with other guys before where the relation will be fine and a couple of days later her mind changes. 

Well the break up actually started last Saturday after we had a fight about me being clingy the night before. I apologized because I realized I had been clingy. Then we went out and enjoyed ourselves for a couple of hours were okay. When we got home we were having sex when we stopped in the middle of having sex because she was feeling sore. We were cuddling for a couple of seconds before she tried to justify it and then started saying that I was tired anyways and was going limp, which was partially true as it had been quite some time since we had sex last.

Anyways, I got annoyed by this very quickly and told her to just stop which pissed her off and she pushed me off her and started crying, saying I don't love her. For approximately an hour I tried to calm her down and tell her I do. She told me of a couple of times in recent weeks where she didn't feel appreciated or had gotten mad at me, most of which she hadn't told me before and I think would have been not that big of a deal if I had known. It's partially my fault because I didn't realize that she had been actually mad at me but she does this a lot where she will bottle everything up and let it out all at once. Finally, her friends interrupted us because we had invited them over earlier. When the night ended we were okay and slept together. We woke up the next morning and made breakfast together and then she left. Over the next couple of days (Monday and Tuesday) we texted back and forth a couple of time but not really any conversations and she invited me to watch a movie with some friends at her place. I declined as I was still a little surprised from Saturday and was actually thinking about breaking up with her, which was probably a mistake and I should have gone. However, I made up my mind that I wanted to stay with her and decided to do something nice for her.

Finally on Wednesday, after buying tickets for a show to her favorite band, I surprised her and showed up at her house. She told me that we needed to talk and proceeded to tell me that she wasn't in love with me and that we weren't in love. She was obviously upset and cried a lot but didn't really explain much to me except that she didn't want to date me anymore because she thought we were better together as friends. She also said she loved me like a best friend and was upset because she thought I wouldn't want to be her friend anymore. Which is true. I feel betrayed and hurt by this. We haven't talked in a week and I am lost at what to do. I want her back but I don't know if it's possible. She has a whole drawer of clothes still at my place and I think about her every day. We had talked about what would happen if we broke up a couple of times before and we had always come to the conclusion that we wouldn't be friends because we didn't have the same group of friends so I am also confused why that changed so quickly. 

I haven't talked to her in a week except when I texted her to ask if this had anything to do with another guy to which she said no and to ask if it was because of the pregnancy scare to which she didn't respond. I have been trying to give her space but I really miss her. She was also my first girlfriend so I don't have much experience about this. We both agreed that we had some really good times but recently, she said she has just been really upset. However, she kept saying that it wasn't my fault and that she wasn't love with me anymore. I want to know if there's anyway I can try to convince her to change her mind or at least give me a chance. When we broke up she was very adamant that her mind was made up. If you have any questions let me know. I tried to be thorough yet relevant. 

---

TL;DR: GF broke up with me saying she doesn't love and we aren't in love. She said she wants to be friends and cares about me. We haven't talked since and I really miss her."
1jui6d,112,2013-08-06,Cheesemonger's cove - an FPS from a living patient,Ich_bin_surreal,fatpeoplestories,https://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/1jui6d/cheesemongers_cove_an_fps_from_a_living_patient/,"OK, FPS. I'm back here to feed you a short, sweet story from some years ago... It has some exotic flavoring, but is still very well buttered and deep fried, so *(insert overused joke here)*...

Engaging green.

&gt; Be intern in a small rural hospital

&gt; Mostly underserved local population, a lot of which have lots of serious problems and only come when things get dire

&gt; Be covering Internal Medicine

&gt; oldpeople.sick and minimal attending supervision

&gt; Generally don't mind

&gt; New patient admitted from the ED, brought by ambulance

&gt; Enter patient's room, unknowing the horror that awaited

&gt; 260 (572 Lb) Kg female behemoth, barely holding up in this tiny hospital bed. Her abundant rolls overflow every corner and she seems surrealistically uncomfortable there. her entire external anatomy is a cruel and grotesque joke of itself.
 Have no idea how she was brought there.

&gt; Multiple nurses and nursing assistants in the room, all gagging from the smell and panicking due to the lack of physical resources to deal with this mythical creature

&gt; Go talk to the creature and try to contain the awe that befell me. Says she has severe difficulty breathing and had never seen a doctor before. Several other issues on to of that (I'll get to it, don't worry)

&gt; Bluntly ask ""how did you let yourself become that size?""

&gt; ""I've always been a little bit bigger since I was a kid... I guess I just like eating... Teehee""

&gt; mfw no face hearing""a little bit bigger""

&gt;  Ask about dietary habits

&gt; Oh surprise, she eats all healthy-ish home cooked meals... Just over 10,000 calories of them a day!

&gt; She does look pretty sick and the massive amount of fat makes auscultation impossible, so X-rays are ordered

&gt; However, she can't stand up to get a conventional CXR

&gt; She won't fit inside the C-arm portable X-rays either

&gt; There is no way to know what is going on inside her chest, so she'll need to be referred to the larger center in the city. Extensive discussion is had with attendings, hoping she'll be a decent candidate for bariatric surgery at some point

&gt; Meanwhile, try to keep her alive and solve as many issues as possible, this, of course is where things get crazier

&gt; Behemoth complains of vaginal itching and lesions in her skin

&gt; So that explains the smell

&gt; Realize I'll have to do a pelvic exam on this flesh mountain, and we only have your average length gloves, no fancy elbow length stuff

&gt; That obviously means I'll come in contact with her greasy body fluids

&gt; Alpha up and do it, with the help of four nurses, two of each separating each leg, since the rolls and sheer weight make it impossible for her to even open them by herself

&gt; When this happens, we all get to smell the true power of cheesemonger's cove... It smells like Limburger but exudes something that looks like a mix between cottage and fresh mozzarella

&gt; Hold breath and actually examine her... It looks like good old *Candida* and bacterial vaginosis.

&gt; stinksbutnobigdeal.exe 

&gt; Skin is all violaceous in her legs and thighs as expected

&gt; Also, more cottage cheese under every single overflowing fold. The stench is unbearable. Besides, there are several blisters in other areas, which look seriously infected.

&gt; Consider if I will forever forfeit cheese after this.

&gt; lelnope. Pathologist's brain grants +99% resistance to disgust

&gt; Try to manage this issues while the ambulance comes for her, then go deal with other dying/crazy/demanding/dramatic living patients

&gt; When I'm back, the ambulance is finally taking her out. Don't have the fortune to see how in the works she was taken out

&gt; Walk into the horizon, never hear of this behemoth again

&gt; Hope she made it somehow.

TL;DR: HAES is having Pickwickian syndrome (?) and not fitting in any imaging machine to work it up."

We are both college students for and we met at school. Me and him seem like the perfect couple on the outside but for the past month and a half I can say that my willingness to be in this relationship has been dropping steadily.

I am a very ambitious person and excel in my studies and am really involved in forming a successful career path for myself with volunteer work and internships. He on the other hand barely passes his classes and always complains that our friends are doing more than him and he feels like he waited too long to start but yet does nothing about it. He always complains about being broke but never gives any effort to even apply to jobs. This is a huge turn off to me because I want someone who can keep up with me and not see as someone who will hold me back. He is always going on and on about how unhappy he is with his life but yet never does anything to change it. His constant Debbie downer attitude exhausts me and I feel like I constantly have to give him pep talks but its all a waste of my time because they fall on deaf ears. He just seems to have serious self esteem issues and I want to help him get there and have been trying for a really long time but to quote Katt Williams ""it's called SELF esteem"" and I'm tired of being his crutch. 

That being said I'm afraid to leave because he seems to be depressed sometimes and not to toot my own horn but he always says that I'm the only good thing in his life and I wonder what my absence would do to him.

When it comes to our sex life I'm also equally disappointed. He barely ever has sex with me and when he does it is because I initiated it and he does the same thing each time. If it was up to him he would have sex twice a month maybe. I have confronted him about the lack of intimacy so many times but he says that he is just not that much of a sexual person and that he never has been. Not to be conceited but I find myself to be very attractive and I always wonder why he won't have sex with me. This has seriously messed me up. And has even made me contemplate cheating on him. I have never gone through with it and i never will. i havent even spoken or flirted with other guys but its a terrible thought that passes my mind every so often because I am not happy with him.

We are both embarking on our senior year and he has all these plans of getting married and moving in together and theres a lot of pressure from his family to be together and these plans honestly scare the shit out of me. I'm only 21 I want live free from commitments and focus on myself, my career, and just have fun. 

I know I'm not making him seem like the most likable guy but to be honest in every other aspect of the relationship he is amazing. I really love him and really care for him but while im writing im wondering if The love i have for him is more of a maternal wanting to help out love than live partner love. He is caring and thoughtful and always takes care of me and my family. He is a giving person and a good guy who I can tell really loves me and would never hurt me. This all leads me to feel like an asshole for wanting to leave but I honestly feel trapped at this point.

Tl;dr: my bf of almost 2years barely ever has sex with me and has a very draining and self defeating personality that leaves me feeling exhausted. Aside from that he is an amazing guy. Should I stay or go?

1judt5,1,2013-08-06,Didn't do a degree in Graphic Design but know this is what I want to pursue. What are my best options now??,[deleted],graphic_design,https://www.reddit.com/r/graphic_design/comments/1judt5/didnt_do_a_degree_in_graphic_design_but_know_this/,"I'm really stuck on a decision. Any feedback at all is greatly appreciated, especially if you are study/work in the field!


My dilemma: I have a BA in Visual Arts and English. After graduating, I knew that I wanted to pursue graphic design and illustration- both if I could. I took a few courses in both subject areas at a community college to test it out and loved it. I also have a certificate in publishing to try and get internships in the field. I've been looking into what my options are now. Most job postings in design seem to ask for a 3-4 degree/diploma. Is my only option to return for a second BA? I reallllly don't want to spend another 3-4 years on school at this point. I've looked into a few options and here's what I've been trying to choose between:

1) Graphic Design Certificate- Print &amp; Web Design at Humber College (6 months full-time)

2) Digital Media Certificate at OCAD University with specialization in Graphic Design and Illustration (approx. 1 year through part-time Continuing Education courses)

3) Post-Graduate Diploma in Design for Visual Communication at the London College of Communication in the UK (1 year full-time, but would cost approx 28k for tuition/living; would also be doing it for the experience of living in London though)


My questions are: 

Which program do you think would be the best choice to get an entry level position at this point? 

Is a certificate program enough to get you in the field (esp if I have a Visual Arts BA that helped me cover things like colour theory, composition, drawing skills) 

How important is the name/reputation of a school in the industry? (if I stay in Canada, I feel more inclined to go to OCAD over Humber based on the name, even though I prefer a faster full-time program)

Or do I just have to bite the bullet and return for a degree if this is the profession I want to be in?

PS. Some of you may suggest the self-taught route, but I do not do well with this. I really prefer to learn in a classroom at this point to move things along faster.


Thanks for any feedback!

Help?",wowzaome,LongDistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/1ju3gq/the_distance_between_my_so_21f_and_i_22m_is/,"Hi! So, my SO had an internship on the west coast this summer while I stayed on the east coast. We did much better than I was expecting us to do, and a lot of that is due to this lovely subreddit. (Thanks!) I've never been part of a LDR, and I was really anxious about it, but we did a great job, skyping nearly every day, texting often, emailing and exchanging letters. 

Now, she's back home in the same state. I'm thrilled. Ecstatic. So glad to have her closer. We're only an hour apart now, but our situation is a little different. Over the summer, we were both on our own friend-wise because we both moved to new cities, so we were talking for several hours a day. Now, she's back home with her friends (and mine), and I'm still by myself in an unfamiliar city waiting for my job to start. Even though the distance is smaller than the summer's, I feel further apart. 

I know how lonely she felt over the summer, and I want her to have time with her friends. I want her to have this without feeling guilty about me. I'll talk to her about how I feel in a week or so, once she's settled in, but in the meantime, I'd really like advice on distracting myself from texting or emailing her a lot. 

What do you do when you feel like you're talking to your SO too much?

1. Prospect: Extending internship with Company A, $24 an hour, 15 hours a week remotely from the comfort of my apartment
2. Prospect: Old IT job on campus with old boss, $10 an hour, 10-15 hours a week (Company B)
3. Solid OFFER: New job offer from Network Services on campus, $8.81 an hour, 10-15 hours a week (Company C)

Waiting to hear back on #1... this is my first choice because of pay. My direct manager said ""hopefully we'll hear something this week, but I can't do anything about it.""

Waiting to hear back on #2... old boss said they are ""balancing the budget"", but I know this is just him biding his time and dragging his feet. He said he would get back to me ""before the semester starts""... very vague timeline on this one.

Got an offer on #3... they need an answer TOMORROW... but this is my last resort job. 

I am waiting on a response about extending my internship through the school year. My direct manager has sent the request through, but apparently it is now up to management, and they seem to be taking their sweet time. My manager does not seem to understand the timeline I am working with, and he gets frustrated any time I bring it up. I told him I need to start making employment plans for the school year a while ago. His manager is speaking with management about it. When is it okay to sidestep my boss and go to his boss to attempt to convey urgency and tell her that I need to know ASAP so I can nail down employment for the school year? Is this going to be just an annoyance? Is it never okay to jump over my boss' head on an issue like this? 

What do I say to my old boss about #2? Can I push him in a nice way to hurry on an answer? 

On #3... do I just accept their offer on Wednesday if I haven't heard back from any of the others? Then I can just tell them, ""Sorry, this position isn't for me"" when/if another offer settles? Others have urged me to do this, but it's highly unprofessional to do.

Any help is appreciated. "

I've never done salary negotiation before and I'm not sure how having a second offer that the company knows all the details about would affect the salary negotiation.

Company A wants to give me a base salary of $90,000 with a company bonus that they say is usually around 20% but not guaranteed so they say this is basically like getting $108,000 (but it could be as low as 0%)

Company B wants to give me a base salary of $105,000.

I'd rather work for Company A. Company A already knows about the salary from Company B and they used that knowledge to decide on their own offer. They also use the average salary of new grads (but I have a lot of internship experience), the value of the company, and other salaries in that area to make this decision.

I feel uncomfortable choosing Company A with such a big difference in base salary but they seem like they'd be open to negotiation. What's a reasonable amount I should ask for from Company A so I can get the highest base salary that they're willing to give?"

-----------------------------------

I submitted a post about 5 months in r/politics regarding the onslaught of propaganda in the movie industry in 2013. It was after this that I began to delve deeper into much of the topics that are discussed on this forum, and I feel that the topic deserves a reprisal here. In my opinion, the realization that there is a propaganda effort in Hollywood solidifies many of the suspicions regarding the way in which this world is actually ran, namely, a centrally coordinated effort to influence the public's perceptions which is clearly integrated with the USA's military industrial complex (I know this isn't new).

Furthermore, If we look at the themes promoted in many of the trailers for these films, they coincide with the idea that the government is in the business of promoting fear, specifically based around the formulated fear of the boogie man terrorists that we are told are out to get us. 

Lastly, the sheer magnitude and repetition of themes might make you wonder what the motivation behind this propaganda is all about. Is it simply supposed to alter perceptions, or is this an example of the 'elites' revealing to the public they're intentions? Is it propaganda or suggestion, or both, or neither? 

Here is a list of the films that I noticed a few months ago, with notable features from the trailers in brackets next to the films. Whilst reading them, please be aware of the premise that this effort, taken as an aggregate, is intended to:

a) Remind people of the atrocity of 911 and terrorism to keep people supportive (through fear) of expansive military efforts.
b) Desensitize the public to violence and conflict, to perpetuate the attitude that 'this is the way things are'
c) Create an atmosphere of apparent turmoil and apocalypse.
d) Induce collective association to America, or patriotism.

I invite you to watch these trailers as a whole with the premise in mind. In my opinion, if these films aren't explicitly intended to achieve these aims, then it's a hell of a coincidence how well they coincide with an effective propaganda effort.

1jtmu4,1,2013-08-06,Didn't do a degree in Graphic Design but know this is what I want to pursue. What can I do now?,[deleted],graphic_design,https://www.reddit.com/r/graphic_design/comments/1jtmu4/didnt_do_a_degree_in_graphic_design_but_know_this/,"Okay, really stuck on a decision. Any feedback at all is greatly appreciated, especially if you are study/work in the field!

My dilemma: I have a BA in Visual Arts and English. After graduating, I knew that I wanted to pursue graphic design and illustration- both if I could. I took a few courses in both subject areas at a community college to test it out and loved it. I also have a certificate in publishing to try and get internships in the field. I've been looking into what my options are now. Most job postings in design seem to ask for a 3-4 degree/diploma. Is my only option to return for a second BA? I reallllly don't want to spend another 3-4 years on school at this point. I've looked into a few options and here's what I've been trying to choose between:

* 1) Graphic Design Certificate- Print &amp; Web Design at Humber College (6 months full-time) 
* 2) Digital Media Certificate at OCAD University with specialization in Graphic Design and Illustration (approx. 1 year through part-time Continuing Education courses) 
* 3) Post-Graduate Diploma in Design for Visual Communication at the London College of Communication in the UK (1 year full-time, but would cost approx 28k for tuition/living; would also be doing it for the experience of living in London though)

My questions are: 
* Which program do you think would be the best choice to get an entry level position at this point? 
* Is a certificate program enough to get you in the field (esp if I have a Visual Arts BA that helped me cover things like colour theory, composition, drawing skills) 
* How important is the name/reputation of a school in the industry? (if I stay in Canada, I feel more inclined to go to OCAD over Humber based on the name, even though I prefer a faster full-time program) 
* item 4 Or do I just have to bite the bullet and return for a degree if this is the profession I want to be in?

PS. Some of you may suggest the self-taught route, but I do not do well with this. I really prefer to learn in a classroom at this point to move things along faster.

1jt6ka,51,2013-08-06,"Terrible experience with a recruiter. How serious can they be when they say ""You'll never work again!""?",mintdilly,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1jt6ka/terrible_experience_with_a_recruiter_how_serious/,"So, long story short, was on a contract to hire, company came in very low on salary, got a call from a recruiting firm I've never heard of talking about a position that paid a significant amount more. Had one phone interview with their client and they loved me, wanted to bring me on board. Went in at met them, seemed decent enough, told them I'd like to start. 


So, they insist that I start in EXACTLY two weeks, no more. I'm working on a BRAND new project in my current role, and I have two interns until the 16th, so I told them I'd like to stay here until the 16th, which would have been three weeks. Absolutely not. ""The client doesn't want to push the project back another week"". I end up having this back and forth three times with three different people at the recruiting firm. So, I'm in a moral quandary; do I not accept this position and just stay at the current employer until I can find something else or do I screw my current employer (which honestly has been GREAT, close to perfect) and just take the job with the new place on the date they insist on?

I actually choose option C: get on the phone with a buddy of mine and get hired at a THIRD job the same day.

So, anyway, I emailed the recruiters yesterday, told them ""hey thanks, but I can't start on that day, and I don't want to work anywhere where they won't allow me to gracefully leave a current employer. Good luck with the search.""

My phone instantly started ringing off the hook.

Long and the short of it: talked to some director this morning, he told me that he never asked the client about the start date, and if they knew it was a big deal, they would have made it happen. I told them that I don't like being lied to, and I'm not coming to work there.

He lays into me: you're lazy, you're a child, you're not acting professional, you'll never work again.

I mean...I'll clearly work again, I can get a job almost at will. But can this unstable fellow actually DO anything? I mean, outside his scumbag company?

tl;dr:
Didn't start new position; couldn't agree on start date. Butthurt recruiter tells me I'm a child that will never work again. 

UPDATE:

So, this morning, another recruiter from another company contacted me about the SAME position. HA!"

I'm still struggling especially on the work front, but things are starting to look up. Would have never guessed it when I was at my worst."

I moved solely to maintain residency in order to save money when I transfer to the University of Missouri next Fall, and also to experience a new chapter in my life which involves basically resetting everything. Unfortunately, this means I had no job before moving here. I tried, and I tried, but nothing came up, and nothing has yet. 

I spent two years in customer service, working in fast food and got to experience a heap of knowledge from that. While finishing up my first year of college in May 2012, I worked as a Copy Editor on my college's newspaper. Shortly after the semester ended, I started an internship at my local NBC affiliate, to which I was hired as an editor before the internship finished. As editor, I was responsible for editing any local and national video that went to air. An easy job, but very fun. 

I work well the public, with my co-workers, carry a heavy knowledge in computer programs, am respectable and *very* ready to work. I'm really looking for anything that can pay more than minimum wage and work around a full-time college student.

I am about to finish my double major in CS and CE at a state University. I have worked as a professional web developer and I am currently finishing up an internship at Intel as a Software Engineering Intern. Though, I am in no way confident I could pass a Google coding interview. I know it's grueling. I have done similarly hard interviews with Microsoft and Amazon got fair but no cake. (it was a lie). This is the source of much turmoil in my life right now. I don't want to feel subpar at what I do for a living.
I have tried to prepare, honestly. I pick up my copy of Cracking the Code (which you should get a copy of if you don't have one) but I just can't sit and study like that. It's dismal. I feel no excitement in just reading solutions. I want to build cool shit, fun shit, not reimplement data structures then analyze it's BigOh complexity. That's been done millions of times. I was wondering if anybody had a fun way to prepare for this type of interview. I guess I am looking for some type of challenge or community where I can solve interview style questions and have people tell me how stupid or awesome I am.....probably stupid at least at first. Sort of like a Sudoku a day type thing. Anybody have any resources? If you want to see some of what I have done in the past check out my GitHub (follow me plz...) https://github.com/SeanDunford
TLDR: I am an alright programmer. Are there any fun resources to become good enough to pass a Google coding interview."
1jskzf,21,2013-08-06,I'm aiming for a summer 2014 internship in Seattle or the SF Bay area. I don't have a lot of programming experience. Is it doable?,criticalhit,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1jskzf/im_aiming_for_a_summer_2014_internship_in_seattle/,"You might have seen me before. I'm Canadian, headed to Simon Fraser University in Vancouver in January. At my local CC I hope to be taking an introduction to CS class suitable for engineers (which is two semesters in one). I have taken programming courses in the past but my programming experience is very low.

I'm a few semesters out of co-op, and the pay around here is a pittance. So, I'm strongly considering going south next summer for an internship.

Starting this month, I want to do some intensive programming on my own. I hope to get some small! independent projects up on a Github within the next 5-6 months.

Which language? Well, the course will use C++, so this a short list of my considerations:

* One webdev language-Python sounds right, plus HTML/CSS.
* One ""traditional"" language-I've programmed in Java before so it's easy to pick up. I can code stand-alone projects (Tic-tac-toe?). Or, I can stick with C++ and go beyond what is in the coursework.
* One backend language-probably Django, Drupal or both.

Other considerations include JS and jQuery. I also want to try my hand at Wordpress sites. This whole thing will be in a 9-10 month period.

To ensure I don't put too much on my plate, I will try a piecemeal approach. For example, one day, I'll do some programming in C++, and the next in Python.

My goal is to get lots of projects in my portfolio by May, maybe April if that's too late, and start applying for internships. What do you think-is this doable?

First, let me say I think you're all fucking awesome for even considering to persevere against such urges.  I've been skimming this page before I jerk off for over a year now, and it's always uplifting to see people make such leaps and bounds.

Here's my story:

I have a great life.  I'm finishing up an internship I love, I have a gorgeous girlfriend, and I'm in college.  I've also been a professional fapper for 9 years as of TODAY.  But an examination of my life up til now will demonstrate how it's taken its toll.

RIght before I started fapping I'd get these vicious little boners that I'd simply, confusedly ignore and go on my merry way.  I was actually a pretty promising 6th grader - very social, very athletic.  Then, the summer before middle school, I started.  And looking (way) back, I changed for the worse.

Girls, all of a sudden, became terrifying.  I wasn't as good at doing math in my head as I had been.  I became this socially awkward geek.  Everything was sort of a daze.

I learned to adjust to this new way of living throughout middle school and going into high school.  Still managed to be a straight A student.  I maintained a degree of social awkwardness into college and today I still have instances of social anxiety - I'd rather walk the long way around an academic building just to avoid saying hi to someone I sort of know. So yeah, the fapping is most likely the cause of this.

My girlfriend is awesome - truly beautiful, brilliant, and loves me.  She's absolutely everything I could ever want in a girl.  But, intimately, I've always felt slightly hesitant (sex life is still fine - I just keep this strange wall up).  My brain can't understand why - she's gorgeous.  But part of me is so used to fetish porn and gets off on that.  I honestly think it affects how I see her both sexually and as a lover... any of you have the same situation?  It seriously freaks me out.

So, I'm turning over a new leaf as of today.  The 9 year phase of my life is ended.  I've tried and relapsed before, but why not make it an even 9 years?  Wow, it actually feels good to articulate these feelings - never have.

I'm doing this primarily for myself - again, I'm a relatively normal guy, but what if I can become that much more outgoing, sharp, physically active, etc?  But I'm also doing it for my girlfriend - I'm really hoping this dissonance, this distantness is a result of the fapping (PLEASE LET ME KNOW IF YOU'VE BEEN IN THE SAME SITUATION BECAUSE IT'S TERRIFYING ME).

Thank you all for serving as inspiration to do this.  If anyone is looking for an accountability partner, I am your man.

Cheers."
1jsire,0,2013-08-06,"I [24/m] was planning on telling ""the one that got away"" [23/f] how I feel. But it turns out she's involved with another guy. What to do?",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1jsire/i_24m_was_planning_on_telling_the_one_that_got/,"Maybe the obvious answer is to ""do nothing and get over her."" But let me explain. We dated for 3 years at the beginning of college. Things were great. I truly loved her, and she was the only thing that mattered in my life. As our relationship went from counting it in ""months"" to ""years"", I often wondered if she was the one I'd end up marrying.

But it didn't turn out that way. As we navigated our way through college, we fell out of our groove. I was stressed with classes and unhappy with my friend situation, and I relied heavily on her for emotional support. At the same time, she seemed more interested in partying than investing in the relationship. There was no huge falling out. I was heartbroken, but the breakup kind of happened naturally. Things just weren't working, and there didn't seem to be another choice.

Since then, we've stayed in touch. It's already been 3 years since we broke up, but we still talk. We have a lot of mutual friends, so we used to run into each other a lot. We've gotten lunch a few times to catch up. And we're generally happy to hear from each other. But as time has gone on, I started to realize that nobody really measured up to her. I've been in a couple other relationships, as well as a few flings with girls, but nobody I met has compared. When I catch myself daydreaming, I find myself thinking of her. When I imagine the type of girl I want to marry, this girl has so many of those qualities. When we were together, everything just felt right.

I haven't seen her in about a year. She lived abroad for a year while she completed an internship, but we traded emails a few times just to stay in touch. And she finally returned home a few weeks ago. I haven't seen her yet, but my plan was to finally tell her how I felt. Even if it was just to get it off my chest and be able to move on. But I just found out one problem: she has a boyfriend.

Maybe if I had paid more attention to her Facebook activity, it would have been obvious. But she met someone while living in Europe, and it seems they've been together for 6 months or so. Not only that, but he's back in the US with her now, which I'm assuming means that it's pretty serious. And now I don't know what to do. I feel like anything I was planning on telling her is going to fall on deaf ears. Even when I was in a relationship that wasn't so great, I had no interest in other girls. So even if she still harbors feelings for me, I suspect she won't reciprocate as long as she's in this relationship.

So what do I do? Do I go through with it, even though it's unlikely to change anything, just to get it over with? Or do I try to wait out this current relationship of hers, and wait for the ""perfect moment""? My only worry is that I haven't a way to say it since we broke up, maybe there won't ever be that perfect opportunity.

**TL;DR:** Dated a girl for 3 years. She was the best thing in my life during that time, and I often regret that things ended between us. After all this time, I finally decided to tell her how I feel, but I just found out that she's seeing someone. Is it even worth going through with anymore? "

Laurie:  Introducing first, from our nation's capitol, Washington D.C., Santa WITH Muscles himself, HANDsome JAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMES  HARshhhhhhhAW!

James Harshaw comes out to the delight of the female portion of the audience.

Andrews:  James Harshaw has been here a long time and I am always happy to see how fully the fans have accepted him.

Slam:  Yeah, well, we'll see how long he lasts without Sister Mary backing him.

Andrews:  In a cynical mood tonight are we?

Slam:  Local liquor store was out of vodka, said a scary butler bought them out and I get cranky without my breakfast Bloody Mary.

*Battle Royale- The World Alive cuts through and out walk the Blaade Brothers.*

Laurie:  Introducing now, accompanied by his brother William, he is one half of the Tag Team Champions, and hails from Nashville, Tennessee, he is CoooooooooooREEEEEEEEEEEEEEY  BLAAAAADE!

*Both Blaades walk down wearing their masks, tag team belts glistening underneath their hooded cloaks, at the steps Corey ascends removes his belt and hands it to William, before ripping his mask from his face with a satisfied howl.*

Andrews:  I can't believe these guys are our Tag Champs now.

Slam:  You're telling me?  It seems our little fed has not only made compelling television at Gold Rush but also stirred up international controversy.  You heard that Human Resources director Anton Sykes has fled to King Lightbody's Argentina.

Andrews:  I did.  It still amazes me that he was a mole for the Congregation for all this time.

*Corey barely has time to finish removing his cloak before Harshaw is on him, hammering him with heavy shots over the ropes and then grabbing an arm and yanking him over and onto his back in the center of the ring.*

Slam:  Harshaw is out for blood!

Andrews:  Could this all be because Corey is claiming to have a relationship with Sister Mary?

Slam:  And I always thought I'd have a shot after Jimmy over there.

Andrews:  Really?

*The ref finally calls for the bell as Harshaw continues to hammer over Corey, with William on the outside slamming on the mat.  Corey finally manages to roll away from Harshaw and out towards his brother Harshaw hesitates to follow, seeing the potential two on one.*

Andrew:  Corey Blaade needs a breather already?

Slam:  The way Harshaw  was all over him, I'd say it was the right move.

*Harshaw hits the opposite ropes running and nails both Blaades with a suicide dive through the ropes, all three men falling into a heap.*

Andrews:  Good God!  That was a tremendous Suicide Dive!

Slam:  Harshaw reaching back to his eXtreme Champion days for that.  He really wants to put Corey down!

*Harshaw gets up slowly clearly rattled for his high risk move, reaches down and drags Corey to his feet, he goes to Irish whip the Blaade into the stairs but Corey reverses the move sending Harshaw into and over the stairs leaving him on the other side holding his knee and writhing in pain.*

Andrews:  Quick thinking by Corey Blaade.

Slam:  More like a desperation move, look at Corey he's still catching his breath.

*Corey walks over and start putting the boots to Harshaw, before looking up and realizing the ref has been counting, he rolls in for a second to break he count and speak to the ref, and as Harshaw is getting to one knee he is met by a running boot to the head.*

Crowd:  OOOOh!

Andrews:  That was a vicious and underhanded move by William!

Slam:  I don;t like it, but I won't say I wouldn't have done it myself.

Andrews:  Tonight I'm Googling your matches just to see if you really were that underhanded.

*The ref turns at the sound from the crowd but William is already on the other side of the ring non-nonchalantly examining the tag belts and Corey slides out to drag Harshaw back into the ring, Harshaw is fighting to get up.  Corey stands over Harshaw waits for him to get on all fours before measuring and dropping an elbow, then waits and measures another.  Finally he reaches down and gets Harshaw to his feet, jumping up for a frankensteiner but Harshaw sits out and drives him into the mat with a powerbomb.*

Andrews:  What a move by James Harshaw!

Slam:  Do my eyes deceive me?  Look at the top of the ramp.

*Atop the entrance ramp Sister Mary Elizabeth stands watching the match in rapt attention.*

Andrews:  That's Sister Mary!

Slam:  But who is she here to watch?

*Corey and Harshaw both struggle to get up as the ref's count hits 5, both men leaning against the ropes, Harshaw reaches out and sends Corey into the corner following him with an splash and then goes for a knife edged chop that Corey ducks switching places with Harshaw and hitting him with a knife edged chop of his own.*

Crowd:  Wooo!

*A second chop.*

Crowd:  Woooo!

*Corey rears back for another chop when suddenly Harshaw explodes from the corner with a clothesline that flips Corey end over end, at the top of the ramp Sister Mary stands with both hands over her mouth.*

Slam:  Do you think she's more concerned with Cory nearly getting his head taken off there or is she just cheering James on?

Andrews:  I wouldn't even venture a guess.

*Harshaw lines Corey up and hits him with a fist drop that would've made Jerry Lawler proud, Corey rolls onto all fours and punches Harshaw in the gut as he steps over to pick him up, and the two start trading shots, Harshw easily taking control, until Corey goes for a kick that Harshaw catches and is promptly laid out by an enziguri.*

Andrews:  These two are very evenly matched.

Slam:  But are they evenly matched in the bedroom?  'Cause I bet that's all Sister Mary cares about.

Andrews:  You really are a pig.

Slam:  Snort snort, buddy.

*Seeing that Harshaw is down Corey gets up and runs over to the corner spingboarding from the second rope to the top into a picture perfect moonsault.  At the last second Harshaw draws his knees up and Corey crashes and burns.  Harsahw leans down to grab Corey's leg and William hops up but Harshaw runs over hitting him hard enough to send him ribs first into the steel barricade.  Running back to Corey he again grabs the leg and sits back far.*

Andrews:  Single leg Boston Crab applied by James Harshaw.

Slam:  Painful move, and he's in the center of the ring nowhere to go,and his brother's down, doesn't look good for our new Tag champ.

*Corey valiantly drags himself towards the ropes but taps out mere inches away.  The ref signals for the bell and Sister Mary walks backstage, seeing her for the first time, Harshaw sprints after her not even allowing the ref to raise his hand.*

Laurie:  And the winner of this match as a result of a submission, Handsome JAMES HAAARSHAW!

Andrews:  Hard fought victory by James Harshaw.

Slam:  Clearly the victory was good, but he's chasing his real prize right now.

**COMMERCIAL**

Andrews: This next match-up looks quite promising. HVX intern James Lafontaine, fresh off an impressive showing in the War Games match at RWF Gold Rush, will be taking on Rickey Cortez!

Slam: Yeah, ‘Mr. PG’ himself. Hot diggity dog. Isn’t this the same guy who fought Chris Hardcore in the Hell on Earth match?

Andrews: Well, after the horror show that turned out to be, Rickey Cortez has gone back to basics, using his given name and shedding the negative image of his ‘Ricardio’ gimmick. I, for one, am excited to see a young performer with this level of talent coming out and standing up for the principles of fairness, sportsmanship, and competition that make this industry great!

Slam: Yeah, but what about the violence? That’s what we want! War Games! Hell on Earth! Chairs! Tables! Glass shards glued to fists and big bags of nails!

Andrews: Are you serious, Rodney? How many injuries should there be, how many careers have to end early to satisfy the bloodthirsty fans? Troy Stone still has cage-marks on his face! Rickey Cortez himself was put out of action for months following an unnecessary, tasteless, and completely gratuitous so-called ‘match’!

Laurie: The following contest is scheduled for one fall! Introducing first, making his return to the RWF and now competing under his real name, ‘Mr. Pg’, Rickeeeeyyyyyyy Corteeeeezzzz!

*Kevin Rudolf – Let it Rock kicks in and the crowd give a decidedly mixed reaction to Rickey Cortez, as he walks down the ramp through a shower of pyrotechinics. He nods to the crowd on either side and climbs into the ring where he shakes himself loose in the corner*

Laurie: And his opponent, from New Haven, Connecticut, the Brutal Blueblood, Jaaaaaames Laaaaafontaaaaaaiine!

* Muse - Citizen Erased heralds the arrival of James Lafontaine, who comes down the rampway with a stoic look on his face. At the bottom of the ramp, Lafontaine bows to the crowd on each side, then bows his head to his opponent as well, with only the slightest of smirks on his lips*

*DINGDINGDING*

*The bell clangs and Rickey Cortez and James Lafontaine step to meet each other in the center of the ring. Cortez extends a hand, and Lafontaine stares at him for a moment before obliging him. They shake, but Lafontaine grips Cortez’s hand tightly and pulls him in to a mean headbutt! Cortez staggers and Lafontaine quickly slips on a side headlock, popping his hip and completing a takeover, now leaning his weight on Rockey Cortez as he continues the headlock on the mat*

Andrews: That was a cheap shot!

Slam: That’s where your sportsmanship will get you, John. Lafontaine learned his lesson.

*Lafontaine arches his back to increase the pressure, but Cortez smartly snakes out a hand and grabs Lafontaine’s ankle, pulling it in close and costing James his balance in the process. Cortez gets his knees under him and pushes Lafontaine’s arms away, sweeping out his other foot and leaving James Lafontaine seated on the mat. Rickey slips behind him and delivers a crushing forearm to the temple, then a knee to the back followed by a Johnny Weaver-esque Sleeper Hold!*

Andrews: Impressive technical acumen from Cortez, turning the tables on his opponent.

Slam: Both of these guys can wrestle. What I want to know is, can Rickey Cortez fight?

*James struggles, trying and failing to dislodge the grip of Rickey Cortez. Feeling his strength, and more importantly his breath, leaving his body slowly, Lafontaine gets his legs under him and grabs onto Rickey’s head, bucking forward and flipping Cortez forward, where he lands on his back. Lafontaine takes a second to get to the ropes and catch a breath as Cortez gets to his feet. The two meet in mid-ring again and immediately go for a collar-and-elbow tie-up. They jockey for position, shoving each other back and forth, until Cortez maneuvers behind Lafontaine and gets him in a Rear Waistlock. He goes for a German Suplex, but James hooks his leg around Cortez’s, blocking the move, and throws a swift elbow to Rickey’s gut to shake him off. He turns around and grabs Rickey’s wrist, sending him across the ring with an Irish Whip. As he rebounds, Lafontaine readies himself for a Back Body Drop, but Cortez stops short and counters with a snap kick to the shoulder! Lafontaine stumbles back from the impact, and Rickey Cortez wraps him up and lifts, planting James Lafontaine with a Fisherman’s DDT!*

Andrews: And Mr. PG nails the Blueblood with the Fisherman’s DDT! A devastating maneuver from the reborn Rickey Cortez!

*Cortez rolls James over with a collegiate-style pin, but Lafontaine gets his shoulder up at two. Cortez backs off and allows Lafontaine to get to his feet without protest, but charges him immediately once he’s upright again. Lafontaine counters quickly with a Drop Toe Hold then jumps up for a big elbow drop, but Cortez rolls out of the way at the last second and Lafontaine hits the bare mat. Cortez goes for a clothesline on Lafontaine, who ducks under and gets behind, slapping the Cobra Clutch on Rickey expertly! Cortez swings his free arm around, but he can’t find a target, and now Lafontaine is wearing his down again*

Slam: That’s a nasty hold! Mr. PG might have some censorable words after this match, if he can stay conscious!

Andrews: I didn’t hear a bell yet, Rodney.

*Cortez is struggling to loosen the grip of Lafontaine but is getting nowhere fast. His face turning redder by the moment and his strength dwindling without oxygen, Cortez’s eyes light up and he begins dragging himself, one laborious step at a time, to the corner. Lafontaine fights him, tightening the hold as best he can and keeping Cortez’s free arm out of range of the ropes, but Cortez isn’t looking for that after all! He lunges forward, finally close enough to run up the turnbuckles and flip over, Shiranui-style, bringing Lafontaine down with him! The hold is broken and both men are one the mat*

Slam: I don’t know who got the worst of that, but it looks to me like this Cortez kid is done for! Lafontaine is already half-way up!

Andrews: It was a big risk to take, but Rickey Cortez displayed some admirable innovation and tenacity with that counter! The Cobra Clutch could have ended things already if he hadn’t tried.

*In the ring, Cortez is just reaching a knee as Lafontaine is up again, breathing heavily and rubbing his neck. He advances on Cortez, kicking him in the side which sends him staggering to the ropes. Cortez is barely holding himself up, and Lafontaine is relentless as he charges in for a big knee strike. Somehow, someway Rickey Cortez dodges, and James gets his leg tangled in the rope! Distracted as he tries to free himself, Lafontaine is taken by surprise when Rickey Cortez goozles him and lifts him up, spinning in a half-circle to bring him down mid-ring with a Chokeslam out of nowhere! He hits the lateral press and the ref drops and slaps the mat, once, twice, thrice!*

*DINGDINGDING*

Laurie: Here is your winner, Rickeeyyyyy Corrrrrrteeeezz!

Andrews: What a showing from Rickey Cortez here tonight!

Slam: Bah, he’s just lucky Lafontaine was still so banged up from War Games. When you’re a *real* wrestler, sometimes you take your lumps and you keep on working. Guys like Cortez have an advantage. They don’t take part in the hardcore stuff, so they’re fresher and healthier more often than not.

Andrews: And it’s unfair for them to maintain a safe working environment out of concern for themselves and their families? And for the example they set for the RWF Universe?

Slam: Example? They beat each other up for money! Be it with a leg drop or a staplegun, it’s still the same in the end. If the fans want blood, we give them blood! 

Andrews: This is not the time or the place for this debate. What it is time for is our main event, as Roy Firestone takes on Joey Knight, right here live on Battleground just after this!

I'm currently 16 years old, entering into my Junior year of high school, with the classes necessary to get the credits required for graduation an entire year early. I'm currently set on going to DeVry University for a bachelor's degree in Game Simulation Programming which, with the schedule I am going to be on, I will be getting when I am 19/20. I have a year left of high school, and I need to know what I should be focusing on.

My current abilities are: seemingly good with C++, I can write code, debug, have good syntax recognition, practice good programming techniques including encapsulation, polymorphism, avoiding the ""deadly diamond inheritance tree"", a solid understanding of finite state machine prototype, and the openness to study and learn more and more every day. I currently am working on reading through the MaNGOS script files, learning everything I can along the way. With higher level scripting languages, I am fairly decent with Python and Lua, however I haven't used many others. I am currently working on a game based off of the Löve 2D framework, and have made some simple text based games with Python, but nothing too complex. I have looked into C#, but syntactically need improvement. I have worked in vJass, the programming language extension for JASS, the script language for Blizzard Entertainent's ""Warcraft III: The Frozen Throne"". I have a strong, natural understanding of basic to adept OOP concepts and apply them to my work, however higher end subjects are not known to me, I have tried to find resources for them but it is difficult. I have used some HTML, CSS, and Javascript, as well as PHP, but will still need to get myself comfortable with the styling.

My current questions are really basic but somewhat difficult at the same time. 

I feel confident in my school choice, as it was either DeVry or Community college, but is it a good school? Does anyone know a lot about it? I've been trying to gather as much information as possible and already am in contact with a counselor at the school.  

What should I be doing to prepare myself for college/ computer classes like this? Should I be brushing up on my skills in C++? Learning more languages? Learning Java? Making simple applications and polishing them to hell?

How do I go about portfolio building? Should I be starting now? What would be an acceptable project to put on my portfolio and what is the best medium for it (website, PDF, docs other).

As I will be commuting going to campus, should my home setup be somewhat more modern? My current computer is 4 years old and I am currently working on making 2 external monitors. 

As a game developer, what types of internships should I be looking at if any? Is working at a technology store going to be beneficial to my resume or does it not matter where/if I have a part-time job? Would making games/apps for sale to make some revenue be hurtful to my chances of being hired in the future or beneficial? Would it be worth doing? Would it be better to release freeware and open source projects? 

TL;DR What do I really need to do to prepare myself for college, I have a year so I'm not pressuring myself, but I want to be ready, and I am still programming for many projects in my spare time for fun. I enjoy programming in any language and I am always willing to change what I'm doing or learn more if it will end up helping me in the long run."

Late at night, want to go to bed?  Fap.  Just got back from a night out and didn't have much luck?  Fap.  It was borderline instinctual.  It got so bad that the type of porn I would look at wouldn't always be..conventional.  A few months ago, I started realizing exactly how it was making me feel.  If I fapped with porn, I felt somewhat guilty and drained.  Without porn - not as bad.  But I still felt drained.  In the last few months it's been a habit to fap before getting out of bed in the morning.  I couldn't help it.  My imagination would run wild and I would completely give in.  And I didn't realize it, but doing that would drain me for the rest of the day.  I knew I was an extremely horny individual, but that morning fap took it all out of me.  I was yearning for that sexual gut feeling when I saw a pretty girl but it wouldn't come.  So my motivation was lacking as well.  So one day I was about to start my morning fap and I said no - this is ending right now.  And that was the start of a crazy week.

It's hard to remember all that happened, but I will summarize it the best I can.

Day 1-3.  Feeling a bit ""spunky.""  I had a little more energy.  I felt a little more confident.  I used the energy to go to the gym and lift just a little bit heavier.  That circulated the hormones a bit.  Which didn't help.  After the gym I felt like a raging beast.  Even 2 days in I could barely hold myself.  Every 5 minutes my brain would start daydreaming some elaborate fantasy involving me seducing the opposite sex.  I would detect this and force myself think about something else.  That worked, for now.  If this is what happens after just a couple days, holy crap.

Day 4-5.  I've sort of ""gotten used to"" forcing myself to stop thinking sexual thoughts.  But it's a constant battle.  I am feeling strong.  I've had more energy in the gym and my muscles pumps are getting bigger.  Just looking at myself in the mirror makes my brain start another sexual fantasy.  I know I'm weird, shut up.  The girl interns at my office are starting to actually look sexy.  My posture is improving because I am so focused on it since it is so easy all of a sudden.  It feels like I am living in another world.  My brain feels like it is in a haze of confident bliss.  The thought of approaching a girl isn't so scary anymore.  In fact it's getting me excited.  Holy crap stop thinking about it or you will relapse!

Day 6-10.  On the 6th day I looked at some questionable things on the internet.  My old habit took over for a minute.  But I didn't let myself edge.  I stopped and put the computer away.  I was panting.  Out of breath.  Sweating.  Extremely horny.  It felt sooo good yet it was terrible since I didn't have any outlet.  Weed helped, for a minute.  It was hard to concentrate at work the next couple days.  But somehow I pulled through it.  The weekend was approaching, and I knew that if I didn't get some relief before the weekend was over I wouldn't survive.  The 9th day I sat in a long training session at work but my mind was elsewhere thinking about one of the girl interns.  After the class I went up to her and we talked for a while and I got her number.  That was a HUGE leap for me.  My old self would have NEVER done that.  And my super focused self acually payed attention to her body language.  She actually kind of likes me!  My old self would've stared at the floor.  I never would've known.  And that night I went to a house party.  And to my amazement, I was happily talking to a few girls there for what seemed like hours.  I was watching other guys stand on the edge of the party by themselves, drink in hand.  I knew that used to be me.  But my brain was on a totally different level.  I was at the top of the world.  I got another number from a girl.  But no action, sadly.  In hindsight I could've gotten laid with her.  But that was the closest I'd gotten in YEARS.  It feels great, believe me.  And the next day I relapsed.  Without porn.  My brain got the best of me.  I needed it though...I had a constant hard-on at that point.  I was so backed up it hurt.  And now I am back to day 2.  But my perspective is different.  Looking forward to breaking this record for myself.  And another exciting week!

It's amazing how powerful the human mind is.  If I made it so far after trying it just this once, imagine how much I can accomplish the second time.  And the third.  The possibilities are endless.  And being disciplined is easier said than done.  But it's worth it."
1js23c,1,2013-08-05,In Which I Stand Up for Feminism,[deleted],talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/1js23c/in_which_i_stand_up_for_feminism/,"Male, late 20s sysadmin here.  Today my team moved into a new office location, and I was helping to get everything set up.  Included in this effort was a middle age manager, an early 20 something female intern, and two people from the IT move team.  It's a very large company so I had never met either of the move team folks before, but these two happened to be a middle age Hispanic man and a young Hispanic woman.

We had all been working for an hour or two at getting things unpacked - manager and I were mainly running about pointing where things go, and the move team was doing most of the lifting and plugging in cables.  When it we got to a lull in the work, the intern and I took our leave to go check on some work going on elsewhere, and the following conversation ensued:

Intern - I can't believe they had her doing all that lifting.

Me - Hunh?

Intern - The move girl, she was having to lift all those monitors and workstations onto tables - she's so tiny! (she was small - perhaps 5'2"" and 120 lbs? - 157 cm, 54.5 kg)

Me - So?  That's her job - setting up IT equipment.

Intern - But there were some big monitors in there that had to have been kind of heavy, why do they make her do all of that!

Me - ... because it's her job - she signed up for it, she seemed perfectly capable of doing it, if she needed help there was another person there to help.

Intern - Well, why didn't you help?

Me - I was helping, I was coordinating where things went.

Intern - But she's so tiny, and looked so young.

Me - I'm not about to tell someone to not do the job they were hired to do.  If she was treating my equipment badly or acting unsafely I'd stop her, but until that point in time, I'm going to assume she's a competent worker and perfectly capable of lifting a 25 lb monitor and a 30 lb workstation.  The fact that she's small and female doesn't matter to me in the slightest.  We got the heavy lifting guys with carts in to move the big tables.  Other than that, leave her to do her job.

Intern - ... ok.

And there you have it folks.  I made my stand for my female colleagues out there because frankly I don't give a damn what's in your underwear (or the color of your skin, or what's in the underwear of your preferred partners, or really anything else, with only a preference that I can understand your English, otherwise it's difficult to work with you) - if you do your job well, I'll continue to do my job well, and we'll all go home respected and happy."

I am about to finish my double major in CS and CE at a state University. I have worked as a professional web developer and I am currently finishing up an internship at Intel as a Software Engineering Intern. Though, I am in no way confident I could pass a Google coding interview. I know it's grueling. I have done similarly hard interviews with Microsoft and Amazon got fair but no cake. (it was a lie). This is the source of much turmoil in my life right now. I don't want to feel subpar at what I do for a living.

 I have tried to prepare, honestly. I pick up my copy of Cracking the Code (which you should get a copy of if you don't have one) but I just can't sit and study like that. It's dismal. I feel no excitement in just reading solutions. I want to build cool shit, fun shit, not reimplement  data structures then analyze it's BigOh complexity. That's been done millions of times.

&lt;I think what I mean here is I see little incentive to redo a problem from a book when I can look it up. I would like a more interesting approach that allows me to see the value. Or possibly an approach with feed back where creating a custom solution makes sense because people can inform me what I am doing wrong and why. I think they have a training package on Cracking the Code website but I am not willing to spend all that money for that.&gt; 

 I was wondering if anybody had a fun way to prepare for this type of interview. I guess I am looking for some type of challenge or community where I can solve interview style questions and have people tell me how stupid or awesome I am.....probably stupid at least at first. Sort of like a Sudoku a day type thing. Anybody have any resources? If you want to see some of what I have done in the past check out my GitHub (follow me plz...) https://github.com/SeanDunford

TLDR: I am an alright programmer. Are there any fun resources to become good enough to pass a Google coding interview. 


&lt;EDIT&gt;: People were misunderstanding me. I know that Big-Oh is good, cool, awesome, need to know it. I know data structures are the toolbelt to every great programmer. I want to gain knowledge of this but I can't really read and regurgitate. So what are some more interesting ways to learn them. 

&lt;Edit&gt;: /r/dailyprogrammer seems to be a great resource for what I am trying to achieve. I think exercism.io might have something similar as well. Thanks for all the responses please keep them going.  

&lt;Edit&gt; TIL: No matter what my approach is it's probably not going to be fun. So I should suck it up and stop being a baby. There are some challenge websites namely USACO, Euler, and more that can help. My Git profile is a steaming pile of shit. Thanks. It is Kind of weird how you can gain a lot of introspection looking outward. "

1jx3so,3,2013-08-07,Me[19M] and my [18F] GF of 3 months are going to be 5 hours apart due to college.,ruffthere95,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1jx3so/me19m_and_my_18f_gf_of_3_months_are_going_to_be_5/,"We have been going out for 3 months this summer and having a great time. We really care about each other and think the world of each other. Our relationship seems to just keep growing and growing and now it's going to be cut short by college, or is it? Do you guys think it could work or recommend going for it or is it not worth it? 

Regardless we have agreed to stay in touch and be friends througout college because we both have the same end-game city and plan for life, just to keep our options open down the road if we live in the same city it could rekindle. The other option would be to try the LDR which would be about 5 hours.

 I think we're both down but a little worried our relationship would just fizzle out and we would also lose that friendship then too because we would only have known each other romantically. I have classes until 1 pm on Friday's so I could get up by 7 or 8 Friday night and then be with her for the weekend and then come back Sunday night or early monday morning before my 11 o'clock class. In the breaks we would also see each other and I would try to get a summer internship in her city, because that's my favorite city in the world and I want to live there for the rest of my life; as does she. 

I really care about her and want her in my life, preferably romantically but we also get along great as friends as well!!! We could try the friend route for college, see other people, and then see where we are after college and if things align, give it another go. I'm just worried though that if we try this, she'll find a boyfriend, and stop contacting me after awhile because I'll just be some old ex from a different city and I really want her in my life because she is the coolest funniest person I know. 

I also don't want to lose her because of a strained LDR. Which route do you think I should go? Also, ask me any questions if you need more clarification about anything.

---

TL;DR: Should I give this LDR a go or go the friend route? And should I realistically expect to be friends with her if she meets someone else in that time?"

I f(21) have been with my bf(21) for almost 2 years now. We are both college students for and we met at school. Me and him seem like the perfect couple on the outside but for the past month and a half I can say that my willingness to be in this relationship has been dropping steadily.

I am a very ambitious person and excel in my studies and am really involved in forming a successful career path for myself with volunteer work and internships. He on the other hand barely passes his classes and always complains that our friends are doing more than him and he feels like he waited too long to start but yet does nothing about it. He always complains about being broke but never gives any effort to even apply to jobs. This is a huge turn off to me because I want someone who can keep up with me and not see as someone who will hold me back. He is always going on and on about how unhappy he is with his life but yet never does anything to change it. His constant Debbie downer attitude exhausts me and I feel like I constantly have to give him pep talks but its all a waste of my time because they fall on deaf ears. He just seems to have serious self esteem issues and I want to help him get there and have been trying for a really long time but to quote Katt Williams ""it's called SELF esteem"" and I'm tired of being his crutch.

That being said I'm afraid to leave because he seems to be depressed sometimes and not to toot my own horn but he always says that I'm the only good thing in his life and I wonder what my absence would do to him.

When it comes to our sex life I'm also equally disappointed. He barely ever has sex with me and when he does it is because I initiated it and he does the same thing each time. If it was up to him he would have sex twice a month maybe. I have confronted him about the lack of intimacy so many times but he says that he is just not that much of a sexual person and that he never has been. Not to be conceited but I find myself to be very attractive and I always wonder why he won't have sex with me. This has seriously messed me up. And has even made me contemplate cheating on him. I have never gone through with it and i never will. i havent even spoken or flirted with other guys but its a terrible thought that passes my mind every so often because I am not happy with him.

We are both embarking on our senior year and he has all these plans of getting married and moving in together and theres a lot of pressure from his family to be together and these plans honestly scare the shit out of me. I'm only 21 I want live free from commitments and focus on myself, my career, and just have fun.

I know I'm not making him seem like the most likable guy but to be honest in every other aspect of the relationship he is amazing. I really love him and really care for him but while im writing im wondering if The love i have for him is more of a maternal wanting to help out love than live partner love. He is caring and thoughtful and always takes care of me and my family. He is a giving person and a good guy who I can tell really loves me and would never hurt me. This all leads me to feel like an asshole for wanting to leave but I honestly feel trapped at this point.

Tl;dr: my bf of almost 2years barely ever has sex with me and has a very draining and self defeating personality that leaves me feeling exhausted. Aside from that he is an amazing guy. Should I stay or go?

1jwqba,1,2013-08-07,My GF (20F) of one 1 year told me she doesn't love me (20M) and can't date me anymore.,csdbifda,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1jwqba/my_gf_20f_of_one_1_year_told_me_she_doesnt_love/,"A little background first. We are in college and hooked up for a couple of weeks before we decided that we should actually try dating. I had known her before then and had hung out with her. We have had a couple of fights and most of them were honestly probably my fault. But we have made up and I thought we were doing well. We were away from college for 2 months this summer so didn't see much of each other. When we came back we have been hanging out but haven't done anything special. We both started internships and have been under stress and haven't had much time. I wish I had taken the time to take her to dinner or do something for her in the past month but we were meeting up so often just to hang out, I didn't really think of it. I think the problem started when we had a pregnancy scare a couple of weeks ago. I think she really freaked out and finally snapped. She has done this with other guys before where the relation will be fine and a couple of days later her mind changes.

Well the break up actually started last Saturday after we had a fight about me being clingy the night before. I apologized because I realized I had been clingy. Then we went out and enjoyed ourselves for a couple of hours were okay. When we got home we were having sex when we stopped in the middle of having sex because she was feeling sore. We were cuddling for a couple of seconds before she tried to justify it and then started saying that I was tired anyways and was going limp, which was partially true as it had been quite some time since we had sex last.

Anyways, I got annoyed by this very quickly and told her to just stop which pissed her off and she pushed me off her and started crying, saying I don't love her. For approximately an hour I tried to calm her down and tell her I do. She told me of a couple of times in recent weeks where she didn't feel appreciated or had gotten mad at me, most of which she hadn't told me before and I think would have been not that big of a deal if I had known. It's partially my fault because I didn't realize that she had been actually mad at me but she does this a lot where she will bottle everything up and let it out all at once. Finally, her friends interrupted us because we had invited them over earlier. When the night ended we were okay and slept together. We woke up the next morning and made breakfast together and then she left. Over the next couple of days (Monday and Tuesday) we texted back and forth a couple of time but not really any conversations and she invited me to watch a movie with some friends at her place. I declined as I was still a little surprised from Saturday and was actually thinking about breaking up with her, which was probably a mistake and I should have gone. However, I made up my mind that I wanted to stay with her and decided to do something nice for her.

Finally on Wednesday, after buying tickets for a show to her favorite band, I surprised her and showed up at her house. She told me that we needed to talk and proceeded to tell me that she wasn't in love with me and that we weren't in love. She was obviously upset and cried a lot but didn't really explain much to me except that she didn't want to date me anymore because she thought we were better together as friends. She also said she loved me like a best friend and was upset because she thought I wouldn't want to be her friend anymore. Which is true. I feel betrayed and hurt by this. We haven't talked in a week and I am lost at what to do. I want her back but I don't know if it's possible. She has a whole drawer of clothes still at my place and I think about her every day. We had talked about what would happen if we broke up a couple of times before and we had always come to the conclusion that we wouldn't be friends because we didn't have the same group of friends so I am also confused why that changed so quickly.

I haven't talked to her in a week except when I texted her to ask if this had anything to do with another guy to which she said no and to ask if it was because of the pregnancy scare to which she didn't respond. I have been trying to give her space but I really miss her. She was also my first girlfriend so I don't have much experience about this. We both agreed that we had some really good times but recently, she said she has just been really upset. However, she kept saying that it wasn't my fault and that she wasn't love with me anymore. I want to know if there's anyway I can try to convince her to change her mind or at least give me a chance. When we broke up she was very adamant that her mind was made up. If you have any questions let me know. I tried to be thorough yet relevant.

TL;DR: GF broke up with me saying she doesn't love and we aren't in love. She said she wants to be friends and cares about me. We haven't talked since and I really miss her."

Do you get to travel to Japan to see various methods?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jw5sf/iama_sushi_chef_with_over_25_years_of_experience/cbiv9a7?context=5)|What you see in the sushi bar may only take a few minutes to prepare in front of you, but what you don't see is that it can take all day to prep.  That's one bite that takes 4 hours to make in the back.  That's why it's expensive.  
[Is it true that some sushi apprentices in Japan spent a year plus just making the rice.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jw5sf/iama_sushi_chef_with_over_25_years_of_experience/cbiv9a7?context=5)|Reflecting on the movie, I felt very sad.  The man spends spends his entire life trying to attain perfection, but perfection is not static.  But it can't be done.  Secondly, on a more selfish level, the movie made me sad because I wish my customers were more like his customers.  With all due respect, my California Roll customers pay my rent.  With all these sushi bars that are opening, I am afraid that the art of sushi is dying.  There are so many rolls covered in sauce.  True Itamaes don't do that.  Of the 100+ sushi bars in Dallas, there are less than 10 true sushi bars.  Everything advances and changes, at a natural pace, but this new fast-food, mass-produced sushi covered in 3 different sauces defeats the purpose of sushi.
[Since there are so many sushi bars, how can you tell the good from the bad? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jw5sf/iama_sushi_chef_with_over_25_years_of_experience/cbiw9bt?context=5)|A lot of people tend to think that if a sushi bar is really busy, it's good.  That's not always true.
 |For me, if I were to walk into a sushi bar, I would immediately sit at the sushi bar and not a table.  I would engage the Itamae.  You need to develop a connection or relationship to the Itamae.  In one trip, you can tell if it's good or not.  It boils down to one thing.  Is the chef putting his/her name on the line?  If a restaurant is promoting their rolls more than they are promoting their chef, you should be hesitant.  Of the less than 10 real sushi bars in Dallas, all of them are connected to a real Itamae, not just an assembly line of sushi makers.
 |It's not different from walking into a chain restaurant or a mediocre restaurant vs dining at a restaurant with an actual named chef.
 |EDIT:  I agree, just because your name is on it does not mean it's going to be good.  But once you do put your name on your food, you are subject to judgement, and I would hope that a named chef would put forth his/her best effort. I do and so do the sushi chefs I referenced.

I personally don't like it, but it is a best-selling roll.  There is place for the Philly Roll.  I met the Master Itamae that invented this roll, and he is the much more traditional than I am.  But he understood his audience and it took me a while to understand my audience.  I do not have many Japanese customers.  ZEN is located in a very diverse, transitional neighborhood in Dallas.
 |What sets me apart is my own biography and culinary profile.  I'm not trying to offer the Japanese experience.  I consider my food New American with strong Japanese influences.  My personal creations reflect my style.  I was born in on Tokyo.  My mother is Japanese and my father is Cajun.  I grew up in South and Southwest.  I have a distinct flavor profile.
[For the most part, I enjoy the experience of Omakase (for those who don't know, it literally translates ""I'll leave it to you"" and means you leave the meal choices in the hands of your chef\).  I have been at restaurants where stern instructions were given with each offering, with the tone of ""you eat it this way or don't come back"".  What is your opinion of this attitude? Do you think it belongs in modern sushi?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jw5sf/iama_sushi_chef_with_over_25_years_of_experience/cbivxa2?context=5)|Chefs should probably change the word ""instructions"" to ""suggestions.""  This goes back to the egomania of any chef.  I can see that artists have a vision, but you cannot dictate to your customer/viewer/consumer how to experience what you produce.  People's tastes changes every day.  Based on your body chemistry which is always fluctuating, you may need a bit more salt.  It's okay if my customer wants a bit more soy sauce than normal.
 |Any chef, in any cuisine, needs to understand that they are making food for **you.**  Food with instructions is like masturbation.  Your purpose is to make food for **someone else.**   
[Well now that we kind of breached the subject I'll go ahead and drop the question: traditional Japanese do not approve of female sushi chefs. To the point where most sushi chefs would refuse to train a woman. How have you surmounted this problem?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jw5sf/iama_sushi_chef_with_over_25_years_of_experience/cbixa28?context=5)|I think I was in the right place at the right time.  They were desperate and I was willing to work for free... and be abused.  I didn't know about the abuse.  The abuse came later.
 |Everyone gets treated like crap, but some went out of their way to make my experience miserable.
 |I never in my wildest dreams imagined what would happen last year:  A chauvinist chef that I once with, who hit me twice, actually applied for a job at ZEN.  My revenge fantasy from 20+ years ago came true, but I didn't feel good.  I felt sorry for him.   
[How did you get into making Sushi?  What was the training process for you like?  Are there any aspects of your restaurant you would like to better? Anything you want to change?  If you could meet one person, alive or dead, who would it be?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jw5sf/iama_sushi_chef_with_over_25_years_of_experience/cbiv5ln?context=5)|I started making sushi in San Antonio.  I was just a sushi maker, but I wanted formal training so I could be a real Itamae.  I knew I had to move to California to learn the very best.  I was lucky enough to find a company in San Diego that operated 3 different sushi bars that allowed me to train.  Because it was a large restaurant group, there were at 10 Master Itamaes.  None of of them acknowledged my existence except for one.  Thank you to Mino-San.  I learned mostly by watching and mimicking and that actually turned out to be a blessing in disguise because I learned so many styles from 10 different Masters.  I took what I thought was best of each of their styles and I developed my own style.  Most of the chefs at this restaurant group were from Tokyo.  I learned Edo-style.
[Are there any problems you face being a female sushi chef?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jw5sf/iama_sushi_chef_with_over_25_years_of_experience/cbiv5ln?context=5)|When I started 25 years ago, there were no schools for sushi.  The only way to become a sushi chef was to apply for an apprenticeship.  Back then, Itamaes were all Japanese men.  They were very against training non-Japanese and women.  I was both.
[San Diegan here.  What was the restaurant group please? And did you train with/under Shige-san?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jw5sf/iama_sushi_chef_with_over_25_years_of_experience/cbix9qa?context=5)|This group is now defunct, but I worked at the original Sushi on the Rock in La Jolla, Genji in Del Mar, and DaTe in Ocean Side.  This was in the late 80s.  
[Are you bad tempered like the sushi chef on the Simpsons?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jw5sf/iama_sushi_chef_with_over_25_years_of_experience/cbiv761?context=5)|Itamaes are naturally ego-maniacs.  In Japans, being an Itamae is the best chef you can possibly be.  It has ranking and draws a lot of respect.  It is because the training process is so rigorous and takes 8 years.  That's 8 years of very bad treatment.  Once you make it, you have a (false?) sense of superiority.  So you get grumpy at stupid people, stupid questions or stupid requests.
 |Although I'm not like that anymore because I am older, I do remember my ill-tempered days.  You eventually learn that you don't know sh*t.
 |So, yes, the Simpsons depiction is quite true.  I can attest to that stereotype.
 |And BTW, The Simpsons constantly gets referenced by my customers and my staff here loves the Simpsons.  We even have our own Sherri-Terri, here.
[Is toro worth the extra cost?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jw5sf/iama_sushi_chef_with_over_25_years_of_experience/cbiwz0v?context=5)|I don't determine if its worth it.  You decide.
 |Honestly, I pay over $50 per pound at wholesale prices.  To me, it is the best part of the best fish.   
[People say the freshest fish is best, but from reading online it seems fish should be frozen for a period before being served raw. Can you talk about the timing and process of getting fish ready for consumption? Does it really make a difference if my fav restaurant isn't on the coast? Thanks!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jw5sf/iama_sushi_chef_with_over_25_years_of_experience/cbiyrxt?context=5)|No, it does not make a difference.  The supply chain for the food and shipping industry is unbelievable now.   A day fisherman in California can catch a fish, have it on the dock, and have it sold to a distributor by 10am.  I can be preparing this same fish the same evening in Dallas for dinner service.
 |If you catch fresh fish, you should ice it for at least 6 hrs, so that the adrenaline and hormones in the fish works it way out.  Those hormones are detectable, and you want it to taste natural.   
[I know this one's probably obvious but...  Does the temperature of your hands really affect the taste of sushi, or is that some sort of myth?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jw5sf/iama_sushi_chef_with_over_25_years_of_experience/cbivy1o?context=5)|Myth.
[Wouldn't it have been easier to just become a carpenter?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jw5sf/iama_sushi_chef_with_over_25_years_of_experience/cbiylrh?context=5)|Yea, it would have been.
 |It would have been just as rewarding.  There is an art and honor to being a carpenter.
[There are some kinds of sushi that I absolutely love, and others that I'm not a fan of. The best sushi I have gotten is by doing ""omakase"", even though I'm always a little nervous about what I'll get.  My question is, is it poor form to request omakase but put some restrictions on it (e.g., no uni, or no maki, etc.\)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jw5sf/iama_sushi_chef_with_over_25_years_of_experience/cbiw5o6?context=5)|I can only speak for myself:  I appreciate some direction if I have never made food for you before.  It gives me information about you so that I can make your best meal.
[What makes sushi so damn addicting at a level well above other foods?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jw5sf/iama_sushi_chef_with_over_25_years_of_experience/cbiwguw?context=5)|Some people say there's an addictive agent in wasabi.  But most sushi bars don't use real wasabi because it's so expensive.  People like wasabi because it probably released low-level endorphins from the burn.  With anything that does that, whether its a video games or exercising, you are more likely to be addicted.
[What can we do to attract more women into the sushi chef profession? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jw5sf/iama_sushi_chef_with_over_25_years_of_experience/cbiwbyb?context=5)|I regularly have interns from culinary schools who are female.  I think things are changing.   Honestly, there doesn't seem to be that much interest from females.  I really don't know.  There's more opportunity so let's work on building interest.   
[I love the Bishop Arts District, but I have yet to go to Zen (hopefully I will soon\). Before I leave for culinary school, I want to try and go to most of the restaurants on the D best 100. Which restaurants are your favorite, whether it be pizza, steak, french, and are there any Sushi restaurants other than Zen that you think people should definitely try out in the Dallas area?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jw5sf/iama_sushi_chef_with_over_25_years_of_experience/cbiykxi?context=5)|If you are going to go to my competitor, at least go to a place I would eat at:  Tei An, Sushi Sake, and Yutaka (when he's there)
[My dad's been a sushi chef for over 28 years and we just recently opened up another restaurant in BC, making a grand total of 6. After a couple of our employees left, we're stuck looking for Itamae, but all the ones we hire end up being sloppy with their rolls, and since my dad's super strict about quality, they always just quit. In my opinion, my dad's reasonable about what he says and how he trains people, there's just a lack of responsibility and perseverance. So my question is, is there a way to know if someone will meet your standards, maybe a certain question that will help my dad understand who will meet his requirements?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jw5sf/iama_sushi_chef_with_over_25_years_of_experience/cbizhhh?context=5)|During the interview, I make them perform a few tests including cutting vegetables and making sushi and a roll.  The more detail-oriented some is, the better their sushi is going to look.  This means they will be slower.  You have to find a balance between someone who is meticulous but also quick.  This is a very hard combination.  You can teach neatness.  You cannot teach a sense of urgency.
[Any tips for women trying to get into the business? recommended courses, etc?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jw5sf/iama_sushi_chef_with_over_25_years_of_experience/cbixl5k?context=5)|I really believe that the best way to learn is to beg for an apprenticeship with a respected chef.  I have been quite disappointed in the skill level of the graduates from some culinary programs.  You learn by repetition.  You have to make a California Roll at least 1000 times before it looks half-way decent.  You get this practice on the line, not in school.  
[Have you ever eaten Fugu or had an experience with it in your job?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jw5sf/iama_sushi_chef_with_over_25_years_of_experience/cbixdxq?context=5)|I have served Fugu at a [SSS](http://zensushidallas.com/zs/secret-sushi-society.html) dinner.  Honestly, the taste of fugu is over-rated.  It is a firm white meat fish, similar to halibut.  It is also very vein-y.
 |I think people want the thrill of it.  It's very expensive.  
[As a Sushi connoisseur, I normally ask the sushi chef to ""surprise me"" with whatever they enjoy making (under a set price, of course\)  I have to ask, do you enjoy it when people as you to ""surprise them""? Or do you just consider them assholes?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jw5sf/iama_sushi_chef_with_over_25_years_of_experience/cbj527g?context=5)|This is the best way to expand your palate.  I think that somebody who is a serious and respected chef is going to give you their very best stuff.

1jwgb8,1,2013-08-07,I'm exhausted. I keep putting effort in for seemingly no payoff.,throwawayaway42,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1jwgb8/im_exhausted_i_keep_putting_effort_in_for/,"This is going to be a rant, but whatever. I'm fed up. I've spent the three years since getting my degree as an unpaid intern at a prestigious institution in a large city. I'm making no money, though, so I live at home in the suburbs with a 1.5 hour commute each way. My co-workers, for the most part, seem like competent people with lives/friends of their own. I put on my cheerful/witty mask well enough and we all have fun at open employee mixers and the like, but I haven't fit in with any of the social groups (which is hard to attempt in the first place with my commute). I have no friends otherwise.  
  
My supervisors have told me often enough how impressed they are with my work ethic. Unfortunately for my attempts at a social life, about a year ago work needed to start at an auxiliary location a few blocks from my home in the suburbs, so I was the natural choice to start on that. It's staffed by a handful of old people -- not helpful. I feel like a stranger among my peers now. When I make the trip in for no other reason than to maintain some semblance of relevance among my peers/acquaintances, the first reaction is ""Oh, what are you doing here?!"" I know it's just the natural reaction/conversation starter, but hearing it over and over again makes me feel so out of place among people who I never really felt in place with anyway.  
  
I know I'm not supposed to compare myself to others, but in one case I can't help it. Two weeks after I started as an intern (a long three years ago), a job opening appeared at my institution, and they were looking for people with just my background. I made it to the final round, but someone else who pretty much matched my background was chosen instead. I know had the support of at least one of the final decision makers, so I feel like it was essentially a dice roll -- pure luck -- that was the deciding factor. I look at the life that this person has lived the past few years: apartment right near our institution, great friends, resources to go on adventures, partner they are now engaged to ... now with the three-years of experience they are off to graduate school along with a related job offer at a great university. To make matters worse, I've since applied to the same position a few more times as it has opened up, and even with now years of being at my institution, I'm not even selected for the first round of interviewing -- as if I'm a less attractive hire now than I was when I was a fresh intern. Where would I be now if that dice roll had gone my way instead? I can usually avoid the ""what if"" game, but this instance of ""if"" was just too darn close.  
  
I'm losing the fight. For the past couple of weeks, I've given up on my attempts to be social. I come home after ""work"" and alternate between Facebook and Reddit for the remaining 8 hours of the day before going to sleep (I also look through OKCupid profiles, because, as pathetic as it sounds, ""getting to know"" women in this fashion is better than nothing. I haven't had any replies to messages -- great for my wallet, bad for my self-esteem). I try to ""get out more"", but my interest in various things wanes as soon as I contemplate actually doing them. It's almost as if I like the *idea* of these things rather than the things themselves.  
  
I know I sound like a total downer, but I hide it well when I actually am with co-workers or at a mixer or something. I'm cheerful, witty, and can make enough small-talk to be passable as a social butterfly. I'm told how fun I am and how popular I must be (lol), but when I try to make friendships or become a member of a social circle, things fizzle out somehow. I never complain about these things to people in real life (aside from my therapist), lest I dig myself an even deeper hole.  
  
All the while, I'm sometimes crushed with the feeling of depression. I don't know what to do. I can point out all of the ways that I'm thinking irrationally. I can identify the clearest road to feeling okay as worked out by myself and my CBT doctor. No one ever said we humans were supposed to be able to be rational, though. I don't know."

I'm at that lovely point of my career where I'm applying for internship.  As I comb through the overwhelming and disorganized mess that is APPIC, I'm finding myself feeling a bit overwhelmed.  I'm hoping that the reddit community can help me out a little bit.

Long story short, I'm looking to get into a research career and I'm a behaviorist.  I'm trying to identify sites that are open to contemporary contextual/ behavioral therapies (ACT, FAP, DBT, BA, MI, etc.) and will help me facilitate my research abilities.  I also have no interest in working with kids (sorry Boys Town).    

I'm currently 60 sites into my evaluation of 453 APA accredited sites.  My hope is that any suggests here will help serve as a safety net; making sure I don't overlook any sites I should be attending to.

I'd also love to hear any of your own internship stories, advice, or just general cheerleading for me.  

Thanks!"
1jwam4,117,2013-08-07,[M]y Spring Break Encounter with an old [F]riend,[deleted],gonewildstories,https://www.reddit.com/r/gonewildstories/comments/1jwam4/my_spring_break_encounter_with_an_old_friend/,"It was just a gentle tap on my shoulder followed by a question.

""Andy?""

""Yes,"" I said before full focusing on the questioner, and then blurted out, ""Jen? Oh my God!!""

Jennifer was an old friend from my home town. We were separated by a year in age. She was now a senior at our University and I a Junior. And as it happens we never ran into each other on campus and hadn't seen each other in about 6 months to a year.

""Getting ready to split,"" she asked?

It was two days before the start of Spring Break and everyone was hell bent on getting off of campus. 

Except me.

I stepped up for a friend and took his shifts on campus as a security guard that entailed me walking all over campus checking doors, making sure cars were properly parked and traipsing through the dorms making sure there were no fires, water leaks or other activity that would endanger the buildings. I even had a little walkie talkie.

""Actually,"" I said to Jen, ""I'm sticking around,"" and explained my security gig.

""No kidding?"" Jen asked.  And then explained that she too was remaining on campus because of an on going internship and other duties she wanted to complete as a resident assistant in one of the dorms.

""Maybe I'll see you around,"" Jen said. ""Make sure my dorm is safe!""

' I will,"" I replied and made a mental note to be sure I walked through her floor often.

Now some background about Jen and I.

We were friends... close friends. BUT never so much as kissed or held hands. Part of it was that we were good friends and the other dynamic was that Jen was, well, beautiful. Tall, raven black hair, green eyes and as close to model material as they come. Really. Funny part is, she knew it and never used it or was cocky or flip about being a stunner. It was just her. No pretension what so ever. Even if she did flaunt her great legs and backside, small, but perfect breasts and shampoo commercial worthy hair. Not to mention she dressed like a catalog model and was/is the nicest person you could ever meet. Bubbly, smart (extremely) and kind.

Folks always said we would make a great couple but nothing ever came of it. And I never garnered the courage to ask her on a date, partially because I feared rejection and partially because I did not want to ruin or relationship.

Jen and I exchanged a few more pleasantries and catching up, then parted ways.

She gave me a friendly pat on the arm and said ""See you soon!""

I secretly hoped I would bump into her again during the long week.

Campus security in a word is boring. Check doors, check hallways, classrooms. Alot of walking, climbing stairs and not much happening.

Campus was a ghost town. I'd never seen it so empty.

For three days and nights, during my shift, I passed through Jen's dorm and didn't see her. I was dejected. 

Then night four, about 9 PM it happened, I entered the hallway from a fire door and there she was.
Naked.

""Holy shit!"" she screamed, ""what are you doing?""

I shielded my eyes, fumbled, feeling embarrassed for no apparent reason.

""What am I doing? What the hell are you doing??"" I  fumbled.

""I ran out of toilet paper,"" Jen said, ""I  was checking the hall ladies room.""

""Nude?!"" I said.

""Well, I thought I was safe.. Jesus,"" Jen blurted, all the while trying to get to the safety of her room.

""Here,"" I said, motioning for her to take my jacket, still not looking and then realizing she had darted into her room.

Jen emerged with a towel and a robe, at first angry, and then laughing.

""I didn't see anything, I swear,"" I said with a smirk on my face.

""Liar!"" she said jokingly. ""You saw the whole package.""

""Yeah, "" I did I replied. 

""Tell no one!"" she said, ""or I'll kick your butt!""

Jen started to get playful, pretending to slap me and at the same time letting go of her robe closure and giving me another, maybe unintentional view of her beautiful body. This time I could spy that she was partially shaved down below and had a small diamond stud through her belly button. Not to mention the flattest firmest stomach I'd ever seen.

The tent in my pants was evident, and she again caught me starring.

""Stop looking,"" she jokingly yelled, ""all the blood will rush from your brain!""

We laughed. 

""Well, what do you expect? "" I said. Still somewhat uncomfortable with the entire situation, but enjoying it none-the-less.

And then without warning, she dropped her robe and kissed me on the lips. First briefly and then full make-out, french-kiss glory. Nude. Her body against mine. Naked. Hot naked. glorious Jen naked.

I couldn't believe it. I didn't know what to do. Where to put my hands. Anything. Numb and at a loss.
After a minute or two Jen sensed it.

""This is when you're supposed to cup my breast, or grab my ass, or something,"" Jen whispered.

""Really?"" I said, not believing what was happening.

""Really,"" she uttered breathlessly, as the situation got hotter.

Not waiting, Jen began to undress me. Shirt off, unbuckled my pants and pushed them down and then off with my boxers. She wrapped a firm hand around my cock.

There we stood. 

Nude. In the hallway. Jen slowly stroking me and I stunned.

""Should we get inside?"" I asked. 

""Sure,"" she said and pushed me to her room and on to the floor just inside the door. She pushed the door closed with her foot and then just sat on me and took my hard cock and slipped it right inside her. No talking, nothing. Boom. We were fucking.

And talking dirty.

My innocent friend. My gorgeous, innocent friend had a dirty streak; that is,  a dirty-talk streak in her.

She began riding my dick and whispering sweet nothings.

""I want you to fill my pussy with your hot-white cream,"" Jen whispered, and later I want you to lick my ass and hot pussy lips.""

It was all I could take. And then, after hearing those words, I came. Hard. Screaming, muscle tensing, hard. 
And alot.

Jen was out of breadth.

""Later,"" she said,  ""you're on top.""

""Later,"" I asked?

She smiled.

I had to get back to work.

Later was about 4 hours later, after my shift.

I went back to my room, showered and changed and then headed over to Jen's.

The door was locked.

Knock.

No answer.

Then I noticed a piece of paper stuck between the door and door frame.

A note.

""Dear Andy, Be right back. Don't wait. I'll call you. But when I do call, come ASAP. Be hard.""

""What?"" I thought. Does she mean that. Is she kidding. 

I shot back to my room and waited.

An hour. 

Two hours.

The phone rings.

""Andy?"" She asked. 

""Jen?"" I shot back ....

""I'm soooo sorry,"" she said. "" Can you still come over?""

""Of course,"" I said.

""Did you read my note? It was still stuck in the door.""

""Yep,"" I said ... and before I could finish she giggled.

""Cool,"" she said "" Follow the directions and get over here.""

She hung up.

So, I'm thinking to myself, Am I supposed to walk in with a raging boner?

I head over to Jen's room, about a 10 minute walk, and my mind is racing about what is going on.

No doubt we're about to have sex again. Glorious Jen sex. But what did she have in mind?

I hustle over and thankfully while thinking about Jen and her note and what might happen, I'm more than excited and have, as Jen instructed, a hard on. Hard. Rock hard. Walking is difficult, hard.

Arriving at her room, the door is barely iopen, just enough for me not to have to turn the door know. I knock first. And walk in.

It's dark.

A flicker of light is coming from Jen's room. 

""In here,"" Jen calls. ""Did you comply with my note?""

""Hell yes,"" I reply as I make my way into her room.

And there's Jen.

On the bed. Completely naked with her head on her pillow and ass up facing me as I walk in the door.

""No talking,"" Jen says. ""You have one minute to get off your clothes and stick your dick in me.""

I fumble and in no way smoothly strip off everything then hesitate.

""Now,"" Jen says, ""I'm waiting.""

I comply.

Jen accepts my hard cock into her glorious waiting pussy with an ""oh, that feels so good.""

With my hands on her hips she tells me what she wants. 

""Long, slow thrusts,"" she commands, ""and then go all the way in and stop.""

I comply.

And while I am in her tom the fullest she begins to gently move her beautiful ass, ever so gently, up and down.

I tell her I'm about to come and she slows and slides forward, releasing me from her grip. My shaft is coated with her slippery, glistening juices.

Jen then takes me in her mouth, slowly licking at my shaft and head. She senses I might come and says ""Your turn.""

She lays back on the bed pulling her knees up to hear breasts, exposing her beautiful mound and pussy lips.

She motions for me to kiss her between the legs and I oblige, slowly at first, and then unable to contain myself begin licking furiously at her labia,darting inside in search of her clit. Jen moans and paws at my head, guiding mwe to her target and asking for more.

""Don't stop,"" she says. And I don't.

Jen tastes deliciously sweet, and it;s hard to believe one woman could be so wet. Her pussy is glistening with my salivia and her juices. I continue. 

Now while licking her feverishly, I also begin to tease her with my fingers and occasionally reach for her breasts where I find her nipples are extremely hard. Jen reacts even more.

""Sensitive,"" I ask?

""More,"" she says, and I oblige.

I leave her pussy and slowly kiss my way to her chest and those inviting nipples.

My penis is rock hard, and rubbing against her as I move. When I get to her thighs and near her pussy I can feel her juices  that have slowly dripped down.

I begin licking and sucking Jen's nipples, running my hands all over her body, rubbing her outer pussy lips when she begins to have an intense orgasm. Small at first and then just rippling into a body shaking tremor. She gasps and moans and draws in deep breaths, settling into a tired heap.

""You're next,"" she says.

I can't wait.

1jw2lb,3,2013-08-07,Are staffing agencies for me? (Web Developer),TFenrir,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1jw2lb/are_staffing_agencies_for_me_web_developer/,"I'm a relatively recent grad looking for some work, and my trade is web development. My experience is minimal, but I do have at least some experience working in the field - unfortunately the last place a worked was an unpaid internship that was just... not good. I got some experience, and they even offered to start paying me when I told them I was leaving, but the environment was really amateur and my confidence in getting paid was basically null.

Since then I've been looking for work, entry level, junior level, paid internships - whatever really, just anything in the field. But it's been really hard, and honestly I haven't even gotten an interview since that last position, which was nearly 2 months ago. As far as I can tell my resume is fine. I've had employment coaches (and others) look at it and they don't see anything wrong with it, and I always customize it a bit for each job application as well as provide a cover letter. But basically, it might just be my city (Toronto) but there is sooo much competition, I'm guessing my resume is just getting tossed aside.

I've been considering just getting in contact with as many IT recruiters as possible and hoping for the best at this point. I just need to get my feet in some doors, because I know I interview really well - but I can't seem to get that far. I recently got in contact with a second IT recruiter (the first one fell off the map) and she thinks she has positions that will fit my criteria, but who knows. Regardless, just talking to someone has been such a change of pace, it really got me thinking that maybe I should get in contact with every IT staffing agency in the city I can find, and just ask for their help - essentially.

Short of that, I could start cold calling, but I have no idea how to cold call to be honest. I don't know what sort of companies to even call! It's pretty frustrating getting leads, but not have them ever turn into interviews, and the only interview offers I seem to get are for completely amateur 'unpaid internships'.

I guess that came off a bit more ranty than I intended, but the short of it is... having trouble finding entry level web development work, the most luck I've had so far is talking to recruiters. Should I just start focusing on recruiters/staffing agencies or should I try my hand at cold calling? If I should cold call, how should I go about it?"

1jvr6y,5,2013-08-07,"A few college-related questions regarding where I should place my focus, and GPAs",[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1jvr6y/a_few_collegerelated_questions_regarding_where_i/,"So I've almost finished the first year of my CS degree - I've done reasonably well so far, pulling Ds, HDs and the occasional C for most of my assessments, and maintaing an unofficial GPA of 3.0 (with 4.0 being the highest GPA at my university).

However, I feel like perhaps I might be working *too* hard at university. I would estimate 70% of time is dedicated to studying (weekly readings, making study guides, attending lectures/classes, and assignments/quizzes), with perhaps only 10% of my time spent on personal projects and actual coding, and the other 20% spent on my part-time job and going out for the occasional drink. At the risk of sounding whiny, I am frankly feeling a little exhausted from it all, and I'm starting to feel like I'm putting too much stock in my GPA.

From everything I've read on this sub, and others, it would seem that getting an internship/experience is more important than my GPA, and that getting said experience is largely contingent on personal projects and actual, tangible coding skills (which I feel are still below par, despite any academic success I've had thus far).

So should I perhaps pull focus away from my studies, possibly forfeiting the chance to score a high GPA, and instead concentrate on building my actual coding skills and working on personal projects that I can parlay into experience/an internship?

Any response would be super appreciated!"
1jvlhz,7,2013-08-07,Things are falling in to place faster than I expected,[deleted],brag,https://www.reddit.com/r/brag/comments/1jvlhz/things_are_falling_in_to_place_faster_than_i/,"Well first off, my result for uni last semester was amazing. I got two credits and a distinction. One credit was for accounting, something I found not only to be a struggle mentally but emotionally as I failed it the first time after a friend killed himself. 




Secondly, I got an amazing paid internship at a place I really like and I've only worked two days so far and they love me. They are hinting heavily at hiring once I finish my degree, which might be this year since now I have experience getting a double degree isn't worth the extra money and time. 




Third, this sounds really pathetic and childish but a guy I've had a crush on for years kissed me and it was so awesome. I don't think it will go anywhere because honestly we are too different but just to get the moment, after this long. I never thought anything would happen, he would just remain someone hot I'd occasionally flirt with. 





Fourth, I have saved enough for my trip to America as well as my second trip next year for my sisters wedding!! I am so excited for both its crazy. I get to go to New York! That's something I've always dreamed of! I can afford to buy whatever I feel like food wise, clothing, make up, etc. Then I get to be the maid of honour at my sisters wedding... after waiting 12 years of their relationship! 





Finally, my boobs are getting bigger! A bikini I bought in January is now overflowing with cleveage and my bras are getting too small now. Soon I would have gone up a full cup size. Hopefully they will keep growing too!







Things just seem to be working out and I'm really enjoying being alone for once. This is the longest I've been single since I was 17. I feel on top of the world!"
1jvk2g,4,2013-08-07,I have ADHD and I have some problems that I'm not sure is related to ADHD.,[deleted],ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1jvk2g/i_have_adhd_and_i_have_some_problems_that_im_not/,"The following happened a lot when I was around 8-12 years old

Some days, I would just sit still in class, completely quiet while listening to everything that was going on around me. I would often start staring at any random spot and my thoughts would be completely empty. After a while, the noise from the other kids would seem louder and louder. A feeling of unease would start growing and my heart  would start beating faster. I would panic and rush out of class, often all the way home.
When I got home I still felt uneasy. I would often turn on my computer and play some game, which calmed me down and I would quickly forget about the unease feelings.

The same thing would happen at soccer practice and family activities (such as birthdays etc). But most of this stopped around the time I was 12.

A similar thing happened when I was 17 and had an internship at a rest-home. On my first day, after about 1 hour I started feeling very uneasy and I just could not resist running home, so that's what I did, without saying a word to anyone. The day after I called them and said I just couldn't do it.

I'm now 20 years old and I'm struggling to find a job, I'm afraid that I will just panic and quit, if I managed to get a job that is.

So my question is; Has something similar happened to people with ADHD? Is it / could it be related to ADHD?"

[What was your scariest shark encounter? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jtug2/iama_shark_diver_at_seal_island_south_africa_ama/cbi87pa?context=5)|Well it wasnt my scariest (however i am desensitized)  but when I tell people the story they certainly think it is.
 |I was working off the back of the boat on a day with lots of swell. We went over a swell, the anchor caught and I was thrown off backwards and landed on the head of a 13 foot great white shark. It spooked the shark and as it bolted away i rolled over it and got one hell of a hit from its dorsal fin to the side of the face...bitch slapped by a great white :(
[What if you wore a bright orange or yellow suit to look less seal like.?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jtug2/iama_shark_diver_at_seal_island_south_africa_ama/cbikfee?context=5)|They've done studies on color. I am pretty sure color makes little difference. There is a joke/saying where yellow is referred to as ""yum yum yellow"".
 |Im not to sold on color, I think you could be whatever color you want I think sharks tend to focus more on shapes- if that makes sense.
[Is it possible to become ""friends"" with shark? They remember you in some way? As you go swim/dive with them they come and say ""hi""?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jtug2/iama_shark_diver_at_seal_island_south_africa_ama/cbi9jx9?context=5)|I wish! we have been having the same shark return to seal island for 11 seasons now. while we love and get really excited to see him I dont think he shares the same emotion.
[Do Sharks like to ride Tornados for fun? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jtug2/iama_shark_diver_at_seal_island_south_africa_ama/cbi8ewc?context=5)|Absolutely! however, this usually happens far out to sea where we cannot witness this spectacular event. It was only recently that director Anthony C. Ferrante was able to capture this rare event occurring over los angeles. 
[Are sharks in South Africa protected? What is the state of the Shark population in your country and in Africa in general?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jtug2/iama_shark_diver_at_seal_island_south_africa_ama/cbi9h49?context=5)|The great white sharks are protected in south africa however there is very little government infrastructure to enforce protection. Shark long lining is a very serious problem off all of Africa's coastline. Other countries such as china take full advantage of these countries being unable to enforce.
 |It is really tragic and difficult to watch.
[That is terribly sad. Sharks are truly amazing animals, they deserve better. What activities do you participate in to help sharks in your country?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jtug2/iama_shark_diver_at_seal_island_south_africa_ama/cbi9txh?context=5)|If I see people fishing out great whites I usually try to photograph the people, their boat, car etc and send it off to the authority. unfortunately, a lot of these efforts have been in vain but we have gotten one person prosecuted.
 |I also try to do whatever I can to get them to stop. I have taken by boat overtop their fishing lines every time they cast.
[You grew up on the ocean?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jtug2/iama_shark_diver_at_seal_island_south_africa_ama/cbi93r8?context=5)|Well my mom was a mermaid and my dad was just a young city guy who fell in love. Needless to say I spent a lot of time on the ocean.
 |Splash movie reference... anyone... anyone?
[What makes a Shark turn rogue? (I think of the Jersey Shore shark attacks of 1916\).](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jtug2/iama_shark_diver_at_seal_island_south_africa_ama/cbia1m2?context=5)|There's no scientific conclusion to this answer but I can give you my educated guess.
 |For lack of better words I believe it is a ""hungry"" shark. Potentially this animal has been unable to successfully hunt wild animals out to sea so it moves in shore to scavenge or forage. Humans are pathetic in the water- even Michael phelps looks like a dweeb in the water to a shark. So we appear as easy pickings. Im sure that if one were to follow a rouge shark they would see this shark eating whatever it comes across- not just humans.
 |Here's an attempt at an analogy- imagine putting a piece of stale or moldy bread in front of two people. One person regularly eats and just finished a massive meal. The other has only eaten sporadically and hasnt eaten in the past couple days. It is no doubt that the hungry person is going to be far more aggressive in securing that bread as well as less picky about the state of the bread. In this case the people are the sharks and the moldy bread is the human.
[Is there a way to minimize a shark attack if you are by sharks? Maybe a quick jab to the nose..](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jtug2/iama_shark_diver_at_seal_island_south_africa_ama/cbi9d69?context=5)|There are things you can and cannot do however if you encounter a shark, not on your terms, or by accident, I honestly believe the ball is in their court.
 |Typically if you see the shark that is the first indicator that you have a chance. They are ambush predators if they want you they are going to hit you before you even know what is up. Anyway, at this point you need to show the shark that you are the more dominant animal in the water. This means you need to make movements towards it, poke it with a spear (if you have) or hit it as hard as you can while maintaining accuracy and control. Make yourself look as big as possible, I put arms above my head and point my feet straight down with toes pointed.
 |While doing this you want to make your way out of the water as quick as possible. Do not ever start splashing and swim away from the shark (in panic) when it is circling you or swimming at you. This is like a dinner bell to them.
 |It is the ultimate game of chicken!
[I heard that attacking the eyes would be the number one priority.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jtug2/iama_shark_diver_at_seal_island_south_africa_ama/cbi9so8?context=5)|Great whites are pretty big. It would think it would be difficult to reach back and hit their eye as you are in their mouth. plus their eyes roll back to protect when they are biting.
 |With that said, it sure wouldnt hurt to try.
 |Also, sharks cant look backwards so if you can somehow get behind them and grab down on them somewhere this will usually elicit a flight response and send them on their way. 
[At what point do you stop swimming towards it and start getting out?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jtug2/iama_shark_diver_at_seal_island_south_africa_ama/cbiqdco?context=5)|I think at the point you feel that your are close enough to an exit that you can book it before the shark comes back and investigate you.
[How many different species of shark exist around Seal Island? Do they like to co-mingle with each other or do they stick to their own kind? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jtug2/iama_shark_diver_at_seal_island_south_africa_ama/cbibcjx?context=5)|The great white shark is king around the island. you do get some small bottom dwelling sharks that live around the island but any species that swims in the water column would likely be view as a meal for a great white as well.
[Have you seen individual sharks display individual personalities?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jtug2/iama_shark_diver_at_seal_island_south_africa_ama/cbiaipq?context=5)|Absolutely! we first identify them by characteristics on their bodies (such as birthmarks). WHen they stick around and come to the boat day after day you start to see these amazing personalities come out. You get very attached to them and feel very close. Eventually the sharks move on and when they stop showing up you get sad but hope to see them next season and when they show up that next season, a little bigger, you are over the moon! 
[That's so cool - can you give an example of the personalities you might see? It's so hard for me to imagine something like a shark exhibiting one (shows how limited my knowledge is\).](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jtug2/iama_shark_diver_at_seal_island_south_africa_ama/cbibs92?context=5)|Sure, last year I named a shark Deux Rossee. which is broken french for two roses. This is for two reasons: first, she has two rose shaped birthmarks on either side of her dorsal fin. Second, she has two personalities. She can be so calm and circle the boat for hours or she can be a wild child and fly out of the water on you. Here are two pictures of my little girl.
 |The first is her being calm, notice the white pigment rose on her dorsal fin [Link to imgur.com](http://imgur.com/8YZQKv) The second picture is her wild side [Link to imgur.com](http://imgur.com/SkiVv2G)
 |There was anothe shark names Rasta because he was sooo chilled. He could come up to the boat and rest his head on the back of the dive step (I dont have a picture)
 |There are soo many more but I will leave it at that for now.
[How dangerous are these sharks to humans?  For example if your dive boat sank and everyone had to swim to shore, would you be confident that nobody would be bitten in half by a shark?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jtug2/iama_shark_diver_at_seal_island_south_africa_ama/cbi8e5q?context=5)|I would say it really has to depend where you are. Sharks have resting grounds and feeding ground. If the boat went down at seal island I would be nervous as this is their hunting ground. If we were in their area that they rest I would still be uneasy as there are always opportunistic sharks and we would be a group of panicky animals splashing on the surface but there would be a good chance we could make it to shore.
 |For the record, I would try to get everyone to be a calm as possible and clump together as close as possible so we look like one massive animal as opposed to many individual small animals.
[*If the boat went down at seal island I would be nervous.*  *If we were in their area that they rest I would still be uneasy.*  So we'd be fucked either way.  Gotcha.  Good to know.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jtug2/iama_shark_diver_at_seal_island_south_africa_ama/cbi8t1o?context=5)|I wouldnt say fucked but I would say that your fate is out of your hands at that point. 50/50.
[What is the coolest shark encounter you have ever experienced?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jtug2/iama_shark_diver_at_seal_island_south_africa_ama/cbi9ats?context=5)|There are so many aye. I have to give it to the first time I ever saw a great white. I was on the dive step off the back of the boat and the spotter in the eagles nest called out a shark coming in from the left. I immediately looked and saw a shadow moving our way. As it came closer the shadow transformed into a shark shaped shadow, then it came and swam right under my feet. at that point 20 years of wondering what they look like in real life became a reality. It was such a memorable moment in my life.
 |Pardon the pun, but i was hooked from then onwards.
[What is the most sharks you've been in the water with at once?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jtug2/iama_shark_diver_at_seal_island_south_africa_ama/cbicj3c?context=5)|This is a picture of me that I would probably say is the most sharks i have dove with in one sitting [Link to imgur.com](http://imgur.com/r45qWi8)
[ if you think you're about to be attacked, what is your ""oh shit"" plan to gtfo?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jtug2/iama_shark_diver_at_seal_island_south_africa_ama/cbicj3c?context=5)|As far as a GTFO plan, I would assess how far I have to go to get out of the water. If it is close enough I would just break all my rules and try as hard as I could to get there as quick as possible. If i am out in the open I would try to just fight it off until it gets over it. Last resort- shit myself an island and stand on it!
[What made you want to pursue a career in working with sharks? Is this something you've wanted to do since you were a child?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jtug2/iama_shark_diver_at_seal_island_south_africa_ama/cbi8prl?context=5)|I've grown up on the ocean and always had an obsession and curiosity with sharks- especially great white sharks! There is so much mystery to these animals. i also find them beautiful, powerful, graceful and terrifying all wrapped up into one. 
[I am already scuba certified, and would love to go cage diving with sharks.  Do you have any tips, or recommendations on locations I should go for this?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jtug2/iama_shark_diver_at_seal_island_south_africa_ama/cbici5w?context=5)|My intentions are not to plug my company however I do have a shark diving company. the website is www.oceans-discovery.com.
 |I would say the best place to go cage diving in the united states is out of san diego california. There are live aboards that go down to an island called guadalupe off baja. here, the vis is 100 feet, the water is warm, and the sharks are biig!!
 |In SA the shark diving is also great however the water is cold and the vis is usually around 12 feet. the crowning jewel of SA is the sharks jumping.
 |Austrailia and New Zealand have equally amazing cage diving.
 |Drop me a line if you want the full shabang about great white shark diving planet earth ;) jeremy@oceans-discovery.com.
 |Again sorry to plug my company, that is not my intention of this AMA.
[I hear stories of massive great whites out there, what is the largest one you have personally seen and what did you feel when you saw it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jtug2/iama_shark_diver_at_seal_island_south_africa_ama/cbiaj4f?context=5)|The biggest I saw was around 5.5 meters, or 17.5 feet, it is pretty rare to come across ones this big. When I saw it, my jaw freaking dropped- it looked like a baby whale!
 |I tell you it isnt the length of these animals it is the girth they gain as they grown.
 |This photo probably doesnt do much justice but it was my attempt at the time to make a comparison. [Link to imgur.com](http://imgur.com/lgHsyLI)
 |Bare in mind that shark is about 6 feet underwater, that seal decoy on the surface is about 1.5 feet. 
[WOW! I would be terrified and awwed at the same time. One day I would like to go in a cage and see those beautiful creatures. Thanks for the pic!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jtug2/iama_shark_diver_at_seal_island_south_africa_ama/cbiavfq?context=5)|Well you have a connection to the shark diving world now! ;)
[What is roughly the highest that you have seen a shark ""jump"" out of the water?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jtug2/iama_shark_diver_at_seal_island_south_africa_ama/cbi9227?context=5)|Probably about 12 feet or so. I work on shark guru chris Fallow's boat and this photo from 2011 was probably it. This is 3/4 on the downward fall. it was well over the sun at its peak.

Love the name but support the stormers through and through.
 |This answer will get me some down votes!
[Very interesting AMA to read. Do Orca come around Seal Island ? Heard any stories about killer whale encounter with great white off South Africa ?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jtug2/iama_shark_diver_at_seal_island_south_africa_ama/cbiqknv?context=5)|Yup, it isnt seen every year but they come in to hunt the common dolphins, we were lucky enough to catch up with them last year. They came right up and I got a killer fb profile picture out of the encounter! check it:  [Link to imgur.com](http://imgur.com/BUaEduI)
 |I havent seen them hunt a great white but I have noticed that shark activity goes very quiet when they are in the area.
[Haha, humans are screwed either way. love it.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jtug2/iama_shark_diver_at_seal_island_south_africa_ama/cbie9i8?context=5)|Lol certainly not free from unwanted shark encounters.
[How do you distinguish the sharks from male and female? Thanks for doing this it is cool.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jtug2/iama_shark_diver_at_seal_island_south_africa_ama/cbij5jz?context=5)|Cheers man, male sharks have what are known as claspers. For a lack of better words, it looks like a big wiener hanging from where you would imagine a sharks goods to be.
 |Here is a picture i shot that shows the claspers well. it's the two pronged thing towards the caudal end (back fin) of the shark. [Link to imgur.com](http://imgur.com/TIMJVx8)
 |And yes sharks do have two dongs- have fun with that one reddit. 
[Not sure if this falls into your lap that often but have you ever seen a whale shark? If so what was your initial reaction to seeing it? Is it safe to ride them via dorsal fin or do they dive too deep?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jtug2/iama_shark_diver_at_seal_island_south_africa_ama/cbjbbh2?context=5)|I have seen and dove with them on several occassions. There are about as mellow as it gets. When to many people get around them they do tend to dive deep. At that point you just let go, head back to the boat, then wait for it to pop up again.
[Can we get a pic of you diving with the sharks?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jtug2/iama_shark_diver_at_seal_island_south_africa_ama/cbia3zf?context=5)|Sure thing. I wont lie I dont have a ton. I've never really been a huge camera guy. Im all about watching with my eyes. meaning Im at the mercy of the people i am with. none the less I will try to get one up.
[Do hammerhead sharks behave notably different than the more ""normally-shaped"" sharks?  I recall reading at some point that the wider distribution of their sensors makes them more effective hunters.  Does it also help them to distinguish between human-food and seal-food?  Also, I've noticed that there are only 3 big stars of Shark Week - great white, bull shark, and tiger shark.  Any idea why this is?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jtug2/iama_shark_diver_at_seal_island_south_africa_ama/cbime7e?context=5)|Hammerheads probably have the most well tuned electro reception capabilities. they are really good and picking out prey that is hiding in the sand and in crevices. Imagine their heads are like a metal detector. Beyond that I am not to credible of a source with the hammerheads- but they are an amazing shark.
 |The reason for only seeing those 3 shark species is simple- they sell.  
[Although you're practically living an episode on Shark Week, do you still like to watch shows from the program? If so, do you ever learn anything new?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jtug2/iama_shark_diver_at_seal_island_south_africa_ama/cbiipsi?context=5)|I like to watch the good stuff- not these 10 people who shouldnt be alive shark attack file stuff. Those docos bum me out.
 |Most docos are pretty superficial in terms of their knowledge they share but every now and then I hear something cool and new- especially when they cover sharks other than great whites.
[How did you end up working with sharks and what school/training did you need?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jtug2/iama_shark_diver_at_seal_island_south_africa_ama/cbiao1b?context=5)|It was a pretty cool little journey. I went to school for Marine Zoology and in my final year I saw an advert for a great white shark internship in Mossel Bay, South Africa and signed up for it about 4 seconds later.
 |While I was down there Chris Fallows and team came to mossel bay to film a segment for Ultimate Air Jaws. I was fortunate enough to spend the entire time working on the shoot with them and got to know chris and monique well. At the end of the shoot they offered me a job to come work for them in False Bay (Cape Town) and the rest is history. 
[Do you have any particular species that you're more fond of than others? (besides great whites i guess\).](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jtug2/iama_shark_diver_at_seal_island_south_africa_ama/cbio0k6?context=5)|A blue shark's skin is amazing- it is like a rainbow of blue when it hits the light. You dont know if you are looking at grey blue, colbalt, periwinkle, light blue, etc.
 |A mako shark skin is also amazing, it is so silver and shiny. Plus they are the fastest shark out there.
 |No picture can do justice to how beautiful a tiger sharks pattern actually is.
 |There's a couple.
[ off, thanks for doing this!!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jtug2/iama_shark_diver_at_seal_island_south_africa_ama/cbiprhp?context=5)|First off i totally recommend Guadalupe for your first experience. The conditions there are amazing. If you are scuba certified you can go into the cage that drops 10 meters down- the other two cages are just below the surface. Also, make sure to go in october/ early november. This is when all the big 5+ meter mamas come in.
[It has been a life long dream of mine to swim with sharks.  For my 40th birthday, I plan on doing it - probably at Guadalupe Island from a US based charter company.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jtug2/iama_shark_diver_at_seal_island_south_africa_ama/cbiprhp?context=5)|Look at companies that launch out of san diego and go down as opposed to ones launching from mexico. It will be cheaper from mexico but from what I have seen during my time there was the mexican boats are shaby and their cages look dodgy.
[My questions: 1\) How do I tell if they are a legit charter company, keeping safety (both mine and the sharks\) in mind?  I've read about companies feeding the sharks, rather than simply baiting them (which, I understand trains the sharks that boats/cages = food\) and others using shoddy cages.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jtug2/iama_shark_diver_at_seal_island_south_africa_ama/cbiprhp?context=5)|I would recommend Islander Charters. The price isnt outrageous, the crew works their ass off for you, the chef is out of this world and they use top notch equipment.
[2\) While I've been wanting to do this for a long time, I'm sure - once I see the shark in the water the first time - I'm going to freak.  How scary is it, the first time you see a Great White, 2-3 times larger than you, swimming towards you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jtug2/iama_shark_diver_at_seal_island_south_africa_ama/cbiprhp?context=5)|I promise that when you see the shark for the first time all your fears are going to go away and you would be in awe. It is so surreal when you see a great white (or any shark species).  What you have in your mind now is an idea of how they behave. The instant you see them you immediately develop a completely different perception of them and usually scary wont be the way you explain them from that point on.
[Sharks terrify, yet fascinate me. Love the pictures you've already provided. Great AMA so far!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jtug2/iama_shark_diver_at_seal_island_south_africa_ama/cbjbucp?context=5)|I have shark paraphernalia coming out the wazoo! When you work in this field most people tend to get you shark stuff for presents- im not complaining.
[Do you collect any shark things...a tooth or anything from your adventures?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jtug2/iama_shark_diver_at_seal_island_south_africa_ama/cbjbucp?context=5)|I do have a real great white tooth that was left behind in our seal decoy one year. they are super rare to get so that one sits in a special place. I also have a tiger shark tooth that I found via dumb luck.
[What kind of great white population is there near Seal Island. Since some great white have wide migration pattern do 'new' large great Whites from other well known areas visit Seal Island ?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jtug2/iama_shark_diver_at_seal_island_south_africa_ama/cbiqrec?context=5)|Ya the sharks are moving up and down the coast pretty regularly. They come into the island for anywhere from 1 day to several months then move on again.

[Have you ever had an experience that left you wondering why you continue to do the shark diving and do you ever think how much longer you will continue to admire sharks and study them?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jtug2/iama_shark_diver_at_seal_island_south_africa_ama/cbif0w7?context=5)|The only negative experience that I have had has been with people in the industry. Unfortunately you have to have thick skin in this industry. I know that my professional life will not always be with sharks but anytime I have to holiday will always be with them.
[Where is the safest and best place to do shark sighting in a cage? Also, what is the training for it? This is something on my bucket list. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jtug2/iama_shark_diver_at_seal_island_south_africa_ama/cbicwtt?context=5)|Cage diving requires no training and most places have everything you will need for your dive. there is an industry wide standard for cage strength. All cages are typically welded steel. We have all seen the horror photos of the shark inside the cage or pulling off the front of the cage. It would be very difficult for that to happen today given the evolution of the industry.
 |You could go to California (dont go to the Faralon Islands of San Francisco though- expensive and ver poos viz), South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand. It will be interesting to see if one pops up off new england soon too.
[Awesome, thanks! I'm not too worried about being attacked in one, I just wanted to be sure the sharks are protected and not go somewhere sketchy. You never know, and I would hate to unknowingly support that. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jtug2/iama_shark_diver_at_seal_island_south_africa_ama/cbid8p5?context=5)|It's wonderful to hear that!

[Aren't blacktips considered As being far more ferocious then big whites?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jtug2/iama_shark_diver_at_seal_island_south_africa_ama/cbiohk3?context=5)|Well you are certainly in more of a pack mentality atmosphere when diving with these guys. You need to be more aware of whats going on around you than when diving with a white shark, tiger shark or bull shark (referred to as the 3 most ""dangerous"" sharks.
 |So, I wouldnt say more dangerous, just more variables. I've dove this place countless times and still have ten fingers and ten toes.
[I've always wanted to dive or cage dive with great white sharks, but those trips are really expensive. Do you know of any options where someone would be able to volunteer in exchange for seeing/working with these amazing animals?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jtug2/iama_shark_diver_at_seal_island_south_africa_ama/cbidno7?context=5)|Off the top of my head i dont. Most companies do paid volunteer programs which would be less expensive then going out and booking as a guest but volunteer and view for free is hard to find. New Zealand is the ""newest"" emerging industry I would start down there and see what happens.
 |Otherwise Marine Dynamics in Gans Bai or White Shark Africa in Mossel Bay (both south africa) have pretty good programs.
[Have you ever had a shark other than a whale shark give attention and/or let you ride on them?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jtug2/iama_shark_diver_at_seal_island_south_africa_ama/cbjeb51?context=5)|Sure, I've rode a tiger shark, black tip shark and duskie sharks. i've held blues, makos, 7 gills.  Most dont let you ride them, it is kind of like bull riding, you hold on until they throw you.
[I figured so, but is it possible for one to still be out there?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jtug2/iama_shark_diver_at_seal_island_south_africa_ama/cbj50z9?context=5)|There always is a possibility that some relict population is hanging around somewhere far away from humans (thus why we dont see them) but I think it is unlikely.
 |It would be bad ass though!

I currently have 1 semester remaining for a bachelor in CS and will be working part-time for them once this school year starts (in around 3 weeks).

Heres my problem: I want to move into development at this company. How do I make this clear without jeopardizing my part-time (well paying, for an internship) job during school and the offer after graduation (which I would accept until I found a development role). Right now the company is slightly low on QA, which I think works against me. I believe they will tell me something like, ""We simply can't spare any QA resources right now, just wait and we will see what we can do.""

I will work to move into development regardless of my staying at this company or not (if they don't move me to dev, I will look at other positions). How can I make this known without sounding selfish?

Raw text is below. 

How I picked up programming and got offered an internship

This is a quick summary of the journey I have been on thus far on how I went from zero knowledge to an internship. I am still learning a ton every day even as I write this. To be honest, I thought programming just wasn't my thing and never would be. The biggest surprise is that the skills I gained were not from courses at school but outside of the classroom learning on my own and at my own pace. If you would like become an autodidact send me an email and I can help point you in the right direction.

High School
Throughout high school, I had been searching for my “knack” (area in which one excels). Programming had always been in the back of my mind. I thought it was interesting and powerful just never the match for me. Some of my only exposure was a computer programming class sophomore year that covered basic java. That would hold true even when I decided to go to Francis Tuttle’s Pre-Engineering Academy as I would sway more towards hardware.

Highschool never did a great job at offering challenging programming courses.
College
I chose Oklahoma State University as the spot to pursue an electrical engineering degree. My first semester there, I took Computer Science 1. This was again a semester overview of Java. The course was a requirement for my degree, and that’s all I saw it as. I had not yet decided to make the leap to taking an interest in programming. We were using tools such as Vim and Putty to complete our work. Still at the time, I had not decided that I wanted to learn programming.

Finally, I had decided I need to face my inner doubts about my programming skills. For the longest time, I had told myself there would be a perfect time to start learning.

There will NEVER be a perfect time to start learning. Now is the right time.
Coming to the point of wanting to start coding came after multiple trips to San Francisco for various conferences and events. A couple being the Intersection Event hosted by Google and Hackademic by Uncollege. In January, I started with the Python track on Codecademy by beginning of summer my profile looked like this:

Codecademy profile after a semester
At this point, I still had no idea what Github or Bitbucket were or even what a repository was. I had not fallen upon the beauty of Sublime Text. I had just took my first steps on the path that I am still traveling down now.

I began to look for internships and started at the Hire OSU Grads site. I went looking for internships that were programming based but did not require extensive knowledge. I found a couple and reached out to them in hopes to makes some leads on getting a job for the summer. Needing a recommendation to help my cause I reached out to someone in my network who was the CTO of a startup based in Oklahoma City.

Internship
To my surprise, instead of getting a recommendation I was given a internship offer I could not refuse. Within a week and a half, I had started my new internship at ShoppinPal. I had went from starting Code School to landing a R&amp;D internship that would include programming projects. Here I was given even more resources to continue my learning such as a CodeSchool &amp; Lynda account.

Codeschool account after 2 months
I wanted to share this part of my journey with you to tell you that you can learn to program too. There are tons of resources out there and if you need help on where to start or what to use reach out. I will be writing more on what I have been able to complete in my time so far at my internship. I am no where near a full on programmer yet. I am learning a ton still. I am taking a Start Up Engineering (Coursera), Try Objective-C (Codeschool) and C &amp; C++ (Lynda). I am constantly trying to learn more and apply that at my work.

Take your time and learn at your own pace. I was my biggest barrier to overcome.

1jv051,7,2013-08-06,In need of some group support,jizzlebee,leaves,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/1jv051/in_need_of_some_group_support/,"Hey all - just a warning - I plan to vent a big boy one...

I've been wanting to stop smoking up for a little while now. Whilst I'm not a daily smoker or anything like that, I've started to notice that it's becoming more and more of a part of my life. This isn't something that particularly sits well with me. I started smoking in high school but didn't really get that into it until I started at uni, about halfway through 2011. After breaking up with my ex, I started spending more and more time with mates, just having weekly smoking sessions and stuff like that. I then moved to the city with some of the guys and it turned into a regular thing. Those were the good days though. Being new to the city, living it up. We'd get high and explore, cruise around, have laughs, etc. But now it's not fun at all.

There is the occasional night where I'm in a circle of friends, having a good time, but the majority of time is spent with my house mate in the lounge room smoking up, doing nothing. I blame boredom, and the cold winter. But it's not only that; the rate at which I'm seeking weed for my private use is increasing, and I fear its going to make me anti-social. I'm not one of those people that can be productive when high either, and this is a big problem for the kind of life that I had always planned to live. 

I'm coming into my last year of uni, and since my habit of smoking has began to increase, i've seen a decrease in my grades, fitness and motivation. I'm in finance, and have just scored an internship with one of the big four professional services firms. Upon accepting, one of the first things that I thought about was ""wait, do I really deserve this?"" Of course this is what I've always wanted, but I feel as though my recent laziness renders my unworthy.

It's kind of been a wake up call, and I know now that given this opportunity, I need to redevelop the level of responsibility I once had before I started smoking so much. And I know in my mind that the only way I can do this is by quitting. My friends and I keep telling ourselves ""we will just cut down, only smoke when other people are sharing a joint"", but it's like we forget that we had the conversation, and the next day we are on the hunt for a hook up.

At the end of last year, I met a guy who had come over with a group of friends. We were all sharing a joint, but he didnt smoke. Upon asking him if he smoked weed or not he replied with ""I used to but a quit. I decided it wasn't a good thing to have in my life"". He seemed to be able to resist the urge to join in with the group, and I was envious. I wish I could be like that guy, but I really struggle with self motivation (something I never had any issues with). I don't have any issues with bud, I'm all for its legalisation etc etc, but I personally just don't think its for me. I'm sick of getting high and only feeling regret. I'm sick of having a lack of motivation and being lazy. I just need to stop once and for all. There have been too many failed attempts, I need to make this time work. I want it be able to sit there with my friends whilst they smoke, and still enjoy myself. I just need to be in the right frame of mind.

Thank you to those who were willing to read through this (probably) over detailed post. I suppose I just wanted a chance to share how I really feel in a judge free environment. I'm looking forward to everybody's advice and stories, and I will appreciate every word.

PS. I'm also trying to quit smoking cigarettes - has anyone tried to quit bud and cigs at the same time?"
1juzv7,2,2013-08-06,I just changed my major as a rising college senior and am freaking out.,collegethrowaway0001,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1juzv7/i_just_changed_my_major_as_a_rising_college/,"For the past three years I have been working towards a major (in an area I sometimes like) and a minor (that I love.) My major has always been a source of discomfort both because of the less-than-stellar job prospects and because I've never been sure it's what I want, so I bounced around and sampled different classes, hoping one would stick. Nothing did.

Towards the end of last year I decided to work towards a business minor in the vague hope it would boost my marketability and took a class that I really enjoyed, so much so that I took another. And then, because it was so intellectually challenging and had such solid job prospects, I declared it as a second major.

My first major required an internship, and I was lucky enough to get a fantastic internship in an area I *love*. It's the first and only job I could see myself pursuing as a career and feel that I would be genuinely happy working in that environment. It's a competitive field that also has rough job prospects, but my supervisor wants to have me back next summer and although it's a long shot I think there's a chance I might get hired there. 

Here's where the problem starts: I realized I would have a serious leg up if I dropped my second major and added a major and minor in areas related to my dream field. My main attachment to my second major is that it's challenging, and I was confused about my future at the time and it just kind of happened. It's a STEM major though, so it's goddamn hard to drop, but tonight, a few hours ago, I finally did it.

Now I'm freaking out because everything feels out of control, and unsafe, and uncertain. I felt so scared that I thought I might puke and felt so scared that I didn't know how to calm myself down. I just dropped a STEM major for a major/minor combo that sets me up great for my field, but what if I can't find a job? What if it's all for nothing? And to top it off, I have two years to finish it as I'm adding a fifth year -- it's really fucking tight and I'm still not sure I can pull it off. What then? What if I've made a terrible mistake -- let my family down, and spent a shit ton of tuition money for nothing?

I'm just terrified that I'll end up bitter and unemployed, and spend the rest of my life thinking back to this moment, where I had the chance to keep a solid career option and chose not to. Ugh.

**TL;DR Dropped a STEM major in favor of pursuing my dream and feel completely paralyzed with fear.**"
1juzaf,2,2013-08-06,Why do I do this to myself? [VENT][TEXTWALL],HelpMeThrowaway1277,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1juzaf/why_do_i_do_this_to_myself_venttextwall/,"Alright, so I realize my problems are very minor compared to some on this sub, and I've never really spilled my guts like this to anyone, so bear with me for a while.  I have always been kind of weird, kind of an asshole, and kind of socially awkward, which doesn't make me the best person to hang around with.  Since going away to college, I've become a lot less weird and a lot less awkward, but sometimes I'll still slip into my old habits.  I've been working on becoming less of an asshole, but that's really hard.  I also talk in a very distinctive way, which used to get me made fun of when I was younger, so I've become very self-conscious of it.

I don't talk to pretty much every friend I thought I ever had in middle and high school (with three exceptions) either because my actions caused our friendships to be over, or because we were never friends in the first place, and I finally caught on to the fact they didn't like me.  Even freshman year of college I had big troubles keeping the friends that I made (finally found a decent group sophomore year).  Because I've lost groups of friends multiple times, plus being self-conscious of my problems makes me read into things a lot more than I probably should, which brings me to a week ago.

I was hanging out with some friends from my internship, and one of them brought up my voice, then said that our boss did a good impression of it and that it was funny.  When I mentioned I never heard him do the impression, she refused to say anything more about it.  I dropped it because I didn't want to be annoying, but that, combined with hearing the way they talk about the interns they/we don't like behind their backs has made me paranoid that they don't like me, and that they talk that way about me when I'm not there.

That has led to me probably reading way too much into things like catching someone taking a snapchat video of me that when he didn't think I was looking, an offhanded comment about a picture of me from when I was drunk (from last summer), a few of them hanging out and me not being invited (but not everyone was there), overhearing some of them talking about a big intern hangout this week but nobody mentioned it to me yet, noticing that it seems like in group conversations that they're just waiting for me to leave, all behavior hadn't noticed before this week.

Anyway, all of this has led to me getting down on myself and bringing me back to those awful times of high school when I had no friends.  I don't know if what I'm experiencing is depression or not, but it sure feels like it.  I obviously just can't straight up ask them, because if they don't their obviously going to lie and then just make jokes about it later.  I can laugh about myself, especially since I know most of the things that I do that are make-funnable, but what I can't bear knowing is that people are making fun of me behind my back.  The last few days, I've laid awake at night worrying about this, when this time last week, I never would've even thought this way.  And even though I know that, I still can't shake the feeling that they hate me, and that's the worst feeling of all."
1juyo3,2,2013-08-06,"I'm a computer engineering major, but I'm not sure what I can do in the field of cs careers. Can someone help?",[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1juyo3/im_a_computer_engineering_major_but_im_not_sure/,"Okay, so my degree is in Computer Engineering. So my first questions are, how much of a disadvantage do I have to other computer science graduates, why/what they are, and if there is something I can do to put myself on par with that.

Second, I have extensive experience in Web Development as an intern and feel this is what I want to do as a career. Is this a CS career? What should a ""Developer"" or ""Software Engineer"" expect as their duties in a career? Does this also apply to development on the web? Can a person who knows Web Development also be able to learn how to use other languages/do development in other types of environments? 

Does a ""developer"" or ""software engineer"" need to supplement their education with further learning? What are some topics that appeal to CS majors as potential careers? 

Does getting a graduate degree help my chances? If so, then which degree would be the *best* one to get? IE, gives me the best opportunities to be happy and to make a lot of money? 

Computer Science - or other major which focuses on pure CompSci

Computer Engineering - an extension of my current degree 

Multimedia Experiences - a compsci related degree which focuses primarily on multimedia and presentation

Business Intelligence &amp; Analytics - a business related science degree which deals with data and what to do with it

Financial Engineering - knowing the business of financial engineering would be helpful if one wanted to write trading software 

Math....


Or is no Degree at all better?

If I worked at a company for 3-5 years, would it be really difficult to switch paths when it comes to what I'm working on? IE, say I wanted to be a front end developer, but then suddenly I decided I actually like databases more and wanted to be a DBA or a network admin and switched to that. Does having done Web Development hinder me when trying to switch tracks/careers, or does having this kind of experience help me by showing I am a hard working person who is good at what they do and can learn quickly?

Not sure...I know little to nothing about the CS industry. Thanks for helping!"

So I've been saving up my summer internship money to build a computer for school.  I've recently seen a lot of Prodigy builds and have fallen in love with the case.  However, I'm curious to learn about other cases of similar size.

I'm also not well verse with parts for it.  ie: I'm not sure which motherboard to get or the big players are for mini-atx boards.  If those could chime in with some advice, that would be greatly appreciated.  "

I haven't eaten anything more than crackers in ~53 hours because of the depression eating at me.

I should mention before I start this story that all of this stuff is long distance. I'm sure that many people have negative opinions of long distance relationships although I'd prefer if any topic about whether or not I should drop a situation like that be left out. Thanks. 

There's going to be several paragraphs of background information. Like, a lot of background information, I'm not sure how much is relevant. Pick and choose, read all of it if you're feeling particular helpful. If you actually manage to read all of this, please let me know before you actually give me feedback, I'd like to know.

Two years ago I had a friend named Ted, I had known him for about two years prior to that. We were fairly good friends, close, never arguing. On a day two years ago, he decided to introduce me to his girlfriend. He up to this point had pretended that she wasn't a long distance relationship. When I met her in my ventrilo server, she seemed nice, and I added her on Skype before the day finished. We talked every now and then, the occasional call. At this point in my life I was happy and content with everything I've had. This girl, who we'll call Janet, is one month older than me, and three years (I think?) younger than Ted. Ted lives in Virginia, Janet in Florida, I in Pennyslvania. 


We are both 15 at this point
One day, two months after we met, she began to panic in a chat for some reason. I read between the lines, but I had played dumb and forced her to go on. She gave me some cute message about shoes and her life, and put () around particular letters in the word. It spelled out ""I sort of like you"". Things evolved. We began to get intimate in chat in the coming weeks. She was still with Ted at this point. I wouldn't say it was cheating, just some flirting and having some general fun. Things continued to progress, and two months later she wanted to get explicit. Pictures, roleplay, whatever it may be. I wasn't really comfortable with this, but I tried anyway. I wasn't comfortable not because I'm not into long distance relationships, but because I wasn't sure if I wanted to go behind my friend Ted' back. But I did. Finally after awhile I just.. Told her I wouldn't do it anymore. Despite how much inside I wanted to continue being loved. Up to this point, I had been an extremely lonely person. I don't have much of a social scene at school at all, I've never had a girlfriend, and I had unknowingly been dealing with neglect from my father. (I have some skin condition that lead to grief that I'll get into later). But within the two we were flirting and doing our thing again. At some point, I made a joke and said I was going to go fap, and she said ""You have my permission to think about me when you do"". I asked about it, and she was serious. She liked the idea of it me thinking of her when I did it. So I did. It's now April of 2012 (Her birthday month). I had offered to give her my Windows 7 key (she was using vista) the month before, but she refused it. I gave it to some kid who's birthday it was, he couldn't afford Windows 7, so I thought I'd give him something to be happy about. 

Now in May, it's her birthday. I offer to buy her a new graphics card for her computer, but we get into a bit of a fight. The details are blurry. She denies a graphics card but says ""Hey, how about you just give me that windows 7 key"" and I explained to her I had given it away. She get's angry at me, one thing leads to another, we're at each other's necks. We've had several fights before this, mostly related to how moral or unmoral things are, how much time she's willing to dedicate to me rather than Ted, it began to drive me a bit crazy. I couldn't have her all to myself despite the fact that I thought I loved her. This was sort of the end, I removed her even though she said she'd cut herself. We didn't speak for a month, and when I spoke to her 30 days later she said she couldn't even look at my picture without crying. We removed each other and added each other a few times, trying to talk to each other over the next several months. 

In these short periods of talking, we kept trying to find closure for what had happened. She told me it was because she pitied me, that's why she did it. I know this really isn't possible, I know it couldn't have been pity. I don't want to sound like I'm in denial, but she had told me she liked me before she knew of any woes in my life (Also, later she reveals that was just an excuse). Finally in early May of 2013, she apologies to me. She says that she wasn't right to try to get explicit, that kind of stuff. She apologized also for even going along with the whole romance thing (I think she forgot that she started it..) and that it was her own insecurities from her childhood that lead her to it. I was relieved that we finally had proper closure. we began to talk casually, not too much, but we were beginning to become friends again.

In June (I turned 17 this month, she turned 17 the month before), Ted visited Janet in Florida for the third time. I haven't really talked to either of them in about 2 or 3 weeks. At this point, I was helping my friend in business school start up a non-profit organization. He needed someone to design a new logo with some specific parameters, I remembered that Janet is great at drawing and is wonderfully creative. So I contacted her. She was in a terrible mood, Ted had just left. I spent the rest of my night comforting her, talking to her, stuff like that. From that point on we started talking.. A lot. We became really close friends over the next two weeks, talking almost all day every day. I neglected my other friends, the people who resided in my Ventrilo (Now Teamspeak, actually) server. We began to fall asleep with eachother on Skype, talking about the past and the future, talking about us and how happy that we're friends again. We just seemed to.. Work together. She introduced me to some friends that she plays some games with and talks to all the time. 12/13 year old girls, they were really nice. We got along great, all of us. I even spent some of the money that I reserved for birthday spending to buy one of them Guild Wars 2 so that Janet would be more interested in trying it with me (I don't have someone to give me money, it's money leftover from when I used to do freelance webdesign work for people local and some work for people I found on forums). I also contributed 180 dollars worth of parts and paid for half of shipping to the computer Ted was building Janet. I don't know how to explain it.. But having her as a friend was one of the best things I remember. But I was dealing with depression. My father was abusing me emotionally (He is the only one I live with), I feared for my physical safety in some cases. He has a few mental problems (understatement). I was lonely, extremely lonely. I might sound like I'm bullshitting, but I honestly don't care about sex, that's not my drive in women. I don't care about myself, I don't have motivation. My motivation at that point was that hopefully I'd find someone who I could love and care for. That's why I even bothered in school, that's why I kept going on. The dim hope that I'd find someone to love (and have love me back).. This really threw me into depression. 2-3 hours every night I would spend sulking sometimes where Janet wouldn't even be able to talk to me.. She knew the problem, and she felt bad. (She didn't know that everytime she mentioned her relationship that it killed me a little inside, hearing how nice love is, I couldn't tell her that.). I know that rather then sulking, I should have just done something, but I'd like to defend myself. 

I was born with a skin condition called x-link ichthyosis. This makes my skin look extremely dry, disgustingly so. It makes me look like a lizard man when it's not even at it's worse. I get scales and I shed, it's really disgusting, I can't describe it. Find some pictures. I can't sweat, which makes working out hard, so I'm a bit chubby (not fat, not skinny. I'm not happy with my weight but I'm not really upset). You know how kids in school are. In the 5th grade people began to realize I'm different. I was discriminated against, I lost my friends. My mother had gotten several DUIs at this point and left my dad. I live in a fairly Christian community and their parents told their kids to stay away from me. I was okay.. I got on. I began to use the internet for my social interaction and my entertainment. In the 6th grade I was treated and labeled as less than human. I got over it, I moved on. It's whatever. Things have gotten a bit better and I have some people who can tolerate my disgusting shit now (I wouldn't really call them friends. I go to a vocational school for half the day to learn networking and IT stuff. They have to get along with me), but god forbid girls talk to me, lizard man who can't do a damned thing about his skin shit. I included this just for some perspective on why I feel so lonely and why it was starting to get to me seeing as my only motivation to live and try to succeed is the hope for love.

My self worth was pretty much nothing. But I had Janet, some girl who I actually care about. I didn't really admit to myself that I love her. I just decided that she's an extremely nice and considerate girl that deserves my care and time more so than anyone else. I did what I could to keep her happy. One time when we were both in bed falling asleep talking, we were thinking back about when we were first.. together, I guess. And the ""You have my permission"" thing got brought up. One thing led to another, she ""gave me her permission"" again. I was a bit confused.. dazed I guess. ""She's my best friend.. Is this alright?"", but I did. And I didn't end the call to do it. She didn't want me to. At that point we began to get romantic again.. We stayed up all night and just kept talking. We were pretty much falling in love.. Things continued to escalate, we became secret lovers. I felt a bit bad about Ted.. I couldn't bring myself (the sad and lonely fuck I was and am) to stop what was going on though. A week later it was that time of the month for her, one thing led to another, we both did our thing over skype together while in bed, ""Hey.. This is a secret.."" ""Oh yeah.. I know, don't worry Janet"" ""Not that.. But that I'm falling in love with my best friend."" We began to think about a future together.. We came up with a lot of strange things that brought us together and would make it work. She has Eczema, something related to ichthyosis. She lives in Florida, a humid environment where my skin condition would barely show (because of the humidity). Her brother in law could provide me an internship and even a job in the field that I'm currently studying in for half the day during high school if I go to college down there (the same college she was planning to go to, actually). The fact that I had been assigned to find someone to design a logo the day that she really needed someone there to help her.. Even the fact that we're so close in age.  And so many similar things about us that just made us work.. Plus a bunch of other strange coincidences that just made it seem like the universe wants us together. I was in love.. I am in love still.. Two days later she felt bad though. She confessed to her religious and control freak mother that she'd just been flirting with another guy. She pretty much forced Janet to confess to Ted and to stop talking to me. I cried. Janet removed me, my best friend and my lover. For two days we were apart, I removed Ted because I didn't know how he'd react (Do bare in mind all she told him was that we were just flirting). But she re added me, she felt bad. She said she couldn't be without me and honestly I couldn't be without her. 

Now the middle of July, we weren't afraid anymore. We were lovers, we loved being together. But she told me about some problems in her relationship. She told me how Ted was neglecting her, how he pretty much only wanted to use her for sexual relief.. I had no clue to this point. Ted had always been a good friend to me, buying me things, playing games with me, being friendly. But I had noticed he'd changed a bit in recent months. So I told her how to fix it. I told her to confront him, I told Janet to yell at Ted. That was honestly what I thought would fix it, I didn't want to see either of them go through a breakup. I could have sabotaged them or just let it die without my interference.. But I didn't.. I couldn't. Ted began to change himself after Janet yelled at him. But she was still really annoyed at him. Even when he was doing just fine.. She got annoyed. She didn't remember why she loved him, or so she told me. I had to consistently tell her to calm down and to give him more of a chance. It killed my every time I told her that. I even began to give him advice on what to do better and what to change, again, always killed me a little inside. At this point we were still madly in love, talking all day and all night every day and every night. we never ran out of things to talk about. She was barely even giving him a chance still.. I didn't complain really though. 

________________________________________________________________________________________________

I would like to recap how we feel for eachother now. We are madly in love behind her boyfriends back. I fucking love(d) this girl, I can't stress that enough. The way she treats me, the way she wanted to have a future with me, the way she cared for me, the way she.. loved me. I can't get over that.. It brings me to tears just typing this bit. This is the happiest period in my life, sharing love with this girl. I wasn't lonely.. I wasn't empty for the first time in so long. She was the only girl in my life that cared for me, the only person. I don't have parents that care for me (honestly), and the only family that I can say I love and loves me back is my sister, who now lives elsewhere. She was my world, my motivation, my inspiration. Everything I cared about is in this girl. We were so ready to start a life together.. I would run miles for this girl.. Anything. 


15 days before I post this, she left for her semi-annual vacation to Key West. She insisted on buying me some stuff down there, and we texting pretty much the entire time she was gone. Although her mother being extremely religious and a control freak found out. She wasn't happy that Janet would always talk to me. She thought I was just trying to manipulate Janet while their relationship were going through hard times.. She was wrong. I was genuinely trying to help their relationship.. I was trying to be good. I cared and care for her. I really do. I just wanted her to be happy and I didn't want to see a breakup happen. It would kill her, and Ted. Her mother was so agonizing and bitchy about it at one point that I had to get Ted to text Janet's mother that I was honestly trying to help with their relationship. 

So after her vacation where nothing less than us getting closer happened, we got back on our regular routine. She got back on the Saturday before this post. We watched movies together, we spoke, and we had skype sex in bed (I know this sounds pathetic), we did what we used to. Our love had never been stronger really. Sunday night, we watched a movie called Easy A. I liked it and she enjoyed sharing a movie she liked with me. Afterwards, she told me a little bit about a book she read (In the turmoil I've forgotten the name). It was about a girl who had rumors spread about her, she killed herself. Before doing this though, she made tapes and sent a different one to 13 people that brought her to it. The tapes were recorded and put on the books website. She had me listen to one, I was intrigued. She asked if I wanted to go on and I said ""I have on connection to this character, but I'd love to. Rather, though, how about I read this when school starts and then we'll come back to these tapes"". I didn't want to just sit there and nod my head and say ""Yes, Janet, wonderful."" I care about everything she shows me and talks to me about. I wanted to make it meaningful. She seemed upset at this, but we moved on. A few minutes later, we got into a discussion about how bad girls have it in high school. I disputed and said how I went through a lot of shit. And I did, and I told her that was able to swallow it down and move on, counted my blessings and whatnot. She went away for five minutes, came back and said she has a headache, she wants to listen to music, and she's nauseous. It is now 1:00 in the morning on Monday. We said goodnight and hung up. I apologized in chat just in case I had done something to annoy her. She said she didn't want to talk about it. For awhile she had her name set to Janet &lt;Ted's last name&gt; on skype, but she changed it. When she hung up, she changed it back to that. I felt like throwing up. I asked her Ted and he said that Janet was upset about our alleged argument (There was no argument) about rumors+girls vs skin condition. I went to bed confused, extremely confused.

I woke up and logged on a bit later than usual. I felt something bad was coming, I don't know what.. But I knew. When I logged on, she told me that we had to stop. She felt bad and she needed to focus on Ted. Out of the blue, there were pretty much no problems until this point.. A few arguments here and there but they weren't even usually arguments.. My heart sank, but I understood. I knew she was right. I began to hate myself, I regretted helping their relationship. I felt abandoned, I felt like a failure.. But I didn't show her that. I noticed something though, she was pretty much asking for me to stop talking to her, remove her from Skype and be done with it. I realized she'd distanced herself from me.. That hurt most. The fact she'd closed herself off. I began to cry, I couldn't stop. I wanted to scream, I didn't even have my best friend anymore. It sent me over the top to the point of no return. I lost her.. I lost my love, the only person who I've cared about for the past two months.. I felt like I wasn't worth the air I was breathing. After some talk.. I finally decided to remove her later in the day. She threatened to cut herself to me when I did it. I was confused.. She told me that she was sorry for acting so distant, but she didn't know what to do. She had to close herself off.. I sort of just accepted it. But I kept crying yesterday.. I wanted to scream, I wanted to yell, I wanted to smash something. I knew things couldn't go back to normal.. And to be honest, I didn't want them to. I already missed her.. I missed being loved.. I missed loving her. I felt empty, lost, abandoned.. I felt so many different pains. I went looking for pity so I told her that I had plans to take 10 of my dad's sleeping pills. One a day so that I could sleep for ten days and leave this whole two months behind as a bad dream.. I had the pills ready and I was about to do it.. I decided not to though. She was seriously concerned, or so it seemed. She said a few things that convinced me there might still be something between us, even if it was just her caring about me as a person. I didn't care about myself, I needed someone else to. I still had the issue where I felt like screaming, where I would always end up crying. But I got on with it. Later in the night she skyped me and we talked for a bit.. As friends. But I broke down. I started crying on the call, I missed her. I missed being loved by her, and I missed showing my love for her. I told her she should end the call, because I wasn't in a good place to talk. She apologized for everything, closing herself off and ever causing any issues. For hurting me. I asked her over IM what had changed.. What had made her want to suddenly stop.. I regret asking it. She responded with ""When I had my date with Ted the other night... and we had fun... it made me start thinking.. It wasn't you."". I totally lost it. I can't explain. I felt like a tool bag, I felt used, I felt useless, I felt terrible. It was a different kind of hurt, one I can't describe.. Everytime I think about it I start to cry.. I never felt so alone.. So empty. I removed her from my Skype list out of desperation after pretty much breaking down to her about how much of a worthless piece of shit I am, how that's all I'm good for; being used. She again, said she would cut herself. I didn't believe her. But she went ballistic to her boyfriend Ted. She got him to remove me on Skype. I still had him added on Steam, but I was offended. It hurt that after all I'd done for him; he'd do that. I removed him from steam and sent him various bad messages. It hurt she'd go out of her way to hurt me. I went to bed crying.

Today we started texting. She realized how bad she'd been to me and apologized. She said the ""It wasn't you.."" thing wasn't actually true. It was just a way to detatch herself from me.  She kept saying ""But I have a boyfriend.. What do you want me to do?"" So I just told her to do what feels right.. I told her about all the times we had and how that felt right, being with her, loving her, being loved back. She agreed it felt right.. But she still couldn't, apparently.. I almost started begging that she took me back. I agreed to just be friends with her, but every time I think about her I just.. I feel like shit. I miss her, I miss all that was, I miss thinking of all that could be. I miss imagining her touch and being with her.. I miss hoping to meet her soon and to share our happiness in person. The best I can do for myself is to just not think about her.. Or else I just get overwhelmed with sadness and regret..  But I can't bring myself to stop talking with her.

I know she's right.. I know that what was going on was wrong.. but it just felt so right... I was.. Am so in love with her. Is she right.. Does it really have to stop? Is it wrong enough? Is the right thing to do really so right?

It's now been about 55-56 hours since I've last eaten a meal (I've had crackers and ginger ale once about four hours ago). I can't eat.. I can't think.. I can't stop crying. I don't know what to do. I feel like a worthless piece of shit, I feel so much regret, I feel like I want to just stop living.. I don't have motivation, not any in the slightest. I can't function at all.. It's just constant sadness.. I have no clue what to do. Please help me. I'm so alone and I'm in so much pain. I am seriously again considering using those sleeping pills to hibernate for ten days (I will eat in between sleeps), and I feel like throwing myself out of my window."
1jumcz,9,2013-08-06,I [F/22] think long distance is making me not attractive to my boyfriend [M/25]. Oh and we're supposed to move in together soon.,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1jumcz/i_f22_think_long_distance_is_making_me_not/,"Throwaway, all day. (JK I have an account, I just don't want to be identified for this current problem)


H'ok. So I recently graduated college and got a job in a large city far away from home. My boyfriend (even though he's a little older) just graduated also but hasn't been able to find a job. We decided that whichever of us got a steady job first, the other person would move to their location. So he's coming to my city. I have a temporary lease that's running out in September so I need to find permanent housing soon. Since we'd probably be spending most of our time together anyway, we planned to move in together.


So that's the external situation. Here's the internal battle I'm having. I had this crush on this guy. He was a friend of a friend, it was nothing but physical and I didn't act on it. He was SO attractive and charming, but he was just an intern and was moving back to his hometown at the end of the summer (he left two weeks ago). We texted and hung out and flirted a lot (...like I said, it didn't go beyond that. I promise!) But I started comparing this guy to my boyfriend. Not only was he attractive but he's done so much in life and has so many plans for his future. His ambition was crazy hawt.


After my crush left, I was surprisingly sad. I missed him and missed having someone that fun to talk to. We really clicked. It got me thinking that I'm settling down too quickly with my boyfriend. I'm 22, fresh out of college and in a new place. Aren't your 20's supposed to be fun? Shouldn't I be meeting new people like my crush and just having a good time?


I love my boyfriend so much. We've been together for 3 years and have been through so much together. He's my best friend and we've talked a lot about marriage. But being in this city makes me realize how much more I want in life before I settle down. If I want to travel the globe, I want to be able to just go without having to worry about another person. Lately it's been really hard to be attracted to him. I rarely feel like talking to him, I never want to do sexy phone things and I'm certain he's picking up on these signs. I hate saying this, but he doesn't hold a candle to my ambitious crush. My boyfriend is completely lost when it comes to this ""real world"" stuff and I feel like I'm taking care of him a lot. It's a huge lady-boner kill. I'm fearful to commit to living together for a year or so because I'm afraid we'll break up. I'm afraid this isn't just long distance woes and I've just changed and want different things. I know he's what I want in a husband EVENTUALLY, I just don't think I want that right now. I can't afford to live in a place alone on my income and I would feel horrible if I made him uproot his life and move just to be dumped. So if he moves in with me, and we break up I'm screwed. I'm so torn if I should get a roommate and have my fun 20's like I imagined or if I should stick with what I hope is still a healthy relationship and move in with my boyfriend. I'm running out of time to decide because the places I can afford aren't going to be available for long.


So here are my questions for people who may have been in similar situations: Is the long distance just distorting my view of my boyfriend? Or does long distance actually RUIN relationships? Is there hope for us? Has anyone lost attraction to a S/O because of another crush? What did you do? What do I do? :( Halp reddit.


**TL;DR: I'm not attracted to my boyfriend anymore but I don't know if it's just our long distance situation or a change from within me. Also, we're supposed to be moving in together real soon.**"
1jum20,3,2013-08-06,Hollywood's Propaganda 2013 - a necessary evaluation (r/conspiracy),hewbet123,ConspiracyResearch,https://www.reddit.com/r/ConspiracyResearch/comments/1jum20/hollywoods_propaganda_2013_a_necessary_evaluation/,"I submitted a post about 5 months in r/politics regarding the onslaught of propaganda in the movie industry in 2013. It was after this that I began to delve deeper into much of the topics that are discussed on this forum, and I feel that the topic deserves a reprisal here. In my opinion, the realization that there is a propaganda effort in Hollywood solidifies many of the suspicions regarding the way in which this world is actually ran, namely, a centrally coordinated effort to influence the public's perceptions which is clearly integrated with the USA's military industrial complex (I know this isn't new).

Furthermore, If we look at the themes promoted in many of the trailers for these films, they coincide with the idea that the government is in the business of promoting fear, specifically based around the formulated fear of the boogie man terrorists that we are told are out to get us.

Lastly, the sheer magnitude and repetition of themes might make you wonder what the motivation behind this propaganda is all about. Is it simply supposed to alter perceptions, or is this an example of the 'elites' revealing to the public they're intentions? Is it propaganda or suggestion, or both, or neither?

Here is a list of the films that I noticed a few months ago, with notable features from the trailers in brackets next to the films. Whilst reading them, please be aware of the premise that this effort, taken as an aggregate, is intended to:

a) Remind people of the atrocity of 911 and terrorism to keep people supportive (through fear) of expansive military efforts. b) Desensitize the public to violence and conflict, to perpetuate the attitude that 'this is the way things are' c) Create an atmosphere of apparent turmoil and apocalypse. d) Induce collective association to America, or patriotism.

That is the main body of films that caught my attention, about 5 months ago. Literally a week ago, I took a stroll down my local high street and noticed that the billboard adverts on the side of the local buses were exclusively dedicated to the promotion of three films, accompanied by a caption for each...

This is the End - ""nothing ruins a party like the end of the world""
The Internship - ""they're crashing the system""
Pacific Rim - ""go big or go extinct""

I invite you to watch these trailers as a whole with the premise in mind. In my opinion, if these films aren't explicitly intended to achieve these aims, then it's a hell of a coincidence how well they coincide with an effective propaganda effort.

What really takes the piss is that we buy tickets for this stuff.

Propaganda, suggestion, both or neither?

Help.",desperateandthrowing,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1jultg/been_told_i_kick_ass_at_multiple_internships_but/,"I graduated from a top 10 US college, studied political science and am looking for a job anywhere close to the media. Not a journalist, but marketing, PR, advertising, research, academia - as long as it's close to the media and pays okay, I'm at least willing to try it. 

I've had internships in all of the above fields and, not to sound arrogant, but I feel I've done a pretty good job. I've performed well throughout and have stellar letters of recommendation from all of them. But no one will actually hire me full-time, because...

I need a visa. 

I understand that handicaps me. I know I should be in a ""high demand"" field like engineering or programming. I know it's asking a lot of potential employers when there are tons of qualified citizens who need jobs too. 

But I know I'm a good worker. I know I can add to an organization. I'm sharp, I'm willing to learn and I work really hard. I was told straight by a supervisor: ""Everyone in the office loves you, you're our favorite intern and you add huge value to our accounts, but we can't hire you because you need a visa.""* So a bunch of other interns are getting hired, while I get to remain an intern because ""they'll have me for as long as I want to stay."" Unfortunately, I can't afford to be an intern for much longer. 

(*The company has thousands of employees, but the entry-level position is on an hourly wage, and apparently there are issues with paying non-citizens overtime.)

The vaguely good news is that my home country has an FTA with the US that makes a visa for me significantly easier to get than a typical H1B. Lower cost, less paperwork, less time, less risk. 

But still, it's work that they wouldn't have to do if they employed a US citizen. It's hard enough to get a company to give me a chance, but I don't just need a chance - I almost need a favor, because of the extra work. And I'm just getting really discouraged. 

So, I don't know what I'm asking. Maybe just a listening ear. But if you know of someone who's navigated a similar situation, or if you have any advice for me, or hell - if you think your company (or a friend's company) would be willing to give me the time of day for a salaried position - please, please let me know. Any advice is welcome.  "

So I received my offer today, and it was a bit underwhelming, but I'm unsure whether I'm overreacting or not. Here's a quick overview.

* Fortune 60 tech company.
* Greater Boston Area (emphasis on Greater, but I'd like to live closer)
* Computer Science Degree, Bachelors
* 1st Full Time Salaried Job
* 22 Years Old
* Non-""Elite"" School (you've definitely never heard of it) 
* Experience: 2 months at current co-op, 8 months previous co-op, 11 months previous CS related job. 

The offer was for 71k base (making 61.5 as an intern right now) bonuses and what not bump it up to about 78k. Plus a one time relocation fee (I'm from New York) that based off my intern relocation fee, will be about $2000, bumping me up to 80k before tax (are bonuses before tax??) for my first full year.

The number I had in my head before the offer was presented was 80k base, considering the major metropolitan area close by, the prestige of the company, general salary for CS majors, etc. I've tried to do my due diligence, and 80k base stuck in my head. I don't know, something about it just.. stuck. 

Anywho, like I said I was a little underwhelmed with the base, the benefits seem to be all in order (3 weeks vacation, health, vision, the works) and I really like the company and the work I'm doing, my only issue was wanting to live closer to Boston (big city kid at heart I guess) and I thought the 80k base number would compensate for that. 

The HR rep said that their offer was based on a formula that took into account degree level, school, major, and experience, and I got the vibe that this is non-negotiable. I told her I would review the offer and give her a response soon, were my expectations too high? Is this a solid offer or am I getting low balled?

Thanks for reading."

1jzchi,6,2013-08-08,"Me[24F] and my ex [23M] dated 7 years, mutually broke up almost one year ago with the understanding it was temporary. Now I need help deciding what to do next.",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1jzchi/me24f_and_my_ex_23m_dated_7_years_mutually_broke/,"I'll try to keep this as brief as possible, but it's a bit of a long story because it's taken place over roughly eight years.


My ex and I met when we were both in grade 11 of high school. We immediately became very close as friends, then began dating several months later. Dating your best friend is a lot of fun. We were each other's ""firsts"" for a lot of things, including sex.


After high school, we went off to university. We both went to different ones- they were very far from our hometown, but only about an hour or so away from each other, so we decided to do a long-distance relationship. After visiting him at his university a couple of times, I decided to transfer to his university for my second year. Because of my transfer, and his decision to switch into a different program, we had to each re-do our first years (we did five years at university, four of them at the same one).


In our third year of university, we moved into an apartment together. The apartment was a shit-hole, but we loved living together. We talked about marriage eventually and maybe having kids together someday. My family moved away to a different city that year, so we would no longer see each other over Christmases and summer breaks (the summer breaks were difficult because for four months, we would be in different countries with a six-hour dime difference between us).


After a year of living together, we both came to the realization that we had become very caught up in each other. So we decided it would be healthy that when our lease was up for the year, to each move in with friends. We did this for our last two years of university, but still saw each other practically every day.


Our last year together was a little tense because he had decided it was best for him, career-wise, to go do a specific graduate program in another country. This kind of program, for whatever reason, is not really offered in our country. We debated doing a long distance thing again, but in the end decided it would be best for us to break up. The reasoning behind this was that since we had been dating since we were 15/16, we never really got a chance to see who we were as individuals. Perhaps we were just comfortable being together, and not as in love as we believed we were. So while I tried to be supportive of him, it was hard because now there was a definite end date to our relationship. We both knew it was the right decision, but it was extremely difficult. We both have the same goals and ambitions, the same morals and values. We are so similar in all the important ways, but different enough in our interests and hobbies that we are still interesting to each other. Our relationship and our sex life was very healthy, and we hardly ever fought the entire time we were together. It was hard for both of us to give that up. I don't want to minimize his feelings, I know it was an extremely difficult decision for him to make, and I probably didn't make it easy for him. However, I felt very hurt because at the time, I felt (wrongly) like this decision meant I wasn't important enough to him.


So we graduate, he leaves at the end of that summer, and we are both devastated and questioning the logic behind our decision to break up. I cannot find work in my field, so I moved back home with my parents and get part-time work to help pay my bills and keep me distracted. I am so sad. I know he was too, but we tried not to talk to each other much because we weren't a couple anymore. Also, there was now a five-hour time difference between us.


When we do talk, I learn that he is having a great time. I am both extremely happy for him- he has made some truly fantastic friends, and is living in a beautiful city with a ton of culture- but (irrationally) hurt that he has appeared to move on so fast, while I am still miserable. We had been dating for seven and a half years by the time we broke up. There were several months that went by where I was very angry at him. I deleted him and all his family from all my social networks (childish, I know) so I wouldn't have to see pictures or hear updates about any of them. However, we did keep in touch. We both found it nearly impossible to stop talking with each other, so there were the occasional emails and infrequent Skype calls.


Around February of this year, I stopped being so angry, and things got back to normal between us. Since then, we send emails and messages almost daily (we have become very fond of Google Hangout), and do video calls where we talk for hours and hours on end, every few weeks. We tell each other absolutely everything and I have no reason to believe that he would be lying to me. I know he has been trying to date other people, but it has gone no where and he doesn't have much desire to seriously date anyone anyway. He has kissed a few girls, but I trust him when he says that's been it. As for me, a couple of months ago, I decided that maybe I was ready to try dating, too. So I've been on some dates with a few different guys, and have kissed some of them, but it's been nothing serious. What it has done is make me realise that I am still firmly in love with this guy.


I know he still has feelings for me; he tells me that I'm his best friend, and that he loves when we talk, and enjoys all the things and messages we send each other. We send dirty pictures and texts to each other, and more than a few times, he's watched me strip and touch myself on our video chats. He tells me when he pictures his future, I'm in it; we still get married, we still have the life we've always talked about having together. There's just this gap between now and then, and he doesn't know how long that gap will last. Now that his program is almost finished, he has decided that he will be staying in that country (he has dual-citizenship) because he has a better chance of getting a job or internship there (which is probably true, I am having no luck in my field either), and quite frankly, it's just cheaper to be there than to come all the way back here. 


Because we now have no idea when we will be seeing each other again, I've brought up the notion of going to visit him sometime this coming spring. He wants to, but tells me he's nervous because what if one of us decides we don't care as much as we thought for the other person and we lose each other entirely. I am now worried about this, too. 


What I'm asking you- if you've made it this far- is if that risk is worth it? This is a lot of money for a plane ticket, and there's no guarantee that either of us will come out better for it. What if it ends up making this worse for us? What if I lose him forever over this? I'd rather be friends than not have him in my life at all. I need some outside perspective on this. Do you think this is a lost cause, or something worth fighting for?


**tl;dr: Dated a guy for 7 years, agreed to break up for him to pursue education in another country which he now wants to stay in for reasons unrelated to me. We stayed in close contact, I still love him, and now want to know if I should go visit him to find out if our relationship is salvageable.**"

I was wondering how does it look to go for a second bachelor's degree? 

I am 22, and I recently graduated with a chemical engineering degree, but the job prospects seem very bleak. I have been over at /r/ChemicalEngineering and a lot of the threads seem depressing. To give you an idea, I saw multiple threads where recent grads are unemployed and some are thinking of going for a masters in a different field cause they couldn't find an entry level chemical engineering job. 

I was thinking of getting a BS in CS or Computer Engineering. My plan would be to go to a CC for 2-3 years then transfer to a 4 year and finish up my degree. The thing is I'll be 27 or 28 when I come out because I'll be working part time (either in retail or after i get some classes under my belt - an internship) throughout this as well. 

Will my age or the fact that I went for a second degree affect my future employment? Or if I go for grad school later, will getting my degree affect that ?

1jyqml,369,2013-08-08,"""You're showing a real lack of commitment to this company.""",[deleted],TalesFromRetail,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/1jyqml/youre_showing_a_real_lack_of_commitment_to_this/,"First time posting, hope I do this correctly.

My first job was working as a sales associate in one of those big nationwide stores that sell almost everything. Now by sales associate, I should really say I was the store bitch. I got hired a few months after my 16th birthday to work the products part of the floor. Over the next year and a half I worked in literally every single department possible. This included:

Clothing, Electronics, Food Alley, Registers, Customer Service, Cart Attendant, Returns, and Back Room (despite the fact I was not 18). I never complained and never had a problem going where I was asked.

Then my yearly review came up for my raise... My maximum potential raise would be 25 cents, not much but still exciting for a new person in the work force. What I didn't realize was that all those times covering shifts, coming in early, NEVER (repeat never calling out), etc would not mean jack when it came to my raise.

Out of a possible 25, I got 4 cents. Yes, 4 cents. The reasoning being that I was often ""all over the place and unable to focus on my task at hand."" The examples they gave me were that when an extra cashier was needed and no one answered the call over the radio, me asking if they needed me to come down followed by an answer of ""yes"" meant I was doing the wrong thing. Go figure.

Despite all these BS I kept working there (later found out the stoner kid at electronics got a 24 cent raises despite the fact he called out all the time and would take breaks 3x as long as required). Then school came around for my senior year and I joined cross country as a means of trying to get into better shape, so I worked less as a result, often only getting 8 hours a week.

Then, a month or so after the stock market crash and the recession began I got called into my HR manager's office. He explained to me that he asked me if I would be willing to work at least 25 hours a week (still in high school, doing sports at the time, and had a girlfriend at the time so I was already stretching it when it came to my availability). I told him no, then this happened.

""Well, I'm sorry to say but we are doing to have to let you go then.""

""What? Why?""

""You aren't willing to work as much as we need you to, it isn't worth putting you on the payroll. Friday (this happened on a monday) will be your last day.""

I took it in stride, left after my shift was over and applied at another place a bunch of my friends worked at and got hired with a higher starting wage within 2 days. I went in on thursday to tell the HR guy as much.

""Hey, no hard feelings. I already found a new job so I'll be okay, thanks again for everything, (he was a nice guy to me before this all). I start my new job tomorrow so I obviously won't be able to work my shift here.""

He looks up at me as if I just took a shit on his desk and called his mother a whore.

""You what!? You're kidding right?""

""No, why would I be?

""XXXXX you're showing a real lack of commitment to this company. This is incredibly unprofessional of you, when someone puts in their two weeks notice they don't-""

I snapped, tired of his bullshit.

""MY two weeks notice!? You're the asshole who fired a high school kid for not working more hours which would only make me end up working here for the rest of my life and you think I'm unprofessional? Fuck you.""

Stunned, he just stared at me, mouth wide open. At this point a crowd had gathered outside his door.

""I think you should leave""

""I think I should, all this bullshit is making me lightheaded.""

I left, and never went back. I just graduated college and started a paid internship in the field I studied, I later found out the HR guy was transferred to a different store and was fired about a year ago.

TL;DR: Worked my ass off, company didn't give a shit and gave me a horrible raise. When economy slowed down, they asked me to work WAY too many hours despite being in high school, let me go as a result. I got a better job and the HR guy freaked when I told him I couldn't work my last shift."

I don't greatly enjoy programming, but I do enjoy doing network related things so I was thinking of working as a sys admin. This summer I got a paid internship as a sys admin to see what it would be like. I don't know if it was the people or the job itself, but I absolutely hated it. They would give me a task I had no idea how to complete, I would get little to no explanation about anything and even though google helped me a lot and I managed to complete most of what they gave me I felt like a complete failure. I think worst of all for me was the work atmosphere. No one would talk to anyone, and there were 4 people in our room. If anything was ever said it was about work. I am, I guess, a more social person than that and I felt horrible. I am no longer sure that I even want to work in this field. During my high school years I studied the Japanese language and culture comprehensively and I have been learning the way of the Tea for the last 6 or 7 years and I will probably go to Kyoto on a scholarship for 1 year to study more. I am trying to think of a way to make a living off of that, but I'm not sure I can...

I was walking home from the office where I intern yesterday and I notice a guy following me. Scraggly, maybe homeless, maybe not. Now this is in the middle of the city's shopping area so there are plenty of people around but I guess for some reason he picked me out of the crowd to sexually harass. 

He got closer to me and I could hear what he was saying, not under his breath, but loud enough for other people to hear. He was talking about my hair, about my clothes, about how he wanted to fuck me and many, many more disgusting, demeaning, sexual things. 

I didn't turn around, I didn't make any sort of gesture to make him think that I could hear, him, I just kept walking, and he started talking louder. He followed me for about two blocks until I could finally duck into an H&amp;M to get away from him. 

I was horrified. I felt violated and disrespected and I'd never had that sort of sexual harassment happen before. Yeah, catcalls or comments on the street but never to this extent. In retrospect I probably should have called the police like my boyfriend said but I didn't want to wait around anywhere near that man.

I was waiting to meet my boyfriend in a little bit and so I decided to do a bit of shopping even though I was on a no-buy. Retail therapy, dumb of a concept as that is, actually works on me. I looked through the regular rack of pencil skirts and recognized a design from months ago. The tag had a clearance sticker for $20, reduced from $35. I thought, ""Yeah, okay, I can do $20."" 

Got up to the register and the total came up to a whopping **$5**. ""Are you kidding me?!?"", I said. I got a fantastic deal and was lucky enough to avoid attracting the man's attention again, as he was waiting right outside the H&amp;M when I left. 

So that's my dumb little silver lining story. I'm not one to look on the bright side of things but now I just might try a little harder. "

1jxru9,5,2013-08-08,Me [26M] freaking out over breaking up (for the 2nd time) with SO[28F] after realising I want her to be the mother of my children -- course of action?,DocDon,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1jxru9/me_26m_freaking_out_over_breaking_up_for_the_2nd/,"Here is how the full story goes. bear with me if this gets a little long. So i met this girl as I was a med student (i was 23 at the time) and she was my intern. the chemistry was instantaneous and we started going out after a short time. From that time we were almost inseperable, spending a lot of time together. Around 3-4 weeks in the relationship i gave her the keys to my place once and she just kept them. it came naturally and didnt bother me at all. For the next year or so she would spend most of her nights at my place because i lived litterally 2 mins away from the hospital. I come from a very liberal family and she comes from a conservative family and her mother is a very devout christian on the edge of fanatic. The fact that she was a surgery intern with many moonlighting duties was a good cover for her spending nights outside her parents' house. So anyway, coming from a conservative family, she was always very eager about marriage and kids, the earlier the better. As far as I was concerned, it was out of the question for at least the next five years, as i was still young and wanted to live my life. I was very clear right from the beginning. She woukd settle down for a while and not talk about it and then 2-3 months later the issue would arise again. She also was very jealous at the slightest of things and it would get sometimes quite suffocating, as I am a very independent person who does like his solitude once in a while. however, i never swayed from my initial honesty and i kept saying i wasnt ready for marriage anytime soon. Eventually I broke up with her because I felt i could not promise her what she needed me to, and her jealousy was sometimes suffocating (though it was not the main cause of the break-up).




Fast forward 3 month. Since we were both attending the same hospital, we kept seeing eachother often and eventually we jumped on each other and we were back together. Everything was Smooth this time around. She wouldnt nag about the marriage stuff and we both knew better than thinking too far ahead. Or so i thought until one night she burst out crying about how her ovaries were a ticking clock and she wanted kids in 3 yrs time. that was the beginning of when i started to grow a little distant over months. there was also the jealousy issue which never really went away, despite the fact i was always faithful. In addition, i had moved from my old appartment to another town about 45-60 min away cuz i had graduated and i was working in a private practice there. This had made it logistically more difficult to see each other as often as we used to and created some distance in the relationship. I was also working crazy stressful hours.Also, I had gained a lot of weight during med school and I was determined to shave them off with lots of sport and watching what I'd eat. She wasnt that suportive and seemed more interested in checking out this or that new fancy restaurant in town, or generally making plans that suited her instead of encouraging me to continue my training (i was in the mindset to do a long distance endurance race that required months of disciplined training). In the end it all accumulated and I grew more distant. Also, i was set to travel abroad in a few months time to continue my specialization.One time after a very long day she called and wanted to do something. I couldnt think staright from the stress and i kinda told her to leave me alone for now, that i needed to catch my breath after work. So she messages me later that evening, saying im growing distant and angry, and that she no longer wants to be in a relationship with me if im gonna remain distant and angry. This triggered something that had beeen in the back of my mind for a while and I broke up with her.




fast forward 6 months. I've had the opportunity to date a couple of other girls, and none of them has mad nearly as much impression on me as she did. I would be at a bar or club or wherever, chatting up some girl, and o matter how beautiful or nice or funny the girl would be, she wouldnt measure up to her. This didnt even make me want to make an effort to try and get the new girl's number or leave an impression or whatever. Slowly, it started to dawn on me that despite her little quirks, she had been and still was my best friend and probably the love of my life. We're still on good terms and lately we started going out every 2 weeks or 1 month together. When i confronted her with my feelings, she said there was no garantee. I should mention that i'm planning to go abroad in a few months time to continue my specialization, so that any relationship with her would have to be long distance. She said she'd been hurt twice, and she wasnt willing to risk a third. She said she'd changed cuz i had broken up with her twice. I think she still loves me otherwise she wouldnt be in such amiable contact with me. I think she's afraid and i understand it. It's hard for me also to take once more this responsibility. But Im also afraid I'll lose her to some douchebag  who wants to get married while i'm abroad cuz as I know her she would be prone to get dragged into it quickly, disregarding the other person's flaws so she'd get married and get children. Let's not forget her parents are always pressuring her and telling her she's getting older and should find someone to marry before she ends up old and alone. I'm totally at a loss on what to do and i'd really appreciate any opinion or advice. Sorry this thing was long.

tl;dr Already broke up my my gf twice cuz of some quirks in her character, the fact that she wants to get married and have kids soon, and that im travelling to live abroad for a few yrs soon. Later realized shes the love of my life."

Last year I was studying abroad in the US.. Hands down, best year of my life. Met a lot of great people, could enjoy a lot, study what I really love and realize the world is much bigger than I thought.

But theeen.. I came back to my home country and since then I couldn't find happiness anymore..

1st problem - My good friends all graduated and, since this is sort of a college town, they all left.. Now, I am here.. wanting to go out, have some drinks, talk and laugh, but I just have no one to call.. not kidding!

2nd problem - I am a soon to graduate Biology student, and I want to work as a researcher for a company or something, not universities! But the thing is.. I may have done the biggest mistake of my life by choosing Biology as a major.. In my country biologists a treated like shit, nobody wants them and nobody pays them well! I mean, it's great, I love all the knowledge that I have acquired over the last 5 years. But I want to make some good money doing what I want.. I could only realize that, after going to the US, things are great there, scientists are treated well and are recognized for their work.
I now have 4 months before graduating, and just keep wondering over and over what should I do once I graduate.. Look for a low paying job? Be a grad student? (which, again, in my country are treated like shit, and make very little money). Go for PhD abroad? ( It's an option, but I'm quit sure I'm not ready for yet)

3rd Problem - I've met this great girl! I mean GREAT! We are dating now and she's really good to me, but, in a weeks I'll have to leave town for an internship (for 6 months), and she says she's no ready for a long distance relationship yet, so, basically, we know we are breaking up in two weeks..

You know, these things, on top of each other, combined with the stress of graduating, having a final thesis to write (and all the research), internship to think about, moving and all of that are just driving me crazy.. I was known between my friends for being always smiling and happy. Now, I'm just someone with a miserable life and I don't know when this is going to end.

That's it guys, thanks for taking your time, and I hope everyone writing here (including me)con move forward and leave problems behind!"

To whom it may concern,


This semester I am a sophomore at Pennsylvania State University, working toward a bachelor's degree in computer science.

After looking for an internship related to my major, I found your internship program and realize it's everything I'm looking for.  


Working for the largest communications holding company in the world while also being able to develop and practice my programming and leadership skills would be the experience of a lifetime.  My experience and passion would also be of great value to the company.  With skills that cannot be taught inside a classroom and an excellant education to serve as a base, I am easily molded and make a great addition to any team.  I communicate and work well with others, yet work well independently. 


I'm very eager to gain professional experience and looking forward to a challenge.  I would greatly appreciate hearing back from you so we could discuss how I can be the perfect addition to your team.

Thoughts?,valkyrie87,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/1k267a/i_want_to_switch_from_eet_to_embedded_systems/,"I've completed two years of my EET degree for transfer to a university BSEET program. I got into EET because of my interest in digital systems and microcontrollers. However, after my internship experience this summer and some research into the university curriculum, I've realized 

1) I'm really not one for circuit analysis and hardware. I'd like to do more programming.  

2) The rest of the EET program is almost ALL about hardware and circuit design. Not much in terms of programming/microcontrollers. 

If I switched to software engineering, it would take an extra year or longer before I could transfer.
Then I found out that the university also offers an Embedded Systems Technology degree that focuses a lot on programming. Almost all my EET credits transfer toward that degree. It would also better qualify me for the kind of work I really want to do. It seems like the right choice but I have some concerns:

1) It's a new program, not yet ABET accredited, and has low student enrollment compared to the software and EE(T) programs.

2) An EET or software engineering degree both can get you a job in embedded systems, plus you can go into many other areas. Is Embedded Systems too narrow a discipline? Would it limit my job options down the road? Or is it best of both worlds?

tl;dr- EE(T) vs Software vs Embedded Systems degrees. Pros? Cons? Practical advice?

He's going through a very rough patch right now since he has been dealing with derealization for about 5 months now. He also has synesthesia - while synethesia on it's own isn't a bad thing, combined with derealization it makes everything look horrible.

Every conversation starts about how well or how horribly he's been doing that day, and if it's gotten better or worse. Naturally at first I was always willing and always there to listen, but it's been the same for five months. Five months of constant break downs - constant worries and it is wearing down on me emotionally. Every conversation somehow turns into a conversation about his derealization. 

His mother no longer wants to hear about ANYTHING to do with his derealization, and is threatening to kick him out if he even mentions it to her. His stepfather just tells him ""to pray and God will answer his prayers if he truly believes."" 

He tries to communicate with his brothers, they don't really help. He does have friends but he's different around them, he becomes rather dickish. 

Before this all happened, he was doing great in school, great at work with his internship - and everything came crashing down. 

Everything we do is routine now, and once again it's killing me. I don't have the heart to leave because he's going through all of this, but at the same time I don't see it becoming better. I love him, I really do - but I just don't feel that passion anymore.. Everything he does is starting to annoy me to no end. He's very affectionate with me, and he adores me. He really truly loves me. I just wish I didn't feel this way. I've even been avoiding sex because I even feel no pleasure for it anymore, I just feel there.
 
I'm going to speak with him after he comes home from work and I'm going to finally let these feelings off of my chest. But I'm scared reddit. I really am. People say to leave, yet it's very difficult to do. I'm his best friend. 

**TL;DR** My boyfriend is derealized, I feel numbed in the relationship. I love him and because of his current state I feel it would be horrible for me to leave.

I'm not even sure where to begin here, what should I do? What should I say?

1k1sd0,1,2013-08-09,A Global Warning for the U.N. 2012,[deleted],BestOfHorror,https://www.reddit.com/r/BestOfHorror/comments/1k1sd0/a_global_warning_for_the_un_2012/,"The following is a redacted document originally submitted to the U.N. council by their diplomat for Global Climate Research. It has since been discovered by an American intern at a foreign consulate and spread virally through Wikileaks by an internet group known as The Midnight Society.

To the U.N. Council:

My research into aqua-parasitic growth in small water bodies has turned up significant evidence of a looming global pandemic. The continuing change of the Earth’s climate has led to a slight but highly problematic change of 0.017 degrees Celsius in an [redacted]. Though the research is far from complete, the evidence gathered thus far calls for greater man-power, more intense studies worldwide, and a global plan to prevent the growth and spread of a specific pathogenic parasite known as structure 2321 Alpha, or what we call the Adam Parasite.

Two research teams were sanctioned by the council: my team is the Adam and we’ve been stationed between [redacted] and [redacted] in the [redacted]; the second team, the Eve, is stationed in [redacted] in [redacted]. Our positions were determined by local population and distance from the equator. The Eve has not yet reported a similar finding; we have also contacted many foreign preservationists and found no sign of the parasite in Europe, Australia, and some of Asia, though large parts of Asia, Africa, and the warming Antarctic, as well as many other locations, have yet to be verified and pose a serious risk of hosting a similar intracellular parasitoid.

I would like to reiterate a case study from seven weeks ago, as it has also been the most public. On May 26, a man in Florida was found eating the face of another man. When confronted by police, the man was incommunicable and highly violent which ultimately led to a fatal shooting. This man’s name was [redacted] and we had, until a week previous to this incident, been in constant communication with him as he had been contracted to work as our lead bacterial consultant. His lab was located in Miami and, until he disappeared, we had been sending him samples of our findings. His disappearance occurred two days after he received our initial samplings of the Adam Parasite.

Not one week later, we tragically, inadvertently found a host to composite the Adam Parasite’s effect on the peripheral nervous system when our lab technician, [redacted], also became infected. As I thoroughly detailed those events in my previous case study to the council when asking permission to section off portions of [redacted], I will skip the harrowing events and merely re-explain the results: it entered [redacted] bloodstream through nasal inhalation; attacked the sub-cortex of the brain, overheating the skull and outer brain tissue; [redacted] temperature raised to 104 degrees Fahrenheit, wherein [redacted] began violent hallucinations much like a fever dream; then, in the final stage, there was a liquefaction of the brain stem, causing the death of the host.

We have been in communication with the [redacted] on these proceedings. They have done a good job preventing mass hysteria thus far and their [redacted] have helped us section off the southernmost area of [redacted], the only area we have found to contain the Adam Parasite. As of now the parasite continues to exist in an incubational stage though a time will come in the near future, as temperatures continue to rise, where the parasite will surface like mosquito larvae to be carried on the wind and spread with the weather front.

This communication is to state further emphasis on a global plan to handle this inevitable situation when it begins, as it is far too late to prevent it entirely. Unless climate change can be halted 100% right now – it can’t – this parasite will grow in size and spread exponentially, likely to occur in the second half of 2013. There needs to be a plan in place for the exodus of country dignitaries and top political figures to the southern- and northernmost portions of Earth, where this parasite will be unable to infect. The rest of the population will have to prepare for the spread as if it were a flu pandemic. A vaccine may be possible if work begins now, in large numbers, across the world; this needs to be a global effort. We cannot make predictions on population effects or R-naught unless we were able to conduct more case studies.

We must begin to alert foreign dignitaries on a global scale to prepare for what could amount to the extinction of the human race. The ice on which we currently stand melts more each day and it will take but a short time before it cracks and we fall under.

As always, thank you for your time and I await further orders.

In the beginning, things were great. I got along well with everyone, we were all like a family, became very close quickly. 

A month or so in, I made a quick trip back home to pick up some stuff, including my laptop. As soon as I had my laptop, daily PMO. Before that, I had been masturbating infrequently, and to my imagination of women I had met, no porn. 

As the season progressed, things started to deteriorate. I was becoming more withdrawn and unhappy, tensions and conflicts started forming (of course, some of that is just normal when living and working closely in a small group). 

One day, the farm manager, who is a very intelligent, insightful, hippy lady asked me, ""what do you look at on your computer? Because, whatever it is, it seems to be draining you.""

The porn definitely popped in my mind, but I rationalized my way out of it, saying it must be all the articles I read about ecological destruction, energy, socioeconomics, injustice, etc. just making me depressed and hopeless about the state of the world. Now, all of that is totally valid, but looking back, the PMO may have played a greater role than I cared to admit, and I suspect that she knew that better than I did.

So, I'm looking forward to this challenge. I've tried to stop several times over the years, but I've never been able to go longer than two weeks before I got so ridiculously horny that I broke. 

I think this community may be just what I need to stay with it. Thank you all for being one of the most positive and supportive groups (especially subreddits) I've seen. "

I'm not a daily marijuana smoker, but I smoke maybe two or three bowls of good quality weed every weekend (shared with friends). I still have a large amount left, and smoking with my friends every weekend is what keeps me going through everyday life. I look forward to it and I've never been more happy or social. I exercise regularly (4-5 days a week) and I'm in great physical condition (a bit on the skinny side too) So now I'm weighing my options. 

Option 1: Get clean. Don't smoke with my friends at all until I find another job and pass the hiring drug test, but be miserable and much less social during the already hard time of job hunting.

Option 2: Use ~$50 of the $500 and get some synthetic urine. Smoke only once a week, and when I get a catch on another job, stop smoking immediately and use the synthetic urine to pass the test (hopefully)

Option 3: Smoke smoke even more seldom (maybe once every two weeks) and the second I get a job interview, stop all smoking activities and I might be clean for the test.

So, I have an A-Level in Computer science and just finishing an apprenticeship in programming (equal to 3 A-Levels). My tutor has commented a number of times saying 'why are you on this course?' in a good way, she means I should be a on a much higher course than the one im on. Im thinking of it as an internship as such.

Now, I love programming but I really hate where I am at. I like my boss and colleagues, but the work is draining its in an office which doesnt feel enlightening and often I actually have little or no work to do, I'm not pushed or challenged and its just dull.

So, I am now looking to progress. Im making so little money it hurts, I was on around £700 per month which isnt bad for my age and considering im on an apprenticeship, but now my hours are cut and im on £375 a month and Im looking to move in with a mate. I am looking to start progressing.

So, when I started I was a web developer (not something I really enjoy) and I have great skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, SQL etc etc. 

Then I moved on to android and iOS programming (Java and Objective-C). 

During my A-Level we were taught programming paradigms and concepts in Visual Basic and C, so my knowledge of the fundamentals of programming is good, not excellent, but good. I love to study OOP and I love things like data structures and objects, something about them really fascinate me - which is one reason I dont like the web dev side of programming, I love the nitty gritty stuff where you beam hugely when your massive module works (no pun intended).

**Questions:**

1) Whats next for me? My software dev skills arn't great for a computer, but this is an area I would like to go into, I have the skills but I havent done anything commercial for a computer (just phone OS)

2) What is your workplace like? I ask this because I dont like the setup we have, it just doesnt feel nice, I dislike going into the room and sitting down for the whole day

3) Pay prospects? At the moment as I stated above im on next to nothing for what I do. How can I grow this?

4) Finally, why do you enjoy software dev? I may not pursue this career (as I am also in line for the police full time from special constable, but there may be an issue with my application) so I want to know my options :)

Thanks for reading this anyway! Appreciate it loads :)"
1k1798,8,2013-08-09,If I had to give one piece of advice to people who want to quit -- through my story,Munegascu,stopsmoking,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/1k1798/if_i_had_to_give_one_piece_of_advice_to_people/,"Here we are, 28 days later, and I must say it was kind of easy thus far.

Well, at least, easier than it would have been under certain conditions.

Hear me out.

I was not a long-time smoker. 2-2.5 years tops. I'm in my 20s so I guess it was easier for me to stop when it was still time. However, I was kind of a heavy smoker. I started with a pack every three weeks but rapidly got to smoke 1.5 pack a day. I was in a smoking-friendly environment. Which triggered my craving even more. My best friends were smokers. So, all the conditions were here to make me smoke more and more and more.

Currently enrolled in a master's degree program, I realised smoking helped me to *forget* my emotional feelings. If I was stressed, I would light up a smoke. If I was disappointed, I'd light up a smoke. If I was broke, dude, can you spare me a smoke?

I didn't like the person I'd become. Clothes reeking cold smoke, bad breath, begging for a cigarette to friends, ...

But it is not socially inacceptable to smoke where I live. It is more part of a social activity. I enjoyed this social acitivity. Having a smoke at the 10am break over a cup of coffee is awesome but then it leads to the 2am smoke when you can't sleep. Unhealthy way of living.

Fortunately, I turned my life over.

And this is one of the secrets to stop smoking: turn your life over so you avoid encountering situations that will trigger the need to smoke.

I actually don't think I was craving nicotine *per se*. Alright, smokers ARE hooked on nicotine, but this addiction lies in the fact that you associate the act of smoking with good times/habits. When I think of my 10am break with my friends. Makes me want to light one. When I think of the afterwork cigarette over a beer, still with my friends. Still makes me want to light one.

But I avoid these situations. But how? 

I'm lucky to have moved to a different country for a couple of months as part of an internship. As everything was new to me, everything I did couldn't be associated to a smoking habit, which made it way easier to stop cold turkey.

That's why I'd advise people who want to stop, or people who are having difficulties to stop, to change things in their life. It will probably lead to drastic measures, such as moving elsewhere, quitting your job, whatever, but I feel like it is the easiest way to stop.

I feel like starting something fresh, something new, truly helps quitting what was once our beloved smoke.

Going to a new school? Time to quit.
Having a special someone in life? Time to quit?
A big event in your life? Time to quit.

If your life stays the same over and over, you'll never find the motivation to quit or worse, you will light one after weeks of being smoke-free. 

Habits have to be the black sheep of wannabe-quitters. Substitute existing habits with something else, healthier, preferably.

KILL THAT HABIT. START SOMETHING NEW AND APPLY SOME CHANGES IN YOUR LIFE.

I understand it can be difficult but I felt like sharing this piece of advice.

However, I'm dreading going back to my country and be among my friends -who are heavy smokers. That's why I still need your support. Any other piece of advice is welcome as to overcome going back to my old habits again.

Have a great day.

Cheers."

I went to college, chose my major, my internships, even my friends, based around one end goal.  One day, I'm going to be an astronaut.

But what happens if I'm officially diagnosed with depression?  What happens if I'm prescribed medication, or go to regular counseling that could actually help me?  I'd have to give up on that dream, and just thinking about that makes everything worse.

I left school this Spring.  During our Winter quarter, I stopped going to classes.  I stopped leaving my floor in the dorms for much of anything, only leaving on days where I needed to pretend to go to class.  I spent my days playing video games and sleeping.  I gave up on everything, and I just planned on killing myself at the end of the quarter.  I told everyone I wasn't coming back the next quarter.  Everyone except for my parents.  I didn't plan on coming back.  But I didn't plan on being home either.

Until the last week, where the guy I love found out that one of his friends killed himself.  He spent several days in my room.  It was right around his birthday and I remember the two of us sitting on my bed.  He'd go between crying and eating bites of a cookie cake his parents had sent for him.  I stayed with him nearly every moment, and saw just how hard it hit him.  I drove him home to be with his family and for the funeral.  After that, I couldn't do it.  I knew that I needed help.

I went home.  I barely explained what was going on to my parents.  It was the second time I had to leave school for something like this.  The first time I had the excuse that my family had lost our home to a flood, this time there wasn't something else I could hide behind.  This time I couldn't lie.  My mom forced me to go speak with a therapist or I couldn't stay with them.

I sat in this woman's basement for hours.  We talked about what felt like everything.  Everything that I felt had gone wrong in my life.  Everything that had ever happened with my family, friends, and myself that made me feel as horrible as I did.  She told me that I was  dealing with depression.  She said that I could go to regular counseling, that there were medications that could help, our family had great insurance that would cover most of it for me.  She said it was nothing to be ashamed of, that I wasn't alone in this.

I never went back to her.  I called a few days later, said I was feeling a lot better, that it had been a passing phase, and it was over.  I lied.

I lied because getting the help I need now would take away what I've spent my life working for, and I'm not ready to give up on that dream.  Why should being depressed in my 20's, and getting help for it keep me from the job of my dreams in my 30's?  If I get help, wouldn't it leave me better equipped to deal with issues like this in the future?  But if I don't get help, I could be putting myself and others at risk if I'm in space and go through a breakdown.  Either way, it feels like I lose.

It feels like the stigma on mental health isn't just a social one, it's something that can effect my employment.

So now I sit here every day feeling worse and worse.  Reaching out for help that can make me feel better will take away my reason for living, but not getting help makes me wonder if I'd even live long enough for it to be worth it."

Straight A's don't count for shit in business if you're as ugly and awkward as me. My CV looks pretty good, near perfect GPA and lots of competitions and scholarships, but as soon as I get into an interview room it's over as soon as it begins.

I just failed my final interview I had before I finish college. I'm going to complete my degree then either move back in with parents or go wondering homeless for a while. I was kind of resigned to this for a long while, so it wasn't really a big shock. I just felt fucking sick and depressed. There is no future. I was thinking the entire 5 years has been a waste, until I got an email. It was from a girl I've been tutoring for the past year. She didn't get as high grades as me, but she is just a bright smiley happy confident girl. I probably loved her, but I'm repressing it very well. Her email, which I think is probably the best thing I accomplished at university, said:

&gt;I just landed an internship at *large firm*, I can't believe I finally got there

cut cut..

&gt;I'm so thankful really, I could never have done it without you! I'll never forget our sessions in the *underground labs* building.

Then I spent the past hour bawing my eyes out. I don't normally do that. For someone who's experienced so much of it, I don't think I'm very good at good at dealing with failure.

I'm no expert and I didn't have any internships during my coursework, but I can program pretty well compared with my classmates.  

I've never been an athlete or had much muscle tone, but my last year of school I took a Tae Kwon Do course.  It kicked my ass (sometimes literally), but by the end I was starting to get noticeably muscly.  This seemed to me to enact a bit of a change in the way other CS students were willing to interact with me.  I'm a self-proclaimed nerd and am very socially introverted, but I kind of started to feel shut out of my peer groups after getting in shape.

Is this flipping some kind of repressed ""he's a jock, he's an asshole"" defense mechanism a lot of programmer-types may have established in high school?  Could I seriously be better off not working out so much while looking for my first professional programming job?  Would older professionals be as likely to hold a prejudice against physically fit people?  Or am I just some unlikable asshole, skinny or ripped?"

However, as luck would have it, a big reason why I wanted to tone up was because I wanted to look more attractive to men. Once, a guy told me that he thought I was beautiful enough to wear anything and look incredible, which made me think ""screw all of this working out and healthy eating stuff - for the next few weeks, I'll just do whatever I want"" and then go back to my working out and eating routines after my ""eating vacation"".

That didn't work. I ended up starting a new internship that was very sedentary yet still exhausting, so I stopped working out all together, on top of eating a lot of the same sugary foods that I'd previously given up. Now it's 3 months later and I've gained 15 pounds.

I'm trying to start getting back into the exercise habits that I had before, and cut out the sugary foods that I had successfully stopped eating in the past. But somethings changed this time - I feel like I need to do this for my own self confidence, and not for anybody else. While this might sound like a good thing, I now feel much less motivated to do get healthy, and I find myself falling into that same ""just one more cookie, don't worry about it"" mentality that I used to be in.

tl;dr: Lost a bunch of weight over the past two years and gained half of it back in 3 months - but I'm still not really that motivated, although I despise how I look now. Suggestions?"

1k0ajn,4,2013-08-09,I followed my dream-- and it might have been a huge mistake.,neverenough22,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/1k0ajn/i_followed_my_dream_and_it_might_have_been_a_huge/,"I'm sitting here in NYC, a city I've dreamed of moving to for 5 years now, trying to fight back tears in the least manly way imaginable. I interned here a few years ago, worked at an ad agency with the express hope to get enough experience to get work here and have saved and saved for doing just this. I've told people for years that I'd go to New York, find work and live here. This has defined my life for the past few years.

I'm here. I'm not happy. And I'm thinking I made the wrong decision.

Over the past 9 months, my parents moved back from Florida to Ohio just 10 minutes down the road. I fell in love with a brilliant, supportive woman who I left back in Ohio, hoping we can do a long-distance relationship. Aside from a shitty job that I quit, I had a great thing going. I had two cars, a nice apartment, friends, family nearby and finally started exploring Ohio and found so much to love. Truthfully, I was very, very happy, but I really felt like it was now or never for me to explore this dream. I even saw a therapist to talk this out and make sure this was a good idea and the right time.

I don't know that I put much thought into how hard this would be. When I was here as an intern, I was incredibly independent and loved to be alone. Now? I'm walking around looking at couples in Times Square taking pictures of each other and I just want to be back in bed with my girlfriend and her dogs. I want to wake up tomorrow, make her breakfast and go see my family. I jump at the chance to talk to people because I'm so lonely-- and I just got here.

I shouldn't have waited until I was 24 to move away. I got too comfortable, too spoiled and here I am. I have no idea what to do. In all honesty, I've been here for 12 hours-- but I'm just terrified I made a huge mistake. The butterflies and euphoria I felt when I'd been here before just aren't there this time. I walked through Central Park, Times Square and all of my favorite places and didn't feel much of anything. I'm hoping that it's too soon to call-- and it probably is. I'm hoping I look back at this post and feel dumb. But I don't know if I will. I don't want to ruin my relationship, my finances and my friendships. I chased the dream and now I feel like a spoiled, ungrateful prick for not being happy about where I'm at. 

I just needed to get this out. If you have any words of advice or encouragement, I'd appreciate it."

While the topics covered weren't new, the presentation itself was very well-done and entertaining, and I'd like to show it to a friend. 

As I remember, it was about a 10-minute lunchtime presentation by, perhaps, an intern at a large tech company. Might actually have been Google. I think that the involved technologies were JavaScript (Node.js?) and XML - something like convincing a webserver to eval an expression, and the types of hijinks that might result. Specific examples:

* An example of the ""billion laughs"" technique, where the evaluation of a simple expression causes it to expand to a gigantic volume of data - in this case, the string ""lol"" repeated a ridiculous number of times.

* A request that caused a webserver to evaluate one of its local resources as a stream - specifically, the output of a random-number generator.

* A request that caused a webserver to direct traffic to another webserver.

Does this sound familiar to anyone? Can anyone provide a link?

So now I've been scraping through Indeed, LinkedIn, and some of the more well-established companies in search of any possible leads. I also have a very heavy course load this fall, so if I do find anything, it would have to be during the spring.

I'm considering delaying my graduation by one semester, just so I can make room for a possible summer internship. I could also spread out my course load across three semesters this way, but I don't know if that's feasible versus just finishing the degree and looking for an entry-level position.

I work part time at a software dev. place on campus, making Android apps. It's not particularly satisfying because the apps I make are usually related to gov't applications, which gets kinda boring, but it pays and its good experience. 

I do have some research experience, mostly in Human-Computer Interaction, and will be submitting my second research paper to a conference soon. 

My GRE scores are decent (162 verbal, 161 quant, 5 writing), all of which are in the 90%+, except my quant score, which is in the low 80th percentile, so I'm a bit worried about that. 

I'm really passionate about CS and enjoy programming a lot. Would any of you know what my chances are at getting into a top CS grad school? 

Also, there's a 5 year B.S./M.S. program at my school, so would you suggest I do that before applying for a Ph.D?

Thanks,
Alex"
1k3l8b,0,2013-08-10,A simple review of Outside,Thenre,outside,https://www.reddit.com/r/outside/comments/1k3l8b/a_simple_review_of_outside/,"Disclaimer: I'm only level 24 so far in the game and have yet to see a lot of the end game (or even mid-game really) content but I believe that I have seen enough to provide and accurate review of the overall quality and mechanics of the game. Any discrepancies by higher level players please feel free to place in the comments section or in a private email and I will work on adding them into my review. 

I have been playing Outside for 24 of the in game years meaning that I have achieved a higher level than many of the players playing in the [Africa] or [South America] servers and that I have spent more time playing Outside than I have spent playing any other game. The graphics and physics system are simply amazing and the game is infinitely customizable from the inside. These things draw you in and keep you hooked and even with my criticisms I will likely be playing for years to come. That being said I have noticed a couple things in-game that make it hard to believe that there are so many people playing, especially given the ""decline"" in users in so-called hardcore games these days.

The first criticism I have is that of the constant deterioration of stats. Outside is not by ANY definition a casual game but even being considered one of the most hardcore games of all time (no respawn on characters, without significant help from referrals and support of existing players it's difficult to progress, and the server you initially choose without much initial given information outside of the biome being some of the commonly recognized areas making it a hardcore game) there are some aspects that are not readily apparent to most players that make the underlying effort required even higher than initially anticipated. I spent months training my [STR] and [INT] stats to levels that I deemed acceptable for my character that I thought would give me an edge in my current class trees. Once I focused on class progression and less on straight stat training, however, I found that my stats had deteriorated almost to the level my character had when I started training at age 13. This is not something explicitly stated but is integral to the game. The mechanic forces players to continue to train basic stats even while attempting to complete the difficult minigames of [College] and [Internship] necessary to progress beyond a certain level in your class tree. This level of multitasking is not seen in other games and has even been rumored to relate to your maximum level and ability to survive various character death inducing encounters. 

Furthermore your character's inherent stats and abilities decrease with level. Characters of level 60 or higher have to spend increasing amounts of times with player healers and studying h ow to counteract the deterioration process. This seems flawed in that instead of rewarding players for progressing through the game the devs have decided to constantly layer additional difficulty as you progress. 

After completing the [College] minigame for the [Buisness] class tree I found that the in game economy had collapsed while I was in the minigame. While this is not inherent to the game itself, the pvp difficulty has been rapidly increasing and unless the mods step in I think the game is going to be too difficult for most people to actually progress in even the easier class trees. I have chosen to multi-class by going back through the [College] minigame for the [Computer Science] class but it seems most other players lack the motivation to see their character begin to progress again after a catastrophic failure such as my character experienced in the pvp arena. In fact statistics show that it's caused increasing numbers of players to log-out and never log back in. This is something the mods need to address. 

Even with those flaws, however, Outside remains my favorite social game of all time. The other player-characters I have befriended are the only reason I have remained logged in long enough to get to level 24 and likely the only reason I continue to play. The graphics, physics system, complexity of the crafting and player economy interfaces, and limitless number of things to do in the game have long since lost their luster and the flaws inherent have nearly driven me to log off before fully committing to see how far in the game I can progress. This shows that there is a situation in game that needs to be fixed, either through direct mod intervention or a changing in the mechanics of the primary pvp economic system to make it easier for new players, or at least keep it from being too difficult to advance past certain class distinctions. I certainly hope that we see the changes that are so apparently needed in the game soon, or I think that the number of players that are concurrently logged in may soon decrease, in turn decreasing the reason that many of us stay logged in in the first place.

Can't tell if she's interested in a relationship, very concerned not to put her in a position where she feels harassed or pressured. Help?",[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1k3har/me_30m_is_supervisor_to_an_unpaid_intern_22f_for/,"****Throwaway because people I know use reddit lots and might identify me****

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I am a 30M team manager (one of many at my department) at a company in the city. My company has 3 offices around the city.

This month 22F was assigned to my department for 2 weeks as an unpaid intern and I was specifically assigned to supervise her. Two weeks ended yesterday, and on Monday she will be reporting to another office my company has across the city to meet and report to her new supervisor.

During the first week I started feeling very attracted to her. She is very pretty, with an incredibly warm personality and I really enjoyed spending time with her. She was legitimately good at almost every task she was given too. I would be surprised if she wasn't offered a position at the end of her internship.

I felt that it was horrible that my company didn't pay her anything, so every lunchtime I would take her out for a quick meal at a nice place not far from the office. I never insisted, I would always just ask if she wanted to go and she would seem happy I offered, yet her reaction was hard to gauge. I couldn't really tell whether she felt forced/obligated or not because she was just so relaxed easy going about it. 

During our lunchtime meals we would laugh and joke, but would talk mostly about the company, other employees, with only a little bit of personal stuff thrown in. I was paranoid about being one of ""those guys"" who sexually harasses (or appears to sexually harass) subordinates so the conversation was never sexual flirty or inappropriate - just really friendly between two people who seemed to be much better friends than you would expect after two weeks together. Throughout my time with her actually I was acutely aware about how much of a disgraceful human being I were to make her feel uncomfortable or pressured by unwanted sexual advances, so I was paranoid never to cross the line.

I was away from the office for 3 evenly spaced days of the two weeks and e-mailed her in the morning of each day to contact me on my mobile if she needed anything while I was away. She didn't respond to my e-mails, didn't call, and made no attempt to save my mobile number or anything. When I returned the following day she said how crap her day had been and how much better it was when I was around. I'm confused.jpg

Yesterday afternoon was her last day, and I didn't want her to just leave without me saying something given that it was her last day and we were unlikely to be working together again. I peppered the following comments into the days conversations (not all in the same conversation just FYI) - 

* how much I enjoyed working with her
* how great she was to have around
* how boring lunch would now be without her
* how I knew she would be great at her next department etc...

Her reaction was to smile, giggle slightly, and look away when I said it, in an almost embarrassed possibly flirty demeanour? I think the message got across though, that I was interested in her, and her reaction wasn't one of annoyance, disgust, or revulsion, and I didn't get the impression she felt uncomfortable or harassed. Yay? I'm not so sure.....

Yesterday afternoon however, disaster struck - I was coming down with something! I felt sick, dizzy, and not at all like myself. Typical. Her last day and I'm out of sorts and may possible throw up in my cubicle.....

At the end of the day she stayed two hours later than she had to in order to help me with one last project. When she was done we were both really awkward with each other, like we didn't know how to part? She started saying thanks for all I'd done and how great her time was with me. I complimented her too and told her how I'd miss her being around, then I thought................... 

Fuck it. I asked her if she wanted to go for a drink at our lunchtime place after work. This was risky because I was feeling quite dizzy and like I was going to throw up at any time, but I didn't want to let her just ""leave"" without at least some minor attempt to escalate on my part if you know what I mean.

Her reaction wasn't what I hoped. She said yes in exactly the same laid back easy going relaxed way she agreed to lunch on the first day I met her. No indication there was more to the two of us going for a drink after work hours. I'm confused.jpg

At evening drinks, we exchanged mobile phone numbers in a really socially awkward way I suppose? We seemed to do it without either of us expressing any apparent desire for the other to call/text?

This could have been my fault as the entire time I felt like shit - the room was spinning for me and I was screaming in my head ""DONT THROW UP! DONT THROW UP!"". I must have been the worst company possible. I can't remember most of what we talked about because I couldn't wait to get out of there so I could not throw up in front of her.

I offered to take her out after work next week if she was free, and I got the same laid back, relaxed agreement as usual? Super confused.jpg

As we parted on the street outside and I told her good luck for Monday, and I'd see her next week after work sometime if she was free. We then walked our separate ways after some pleasantries and I ran to the nearest restroom to go throw up when she was far enough away......

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Points of note:-

* She has not added me or contacted me on Facebook
* She has not texted me at all
* She has not called me at all

I'm more than a little paranoid that I have made a bit of a fool of myself. The problem for me is that the whole time I was concerned about how my behaviour could be interpreted so as not to sexually harass and get a rep/fired, and it may be that she had hang ups of her own given that she really wanted to work for my company?

The situation was unique for me (being attracted to a co-worker/subordinate), and I found my behaviour to be completely different that if I met her socially.

I am also very concerned that with me being 30m and her a 22f 8 years is too much of an 8 gap and I was being creepy as fuck by even being attracted to her.

Basically........... help?

1. Does it sound like I was inappropriate with her?
2. Does it sound like she's interested in me?
3. Am I too old for her/creepy as fuck for being interested in a girl 8 years younger than me when I'm 30?
4. Where the fuck do I go from here? Do I leave it until next week and ask her out and behave exactly as I would socially because I am no longer her supervisor? Or should I drop this?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TL;DR - me 30m supervises 22f unpaid intern for 2 weeks, develop attraction to her, go to lunch together every day, go for drinks after work, she agrees to see me after work next week, but agrees to everything in the most relaxed laid back way imaginable so I can't tell if she's really interested.

I know depression is a part of life so I didn't want to mask it anymore. 

I recently finished reading ""Into The Wild"" by Jon Krakauer and ""The Sun Also Rises"" by Hemingway. Its been making me think about leaving everything behind and running away for a while. Having not to worry about finding a summer internship and the $40,000 I will be spending this year on student loans. Two things that are stopping me from doing this are my mother, and my best friend who happens to be the girl of my dreams. She's the funniest and most genuinely nice person I have ever met. When ever I am with her, all of my pain goes away. I don't think about anything besides the living in the moment. The thing that sucks is that she has no idea I feel this way about her. We have history of flirting. She always jokes about ""some day we are going to get married"". I am too nervous to make a move because I would rather have her in my life as a friend than not have her at all. She's leaving to go back to school tomorrow and I had to say bye to her tonight. I guess thats why all these feelings are killing me tonight.

It is and has been nonexistent. I’m 23…quickly hurtling towards 24 in a couple of months, and I’ve yet to muster the mental or emotional strength to change this. I am hoping however, that by putting my thoughts down that I might be able to work through this negative cycle that has been plaguing me for the past few years.
 I am an attractive man. I’m not saying this to stroke my own ego, but only to establish that my looks have helped in no way to alleviate the loneliness that has been present in my life for far too long. I’ve grown accustomed to it, like worn leather, though the desire for change is somehow still there, and I want to capitalize on it. But how? I’ve been telling myself that I want change for a long time now, to the point where I have almost have lost faith in my ability to make positive change in my life, especially when it comes to finding a mate. It should be so easy for me to go up to a woman and awe her with my masculine charm, but it has now gotten to the point where my lack of experience is handicapping/crippling me and making me feel inferior to the point of inaction.
 For the record, the last sexual encounter I had was my junior year of college. I was so nervous that I made an absolute fool of myself in the bedroom,mainly due to the fact that I was in over my head, and was subsequently so pissed off at myself that I basically shut down that part of my life.
 As I’m typing this I notice how stupid it sounds. I know there are starving people in Africa, I know there are limbless veterans roaming the streets, I know there are people who have it worse, but it doesn’t make me feel any better. It’s not that I’m a social inept. Far from it. I’ve got an internship I show up to every day, and interact just fine with my coworkers and friends I’ve met here. It’s as if there’s some “block” that is keeping me from getting the confidence to do anything about my lack of sexuality. Clearly there are some habits that I need to change, and I need to change them fast. If anyone has any advice on how they turned their love life around in a significant way, I would surely appreciate it. Over and out.

If you thought san Andrea’s was big or if liberty city was big. There are cities and towns in GTA 5 that are about half the size of those and you still got all the air space and depths of the water.

I am here to bring you the GTA 5 map. I have not seen any leaks of it or any legit maps on the Internet. So as far as I am concerned I got the only leaked map, which is kind of of cool. You might ask how I got it? 

I got it through my cousin, him and I are very close and we talk daily. He is an intern at Rockstar and he took a map scanned it and sent it to me. I don’t feel safe legally just posting it online. I would assume that I would be breaking some privacy law and I don’t feel like fucking with Rockstar a multi billion dollar company.

If you want my opinion this map is crazy. If your afraid it will spoil the game. Let me tell you it wont. There is so much to do and the map is so big your not going to remember your way around the map. Depending on how much you play it is going to take you moths and possibly years to actually know every little thing about the game.

At the same time I have no problem sharing the map I just don’t want to do it here.

If you would like a copy of the map email me. In the email include the following or I will not be responding to you.

There are five players, plus myself. We actually met on r/LFG, so there's a plug for that. 

Matt is playing a Garundi Cleric of Zon-Kuthon named Darwishi. It means ""saint"", which amuses him because his sadistic tastes render him anything but. He fled his home as the third son of a major noble family in Thuvia to Nidal, where he has studied under the monastic tutors at Ridwan.

Jamie is playing a Dhampir Necromancer named Varkus Aeternus. He was raised by his vampire father Damian until a band of vampire hunters associated with the Knights of Ozzem, the Enders of Night, found and destroyed him, pursuing Varkus into the wilderness.

James plays a Forlorn Elven Alchemist named Tobin Springhill, who was raised in Nirmathas by human parents and worked the farm until they died. Managing it just long enough to ensure his adopted siblings and their children would be able to manage it, he joined a traveling cult of Pharasma, which espoused the unorthodox belief that there was a finite amount of suffering in the universe, and that when it had been exhausted, the Final Judgement would occur. This hope for an ending appealed to Tobin and he joined the cult, later leaving them to intern with a torturer/doctor in Nirmathas' capital of Tamran. There his beliefs morphed from the desire to re-assign suffering to those he deemed ""deserved it"", to a realization that he was incapable of being a perfect judge of said guilt and a reticent acceptance that pain was his lot in life.

Stephen plays a Fetchling Dirge Bard named Kraid, obsessed with death and intent on crafting work that understands and illuminates what it is to die. He was raised by a traveling entertainer, who passed on his skills to the young man.

Kris plays a Human of mixed Varisian and Tian ancestry, raised in a cult-like village devoted to their leader, the warrior-skald Kite. He was one of the chosen few who were called only 'X son of Kite the Conqueror"", his own designation being ""7"". He survived years of training only to fight his peers to the death for the right to succeed Kite in leading the tribe. The 13th son, his good friend and a superior warrior, spared his life and fell to 7's blade. Taking up his friend's sword, he killed Kite, and the rest of the town as they slept and fled into the night.

So, yeah, the party is evil. Even objectively, two of them engage in torture and the Necromancer makes three. Kraid is Tobin's friend, so goes along with it and isn't above making a little coin at another's expense. 7 is honestly the closest to ""good"" the party has, as he keeps his word to his friends, doesn't kill anything that doesn't attack him, and along with Tobin, cares for the residents of Silversprings. But I'm getting ahead of myself.

In the first session, the characters (minus Kraid) are drawn together by powerful visions at a remote caldera at the base of a mountain. Within the caldera sits a brackish pond and a small cave leading into the mountain. At the side of the pond is a figure in dark red robes, his face cowled and his posture stooped. They approach him, engage in conversation and learn that the cave is the lair of a demi-lich from ancient Azlant, one who calls himself Karyakuss. This freaks the party out, they're level 1, this lich business is a pretty deep hole to stick one's arm into. But the robed man, who introduces himself as Radagast the Red, assures them they've been drawn here to protect Karyakuss against him and that he intends neither they nor the lick any harm. He promises that Karyakuss is bound to reward them for their service, which intrigues them and after camping the night, they follow Radagast into the cave. Inside they stumble directly into Karyakuss' lair, a simple pedestal with a purple cushion, mounted by a set of stairs. Radagast speaks with the lich, really a floating skull illuminated by green flames and speaking with a harsh, crackling voice. They cannot understand what was said, but once the conversation is over and Radagast leaves, Karyakuss berates them for failing to arrive sooner and failing to stop the wizard. Most of the party is still cowed by his apparent power, but Tobin sees through most of the bluster and is a bit sassy with his replies. Karyakuss tempts the others with power and forbidden knowledge, including Varkus' lost ancestors, the 9 Vampire Lords, and the whereabouts of the Relics of Kazavon. 7 balks at all of this, but stops when Karyakuss threatens Ammelia, a little girl who had nursed 7 back to health after he slaughtered his town and then fled through the wilderness. He quickly capitulates, and the demi-lich sends them to acquire workers and materials to defend the mouth of the cave while he performs some kind of evil ritual that will alert any nearby forces of their presence and the power of their casting. 

While traveling, the party is attacked by the bandits who prey on trade through the Bloodsworn Vale, and they handily beat them, taking three of the five as slaves. Pleased with the progress they've made towards their goal, they approach a trading post nearby and learn that there is a bounty on bandits and orcs, both of which are redeemed by taking ears as trophies. They concoct a scheme to fund the needed materials along with the labor by taking bandits and orcs as slaves, while turning in the ears for the bounty. They take their slaves back to the caldera and leave them in Karyakuss' care, heading along the foothills in search of further prey. Finding a group of soldiers from Nirmathas, carrying heavy chests and moving quickly, they spring a late-night ambush that almost fails disastrously before Tobin flings himself into the fray, keeping the soldiers and their cleric off the fallen Darwishi long enough to stabilize same and allow 7 to roll three 20's in a row, instantly killing the cleric. They only collected three living prisoners, and allowed two soldiers to escape into the night, but found three small chests of gold and diplomatic documents, which they hitched to the prisoners and started frog-walking them back home. After a couple days they spot Kraid coming over the hills behind them, on his sturdy little pony Vanilla. He warns them that the Nirmathan's have gathered an army, a real proper army, to recover the lost documents, which the party promptly unseals and opens. They are missives calling for aid from most of the major players in the western continent, all include a token the party later researches as being Numerian technology. With this mystery less pressing to them than the army at their heels or the work ahead of them, they move on, Kraid in tow. Later that night, as they camp, they are attacked by a huge frost pig, a semi-magical boar that steals away one prisoner, while the other two attempt an escape. The fight goes badly as Darwishi is unarmored and hugely vulnerable, and they must eventually abandon the pig to his meal and recover the other two who are making poor progress while still shackled to each other. As punishment because she had mangled his face, Tobin enlists Darwishi in torturing and vivisecting the shifter prisoner. With only one surviving slave, and a hamstrung one at that, they stumble back into town laden with gold. They restructure their plan to use the gold for the materials and simply be happy with the four slaves they currently have.

They travel back to the trading post to exchange money for stone, wood, rope, lead, and other requisite building materials, only to find it has been raided, and the barns burned. They collect what they can from the warehouse, including most of the contents of the vault, and a goodly amount of food, something they are running low on, especially with the added weight of prisoners.

So that's all for this edition, It's mostly just foundations being set, but things take off fast very shortly."
1k29of,28,2013-08-09,About to graduate with a CS degree. I hate programming. What do I do?,Major_Dork,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1k29of/about_to_graduate_with_a_cs_degree_i_hate/,"I'm about to graduate college with a CS degree, but I'm in kind of a weird situation. During college I was dealing with depression, which negatively affected how I did in my courses, and resulted in me not pursuing internships or any type of job search stuff at all. I was one of those isolationist hermit-like depressives, but I've made a lot of progress in the past year and am feeling pretty good now. I also realized that I hated programming, but I felt trapped in my degree. I'm starting to look for jobs now, and I'm worried that if I take a job as a programmer all the progress I've made in dealing with my depression will go down the drain as I work a job I hate. However, my school really only helps students find jobs programming for reasons I don't fully understand. (I asked this question to my adviser, and she directed me to an online listing that was entirely made up of small-medium business programming jobs. It was a similar situation at the campus career fair.) 

I'm hoping someone can help me find what else is out there for someone in my situation. I still like the problem solving aspect of CS, and I particularly like Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Human-Computer Interaction, but don't know how to explore those outside of the research route. I could deal with a small amount of coding, but I think it's more something I would do a hobby than something I could make a career out of. I'm having a really hard time finding resources on the web, so if someone could suggest a few job titles to research, or even provide some links to resources for CS majors looking for jobs outside their degree I'd really appreciate it.

**Summary in case my rambling is confusing:**
I'm looking for a job outside of programming, or even CS entirely. Hoping someone could suggest a place to start.

**EDIT:** Just wanted to thank everyone for the help, I've got a lot of things to read up on now! I was really frustrated trying to find info on what a CS degree can be used for, so you guys have helped me out a bunch."
1k64s3,7,2013-08-11,Anyone need a roommate? [22/F] looking to stay on NW side of city.,dancingsquirrel,DCforRent,https://www.reddit.com/r/DCforRent/comments/1k64s3/anyone_need_a_roommate_22f_looking_to_stay_on_nw/,"So I posted a while ago about wanting to live in Arlington, but I think I'd really like to stay in the city and I wanted to see what my options were like here. 

I work in McLean (at Gannett/USA Today) as a campaign manager. I came to the city a few months ago for an internship and got hired on full time. Here's the part that's making my hair fall out: my summer lease ends in a WEEK. I need a place to live as soon as possible. I can make it work until September if need be but I'd really like something now.

I don't want to spend more than $1200 for my part, so the total rent would need to be $2400 or lower. From what I've found, that's totally doable more two bedroom places. 

If you're in a similar situation and just want to pair up to look, I'm down. I've found several buildings I'm interested in, but I need to get a move on so be prepared to sign for something very soon. 

PM me or email me at lizzfrick425@gmail.com and tell me a little about yourself and if you need a place or just want to team up to look around. :) Thanks!"
1k61dk,0,2013-08-11,Terry the intern fired?,[deleted],starcraft,https://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/1k61dk/terry_the_intern_fired/,"Ok so... during a between-game interview Terry stated that he was interview a guy named Jamal for ""diversity"" because Jamal was ""darker"" than the rest of the audience (Jamal is black). 

Now Jamal seemed pretty pissed off during the interview and after a short break the casters apologised to the community on-stream on behalf of NASL saying that Terry's actions didn't represent their opinions (or something to the same effect) also stating that ""the internship was over"".

Terry took to Twitter to seemingly confirm this : https://twitter.com/hjk490/status/366668271988121600
https://twitter.com/hjk490/status/366667619073400832

So these are my knee-jerk reaction thoughts on this;
OK, so Terry made a mistake which obviously offended someone and as a result NASL have decided to take action on Terry in the form of possibly firing him? What? Really? I mean I'm not condoning what he said but I think that completely axing him isn't fair IMO. Now I know that I am not fully aware of the repercussions of what he said but people can't seriously believe that what an INTERN said whilst trying to be funny represents the views of NASL, WCS, Blizz and their sponsors? 

Ways in which it could handled better (IMO):

1. Let Terry apologise on stream if he wanted too.

2. If a member of staff says something offensive don't just completely separate yourself from them by saying ""Oh what x said doesn't represent our own thoughts"" support your staff, say something like ""Whilst we disagree with what Terry said, we support our staff member and have taken the necessary disciplinary action against him/her."" Not just ""We're sorry. He's gone now though LOL so it's all ok!""

3. I feel like announcing that he's been fired on stream is indecent and unfair to Terry. So don't do that.

4. The guy got fired 5 minutes after the incident without review or any genuine thought on the incident.. at least think about it for a day or two before effectively ending someones esports career. Come on guys.

I doubt anyone will care about what I think but hey it's the internet I can say what I want.

Questions|Answers
:--|:--
[Nurse here. Thank you for your work !  What are the worst lab results you remember ? The ones that make you go ""whoa, did they send me a sample from Uranus or what ?"".](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1k5c25/iama_medical_laboratory_scientist_mls_working_at/cblk0zx?context=5)|Turns out that the nurse who collected it poured the purple-top into the yellow-top.  Which is bad.  Purple tops are used for hematology, and they contain EDTA stabilized with potassium.  The EDTA prevents clotting by binding to calcium.
 |Also had a few patients come in who had hemoglobins below 4 g/dL.  One had kidney failure, another I think had a GI bleed.
[Whoa. Thanks for your answer !  I remember a patient with D-dimers through the roof, the lab had to double-check the results. Bad case of thrombosis, but the patient survived in the end.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1k5c25/iama_medical_laboratory_scientist_mls_working_at/cbllkjd?context=5)|Huh.  That seems weird to me.  Normally, D-dimer is a rule-out test.  If it's below a certain threshold, then the chance of there being a clot is very low.  However, it's not a very specific test and an elevated result could be caused by a number of conditions (including even very mild traumas).
 |The only reason I could think that they'd need to double-check it is if it was above their analyzer's linearity, or there was some kind of error along the way.
[Vets do this all the time. ""oh we didn't have enough in the sst so we poured some into it from the lavender.""  Clients who don't have at least some in house lab work to do sometimes really just don't understand. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1k5c25/iama_medical_laboratory_scientist_mls_working_at/cblm4gr?context=5)|I've yet to see a specimen from our local vet clinic that wasn't hemolyzed.
[We always redraw/rerun unexpectedly high/low results.  Sounds like you guys don't deal with much other than your normal run of the mill patients?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1k5c25/iama_medical_laboratory_scientist_mls_working_at/cblmc22?context=5)|If the result is unexpected, then yeah we'd look into it.  My point was more that an elevated D-dimer isn't really unexpected.
 |We're a smaller facility.  We can handle a lot of things, but yeah, most of it is run of the mill stuff.  Broken bones, chest pain, fevers, etc.  Our more serious patients are usually shipped to a a facility better equipped to handle them after being stabilized.
[How accurately do shows like CSI and NCIS portray your line of work? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1k5c25/iama_medical_laboratory_scientist_mls_working_at/cbljfej?context=5)|Not very.
 |Lab tests take time.  And every picture of blood cells I've seen on TV has been fake.
[When someone comes into the ER for an injury, are results submitted to the police and/or health insurance company?  I don't think this exactly your area, but maybe you would know.  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1k5c25/iama_medical_laboratory_scientist_mls_working_at/cbljcz1?context=5)|No.
 |We do need to submit **Which** tests we're performing to the insurance company, but we don't send them the results.
 |As for the police, the only way that we can turn over test results to them is if it's been ordered by the court.
 |And routine medical drug tests do not hold up in court due to a lack of chain-of-custody.
[What LIS do you use and do you like it? Is your CAH part of a larger health system?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1k5c25/iama_medical_laboratory_scientist_mls_working_at/cbljnd6?context=5)|We just switched to Cerner.  There are a lot of things that I like about it, and a lot of things that I find frustrating.  And our computer system is part of a larger system (which is where a lot of the problems come from).
[Did you ever work as an MLT during college?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1k5c25/iama_medical_laboratory_scientist_mls_working_at/cbljqjq?context=5)|No, I went straight through the four-year program, and MLT is a separate 2 year program.
[Could you actually work in research or does that take more studying?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1k5c25/iama_medical_laboratory_scientist_mls_working_at/cbljqjq?context=5)|Yes, to both parts.  There are research laboratories out there which perform testing for clinical trials and stuff like that, and I would qualify for those positions.  As for researching new types of testing, I wouldn't be in charge of any projects, but I could work under someone who was.
 |Honestly?  The paycheck.
[Was it difficult to find a job and did your school help with job placement?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1k5c25/iama_medical_laboratory_scientist_mls_working_at/cbm0dko?context=5)|It was actually very easy to find a job, and in fact I had 3 offers shortly after I started looking.  My school did have a contact person for job placement, although in my case it wasn't necessary.
[I have heard that CLS is in high demand at biotech companies (such as 23 and Me\). Do you think you might go that route or do you know classmates that have done that?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1k5c25/iama_medical_laboratory_scientist_mls_working_at/cbm0dko?context=5)|It is an option for the future, but at the moment I'm happy where I am.  I don't really keep in touch with my classmates, so I don't know if any took that route.  However, I do have some interaction with biotech companies (they're the ones who supply our analyzers and reagents, after all), and almost all of their support personnel seem to be former MLS.
[Did your coursework help you with what you do in your job or has on-the-job-training contributed more toward your understanding of how to run the tests you do?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1k5c25/iama_medical_laboratory_scientist_mls_working_at/cbm0dko?context=5)|You need to understand the coursework to understand the theory behind what happens when you run a test, what the sources for error are, possible contamination, stuff like that.  My program had 3 months of classes during the summer, and by the time I finished with that I already understood the majority of what I was going to be actually be doing when I got to my clinical site.
[Another nurse here. Are you the one who calls me with critical lab results? How do you handle notifying the direct care team of a crazy result (like that Pseudomonas in the CSF, woah\) in your facility? Thanks for the AMA, and thanks for your work!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1k5c25/iama_medical_laboratory_scientist_mls_working_at/cblki3l?context=5)|Yes, I am the one who calls you with critical results.
 |Basically, once a result verified, it's put in a queue to be called.  If it's for our own facility, we usually just call it to the nurses station or the physician's office.  If it's an outpatient, we would need to find the contact information for the responsible medical provider and give them a ring.
[What's the strangest color sample you've ever received?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1k5c25/iama_medical_laboratory_scientist_mls_working_at/cblj9si?context=5)|I've seen some strange colored urine.  Brown is fairly common.  Green is a bit rarer, but I've seen that too.  Also orange, red, and pink.
[How tough is the job?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1k5c25/iama_medical_laboratory_scientist_mls_working_at/cbllluw?context=5)|I don't find it very difficult.  The education was challenging, but I also enjoyed it.  The job itself is mostly mental work, although there's a lot of time on your feet and stuff like that.
[Do you work long hours](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1k5c25/iama_medical_laboratory_scientist_mls_working_at/cbllluw?context=5)|Larger labs usually do typical shift-work, and how long the shift is depends on the lab, but usually it's either 8, 10, or 12 hours.  In hospitals they need to have 24 hour lab coverage, so there are night and evening shift positions out there.
[Do you enjoy the work](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1k5c25/iama_medical_laboratory_scientist_mls_working_at/cbllluw?context=5)|Yes.
[What's the job market like?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1k5c25/iama_medical_laboratory_scientist_mls_working_at/cbllluw?context=5)|Very good.  We're currently in high demand.
[Any advice that has to do with school or the job itself?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1k5c25/iama_medical_laboratory_scientist_mls_working_at/cbllluw?context=5)|Pay attention in all of your science classes, especially microbiology, immunology, hematology, and all of your chemistry classes.  Develop good study habits, they'll be very important once you start your actual program.
[Would you recommend it](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1k5c25/iama_medical_laboratory_scientist_mls_working_at/cbllluw?context=5)|Yes.
[Thanks. I really struggled in my high school science classes because I never paid attention. My last year of chem and bio finally reeled me in because it was much more hands on. I loved it. I'm glad you enjoy the job.Ii'm looking forward to the possibility of doing the same.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1k5c25/iama_medical_laboratory_scientist_mls_working_at/cblmtw6?context=5)|Check with your MLS adviser to see if he/she can set up a shadowing experience or a tour of a local medical laboratory for you.  That should give you a bit of an idea what the actual work entails.
 |Also, should point out, as far as the job market goes...
 |Most programs report job placement for new graduates above 90%.
[By testing blood samples of a snake bite, can you recognize what kind of venomous snake was it ? Thank you . ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1k5c25/iama_medical_laboratory_scientist_mls_working_at/cbljbfu?context=5)|With the equipment at my facility, definitely not.
 |There are probably some places out there that could test for it though, but in reality it's not a practical way of figuring out how to treat it.  You're better off figuring out what snake did it some other way.
 |We can, however, do some tests for snakebites that would help.  For example, one of the more common ways that snake venom works is by interfering with coagulation, which we can test.
[What's a ""critical access hospital""?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1k5c25/iama_medical_laboratory_scientist_mls_working_at/cblm283?context=5)|It's a designation for hospitals in rural areas.
 |Basically, it means that we provide medical coverage for a very large area that would otherwise be very delayed in getting emergency treatment.
[Can you go over the process for testing a sample? In our research lab, we use different kits, ELISAs to test for hormones, blots for different molecules, etc. I'm very curious about the clinical side of tests. Is it just centrifuge and stick it into some machine?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1k5c25/iama_medical_laboratory_scientist_mls_working_at/cblk550?context=5)|So, I just got back from the ER with some blood.
 |I throw the chemistry and coag tubes in the centrifuge, and put the CBC tube on the analyzer.
 |The CBC comes off in a minute or two, and I look at the results to see if I need to do a manual review/differential.  If I do, I make the slide and let it start to dry, if not I release the CBC.
 |By that time, the Centrifuge is finishing, and I start the coag/chemistry tests.  When those finish, I review them to make sure that they make sense, and do any follow-up actions I might need to do (repeat testing, dilution, stuff like that).
 |We currently have one analyzer that does our general chemistry testing and another that does immunoassays, but we're working on bringing a new one online to replace both of them and consolidate our chemistry testing onto one machine.
 |All of our urine testing is done manually using test-strips and microscopic review.
 |We do have some ELISA test kits for things like influensae, rapid-streps, RSVs, mononucleosis, legionella, etc.
 |We do microbiology testing in-house as well, although we can only do basic cultures, organism ID's, and sensitivities.  Anything too unusual we'd need to send out.
[What chemistry / heme analyzers do you use? Do you do any manual differentials? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1k5c25/iama_medical_laboratory_scientist_mls_working_at/cblmwkk?context=5)|We currently use a Vitros 350 for chemistry, with a miniVidas for immunoassays, but we are working on bringing a Vitros 5600 online to replace them.
 |Our hematology analyzer is a Sysmex XT.
 |Yes, we do manual differentials, but only when something flags as seriously abnormal on the analyzer.
[Hey I'm currently an MLS student and will be graduating in three semesters. What's the job market currently like? From what I've found it still looks pretty good, but the level of automation in labs today is a bit of a concern.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1k5c25/iama_medical_laboratory_scientist_mls_working_at/cblnmr3?context=5)|According to my university, for five years before I graduated more than 90% of graduates in the field were hired immediately after graduation.  From what I've seen, it's still very good.  Even with automation, there are a lot of things which are simply never going away.
[ what tips do you have for studying for the certification exam? Thanks!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1k5c25/iama_medical_laboratory_scientist_mls_working_at/cblnmr3?context=5)|As for studying, the biggest thing is not to procrastinate and then try to cram.  It's a long program, and there is a lot to learn.  You need to learn it as you go along and build on what you know. 
[What is the schooling like for MLS? And as a biology major, was there any overlap in classes? I'm working at a blood bank now, and to be a tester, you need to have a degree in MLS. It's something that I may be interested in the future, and I have a degree in biology already...](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1k5c25/iama_medical_laboratory_scientist_mls_working_at/cbljpyr?context=5)|You probably already have a good portion of the pre-reqs.  Take a look at some of your local universities and see if they have a MLS/CLS program, and maybe give them a call.
 |It's typically a 4 year degree, and has a lot of overlap with biology and other medical professions (which is the main reason I also have a biology major).
 |It's likely that you could get in on the certification program pretty quickly.
[Hey, just had to say thank you so much for working at a critical access hospital. If you're in the U.S. what do you think of the State Legislators that that refuse the new healthcare funding? I know it is a big issue for  hospitals in Missouri because they have refused it which may lead to many closing down the road. As someone who works there do you see how the special funding plays into treatment?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1k5c25/iama_medical_laboratory_scientist_mls_working_at/cblk7bk?context=5)|It definitely is an issue.  I know our hospital is having some issues with money as well, but we're not in any real trouble yet, and since we have the critical access designation we have a lot of people on our side, trying to keep our doors open.
[How many people are in the lab usually? Excluding the one weekend you're the only person.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1k5c25/iama_medical_laboratory_scientist_mls_working_at/cbljbq8?context=5)|During the day, it's usually two people on the bench (lab-slang for doing our job).  The lab manager helps out if it gets busy.
 |Currently our lab only has four full-time employees and a PRN, who is actually leaving to start a teaching career.
[Do you process biopsies? I was hospitalized back in May and it took 3 biopsies of my lung mass  before I had my diagnosis. It ended up being Hodgkin's Lymphoma, any idea why it took so long? They just kept coming back 'inconclusive'. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1k5c25/iama_medical_laboratory_scientist_mls_working_at/cblql3q?context=5)|In my position, no.  We never get tissue samples, you'd need to go to a larger facility for that.
 |I think there are some instances out there where a MLS would assist with their processing, however for the most part in my experience biopsies are done by pathologists.
 |The reason they take so long depends on what's actually being done.  Often they're actually making slides and looking at the cells, which can be an extensive process that's as much an art as a science.  They may also be using some genetics techniques, which tend to take significantly longer than routine lab work.
[Have you ever mixed up samples and given the results to the wrong patient?  If so, how did you deal with it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1k5c25/iama_medical_laboratory_scientist_mls_working_at/cbljtz5?context=5)|Have I done it?  Not to my knowledge.  I always double-check when labeling, and when collecting specimens I'm very careful to confirm the patient's identity.  But mistakes can and do happen.
 |How we would correct it if it happened would depend on the exact circumstance.  If it's a clerical/transcription error, we'd issue a corrected report.  If it's a case of a mislabeled specimen or something like that, the ideal way would be to contact the physician as soon as possible, inform them of the error.  
[How long does a test usually take? Does it depend on the sample/what you're testing for?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1k5c25/iama_medical_laboratory_scientist_mls_working_at/cbljoto?context=5)|Turn-around-time varies greatly depending on what test it is.
 |I can get CBC results out within five minutes of receiving the specimen.
 |Chemistry results usually take twenty minutes or so, partly because we need to centrifuge them to separate the cells from the plasma/serum first.
 |Urine tests can take anywhere from 5 minutes to twenty minutes or so.
 |Bloodbank testing (type and cross type stuff) usually takes at least 1-3 hours.
 |Almost all microbiology testing takes 1-5 days.
[I saw my school does no offer this position, so, my question to you is, what websites can I visit, or what is the process to go about becoming an MLS?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1k5c25/iama_medical_laboratory_scientist_mls_working_at/cblnv5f?context=5)|I think the [ASCP website](http://www.ascp.org/Functional-Nav/Career-Center) would be a good place for you to start.  I think you'll probably be wanting to find a professional program.
 |And it's a certification.  You can go on for a master's (and a doctorate) in the field, but they're not required.
[if I were to obtain a master's, would that grant any increase in pay or is it just for resume building purposes?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1k5c25/iama_medical_laboratory_scientist_mls_working_at/cblohwy?context=5)|Yes.  But seriously, if you have a masters you're overqualified for some positions, where the facility is probably looking for someone with just the 4 year program for day-to-day stuff, but you'd get more attention when applying for supervisor and specialist positions.
 |Also, aside from the masters program, there are also a lot of special endorsements you can get in various fields, such as chemistry, hematology, microbiology, and blood-bank.
 |And my pay is about typical for most states, I think.  Maybe slightly above average, but I've never seen a job listing for less than $20/hour, except when they're looking for a MLS/MLT (the 4 year or 2 year job title).
 |Edit: just found this, has quite a bit of info on wages.  [Link to labmed.ascpjournals.org](http://labmed.ascpjournals.org/content/42/3/141.full.pdf+html)
[What is the most unexpected thing you've ever found?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1k5c25/iama_medical_laboratory_scientist_mls_working_at/cbljqs1?context=5)|*Streptococcus pneumoniae* in a CSF sample.  *Strep. pneumo* isn't that uncommon, but it's usually found in sputum.  That was one very, very, very sick lady.
[As someone who earned their MLT through the military (USAF\) what can you tell us about the different in the quality of your civilian MLTs and the military ones?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1k5c25/iama_medical_laboratory_scientist_mls_working_at/cblsptm?context=5)|I actually haven't worked with a lot of MLTs, most of my coworkers/teachers have been MLS or higher.
[Is any one group given more responsibility or allowed to perform in a higher capacity?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1k5c25/iama_medical_laboratory_scientist_mls_working_at/cblsptm?context=5)|However, I don't think there's much difference between the position in civilian vs military settings.  At least in a civilian setting, MLTs are able to do most of the same things that an MLS can, albeit with a bit more oversight required and a few exceptions.
[Can you elaborate what you mean by special endorsements? So, you mean to say that if I were to exclude the master's degree, I could do any of those specialties because of my degree biology?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1k5c25/iama_medical_laboratory_scientist_mls_working_at/cblp1nv?context=5)|They are basically an extra level of certification beyond just MLS that allow you to specialize in those areas.  You would still need to do the MLS certification, and they can be either aside from or in addition to the masters degree.
[What do you think overall? I'm starting a 17 month MLS program on Monday which will complete my bachelors and hopefully land me a job (assuming that I pass the ASCP exam\)... I originally was going to do pharmacy, but quickly found out that it wasn't for me. Any recommendations or life hacks you'd like to share? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1k5c25/iama_medical_laboratory_scientist_mls_working_at/cbluecs?context=5)|I definitely enjoy it, and have been quite happy with my decision to enter this field since I graduated.
 |The biggest tip I have is to not put off studying.  There is a hell of a lot of information that you need to cover, the sooner you get a grasp of it the better.  By the time you go to take the exam, everything should already be review.
[Wow. S. pneumoniae in CSF? Jesus. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1k5c25/iama_medical_laboratory_scientist_mls_working_at/cblkjov?context=5)|Yeah.  It was a pretty serious case.
 |I found out later that she'd had some kind of facial reconstruction surgery done a few years ago where they'd done something with her nasal bones, which is probably how it got to her brain.
[How's the pay? I've heard entry level is around $40-55k.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1k5c25/iama_medical_laboratory_scientist_mls_working_at/cbm0ad8?context=5)|I answered this a couple of places.  I'm currently making $26/hour.  Here's a link to the ASCP's pay study.

[Do you do urine drug tests? If so, do you use dipsticks, immunoassay, or MS?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1k5c25/iama_medical_laboratory_scientist_mls_working_at/cblm3sb?context=5)|For medical purposes, we are currently using an Elisa kit, which only gives negative/non-negative results.  Once our new chemistry analyzer is online, I believe we're going to be using that for drug screens.
 |We also do collections for occupational testing, but we're not equipped to test those.
[I actually want to major in Biology and Medical Laboratory Science as well, do you have any kind of tips that would help me out?! ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1k5c25/iama_medical_laboratory_scientist_mls_working_at/cblkaj6?context=5)|Develop good study habits.  In my university, the only people who dropped out of the program were those who didn't put the time in.
 |Also, the only reason I have the biology major is because I came across MLS late and already had all the credits I needed for it.  I don't currently get any professional advantage for it (although that could change in the future), so if you're just looking to work in a lab I'd recommend evaluating whether you need to put forth the extra effort/money.
[How hard was the ASCP exam? How much preparation did it take? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1k5c25/iama_medical_laboratory_scientist_mls_working_at/cbn6q87?context=5)|I actually thought that the final at the end of my program was more difficult than the ASCP certification exam.
 |Of course, neither of them were exactly easy.  If I hadn't spent an entire year learning the material, I would have a much more difficult time.
[Don't you just hate that massage therapists usurped the 'MT' (Medical Technologist\) designation forcing us to move to 'MLS'?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1k5c25/iama_medical_laboratory_scientist_mls_working_at/cblp58g?context=5)|Honestly, I kind of prefer Medical laboratory Scientist to Medical Technologist.  It just sounds sexier.
[What's the nastiest/scariest bacteria you have cultured?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1k5c25/iama_medical_laboratory_scientist_mls_working_at/cblrifh?context=5)|Probably the antibiotic resistant ones.  I've seen quite a bit of MRSA, and a little bit of ESBL *E. coli*.
[What is the most shocking discovery you ever made on a patient?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1k5c25/iama_medical_laboratory_scientist_mls_working_at/cbmxwa8?context=5)|Well, there was the *Streptococcus pneumoniae* in a woman's CSF that I mentioned elsewhere.
 |We also once diagnosed a guy with malaria on a routine CBC.  Which isn't really abnormal by itself, since that's often how it is diagnosed; malaria is just pretty uncommon in the US.  He had apparently just gotten back from India.
 |Once had a lipase that I had to dilute 1:20 to get it to work because it was so high above the analyzer's range.  I think it was like 44,000 U/L.  A normal lipase is 0-120ish U/L.
[What kind of weird or fucked up ebola type viruses have you found in people's bodily fluids?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1k5c25/iama_medical_laboratory_scientist_mls_working_at/cbljera?context=5)|None.
 |Our lab can only test for a handful of common viruses (the flu, Mono, RSV, and a couple others).  If the physician suspected something exotic like that, we would need to send the sample to a reference lab.  But in all likelihood, we would be transferring the patient to a larger facility anyway, so it wouldn't matter.
 |As for bacteria, I've seen *Pseudomonas aeruginos* in blood, and *Streptococcus pneumoniae* in CSF.
[That's odd. Isn't *P. aeruginosa* usually in the lungs and *S. pneumoniae* found in the throat?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1k5c25/iama_medical_laboratory_scientist_mls_working_at/cblnj0y?context=5)|*Pseudomonas aeruginosa* is actually a pretty hardy pathogen and can cause a variety of infections.
 |*S. pneumoniae* is usually a respiratory pathogen.
[Have you ever thought you made a mistake with a sample that you think might have compromised the test results?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1k5c25/iama_medical_laboratory_scientist_mls_working_at/cblphm8?context=5)|If I thought the results were compromised, I wouldn't release them until I was confident that they were accurate.
 |I've had to reject quite a few specimens, including some that I collected myself, for a variety of reasons, including results that don't make sense.
 |Typically I would have it recollected, if at all possible. 
[On average how many hours a week do you work? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1k5c25/iama_medical_laboratory_scientist_mls_working_at/cbll963?context=5)|I do 3 twelve hour shifts per week, plus 1-3 nights on call.  When I'm on call, I usually get called in between zero to three times, usually less than an hour.  So usually, it's around 40 hours or so, counting call-back.
[How's the pay?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1k5c25/iama_medical_laboratory_scientist_mls_working_at/cbll1fg?context=5)|Currently, one year out of school, I'm making just over $26 an hour.  I get $1.5 dollars per hour for being on call, and any time I get called back in after hours it's automatically time and a half.
[I'm almost done graduating with a biology degree and I'm thinking about going for an accelerated certificate program (~1yr\) in MLS.  Would this put me at a disadvantage at finding a job vs others who have majored in MLS?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1k5c25/iama_medical_laboratory_scientist_mls_working_at/cblk6jq?context=5)|Absolutely not.  The only part facilities are actually interested in is the professional certification.  Once you're qualified to take the test, you can usually find a position relatively easily.
[Would you recommend this major for a pre med student?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1k5c25/iama_medical_laboratory_scientist_mls_working_at/cblkf2b?context=5)|That depends on whether you want to go to med-school immediately after college, or work for a few years.
 |Going to med-school after working in a lab for a few years is a great career path.
[Not bad.must enjoy the long weekends.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1k5c25/iama_medical_laboratory_scientist_mls_working_at/cbllhlg?context=5)|It is kind of nice, but the long shifts can get a little exhausting.  Especially if I do one shift, then go on call and get called in multiple times in the middle of the night, and then have to do another shift in the morning.
[Did your degree include lab placement?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1k5c25/iama_medical_laboratory_scientist_mls_working_at/cbm3j32?context=5)|Not completely sure what you're asking.  I was guaranteed a clinical site.  The university offered help when I was applying for a job, but I ended up not needing it.
[How long does it take to become an MLS? Im only a CPT1 right now but would like to go further with this career.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1k5c25/iama_medical_laboratory_scientist_mls_working_at/cblln01?context=5)|Assuming you have no prior college experience, it's a 4 year program.  If you buckle-down and work your ass off, you could probably do it in a little less time.
[Pretty good..I got a CMB major.how would one attain the certificate.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1k5c25/iama_medical_laboratory_scientist_mls_working_at/cbllie5?context=5)|You'd need to go through the professional program.  The one I went through was 3 months of classes and then a 9-month internship.  The structure varies a bit, but it's usually a 1 year program.
 |There are also a few other options for qualifying for the exam.
 |Check out your university and see if they have a MLS program, if they do they can walk you through what you need to do.  You should also check out the [ASCP website.](http://www.ascp.org/functional-nav/career-center)
[I would actually prefer o go to med school straight out of college, ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1k5c25/iama_medical_laboratory_scientist_mls_working_at/cbll12d?context=5)|In that case you're probably better off doing Chemistry, Biology, Physics, or something else.  Good luck!
[Interesting. Are you guys capable of testing for mycobacteria? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1k5c25/iama_medical_laboratory_scientist_mls_working_at/cblkrig?context=5)|Nope, those would be sent out.  We pretty much just do aerobic cultures on urines, wounds, stools, throats, body fluids, and other stuff like that.
[What is the worst mistake you've seen anyone in your line of work make?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1k5c25/iama_medical_laboratory_scientist_mls_working_at/cblkrgv?context=5)|Mislabeling a patient specimen.  That's about the worst thing we can possibly do.  Fortunately we caught it and no erroneous results went out.
[Probably over but here is my question, and any lab workers could post just to see: What state do you work in and how much do you make per hour? :\)  I work in ohio, I make 19.12/hr as and MLT (ASCP\) with 3 years experience...](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1k5c25/iama_medical_laboratory_scientist_mls_working_at/cblteqt?context=5)|I answered this already, but I make a little over $26/hr.  I'm in the western US, and that's about typical to a bit above average out here.
[No prior college, only vocational school. It would probably take a really long time since I work full time and am a full time mommy also. No time at the moment for that kind of studying :( maybe when my daughter is older I can put more time aside to do it because I really enjoy this job.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1k5c25/iama_medical_laboratory_scientist_mls_working_at/cbln6qk?context=5)|You might look into a Medical Laboratory Technician (MLT) program.  It's a 2 year program instead of a 4 year program.  The pay isn't as good and you're more limited in your options, but it's still a very good job and a nice step up from a phlebotomist.  It would also allow you to continue to go on for MLS later on.
[Do you guys have a VITEK? that's the only way I could survive doing micro. Thank the lab gods that our lab doesn't have micro (or blood bank for that matter\) ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1k5c25/iama_medical_laboratory_scientist_mls_working_at/cblm30c?context=5)|Yes we do.
 |Even places that deal just with microbiology are going automated for ID and sensitivities, but you still need to know how to read a plate.

Stool samples don't really bother me, and anyway we process them under the biological safety hood, so it's only the person collecting it that actually has to smell it.
 |And most of the time we wouldn't be called in for a stool in the middle of the night.
 |And I don't really mind being called in most of the time.  I get call-back pay, which is automatically time-and-a-half.  So I got that going for me.  Which is nice.
[Annnd thats my job actually.  Im a phlebotomist and we collect the stuff and send to you guys.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1k5c25/iama_medical_laboratory_scientist_mls_working_at/cbljyl4?context=5)|I work in a smaller facility, so I'm my own phlebotomist.
 |But most of the time, if we're called in after-hours, its for an ER, and the nurse will have drawn blood when they started an IV.  So we don't have to collect anything unless they're not doing an IV, or they couldn't get blood when they did.
 |And we never collect stool or urine specimens, that's always the nurse, or the patient themselves.

[Me too! I went to school for MLS and graduated May 2012 but now I do work for animals from vets and zoos. I like it a lot more. Work is a lot more interesting and hands on than the human labs. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1k5c25/iama_medical_laboratory_scientist_mls_working_at/cbljb75?context=5)|We do get some specimens from the local veterinarian.  Personally, I'm liking my lab so far.  You get more patient interaction in a small facility than in larger ones.  And because you do everything, it helps to keep your skills up.
[Thanks for doing this AMA! The lab and diagnostic services need more recognition and respect, we provide quality results that provide the healthcare team with up to 80% of the information they use to make a diagnosis.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1k5c25/iama_medical_laboratory_scientist_mls_working_at/cblkp2c?context=5)|A big part of it is that we often never see the patient.  A lot of patients think that it's the nurses or doctors who draw and test their blood, and TV hasn't really done much to correct that impression.
[I'm in my third month of the 1 year cert/clinical year MLS program. Was studying for my Micro GPC flow chart test and Med Term test I have tomorrow. Then reddit caught my attention. Then I see this.

Dear Mr. XXX,

it has come to my attention that the XXX International website (since XXX International’s website…) is written in English and since it is an international company (anyway), I decided to write this application in English. 

For this reason, I would especially like to (apply for the apprenticeship at XXX …) do the apprenticeship at XXX International, because it would be exciting and challenging (for me) to work for an internationally operating company at which I can use and improve my (already fluent) English skills.

The most appealing aspect of this job profile for me, are the opportunity to work and correspond with customers and people from different countries, as well as the (constantly) perpetually challenging duty (assignment) of organizing and planning shipping logistics.

During my internship at XXX as a Management Assistant for Insurance and Finance
I have already advised customers, learned and practiced office management and also gained experience in solving specific customer problems as a team.
   
While attending grammar school, focused on economics (Wirtschaftsgymnasium), I also got to study Economics, Business Economics (VWL, BWL), Business Informatics (Wirtschaftsinformatik) and Business English. I am also familiar with the Just-In-Time principle. 
Since these subjects appealed to me a lot, I decided to look for a job based on these topics.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss further details about me and my education with you personally.

I left shorty after by me self and went home. the next day we talked about it and seemed to have sorted it out but i still felt guilty in side. which intern made me feel like she doesnt want to have sex with me and more ( but we still had frequent/good sex) untill recently about 2 weeks ago we were having hard rough sex and after we finished she was in pain in her lady parts. and this happened 2 more times , she went and got checked and she had a bad yeast infection. so sex was off the table for abit. but i felt that i was the one who casued her pain i was the one who hurt her and i felt she saw sex with me painful because she has denied me sex 4 times in the last week . which makes me feel like i cant get her turned ON like i used too and im not giving her the sex she needs/ wants. 

so we discussed this last night and i couldn't explain myself properly and it kinda came out sounding like im pissed that shes turning me down for sex and that i expect sex everytime we hangout. and she feels like a hooker , which in turn made her cry. i back stepped and explained a lot better and she assured me that im not the cause of the pain during sex and that the sex is good and that i have nothing to worry about. And that she doesnt need sex all the time to feel close to me and she said she did notice a decline in sex but its not making her less attractive to me but instead she feels where we are in our relationship is perfect and she sometimes just wants to cuddle and hold each other and feels more connected that way. but i cant help but feel beta now in the relationship because i brought up my feelings about this and that she sees me as this pussy bitch that.

 basically im looking for a woman's side to this , would you think your bf was a beta weak man, if he brings up his feelings about not being man enough to give you proper / good sex and feels  less like a man because hes afraid hes gonna hurt you every time we have sex.

So today, I decided to pick up a decent size sack, a half oz., and just live my life like I have been...half assing finding a job, and smoking to forget real life problems. As I was on my way to follow my weekly routine and pick up to smoke, I was in my car looking for my wallet, and of course like the title says..it wasn't there.

I had a total of about $170 in there with all my credit cards including my drivers license. Now, to be honest, I was severely frustrated with losing this much money and my cards, but instead of mere frustration, disappointment and guilt was engulfing my body to the point where I realized this incident is what's going to push me to quit.
Why this particular incident? I have no idea. But, this particular wallet losing incident made me realize how much of a disappointment I have become not only to myself, but to all the important people around me. Ever since I could remember, I was quite the extrovert; making friends wherever I went, and being the ""life of the party"" at most events I attended. I always exuded confidence wherever I was and actually ENJOYED being that guy. Whenever my friends and I participated in sports or games or an type of competition I always had this thirst to be the best. I was so passionate in everything I did regardless of the situation or what we were doing. ..Then... I found weed.

I cruised through my university with a bare minimum GPA and graduated after 4 1/2 years. While attending, I worked for 2 Fortune 500 companies (one being an internship), but nothing excruciating enough to make me want to or need to quit bud. I always told myself that this was just a phase, and I would ween off my smoking, but it came to a point where I couldn't even last one full day without craving that hit..The worst part about this is that all my friends were in the same boat as me, but we were all satisfied with what how we were living our lives.

We would meet up EVERY SINGLE DAY to smoke, and smoke for the WHOLE day. Before class, after class, before a movie, after a movie, before eating, after eating, basically ANY available open time we had. So, fast forward a little bit and now one of my friends moved on to take care of his family business (received his degree), another is waiting tables still trying to complete his degree, another dropped out of college and now works at a best buy, etc. etc.
After college, I realized that by staying with this circle of friends I was constantly hurting myself and my future, so I left my group of friends. I thought this was the best idea in the world for myself, and for 2 weeks I actually quit. But then I went directly back after those 2 weeks, and haven't stopped since...the worst part about this is that in the past I used to smoke all day everyday with my friends, but now I was smoking all day everyday ALONE. I was not going out, I was staying home all day, just smoking and doing nothing at all productive. I was supporting myself with whatever money I had made throughout my previous jobs, including support from my parents, and some financial support from my sister who had just completed grad school, had ALREADY paid off her loans, and got a new 6 FIGURE job....

So pressure was mounting on me because I could never be as successful as my sister had become and I didn't really have anybody to talk to, and smoking would just erase that pressure.. This cycle went on for a long time and I was doing nothing about it. I would tell myself everyday that I was digging myself into a deeper hole and that I need to stop NOW. But, as most if not all of you know, this is so much fucking easier said than done. I just kept smoking and time literally flew by, and now I'm 25, lacking confidence, jobless, and trying to quit weed... god I seriously disgust myself.

While my family was using their hard-earned money to pay for the home mortgage, daily/monthly expenses, here I was being a useless pathetic piece of shit. By losing my wallet today, it reminded me where all my cash was actually going. This was almost a blessing in disguise because I realized how much of my time and money went into this plant. Not only time and money, but my passion had diminished, and my craving to be the best was not there anymore. I used to be proud of who I was, but now I go into the public feeling ashamed of who I am.

I've become the person that I always found most pitiful. I've become the person that I never envisioned myself to be. I genuinely don't know if this post is even comprehensive or if it even has a point. I just wrote this to tell myself this. I don't want to stay this weak loser that I've become. I ~~want~~ will be the man I've always wanted to be, full of confidence and a winner."
1k4s73,3,2013-08-11,Story of my life,offmychest9,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1k4s73/story_of_my_life/,"First of I want to mention that I'm dyslexia and I hope you can understand what I'm writing.

I wanted to write here since I lately have been thinking alot about my past. Alot of things people have said to me over the years have been stuck with me, and I can't seem to let it go no matter how hard I try. One of the first thing I remember was when I was told by my mom that I was the only unwanted child they had, and also the youngest, but at that time I didn't really think to much about it. I must have been at the age of 6-8 (shortly after my parents got divorced) when I was told I was unwanted and just thought they might have been happy even tho they didn't want me. When I was around the age of 10 years old my mom already started to talk about how when we (my older brother and sister) are at the age of 18 we would be kicked out of the house. Still didn't think to much about it, since it was everyone and not just me.

About 15 years ago (when I was 11 or 12 years old) I lost my dad to cancer. It's hard to loose one of your parents at that age, and you have no idea what that really means for your future. The day after we where told my dad had died I went to school, unlike my brother and sister who could stay home that week. One of the first lunchbreaks we had in the school I had some of kids who had bullied me come op to me. This I still remember clearly even tho it's been more then 15 years. He looked me in the eyes and asked if it was true my dad had just died. I looked at him while nodding and saying yes, and while we had eye contact he started to laugh and said ""I'm sorry"" in the most sarcasdisc why he could and walked back to the other boys while they laugh aswell. This still hunts me to this day, and I have no idea how I will react if I see this person again. That has to be the worst I'm sorry I have ever heard in my life, and nothing can ever make up for it.

Anyway, time pasted and things got worse the next couple of years. I got bullied even more when I joined a new school (the old school only had till 7 grade). They made fun of me for being poor and having no dad. Those times sucks hard.
Forward a few years, when I was around 15 my mom found a new man in her life, and I was happy for her even tho I hated that guy. He was more lazy then her and he was always drunk. Since my dad was an alcoholic I didn't really want her to be with another one of them. She didn't really care about that. One day I was feed up and ran away from home. After some texting I told her she should choose between me and him, and let's just say he didn't go anywhere. About 2 years later she found out what a scumbag he really was and had to call the cops on him since he keept harrasing us. After that night we never heard from him again. Around the age of 18 I was called in for my national service in the army and I was glad to get in. I thought it might give me a different point of view on everything and maybe I could learn a thing or to about my self. After I had completed the basic training I choose not to continue in the army since I didn't think I could shoot another person and by not being 100% sure about this I didn't want to risk the life of my buddies because of it.

When I returned home within the first week I had my mom yelling at me for not continuing in the army and being station in another country.
I tried to talk to her about it, but she never understood and only said she would have done it if she had the chance. Me and my mom where never really that close. She taught me alot of things like how to keep a house clean, cook food etc. but never really anything beyond that. I had the teach myself, math reading, writing etc. Even learned English and German better by self then ever in school. She had always let me do things on my own. She helped my brother and sister with their homework, talk to teachers, helped them get a job where she worked. But never wanted me to get a job there. Even my brothers friends could get a job there, just by talking with her.

At the age of 19 I had gotten a girlfriend that was a bit older then me (6 years older) who also had her own apartment. After a week of dating my mom keep asking her when I could move in with her since she didn't want me at home anymore. At first she thought it was funny, but when she saw my face as she told me what my mom had said she knew it was real.
I started to getting my shit together and was the one paying the bills and keeping everything neat and thight. At this point we had been dating for 6 month and I finally got a job to make sure we had money for food and bills. At this point she still hadn't paid any bills but I still didn't really mind since I was just glad I was with her. A day before my birthday she told me she was going shopping with a friend and would proberlly be gone the whole day. It wasn't untill later that evening I found out it was her Ex-boyfriend. I told her I wasn't to comfortable with that and she kinda apologized. 1 week later she told me she was leaving me, and I found out she was going to get back with her Ex. She never told me to my face what had happend in the relationship that didn't work out. That was the last girlfriend I had. It's been more then 6 years now.

Years later, I had a fallout with some of my friends I had known for my whole life. Fallout might be the wrong word since I never know what had happend. I tried to visit them and call/write them and after about 3 month like that I got a text from one of them telling me that he needed a break from me. That was when everything went down the drain. I have no idea how I keept on losing people close to me and noone had the balls to tell me why.

Since then I dropped my education, even tho I only had 1 year left, I keept telling myself I was to stupid anyway to complete it so why even bother. I had a internship at a company within my field that I enjoy working with, but had a boss that had no education within that field and I had to teach him stuff. But I was the first to get blamed when there was a error.

This has gotten way longer then I thought it would and I'm going to stop here. I mostly just made this post to force myself to read everything carefully, and maybe someone out there sees this and appreciate what they have.
If you read all of this, I appreciate you taking the time.
Have a great day, and try to keep a smile on your face whenever you can."

I'm just looking for a chance to meet some women. Not looking for anything too serious. Going on a few dates, meeting some people, having fun. Depending on how things go, it could progressively get more serious. Just not necessarily a priority. Sound good to you? Sounds great to me.

A little on me: I've been studying computer science in University City, but I'm currently on summer break and working an internship. I love to laugh and can be alternatingly goofy and fun or serious and thoughtful. I'm a huge music fan who'll listen to almost literally anything (no, really - jazz, rock, punk, rap, you name it!) and who can play a little himself, even. I'm a little into some other arts as well - I enjoy reading (even if I can't do it much these days) and I've been getting a little into TV lately too (*Mad Men* and *Breaking Bad* - can't wait for tonight!). I've got a fairly nerdy personality (after all I did say I'm studying computer science), but I'm not huge into games or that many other ""nerdy"" hobbies.

So that's a little on my interests and personality. Pictures I can do upon messaging. And about the location: I'm closer to Reading, but trips to Philly are fairly easy, and, if things go well, that's where I'll be living in a month and a half anyway. Hope to talk to you soon!

Oh and I totally meant ""fum."" You know, ""fucking unbelievably magnificent.""

I'd never admit it but when they made fun of my body it hurt, I never showed them that and always made a truthful comment towards them with venom but latter I would cry.






 I know from health checkups I'm a healthy weight, but I'd never know that they were just jealous of my body bc of my curves. my body developed before all of theirs and now I look like a college student roaming the halls and often mistaken for an intern, combined with my studiousness its not surprising...to anyone but me. I'm headed to the locker room to change in the bathroom, I hate seeing them snear at me and very conscious of other girl that have had pictures taken of them in the locker room by said mean girls. I open the door avoiding looking to right or left despite hearing a ruckus...there is always a ruckus in here over something when I hear a cheerleader voice shout ""oooh!! even better!! come over here Ginger we have a gift for you"" she chuckles evilly.





I roll my eyes only coming in bc I need to get my street clothes so I can get out of softball practice clothes. my black tank top is damp and bc of it emphasizes my ample DD breasts and pale skin as I round the corner. I gasp shocked seeing my friend tied down on a bench butt naked and cock erect, tied and leaking. his face is red as he screams on panties stuffing his mouth for help. she laughs bouncing on his chest making him lose his breath as I scream ""what the fucking hell are you doing!?!??"" I throw myself at her grabbing her and pulling her off him as she yells at me. I start trying to untie him when I hear him screaming louder his eyes shifting terrified in front of me begging me to look down.






I gulp seeing her holding a lighter a flame next to his cock, he tries flexing away but he bobs back closer to it as he cries struggling while I grab at the lighter screaming at her again. she laughs the bitch. I see two more girls now with lighters and ciggeretts, my friend is over 6 foot there is no way I will be able to grab all of them; one standing near his head, bitch at his groin and another waiting and lighting her lighter for when I move to pounce. I look at bitch girl in front of me. ""what the hell is the matter with you?? shut it off and stop this!!"" I scream at her




""phh some friend he is, you defending him....would you if you knew he was planting a camera in here?? hmmm?? or that he was aiming it at your locker-probably doesn't know you change in the bathroom bc you're too good to be around us. now we are very pissed, either I get to leave some marks so dummy here remembers this and doesn't try this again....or... you sit on his mouth. you heard me, sit on his mouth and let him make you cum, and then ride his cock till he cums...in your pussy, then sit on his mouth again. I want him to clean up his mess, so you STAY there till your pussy is clean. then I don't care what you do with him, we'll leave. you have my word, but untill you finish.. we'll stay nearby ....just in case you get cold feet you know. Ginger my hand is getting tired I could just drop it....hot metal an all you know..."" I swallow my yells at her as I look at you on the bench.






I had always liked you my friend...but not this way and certinally hadn't ever thought of doing somthing like this to you. I look at you feeling like a bad friend even if I would have beat the crap out of you for the camra I wouldn't have done this. your tearful eyes look at me pleading as one of the girls pulls panties out of your mouth. ""please Ginger, she means it!! they ugh "" I hate seeing the fear and shame in your eyes when the girl that pulled the panties out caresses your face ""hmm he's a real good pussy licker Ginger, a wonderful tongue. like a vibrator but better! just take a seat see, he wants you"" she chuckles seeing your cock leaking pre freely now despite the tie.





bitch chuckles, ""should have brought you in sooner"" she laughs as you look at me pleadingly ""please...don't let her burn me"" its almost a whimper. I want to hug you and make your fear go away as she gives me an evil eye and brings the flame closer. you yelp crying trying to pull away ""Please Ginger just fucking sit!!"" I look at you with compassion and hate to her as I slip my shorts off exposing my toned thighs I straddle your chest. bitch makes a snort behind me seeing my soft silky black panties still on as I hover over your mouth. "" just bc you like an audience doesn't mean I do."" I sneer at her as I pull the pannties aside and sit quickly on your mouth. I moan to my shame as I feel your open hot mouth on my sex your tongue laving my clit like a kiss as you look up at me. I expect to see hate or shame, but instead I see lust, and gratefullnes. I don't understand how you could have either for me as you mumble thank you on my cunt. I moan feeling your vibrations as your eyes smile seeing how sensitive my body is. I know why it is, part of my fear. I know I'm pmsing and that I'm at my most fertile... but if you clean me...that would help prevent it right? I try reasoning with myself as my pussy slickens on your mouth"

I was going to wait and make this a celebration of 10,000 subscriptions to /r/accounting, but I felt it better to provide this information to you now in light of recruiting season's imminent start. This guide is split into three parts, continued in the comments section below (it is far too large to fit into one post). Be sure to refer to this guide frequently throughout the entire process this fall for the best results.

To start, a big thank you is in order to /u/computanti for the idea and providing a place for me to start in creating this guide. This guide was put together by myself and the acquired help from a fellow colleague that is an expert on the networking and recruiting process. We have recently been on both sides of the public accounting recruiting process as students as well as professionals recruiting for our firms. Questions and feedback are more than welcome. 

[**Here is the full guide provided in Google Docs**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10vZEI8_0rWePbVo0cIS6CWlM1sYbX0ywVsgIbokm2bk/edit?usp=sharing)

&gt;***Disclaimer***: This guide is based off of our experiences in the recruiting process and some aspects may differ at your school or region. The following is put together based on two schools in separate regions that are highly targeted by the Big 4 and regional public accounting firms. The information provided here is intended for your purposes to assist in the recruiting process only. *(If you would also like to offer advice, please provide your qualifications).* Also, please note that fall tax season is fast approaching as well, so I apologize if there is a delay or I am unable to answer all PMs. I encourage you to post here in order to allow others to help as well.



Part 1 - ***How to Prepare and Your School's Career Fair***

&gt;By now, you have heard time and time again how important networking is in order to obtain an internship or entry-level full-time position in the accounting field, but usually it is not thoroughly discussed on how to network. The purpose of this guide is to bridge that gap between the process of knowing about networking and how to properly execute it. There are two different types of students during the recruiting process:
 
&gt;&gt;**Prepared** Recruits &amp; **Unprepared** Recruits

&gt;This guide is provided to help inform you on how to best become a *prepared* recruit. Successful networking requires building a good rapport with firm representatives and this cannot be done by simply going to one or two events. The most prepared and successful recruits are the ones that go to every recruiting event. Firms pre-identify students through these events, so the more they meet you, the more you will stand out.

***How to Prepare***

&gt;**Use your resources to the fullest** – Networking is all about building relationships. Use your professors, fellow students, alumni network, graduate students, accounting organizations, and school’s Career Management Center in order to learn how to prepare and create connections. This field is as much about the people you know as it is what you know. With this in mind, do not ask someone to pass along your résumé without getting to know them first, as that person will be vouching for you.

&gt;**Linkedin Account** – See the Google Doc for notes on this, post has met its character limit.

&gt;**Join one or more student accounting organizations and get involved** – These organizations provide exclusive access and opportunities for firms to meet students and identify potential recruits. Firms are looking for well-rounded students in leadership positions on campus that is outside of the classroom. 

&gt;**Continuously improve your résumé** – Your résumé is always a work in progress and it never hurts to have others take a look at it. The more feedback you get, the more developed it can become. Firms receive thousands of résumés each recruiting season and likely hundreds just from your school’s career fair alone. Small details stand out when being compared to such a large candidate base. Know everything that is on your résumé and be prepared to talk about it in detail.

&gt;**Elevator Speech** – Have a well-rehearsed brief summary about yourself that lasts about 20-30 seconds. It is key to make a proper first introduction to professionals. State your name, major, year, expected graduation date, and position you are interested in (intern/full-time, tax/audit/advisory).

&gt;**Know your Goals** – You should have an idea of some of your short-term and long-term goals. For example, some short-term goals might be to obtain an internship or finish your degree, while long-term goals might be to pass the CPA Exam, decide on the service line you want to go into, and where you want to be in 5-10 years.

&gt;**Be able to answer the question “Why Audit or Why Tax?”** – The firms are looking to see if you have put significant effort into deciding what you want to do with your career. While you probably do not know what you want to do for sure, it is extremely important to pick one or the other during the recruiting process. Firms do not like to see candidates that are undecided. Generally during career fairs, firms have three piles: Audit, Tax, and Undecided. Most only take into consideration two of those piles.

&gt;**Stay current with news about firms of interest** – Most firms will either frequently be cited in the news or actively post their own articles on their firm’s website. Be sure to keep up with this information to provide relevant conversation topics and show that you are interested in the firm.

&gt;**Professional Attire** – This topic is often talked to death, but it is very important. Never be underdressed, it will never look bad to dress more professionally (make sure your clothes fit well). Conservative is always better, be sure to conceal tattoos and do not wear anything too revealing. When attending single firm events, try to match your attire with the firm’s colors, the firm representatives you meet will take noticed and be very impressed.

&gt;**Necessary Accessories** – There are a couple items you should consider having with you at smaller networking events, a *personalized name tag* (under debate) and your own *business card*. Often, networking events do not provide name tags. Having your own when they are not provided will help professionals and recruiters remember your name and thus recall how often you attended networking and recruiting events. Business cards are also important because outside the career fair, résumés are too obstructive to hand to professionals at each networking event. A simple business card providing your name, contact info, position you are interested in, and status in school is much more effective for smaller networking events. After you exchange business cards at the event, go home and e-mail the person you met with your résumé.

&gt;**Good Questions to Ask** - You should be asking thoughtful and engaging questions to learn more about the people you network with and their firms. Do not simply ask yes or no questions, and definitely do not try to ask highly technical questions with the objective of stumping the professional. *Use the following as a guide to come up with your own questions, do not just copy these:*

&gt;&gt;•	Give me an example of a time you made a mistake and describe how your superiors dealt with it.

&gt;&gt;•	What does your firm do to prevent conflicting assignments for low level staff between two different supervisors?

&gt;&gt;•	Give me some examples of how your firm distinguishes itself from the competition.

&gt;&gt;•	What is one realistic thing you wish you could change about your job?

&gt;&gt;•	Does your firm's culture reward employees who get outside their comfort zone and take on new challenges, even if they make mistakes while trying something new?


&gt;**Thank You Notes** – In most circumstances, e-mail is the appropriate form of sending thank you notes as it is faster and more convenient. Always send an e-mail to every professional you speak to at each event within 24 hours of meeting them. If this was at a small event and the first time you met them, attaching your résumé is a good idea. Firm professionals meet hundreds if not thousands of students throughout the year and if you do not follow up quickly, they are likely to forget who you are and the connection you made will be lost. In the e-mail, it is good to ask a relevant question in order to create a dialogue. Be sure to review your emails multiple times for errors before sending them.

***Your School’s Career Fair***

&gt;All your preparation above is to succeed at the Career Fair. **Most firms, at least in the southeastern region recruit at this event and meet most their hiring needs for the next 12 months during the fall recruiting season.** This makes it essential that you attend this event. Bring plenty of résumés and business cards, wear your best business professional attire, and prepare to network the entire time with recruiters and professionals. *The goal is to convince these people that you are someone they would like to work with.*

&gt;Do not go to your top choice of employers to start. Go to a couple firms you are not very interested in and use this as a chance to get warmed up. You are probably going to feel a little awkward and nervous standing around in a big convention center, waiting in line to talk to a stranger and hand them a résumé. That is exactly why you do not want to start out at your top choice and make a terrible impression. Get comfortable and then move to the booths of your favorite firms.

1k49gg,404,2013-08-10,They didn’t know that it was just a show.,urban_teller,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1k49gg/they_didnt_know_that_it_was_just_a_show/,"Of course they had volunteered. Low budget; volunteers instead of actors. It’s cheaper that way and, if you’re lucky, more interesting.

That’s the core of reality TV.

You will have seen the shows; weird experiments and challenges or just a group locked inside a bungalow and manipulated to hate and attack and love each other.

Now, not all shows make it to your TV screens. Some because they are too boring. Some because the test audiences turn their thumbs down. And some because of accidents.

Accidents, that’s what you could call it.

Of course, they all volunteered and they all volunteered all liability away. Those blanko contracts are strong; even with such unusual cases. The director had trouble and we a bit too - but our studio got off with just a bit of paper money to keep things quiet.

TV works in very simple ways. With ratings and advertisers in your back there is no room for creativity. Creativity dies a slow and dry death the higher you climb the ladder. I saw quite a few that lost their creativity first, then their honor, then their soul.

That thing that actresses sleep with directors - well, think not of the director as that evil or the actress as a slut. It’s a simple business transaction. The director lost his soul; there is nothing left in his life and he has long learned that the power he seems to hold is in reality just a sham and illusion; the power to do what you are told. He does it to own at least some power; to exert what he can and feel like a man again.

The actress, of course, just wants her dream fulfilled. She sells her soul because she thinks her life’s dream will be fulfilled. Then she finds that selling your soul once is not enough. That most shows tanks before they are ever seen and that even when they are seen they will likely will tank soon after. It’s the plot. The way it goes. There are exceptions, of course, actresses and actors - oh, don’t ask me what *they* have to do to get a role - that keep their morality and standing and some of them even succeed. But for far too many the pleasure of the film becomes a trap for their souls and bodies; to consume them until they are too exhausted or too ugly to be consumed any further.

There are too many stories from inside. Too many shoe-licking and sensitive-part-massaging stories to be told.

With those soulless creatures wandering the studios reality TV often seems like a relief. Characters so desperate to be famous that they lose all their shame and soul for free. Volunteers to be sacrificed to the viewers’ voyeurism.

Now, but there are different volunteers. Those that know and those that don’t.

Some know what show they are in. They go to castings and make it through the rounds until they are herded into a room where they can be prostituted to the audience.

But the more interesting ones are those that don’t know. They volunteer. They fill out questionnaires, are quickly taped to show their bodies and voices and then they sign a document that says they are ready for *everything*.

Times were different back then, TV was still big and invading all our minds. Still, it’s not even ten years ago. It doesn’t work much different now. It probably could still happen today. I’m wondering whether we are the only ones that did such a thing.

Ready for everything the studio chooses for them. They resign their fate; they give their soul for free and don’t even know in what way it will be abused.

Now, we got 10 of those. Five men and five women. All good looking, of course, nobody wants to see the ugly reality on TV. Some stupid, some smart. All loud and opinionated, as it should be, but two of them shy for good measure.

As said there is no creativity. Creativity has no place in the film and show business. It’s all about safety and sure ratings and sure ad revenue.

So we took a concept - I’m sure you’ll know which - and tweaked it a bit.

They are locked not in a house, but a room instead.

Not so outrageous, is it? That’s what the studio bosses thought too. So we spiced it up a little.

They didn’t know that it was just a show.

We thought about leading them into the room; telling them that there would be a casting or free viewing or one of the other things that attention-seekers crave for. Then someone, and I don’t remember who but I hope it wasn’t me, had the glorious idea.

“What if,” that person said. “We pretend to abduct them?”

Now, really, I hope that wasn’t me.

Their relatives were in on it, of course. That’s why we later had to pay a lot.

One snatched from her car.

Another on his way home from work.

A third in the shopping mall bathroom.

The fourth on his forest jog.

The fifth, the youngest one, pulled into a car on her way home from school.

The sixth, the shy accountant, taken as a fake hostage in a fake police shootout.

The seventh pulled under water and chloroformed on her beach holidays.

For the eighth, a father of two, we took his sons and told him to come to get them back. That hacked off little boy’s hand was surely well done. Never heard a man scream like that.

The ninth taken from her bedroom at night. We made sure to knock her out. Then to tie her up well. Then to wait for her to wake. Oh, how she squeamed on the way to the car.

The tenth, of course, our favorite. On his way to class, followed by four men. He noticed them but ran too slow. He tried to fight back when they cuffed and gagged him. When they pulled his trousers down he only cried. Of course, nothing was really inside him. But they were convincing, I have to say that.

A pleasure, all of them in the same room. Some cried and some screamed. Mostly they fought against each other.

They never so much as thought of the contract they had signed. They never so much as noticed the cameras above.

It was good to watch them try and scale the walls. There was a fist fight early on, but they got calmer soon after.

“We have to work together,” said one of them.

They tried to build a pyramid but failed every time. Too weak, even the men, and the walls too high.

The bathroom was meant to be a good joke. Something practical, to keep things fresh. When the first man went we let him in and out just fine. But when the first woman went, the young thing, well, let’s say she was surprised that the walls came down and that all was dark around her.

We saw her, of course, with the right camera you can see enough. It was sure to be a good show with the girl scratching her fingers open on the bare metal wall.

The others were not so helpful as expected. Without thought they banged against the metal wall and tried to ram it to open.

Poor thing. Admittedly, we too were at fault. We should have known that the noise would be reflected inside the small room; that the one inside would hear too much and too loud.

Still, legally all fine. They signed it. No problem there and fun enough for us.

Now, it wasn’t really planned that way with her promise. She promised she would take her clothes off if she was let out.

We found that funny enough and opened the wall. We didn’t really expect her to follow through. But she did.

Those eyes. If I could describe those greedy eyes in full tones I would, but they cannot be described.

You would think the men would have pity - oh, but no. Some showed shame and pretended to look away, but they all stared. The women, too, they all stared. Two of them were even laughing among themselves, giggling at the young thing’s misfortune.

We thought about ending it there, or about a bit more instruction. But it can all be censored, after all, and as the slogan goes - sex sells. Too late anyway. She waived those rights, so all was good. Still I’m happy that those tapes were never seen by the police.

They didn’t know that it was just a show.

It got a bit worse from then on. We had it planned for two weeks. Food thrown in from above - bread at first, then insects. Hungry people eat many things. Nothing bad about that anyway - some are even quite tasty. Grilled of course, *I* never ate them raw.

Things were going too fast for our taste. So we tightened the plan a bit and skipped the bread.

Now, the other thing we had not planned was their fear. It seems none of them wanted to use the toilet anymore; particularly not after the young thing put her underwear back on and we made the door close and open two times; just for good measure. She took it off again, if you are wondering.

The mess was pretty quick. First they had a corner where they did it and the others looked away. But the floor was a bit too even for that purpose. The liquids spread until they were all huddled on just one side.

Probably we should have stopped it then. But the lawyers said it was okay. The girl was legal age - we checked twice - and would be well payed to stop any complaints. The others, of course, were all still fine, except for the mess on the floor.

But what are feet in a bit of feces? Not so bad in the end. Everybody has a toilet leak once or twice in their life.

Water, just so you know, was okay. They had their water through a small hole in a wall. Big enough for a mouth to go in and drink; but the drainage too small for anything to be pushed inside.

That bug thing did not work out so great as we thought. They landed on the ground and quickly huddled deep in the, well, mud. Not such a good choice for food. The ten were complaining of hunger a lot.

We dropped a few other items; just to see what they would do. Paper airplanes were good fun but didn’t live long. Then balloons worked quite well. There were a few pieces of wooden and special matches made without heads. They had a few hours of fun trying to get those to make a fire. Who knows what they would have done with a fire. 

I want to be honest here, after all this is all about honesty. We were excited when the first man took a bite of his own, well, product.

“Not as horrible as I thought.”

We thought that would be a good episode title.

Our accountant grew bolder that day. He was the one to say “I can’t stand it” and enter the toilet again.

It was meant as a joke. You have to believe that. We didn’t mean to truly hurt him. Just to lower the wall so he would be caught too and the girl not alone.

Really, it was his fault that he kept his hand outside; that he thought that his hand would stop the door.

That was one loud cracking sound and one loud scream.

We wanted to get him out; we really did. It was just not that easy. When we lowered the rope one of the other men climbed on it. We had to swing him against the wall until he fell back down; right in the black and yellow mud and on the stack of bugs.

There was not really a way to open it all up; to calm them down and continue the show. There were not even doors down there; the only way would be to pull them up.

It was just going to be a day anyway. We had a doctor tell us it would be okay; that it could all be healed. Not that it mattered to us. We knew the money would be good enough for him to stay quiet. Money and a false fame; that’s all that people need and want.

We really wanted to make it easier. I wouldn’t say it was my idea but I would lie if I said that I didn’t have at least some contribution to it.

I swear with all my soul that the paper said “Only one more day” when we threw it into the room and went to lunch after that.

We expected a frenzy - excitement and hope and maybe even celebration.

Sure, it fell in the mud, but they must have ripped it somehow. Ripped it in half.

“Only one,” that’s what they read.

They took it a bit different from what we thought.

It was the father of two. I think that’s what made it; he had kids and didn’t want to risk a thing.

He got his hands on one of pieces of wood; a long one.

We were at lunch. There were only two interns in the room and not the smartest ones at that. By the time they called us it was all a bit too late.

He was quick; you have to leave him that. He started thrashing on another man’s head and within just a moment that man was with his face in the mud; the legs twitching but the arms calm.

Before the father made another move another man pushed him to the ground. He hit the man’s back until there was blood, but the others managed to hold him down and wrest the piece of wood from his hand and smash it on his head instead.

But that man, the one that now had the piece of wood, he too understood.

He must have done some sort of martial arts. He got the accountant pretty quick and the other man right in the bathroom. The interns should have locked him in there, who knows why they didn’t know how to close that door.

He went for the women next. They were huddled together at the other end, right where the mud was. But the moment he came they ran to the sides and only one slipped and had his foot on her head until she stopped moving. The other women didn’t try to help.

They found more pieces of wood though and assembled on the other side. When the man came running the young thing threw her stick at him and must have got an eye because he screamed and slipped and a moment later the women had their clubs on his face. He pulled one of them down and choked her, but the others made sure that he stopped moving soon after.

That must have been the time when the interns found us; not ten minutes after the paper was dropped inside.

I remember how the girl was screaming and crying and it took us a minute to calm her down enough that she could tell us to quickly go back.

That minute would maybe have saved one of them. Not sure about that.

When the man stopped moving the women were the quick ones. One said “Stop! Stop!” and the young thing stopped but the third one standing was quick to hit the club on the choked woman’s face - just to make sure.

The young thing stumbled backwards and fell over the father of two and with her ass in the mud. The two other women both got their clubs and went one after the other around the place while the young thing pretended to be out cold.

While running one got the other’s hair and they both fell and one club hit a face and the other a head from the side. They both fell and struggled and the clubs fell out of their hands. There were fingers in eyes. Once you’ve heard those screams, even just from tape, believe me, you don’t forget them again.

One still had an eye and was on her knees when she’d choked the other.

That’s when the young thing saw her chance.

“Now or never,” that’s what she must have thought.

A piece of wood on the woman’s head and she too was out on the floor. Funny to learn later that she wasn’t dead, really, she drowned instead from the brown liquid on the floor or maybe her own blood.

We got the young thing out. Got her a towel and the camera. The “You’re on television” moment didn’t go as well as we had planned it the weeks before.

Was easy to keep the girl quiet. She’d done things and she knew it.

The bodies on a boat and the boat sent out and sank. Told the coast guard a wrong location and they never even found the wreck.

We made a trailer and pilot and all. Thought to at least get some of the cost back. The studio bosses stopped us. Better sunk cost then the risk to get any news about it out. It was just a room after all; we could have said it all happened on a boat. But the bosses thought it could get too much trouble even with the last few minutes left out.

Those tapes were all meant to be destroyed. Who knows whether that was done. I sure as hell wouldn’t have. Just hope no one finds it before I’m dead.

It’s funny, I saw that room once again. In a martial arts movie. Guess they only cleaned it up and didn’t even bother to take it apart.

We, the crew, got out of the mess. We pretended to be nice little sheep that didn’t know a thing about the boat being dangerous. That’s the wonder of a good lawyer.

The director was less lucky. Had a court case scheduled but jumped his bail and drowned on the way to Cuba. Might have been less of an accident.

The girl, well, that’s the only one I’m really sad about.

I was told she kept talking about bugs nibbling on the bodies while she was waiting to be saved. Lost half her weight. Had nightmares and such things. Cut her wrists once and failed.

They drugged her pretty bad in that institution.

Supposedly she never talked about it. Funny actually. They said she got better with the drugs and allowed her out for half a day. She went straight to a supermarket and that time she did the cuts deep enough.

And all that because they didn’t know that it was just a show."

I would love some input.,misspelledusermane,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/1k8oe3/12_year_career_flowchart_i_would_love_some_input/,"I graduated in Dec 2012 with a degree and accounting and a degree in finance. I have been working on the CPA exams since and have passed 2 of them. Here are my options:

Option #1 - Find a full-time entry level auditing at a public accounting firm. *This option is difficult since public accounting firms don't seem to be hiring right now.*

Option #2 - Find a full-time accounting position at a private company. Work there for a year, and then start my Masters in Jan 2015. Finish Masters and head into public accounting that way. *It's much easier to find a regular accounting position in the next few months than a public accounting position, but that would mean I would get a late start on my public accounting career*

Option #3 - Try to find part-time work, temporary work, internship or volunteer work as an accountant. Get into the Masters program in Jan 2014, get into public accounting that way.

1k86bb,1,2013-08-12,[Troubleshooting] Glitches/Freeze while playing games with my brand new PC with gtx 770.,[deleted],buildapc,https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/1k86bb/troubleshooting_glitchesfreeze_while_playing/,"I built my brand new PC last week and as you understand I was (and still am) very excited to have so much more speed available to me. But one thing bothers me. When playing games there are some small glitches/freeze. It is not really big, but annoying enough to be noticeable. My first thought was that maybe I played the games with the specs too high. That did not make a difference. I tried turning of v-sync in the games, also no difference. I played Crysis 2 (Ultra and High settings), Battlefield 2 Bad Company, Total War Shogun 2 and Company of Heroes (2006 version). All the games had it more or less but Crysis 2 was the worst one. I played them all on 2560x1440 resolution.

Here are my specs

* Asus Z87-DELUXE - Moederbord - ATX - LGA1150 Socket - Z87
* MSI GTX770 Lightning - graphics card - GeForce GTX 770 - 2 GB GDDR5 - PCI Express 3.0 x16
* Be quiet! Pure Power BQT L8-CM-630W - ATX12V 2.31/ EPS12V 2.92 - 80 PLUS 
* Seagate Barracuda ST2000DM001 - Vaste schijf - 2 TB - intern - 3.5"" - SATA-600 - 7200 tpm 
* Fractal Design Define R4
* Corsair Vengeance Pro Series - Memory- 16 GB : 2 x 8 GB - DIMM 240-pins - DDR3 - 1600 MHz

* Be quiet! Dark Rock Advanced C1 CPU cooler
* Dell UltraSharp U2713HM - LED-monitor - 27'' - 2560 x 1440
* Windows 8 pro, 64bit

Here are a few logfiles, [a gif](http://i.imgur.com/mY1jbuq.gif), I made with MSI afterburner. You can see that there is a significant drop in power, GPU usage and framerate.

My first thought was that maybe my PSU not powerful enough. I made several calculations on googled websites and came to about 500watt when buying my new pc. But now with the glitches I digged a little deeper. The ASUS PSU calculator recommends 700watt and The spec for the MSI GTX770 Lightning that I have recommend a 600 watt, 12v 42A, two 8-pin PCi Express power.

On my Be Quiet 630watt PSU box is stated that the combined output of the 12v1 and the 12v2 is 47A. It also states that the GPU has two independent 12v rails. Actually when I read that I came to the conclusion that I had put only one PCIe power cable (a rail?) in my GTX770 instead of two. The PCIe power cable itself has three plugs, one for the PSU, the other two I just put in the Graphics Card. So I plugged in the extra powercable (the second rail?) in the GPU and the PSU. I was relieved I had found it...but no. It did not make any difference, it was maybe even worse.

Ok long story but no solutions yet. I am still thinking PSU but even in old games with low load it happens (but it is more rare). My second thought is Drivers, yes the good old drivers. I installed the latest drivers 320.49. My third thought is faulty graphics cards. But to be honest I just don't know. And before I buy a new PSU or send back my graphics card, I am looking for opinions. 

So do you guys have any recommendations or maybe even a solution? Thx in advance."

Questions|Answers
:--|:--
[What does the University of Rochester's motto, Meliora, mean to you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1k7q6l/i_am_jon_burdick_the_dean_of_admissions_at_the/cbm7nrj?context=5)|You can't trick me into giving away the best answers for our supplemental application. 
[Rephrasing- How does what you do in your job reflect the idea of becoming ever better? What are things you have pushed for/done to achieve this?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1k7q6l/i_am_jon_burdick_the_dean_of_admissions_at_the/cbm8flh?context=5)|Wow--I live Meliora nonstop. I truly believe incremental positive change is the best way forward in life. You get breakthroughs and they're amazing, but ""planning"" for them seems foolish. So we've grown in purposeful ways during my entire ten years here (both enrollment and admissions activity). 
[Although U of R has very high academic prestige, it is not that well known by people. How do U of R students rank in employ-ability and how well do employers think of them?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1k7q6l/i_am_jon_burdick_the_dean_of_admissions_at_the/cbm7u1w?context=5)|I've never known a Rochester student who couldn't get a job. I'm happier to say most of them have enough confidence to look for and ultimately get really good jobs--the kind they like doing rather than just those that pay the bills. Rochester isn't a household name but (as it turns out) most colleges aren't. Our reputation has grown over 10 years mostly through word-of-mouth, which is sustainable, rather than one-time media buys.
[How do you see the University expanding in the future? (e.g. internationally, becoming more selective, opening up more residence halls across the river, etc.\)  What the hell happened this past year? Were the expected yields miscalculated or something? (for reference, some nontraditional students are gonna have to live in upperclassmen housing because there aren't enough spots in freshman housing\)  Does the University **plan** to increase class sizes, and is there a plan to make the university more selective by slightly diminishing class sizes?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1k7q6l/i_am_jon_burdick_the_dean_of_admissions_at_the/cbm7wlu?context=5)|1) pretty much yes. Why should a student who lives &lt;10 miles away get a pass on showing that they've done their homework about what Rochester really does and doesn't offer them? 2) more international seems likely. We're way out in front of peers and it has been positive all the way. More selectivity also seems a given, since that has grown each year. More residence halls across the river--we're coming to the end of a period of rapid enrollment growth, so probably not. We'll see more upperclassmen searching for private housing on the other side of the river, however.
 |3) This year we had a surge in applications from very-well-qualified applicants. History would have told us that our yield was going to decrease a lot. It didn't. The phenomenon was particularly striking with international students, where average test scores were up more than 100 points for admitted. We believed they'd choose elsewhere (they tend to be more sensitive to rankings) but they're coming to Rochester.  My apologies to upperclassmen who were displaced, although Rochester's percentage of upperclassmen housed on campus remains one of the highest you'll see at any university.
[In your 28 years has any one application (or a few\) stood out from the others?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1k7q6l/i_am_jon_burdick_the_dean_of_admissions_at_the/cbm7ow6?context=5)|One of my favorite applicants of all time is now my regional director in New York City. He distinguished himself as an inventive leader on paper, including staging a protest walkout at his public school in Portland. When we met for his interview he talked about it with a sense of humor. Challenging the status quo and demonstrating humor both go a long way with me.
[How will Rochester market itself over the next 10 years and how will this affect our global impact? Also, are there any plans (other than College Town of course\) that will make UR more attractive for prospective students against our peers (Emory, UChicago, Northwestern, Brown, etc.\)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1k7q6l/i_am_jon_burdick_the_dean_of_admissions_at_the/cbm7tes?context=5)|Rochester has three things going for it that have contributed to 40% growth in enrollment over the last 7 years--1) commitment to growing new programs, facilities and faculty; 2) unique curricular philosophy; 3) that unusual combination of huge research with still-small undergraduate population, so most/best teaching is actually coaching. We're ahead of most peers. We stack up well against almost anybody and we've made inroads head-to-head against several peers per the numbers, including all four of the schools you're listing.
[UR Class of 2002 alum here.  Just wondering if anyone has actually been trapped inside Dean Burgett's fiery furnace?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1k7q6l/i_am_jon_burdick_the_dean_of_admissions_at_the/cbm7q0x?context=5)|At last count 37 students were in there. In winter months people go searching for it.
[How does the university help aspiring undergraduates who want to do research ?? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1k7q6l/i_am_jon_burdick_the_dean_of_admissions_at_the/cbm8gbb?context=5)|The door is open to anyone who's willing to hustle and learn, and 90% of Rochester undergraduates do it. We give one grant program for some entering students, and another for students once they're here. 
[What are your requirements inside and outside of academics (such as charity work\) for admissions?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1k7q6l/i_am_jon_burdick_the_dean_of_admissions_at_the/cbm7zx9?context=5)|""Requirements"" is kind of a dirty word at Rochester.

The closest established major (and it's very interesting) is Archaeology, Technology and the History of Structures. Enough math and physics to advance you in your civil engineering career, plus you get to spend a summer in Italy studying the foundations of 2,000 years of Western building.

Mechanics (spelling, sentence structure etc.) can't be so bad that they get in the way, but I'm trying to read an essay to see if it feels like I'm talking to and listening to a real person. The only way to get there is to give yourself time (as in weeks/months) to return to it several times and do multiple rewrites.

Would that help/hurt/no affect on the chances of getting in?  I know this is only looking at academics and not any other part of the applicant but my school is on trimesters and I had to switch from calculus BC to calculus AB because I couldn't pass any of my tests. The grading system is 90% tests and 10% homework+other stuff for calculus. Almost all other classes are 80% tests and 20% homework and I have all A's other than 1-3 B's every year. *In your opinion, how badly would that affect my chances of getting into one of the bigger public universities in my state (the universities that admit ~16k people every year from a pool of ~40k and has no interview process\)?* ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1k7q6l/i_am_jon_burdick_the_dean_of_admissions_at_the/cbm85vs?context=5)|Your admissions essay is a slice of stuff we can't get any other way.

In terms of impact on your chances, I'd say GPA and test scores have a (soft) floor, but most applicants face a hard and fast ceiling (we have many who are perfect, and turn many of those down), while essays have a 'higher' floor (it possible to write your way out of admission), and almost no ceiling.

I'm pleased and it's fun every day to see how much diversity has grown on campus, and I mean all kinds, including racial/ethnic/national. Basically I take seriously the idea that no two Rochester students should think alike, and that's the way we read apps. For the objective data: this fall's freshman class is 'majority-minority,' unheard of among peer-private schools. We have a very high share of low-income students and all of that perspective, unlike many peer schools recently criticized in the New York Times. We have 71 nations in the freshman class, and our in-state percentage is lower than some of the Ivy League schools. Etc.

I'm curious about the computer science masters program at U of R, but my undergraduate degree is in biotechnology and my masters is in microbiology.  I'd like to earn a degree in computer science so I'm better equipped to analyze large data sets that come from genomics studies.  I'm assuming I'll need to fulfill some required coursework before I can enter the program.

If your application is not strong without it, it's not going to make you suddenly great. If your application is very strong without it, you're only going to hurt yourself a bit with a bad interview. Most interviews are very good and I'd say 85% of them enhance an applicant's chances for admission.

- How would I go about getting a brand manager or marketing associate job? (I.e. do I need to look into getting certified for any programs?, where do I even look for these jobs?, do I start at a small company with brands that are not well-known first?)

So I have been doing an internship this summer at a local software development company. I'm going into my junior year this fall. They have asked me to stay on and work part-time through the rest of school. For the internship they were paying me $15 an hour and my pay rate has stayed the same now that I will be a part-time employee.


My question is, should I have asked for more? Or is keeping the same rate a good thing? At this point, I am doing the work of a full-time developer that they would hire normally, but getting paid probably half what they would pay a normal developer. On one hand, I know i am still in school and this is still considered a ""learning"" experience, but on the other hand I feel like I am getting shafted.


They said we would talk again in December to monitor the situation for the following school semester. Should I ask for a pay increase then?

Thanks for any help!"
1k7qig,1,2013-08-12,"Mom, don't you dare complain to me about ""not having enough disposable income""",[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1k7qig/mom_dont_you_dare_complain_to_me_about_not_having/,"I'm coming into my final year of a great program at a great school, and I worked very hard to get into this school in the first place. I got a summer internship that pays rather well, and I've worked my budget to ensure I save enough to pay for the school year's worth of rent, club dues, and a few textbooks. I watch my budget to make sure I don't overspend, that I have enough to pay for gas and groceries, and that I stick to my limit of ""fun money"" so I can have a bit of fun without breaking the bank. I work a few hours on campus during the school year to pay for gas and groceries.

My mother has never worked a full-time job. She dropped out of college to get married and didn't need to work. She taught music to elementary school a few hours per week for three years, and spent a few hours a week (poorly) managing rental property, but that is the extent of her employment history. My father foots her bills.

She claims she's been job hunting. Well, she's been claiming that for the past five years. Her ""job hunting"" consists of casually hinting to random people she deems ""important"" that she's thinking about a job. Once she's shown me a job listing for an office-type job at a local private college that honestly seemed well-suited for her. It didn't require any extensive training or education and focused a lot on dealing with people. She asked for help in getting her resume together and applying for the job, so I took my resume and cover letter (which I have spent a lot of time successfully designing and honing) and essentially made her a template. I figured that if I gave her a template listing exactly what info went where, she could do it herself. Two weeks later I asked her how the resume was coming along, and she told me that she didn't think it was a good format. Bullshit, I've had my template extensively reviewed and critiqued by my school's career counselors and several company recruiters and have received positive feedback. I catered her template to be functional for a non-degree earner who wants to highlight the experience she DOES have instead of the education she DOESN'T. I told her I refused to offer any more help until she became more proactive with regards to the job she supposedly wants. That was seven months ago.

Anyway, fast forward to yesterday. Part of my budget was set aside for buying some more professional-looking attire to transition into my last year of college, the full-time employment search, and moving from student to adult professional. I found some really nice dress pants for super cheap and I wanted to share my joy with her since it's one of the few things we seem to both have an interest in.

I was met with an exasperated sigh and ""Gee, I sure wish I had time to go shopping and spend money all the time.""

Mom, I'm paying for college through merit scholarships and loans with basically no parental assistance. I try to be frugal during the school year, and budget my summer money to cover known school year expenses. I made budgeted, practical, non-frivolous purchases. 

In January you told me you would reimburse me for some textbooks and 
gas money to come home. You didn't fulfill your promise until June. The one time I asked for money this year was to pay for my half of the rent for my summer apartment for the time up until my first paycheck, which you said you would help with. I was flat broke from paying my way during the school year. A few weeks later I called to ask again about it, since the rent was nearly due, and you got all huffy at me because you were convinced I'd take it and go on a shopping spree. I was trying to put shelter over my head for the JOB I worked so hard to get. 

You spend $25 weekly getting your nails done. You spend $30 per month on haircuts. You spend $20 at least six nights a week eating in restaurants. That $120 you spend on ONE WEEK of dinners could feed me every meal for four to five weeks, depending on how frugal I shop and cook. You spend $60 monthly on motherfucking EYELASH EXTENSIONS. You pay $15 weekly to send the dog to the groomer.You bought my brother a brand new Camaro for his sixteenth birthday, after five years of reminding me to be thankful for the used Jeep Liberty you bought for yourself and wanted to sell back that Dad convinced you to let me use instead. You give my brother $40 weekly allowance. You also spend lots of money on groceries, most of which goes bad because you don't cook and you eat out all the time.

Don't you DARE claim you don't have any fun money to spend. Don't you DARE pretend all your spending is necessary. "
1k7pev,1,2013-08-12,Where to go after college?,[deleted],personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1k7pev/where_to_go_after_college/,"Hi everyone.

I originally posted this in /r/financialindependence but was told that I might get more feedback in this subreddit so here I am!

The purpose of this post is to get a sense of what steps I need to take to prepare myself for college graduation in a year. I have had the good fortune to go have both gone to a school with a great financial aid program and a family who has been able to afford any school costs. However, as it should be, my family will only be able to provide for me until graduation. Currently my finances are very much intertwined with those of my parents. I have a shared bank account with my father in a federal credit union. With unpaid internships and a low paying job on campus during the school year I haven't had time to accumulate much money after spending on living expenses at school (the least I can do to help out my family). I do have some money invested (it is all in one stock and fluctuates between 3-4k) that I inherited from my great grandmother when I turned 18. As a rule of thumb I have not touched it in the 2/3 years since it came to be mine. I do not have a credit card and as such no credit score.

If all goes according to plan I will graduate with no student loans. However, I still do not feel I have the appropriate foundation for financial independence. I do not need or want my parents to be linked to my financial life through shared bank accounts and the like (I recently got a letter from my bank that when I turn 21 I have the option to sever this tie - which prompted this post).

Before going back to school I have made it a priority to get a credit card for the year with the purpose of building some credit. I would simply make any purchases I would normally make on my debit card on my credit card. I also am trying to put in place a process by which the bank would take out 50 dollars a month from my paycheck and put it into my investment fund.

Other than that, what other things can I do to be in a position to be financially independent upon graduation. Should I open a different bank account with a different bank or simply retain the one I have with the credit union my parents use? What credit card company should I use? Retirement, investments - what do I do? This is all working under the assumption that I will find a job within 3 months of graduation. I know this all seems very general but I am sure many of you here have gone through the same thing and have advice on what to do or not to do and how to best prepare myself.

Ill be attending a JC for one more year playing baseball and majoring in mech. Engineering. Baseball has been my passion since I was just a little dude, and I haven't lost an ounce of love for it. I'm a pretty easy going guy, non-judgmental and open minded to new ideas and perspectives. I like to meditate (not nearly as often as I should be!), and ponder the metaphysical world. I guess if I had to define my beliefs I would say I'm spiritual? But I don't identify with any groups or divisions. 

On a less in depth note, I am an ent so maybe there are ent friends out there! I do like to party and go out of course, but I'm also the kind of guy that enjoys small groups of close friends, and i definitely enjoy those easy nights at home where there's nothing to do but relax. 

I am also into fitness and exercise; I'm at the gym at least 6 days a week and try my best to eat healthy food. I enjoy myself some yoga but haven't done it in a very long time =/ 

Anyway, I am down to talk about whatever though! Maybe you got a new cute puppy, or you died your hair green, or maybe you have some crazy summer stories to tell! Ask me anything or start a conversation however you please. "

Between my internships and my current job, I have been working in account management for about 2 years. However, I have come to realize that agency life is just not for me. I think I would be much happier working client side as a brand manager or even marketing associate.

The questions are:

- What is the different between agency and client? (I have heard about the differences but I am hoping someone who has been in both could really tell me some details)

- How would I go about getting a brand manager or marketing associate job? (I.e. do I need to look into getting certified for any programs?, where do I even look for these jobs?, do I start at a small company with brands that are not well-known first?)

-Friends first for a few years during and after college.
-Started dating in 2010.
-Before we were officially bf/gf, she tells me her parents can't know we're dating because they are very strict(I tell her it's okay thinking that it wouldn't be a deal breaker).
-Two years go by with amazing ups and some downs.
-I'm starting to think I want to marry this girl and spend the rest of my life with her.
-I start throwing the idea of marriage out there by joking and teasing her.
-I tell her that I'm only in relationships for the long run and I think she could be the one but also if I ever feel like it's not going to work out, I'm out. 
-She squirmed at the idea of marriage at first but started to play along as our relationship progressed. Key word, play.
-She gets accepted into grad school in 2012 in a state over 3000 miles away(CA-&gt;ME).
-We agree to try and make the long distance relationship work.
-I give it my all by trying to be a supportive bf(visiting during my weeks off from work, daily texts/emails, phone/Skype sessions whenever possible, care packages, wake up calls because I work late into the morning hours, the whole shebang!).

This is where it starts going downhill for me.
-I start to really get lonely and miss her like crazy ~04/13 (school ends mid-May but she's staying another month to do an internship).
-She's too busy to provide any support as a gf.  
-She has finals coming up so I don't tell her that I'm sad. 
-I sit on my sadness for a month while stewing over how I always supported her during her down moments but she couldn't do the same for me when I needed it.
-I start to think about how I would even approach the idea of marrying her if her parents didn't know I existed.  
-After her finals were over, I gave her an ultimatum. ""Tell your parents about me and our relationship or I can't be in this relationship.""
-She responds with how she can't because her mom will freak out and would most likely force her to break up with me.
-I tell her that's something we have to deal with sooner or later and I'm not willing to wait to find out later.
-We end our conversation with her deciding not to tell her parents.
-A few days go by and she calls me to tell me that she will tell her parents when she returns after her internship.
-Everything is back to normal and we are happy for another week.
-I fall back into this dark hole where all the negative thoughts about our relationship hit me all at once.
-I start to realize that even if her parents know about me, she's not going to be done with school for another 3 years. She's already made it clear that she does not want to be married or even engaged during grad school.  
-I ask myself, ""Am I willing to wait 3 years for a maybe?"" 
-I ask her for another serious talk.
-I tell her I've been miserable with her gone and I don't think I can do it for another three years.  She tells me she could've done a better job at supporting me and showing her feelings but she also tells me she can't promise anything for the future of our relationship but only that she can try.  I tell her I need more. I tell her I need her commitment for the future and that I'm going crazy thinking about this ""maybe.""
-Generally, she thinks the worst of situations and say we could break up within the next three years about anything.
-She goes on to say she can't assure me that she'll return to CA after she graduates (even though there are plenty of job opportunities here in so. cal.) 
-I tell her I'm not willing to relocate for 3 years while she finishes school because she's not sure if she wants to marry me(at this point, I've made it clear that I want to marry her.
-She makes another effort to convince me to stay by saying that I'm the reason she's been able to make it through the year away from family and friends and that I'm the light at the end of the tunnel and not let the last few years go to waste.  I tell her unless she can give me the commitment I want, I can't be in this relationship. I tell her this difference in stages of our lives is too much for me to overcome by myself.
-End skype session....she breaks down and hangs up on me. 
-I feel like a big jerk because I just broke her heart. 3000 miles away and I can hear her crying in my head. 

3 weeks later, she returns to CA.
-She asks to meet up. 
-I agree because friends said I should do it to give her closure.
-We meet and its really awkward at first but I break the ice by telling her to ask away because I know she has questions.
-After lots of questions and my best effort to answer all of them, she gets more comfortable and starts being extremely flirty.  
-I recognize the situation and ask her what she's doing and why she is doing this.  
-She says because she can and wants to either get lunch or watch a movie.  She knows I have a hard time saying no and leaves me with no option of getting out of it without being a major jerk.  I agree to lunch.
-We drop her car off and head to lunch.  
-During the drive to the restaurant, she tells me she has a strange request.
-She wants it to be like we were still bf/gf for one more day because she wants the last memory of being with me as a happy one.  
-I was weak and agreed.  She had three things going for her that she knows I absolutely love when she does it. Not in any particular order but dress that showed off her curves, her red lipstick and her perfume....jaw dropping...head turning....eyes closed-nose sniffing combo.
-We held hands and she rested her head on my right shoulder while I drove. I could hear the sniffles that she was trying to hide. I hand her a tissue without saying a word. 
-We do some catching up while at the restaurant because it's been a few weeks since we've last talked.
-The drive back to her place is done while holding hands like we used to.
-We sit in my car outside her place for a bit. 
-We embrace in a very very very long hug....around 20 minutes of just hugging while in my car...she wouldn't let go.
-I finally tell her I have to go to work and I walk her to her door.
-I really enjoyed her company again and asked if we can have one more kiss before I left as long as we kept it to today only.  She didn't hesitate. (friends said this was a bad move on my part but I was caught up in the moment)
-I drive away and head to work, she starts messaging me and tells me she wants to see me at least two more times before she goes back to school. 

Fast forward to tonight.
-We haven't talked or hung out since last kiss.
-Despite my efforts to keep myself busy, I think about her. 
-I keep telling myself that I did the right thing...that I'm protecting myself from being hurt in the future IF it didn't work out. 
-I have this strange feeling that I did the right thing and the wrong thing at the same time. 
-I think if I reach out and contact her, it wouldn't make me happy because I know I broke her heart and don't think I can make it up to her.
-I really wish she will find someone who can give her what I gave her plus some more. 
-After all this, I want to know that she's happy so I can be happy too.

I am a 21 year old engineering student in Australia, I have come across an opportunity to work in Germany for 6 months, starting mid November, for a company that engineers really cool stuff by Lake Constance (Friedrichshafen). The application process has gone well so far, however I have not made up my mind about going. My concerns are not so much about the job, I am fairly confident about that, but more about living in Germany. So I'll start:

1. I know a little German, but realistically I am a novice. I have approximately 4 months to learn as much German as I can, which probably won't be a lot. How well will I be able to function, for example, use public transport and make friends? Do most young people speak English? On this topic, what do Germans think of people who come to their country and don't speak German? Note that speaking German is not a requirement for the job.

2. Why do so many German companies offer internships to overseas students? To me it just seems like they are exporting their own methods of success to other countries, only making themselves less competitive for the future. I mean, why pick me over a local student? It just seems like I am being offered something too good to be true. Also this company will have no shortage of applicants...

3. Any specific things specific to this area of note?

4. What time does the sun rise and set in southern Germany during winter and summer? What's the weather like?

5. How easy is it to pass from Germany into neighbouring countries like Austria and Switzerland?

Anything else I should know?


Thanks."

I have no idea what is going on.,ConfusedWithMe,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1k6o7c/would_like_some_advice_i_have_no_idea_what_is/,"TLDR: Officially I got diagnosed with major depressive disorder, but I felt like it had gone way.

I've always struggled to be happy. It was one of those emotions that I rarely experience. Finally I found myself a girlfriend and I thought I was happy. The relationship turned abusive very quickly. I ended up staying with the girl for 3 years, lying to myself. She isolated me from friends and she would get very jealous if I talked to other girls. Eventually it got to the point where I was restricted from talking to girls altogether. We were going to separate colleges, so I was very lonely. I developed a cutting habit. I would cut almost daily. First it started on my arms, but I found those to be too visible. I'm a guy, so leg hair hides scars very well. I would cut between classes, or even when studying for an exam. To me, it was an anxiety relief. I wouldn't feel the pain at all. Fast forward, to 6 months ago. I begin developing suicidal thoughts. I tell my gf at the time, and she almost immediately dumps me. I find out later she was seeing guys on the side, and she had another bf lined up. Its scary to think how close to the brink of suicide I was at this point. I start seeing a psychologist. I did not want to die, but I knew that the pull was becoming too strong. I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder, and it was recommended that I would be placed on anti-depressants, but I refused any drugs. About a month of therapy, I started feeling better. I started to become more social and  I made friends that truly care about me. Its still a weird and unique feeling to me. The kindness and generosity they offer me moves me to tears to this day. I also landed a kick ass internship and I'm excelling academically. I was happy. 

Fast forwarding to a month ago, I'm starting to feel negative emotions again. They are now getting to the point where I cannot contain them.  I have no idea where this is all coming from. I was just happy. I have so many good friends, I'm successful, and I'm social. I don't have an anxiety or fear of being in a social situation like I was once. The negative emotions are creeping back in. I don't know what to do to stop them and its terrifying. I cut the other day, but I wasn't able to do much because I wasn't feeling the anxiety that shields me from pain. Suicidal thoughts are beginning to creep back into my head. Its not thoughts about planning, but just toying with the idea.  

I'm confused as to what is going on. I have friends, I'm successful. I'm excelling at life, but I can't for the life of me be happy. Has anyone else experienced this? I realize people are in much shittier situations than I am in, and are happy. "

I don't really know if they're my thing, but my Girlfriend has scrubs and a white coat and I think she still has some other random things from the hospital and knows how to do the exams and EVERYTHING so I HAVE to give it a good go, all the way through! 

Also I'm a lady just in case that wasn't clear.

* How do I relax during role play? I tend to erupt in nervous laughter.

My Girlfriend has a stereotypical Mistress/Doctor personality and while she can be silly with me sometimes, good grief she downright terrifies me when we try to role play. Like, it's super hot but her voice is so serious that I just get weak in the knees and erupt in nervous laughter. It doesn't help that she is objectively the hottest girl I have slept with at all, ever (and I loved to hit on a lot of girls when I was just a bit younger). So her hotness combined with her general Domme nature further combined with the fact that she is a doctor is just an absolute disaster for me, but in a good way!

Actually, I'm glad I asked because I'm nervous during sex with her in general, not just during role play. It was fine the first time but she brought her entire BDSM bag the next time and it was just down/uphill from there!

Please help because she thinks it is unbelievable/ridiculous/cute.

For an internship I'm doing right now, I have to basically convert the MATLAB local binary pattern code to C++. I've read through a bunch of documentation and I sort of get how LBP works, but I need a better understanding if I want to make an efficient conversion. Here's what I think LBP is:

1. Divide an image into a certain number of squares

2. Each of these squares has a center value; compare this value to the vales of the pixels surrounding the center. If it is smaller than the center, assign the value ""0"", if it is greater, assign the value ""1"".

3. Create a binary number by linking up the 0's and 1's from step 2.

4. Count the number of ""changes"" from 0 to 1 or 0 to 1.  

5. ????

I would appreciate any help with this matter. I just need to understand LBP more thoroughly. Thank you so much for your time."

**UPDATE:** [HERE](http://i.imgur.com/MzJMrDP.jpg) is the proof you all asked for! 

I am working for newly formed, Hollywood production company called Nova Filmhouse.

The company is co-founded by [Sara Risher](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0728260/)  (producer of the Nightmare on Elm Street series, former production head of New Line Cinema), and director/producer [Dror Soref] (http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0814786).

**EDIT- This request is now closed! Thank you for the tremendous response! We are now processing the hundreds of scripts that you all sent in. You will be contacted if they are approved.**
________________________

**Notes/Tips/Rules**

1. We are a brand new company. You will not any find any information on us online. Our website is set to launch within the next few weeks.
2. Feature length screenplays are preferred over shorts or treatments.
3. Every submission will be read. Sending the same work in multiple times will not change our verdict.
4. If you do not hear from us within a few weeks, do not resubmit your work until you have done significant revisions. 
5. If you do resubmit your work, make sure you indicate the draft version on your screenplay.

I read a lot of scripts. I will probably read some of your submissions. Here are my tips:

* 90 pages is a good length for a screenplay. If it's longer than 90, make damn sure that every extra page is crucial! Most 120 page screenplays have 30 pages of nothing happening! 
* The fate of your submission rests in the hands of an unpaid intern. If said intern thinks your work is good enough, it is passed on to the 'higher ups'. DO NOT PISS OFF THE INTERN! Although we strongly recommend that our interns read the entire screenplay before judging it, they have absolutely no incentive to do so. If they are distracted by your page-long run-on-sentences and spelling errors, THEY WILL NOT READ FURTHER THAN PAGE 10! If he/she does not like you, they will heartlessly decimate your best shot at making it into Hollywood! So proof-read your work, and keep our interns happy :)

Granted it was because I knew someone, but this person is not someone I am very close to, and they reached out to me.

You got the degree. You will find the job. But it takes just as much hard work and dedication that you put into your schooling. I am living proof that as long as you finish, there will be immense opportunities to succeed."

Need advice",[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1karmk/m20_my_boyfriend_m21_and_i_have_had_a_very_bad/,"So we met our freshman year of college. We fell so deeply in love. The first year was great, but slowly we started becoming more so ""close friends"" that had sex and hung out a lot rather than a couple.

For the past 5 months, things have been bad. We have had very bad fights, and things got ugly. We never went on dates, we never treated each other well, we just kinda lost our way.

About 1.5 months ago, I went behind his back and met a guy, and made out with him one night. Things got kinda heated between us, but eventually I told him I couldn't see him anymore. My boyfriend just left to go on tour with a band, and we left on a really bad note. He told me last night that he had cheated on me, and had sex with another guy. I was heart broken, and he showed me that he was extremely sad and showed strong guilt. He was wasted, on cocaine, in L.A., he got caught up in the moment.

We were about to break up yesterday, but we decided this. Since we haven't really been dating, and all we have done is smoke weed together and no really do much other than fight, we both decided that we should have broken up a while ago. We both need to make huge lifestyle changes, because despite our wrong doings and differences, we have a very strong connection to each other. The problem is, right now in our lives, we are not ready for a strong committed relationship.

So we decided we need a break. I am already over the cheating, I did it too, I can't be too mad. In fact, it almost comes off as a blessing in disguise, because we have been needing time away from each other. During this break, we decided we are going to pretend we are single, but still be committed, so no sleeping around or anything. We truly want to make each other ready for one another, so we can properly care for each other. We both have goals, but our relationship has kept us from completing them. For example, I want to quit smoking cigarettes and get healthy and train for a half marathon and keep working as a web designer, and he wants to quit smoking, get in shape as well, and find an internship.

We both feel it is the right thing to do, and we both know that we aren't good for each other right now, but can be. I am still so distressed, but at the same time this is something that was bound to happen to both of us, and it did. But we love each other, and still say we do, and after hours of crying on the phone together, as much as I don't trust him right now, I know we both need to fix ourselves.

So here are the overall rules:

1. No sleeping around anymore
2. No communication for the next week
3. After he gets back in town in a week, he is driving home to Nashville, and coming back to Chicago where we both live, and right after he gets back, I leave for colorado. So we might see each other then, but just to talk if that.
4. School begins September 11, 2013, and I feel that at this point we may be ready to start looking towards a ""first date""

Overall, we just want to start all over with each other. Our relationship has had very serious points to where we have explained we could see each other together for the rest of our lives. But as long as we hurt and are bad for each other, we can't be together.

I have never been in this situation, please help!"

1kajhj,3,2013-08-13,I just felt like this might be a good place to talk,[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1kajhj/i_just_felt_like_this_might_be_a_good_place_to/,"I graduated from college last year. Business administration - not exactly what I thought I'd see myself studying, but I lacked clarity and a mentor at the time, or I would've made a different choice perhaps. My dad died when I was 14 - and though my mom's been great, she couldn't have been of much help to me where academic/career related advice was concerned.

Since I finished off with college, I've never really ""finished"" anything. I'd originally planned to go to Grad school, and though I got into a few programs last year, they ended up being way too expensive for my family - and I had to scrap those plans altogether. 

Following that, I struggled for months to get a decent job - and finally landed myself an internship, which I quit a month later, because I didn't like it at all.

On the side, I was doing a couple of language courses - but I fell sick midway, and found that I couldn't cope up later on - so I ended up quitting them too.

Then earlier this year, I tried applying to Grad school again (this time in Germany - because quite a few universities out there are tuition-free) - but I got rejected everywhere because they wanted applicants from my country to have a 4-year degree. It's funny how none of their program webpages stated this clearly. In one case, I was even offered a place, and it was rescinded 12 days later. Tried fighting it out with their Dean, but to no avail.

I have a good idea of what I want to do now (a Masters in Economics from a local school out here from 2014-16, far more affordable - even though I've been hell-bent on wanting to study abroad, it seems like i'll have to settle for this) - but the lack of work experience and gaps on my resume really worry me (10 months of unemployment and counting). I really need to get my hands on some sort of work for the next 9-10 odd months.

People I knew in school and college - who weren't exactly the brightest bulbs in class - are doing so much better than I am right now. I'd be lying if I didn't say that I felt jealous of them right now.

I'm still not getting work/interviews anywhere - and i'm feeling really depressed, and demotivated towards doing anything really. Whether it's getting up in the morning, or searching for jobs, or reading (haven't read a book in months), or going for a run - I don't feel like doing anything. I constantly feel like i'm under house arrest. 

Running was the only thing I had going for me - I ran my first half marathon last month, after about 6 months of training (with no history of running, ever). But I haven't done anything even remotely physical in the last few weeks.

To make matters worse, I just learnt that I've got high cholesterol and mild kidney trouble (despite having been really active/a teetotaler/eating well) - which is apparently hereditary.

And the girl I liked - well, she's still not over her ex. The chances of anything happening between us are now astronomically low. I've been single for about 3 years now - and the chances of me meeting someone now are even lower considering that i'm not working/studying somewhere full-time. The same thing happened with my exes as well - I was a ""rebound"" for both of them, and both those ""relationships"" only lasted a few months. While I've wanted to love and care for someone for a long time now, my experiences are making me increasingly bitter and cynical. Plus it just seems so damn tedious to go through the whole process of getting to know someone from scratch. I doubt that anyone would be able to inspire any of sort of interest in me right now - and that agitates me as well.

I feel vague all day long, and if someone were to ask me what I did all day, or what i've been doing for the past year - I really wouldn't have a good answer for that. Days and week seem to blend into each other - and I'm unable to follow any sort of routine or pattern. Of late I've felt like nothing's worked out for me, and I'm tired of trying. I'm tired of constantly quitting, constantly failing at life, and feeling like this massive failure. 

People tell me that it'll eventually work out - but all I feel is like they're feeding me false hope.

Thank you for reading, if you did - writing this certainly helped me a bit for now.

**TL,DR - Unemployed for close to a year, minor health problems, zero luck with the ladies, demotivated and frustrated everyday, possibly depressed. No idea what to do with myself at the moment.**"

1kae74,0,2013-08-13,Should I (20F) move back to my home city to pursue a relationship with him(M22)?,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1kae74/should_i_20f_move_back_to_my_home_city_to_pursue/,"I apologize for the wall of text. There's a ton of backstory and I need to explain a few things. 

**Backstory**

I currently go to university in Philadelphia and I started dating this guy back in March (roughly 3 months). He doesn't go to my school and is a delivery guy living on his own. Things were going well, however, I was leaving in June to pursue a job opportunity in L.A. for 9 months. We grew pretty attached to each other, but realized the long distance wouldn't work out, so we ended things mutually, but we talked about the possibility of getting back together when I came back to finish up school.

**This Summer**

Things are going great in L.A. and I'm having an amazing time with my job and the people I'm meeting. I've been dating around a bit, however, I've never fully gotten over the guy back in Philly. We text and chat on occasion (roughly once a week, maybe 2 weeks) and though our texting is a little strained, when we talk on the phone it's as if I've never left. He's the only one that can calm me down when my anxiety gets the better of me and every time we talk, those feelings just reemerge. I kept pushing it aside though because I was still going to be gone for another 6ish months. I knew he wasn't going to wait for me, and obviously, I wasn't exactly waiting for him either.

**Now**

My internships end at the end of August and I've been looking for other jobs to fill my time for the next 6 months (I get school credit for taking two terms off and working internships in my field). I've been applying everywhere I could including NYC and Philly. I recently got a job offer in  NYC that I really like and as of right now, it's my top choice. I've been thinking about whether or not I should move back to Philly (cheaper) or try and find a place in NYC where I could stay for 6 months. I already have a place in Philly I could stay and taking the train/megabus to NYC 3x a week would still be cheaper than living in New York-- in fact, someone who already works at my potential employer has told me how easy it is to commute and how much better he likes it rather than living in NYC.

I told my (ex?) man-friend that I would be moving back to the east coast early and that I have a job offer in NYC. I told him that I would potentially be moving back to Philly and commuting for money reasons and that I miss my home/friends/him etc. He then told me that he's been seeing this girl and that, ""It wasn't really serious at all until recently."" I was obviously upset, but not too surprised by the whole thing. Yeah, I was a bit hurt but I told him I was happy for him (which I am). He then turns around and say, ""I know that's not true"" and proceeds to tell me that she goes to my university. However, when I ask any further questions (name, major, how long he's been seeing her, etc) he refuses to answer me. He told me that, ""all that ever turns into is shit talking and drama.""

Now let me clarify something-- my university is a big school. There's a very likely chance that I have no idea who this girl is, and even if I did, I would NEVER trash talk or verbally attack her in any way. I've never done that and I have NO IDEA where he would get that impression from. I'm being honest when I say that I'm happy for him. Yes, I am upset and hurt a bit, but it's not worth dwelling over if he's over me/has a new girl. He's friends with plenty of his exes so I'm almost certain that he still wants to be friends. And that's what I'm trying to do-- make it a smooth transition for both of us.

However, when he does things like tell me he's seeing someone/that she goes to my school but refuses to tell me anything else, that aggravates my anxiety. I ended up having an anxiety attack about the whole thing and making me very confused about the whole situation and my feelings. If he's clearly moved on/over me, why does it now feel like I'm pulling teeth when we talk?

**Theory**

As I mentioned before, I have clinically diagnosed anxiety. I have a tendency to over think and have panic attacks when I can't figure things out. I analyze people and try and figure out what makes them tick.  I talked with my therapist about the whole thing and we came up with a theory.

My therapist thinks that when I left to pursue my job opportunity in L.A., I was essentially leaving my man-friend behind to pursue bigger and better things. We previously discussed that I would be gone for 9 months, so my man-friend tried to get over me. He started seeing this girl and started developing feelings for her, but then I come out of nowhere and tell him I'm actually going to be coming back home early. My therapist thinks that he has both legitimate feelings for me and this other girl, but by telling me the inner details of the relationship with her, he'd be closing the window of opportunity on ""us."" 

My therapist further said that it sounds like my (ex?) man-friend is subconsciously trying aggravate my anxiety as to give him reasons to bury any feelings he has for me. As in, he aggravates my anxiety by teasing me with info about this chick, and when I have a panic attack my (ex?) man-friend tries to use that as an excuse to not be attracted to me. 

Furthermore, my (ex?) man-friend has been saying things like, ""you're not really happy about this"" and ""You don't want to hear about her"" which is absolutely infuriating. My therapist thinks that it's a defense mechanism to try and convince HIMSELF that I'm the one who's not happy when in fact, he's the one who's not happy. 

Part of me is very concerned that my remaining feelings for my man-friend are romanticizing the whole situation, so I'm taking this theory with a grain of salt. But if it's completely over between me and him, why won't he tell me about his new girl? Especially if it's getting serious? Furthermore, he's never actually said, ""I'm over you"" or ""we're done."" Literally, all he's said is that he's been seeing a girl, that it's getting kinda serious, and that she goes to my university. I'm totally left in the dark without any type of closure.

So now I'm at a dilemma-- should I move back to Philly/commute to NYC and try and rekindle my relationship with man-friend? Or should I just move to NYC?

TL;DR - left my man friend back in Philly when I move across country for a job. Now I'm moving back to NYC for another job and have possibility to commute from Philly. Should I move back to Philly/pursue man-friend again even though he's casually dating someone that's not official? Or should I move to NYC instead? 

Thank you so much for reading and hopefully you can clarify things for a highly anxious university student."

1k9z8h,4,2013-08-13,Seeking advice please: how to deal with sexism in engineering while avoiding mansplaining,anonymouscowword,feminisms,https://www.reddit.com/r/feminisms/comments/1k9z8h/seeking_advice_please_how_to_deal_with_sexism_in/,"So I work at an internet company, and recently we had a new software engineer intern join our team. I was introducing her to some of my friends in non-engineering departments one night and most introductions were friendly, nice, and supportive, but I was really shocked when two of my (female) friends greeted our new engineer with ""oh my god are you seriously an engineer? No way! But you're so cute!?!"" (completely serious. not as a joke). She laughed and said yes she was, while I couldn't do much more than face-palm and apologize for their behavior afterwards. That incident haunted me all weekend, and I was really tempted to go talk to those two friends and be like ""you really shouldn't say things like that. That was offensive on so many levels and it's partly because of comments like that we have so few female engineers to begin with!"" and I probably would have done that in the past, but lately I've been concerned that that kind of reaction is mansplaining. Basically that it's not my place to tell women how they should treat women because it makes women feel X. It feels presumptuous for me (as a man who's never been challenged based on appearance about my engineer identity) to assume that I know how that feels, and condescending to tell them how to act (even though I feel like to a reasonable observer, how they acted was clearly *wrong*). So I talked with the intern the next monday about it to see if she was offended by that incident and how I felt about it. She said that she was used to that reaction and gets it all the time so she wasn't offended at the time, but now that I mention it, she could see how it was a sexist thing to say. I tried to explain why it felt wrong for me to reproach those two friends because of privileged position, and tried to guide her to some of the women engineer support groups and offered to help bring up the topic or facilitate a discussion. She said she'd email an HR person for advice, but I'm also moderately concerned that she just said that because she's an intern and thinks I'm telling her to do that as part of her job...

Anyway, I want to know what /r/feminisms thinks: how far is too far into mansplaining in a situation like this? Did I go too far already? Not far enough? How do you do deal with something like this?

**tl;dr:** Some female non-engineer coworkers made some sexist remarks about a new female engineer. How far is too far if a male engineer is calling them on it?

ps. Sorry for the anonymous account. Too many personal details."

I think I am so intimidated by his success.  Whenever he speaks to me without asking a question, I never know how to respond so I just nod along and agree with whatever he says.  When he asks me a question, my voice becomes high pitched instead of firm and neutral.  As if I'm saying ""yes?"" instead of ""yes.""

ALL I EVER SAY TO HIM IS YES, OKAY, SOUNDS GOOD, I UNDERSTAND, AND GOT IT.  I'm always way too shy to give my own input in fear that he will judge me or get angry.  He is very busy and gets stressed easily, so sometimes when I do tell him something he just goes ""yea yea"" or ""okay I know that"" or something.  Like rushed kind of

I have noticed a few things to work on, such as giving direct answers.  I often say ""I think"" (for example, he asks do we have enough hangers; I say I think we have enough).  I feel this sounds unsure and insecure.  So I am going to work on sounding more sure of myself and confident.  Today he hung an outfit on the wall and asked if I thought it was a good spot to take photos.  I said ""I think this is okay"" as in I think its fine, and he got kind of frustrated and said okay is not good enough, and we won't do something unless it's ""fucking perfect""

Any tips you could give me for talking to my boss? Anything! This could be small talk topics, how to not be intimidated, sounding confident when speaking etc.  

**TL;DR I need help talking to my boss without being shy and intimidated**"
1k9dhp,84,2013-08-13,"I (23/f) have social anxiety and am treated poorly by my boyfriend's (23/m) friends, possibly because I am a stripper. Mandatory event is coming up this weekend, and I am almost in tears considering it.",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1k9dhp/i_23f_have_social_anxiety_and_am_treated_poorly/,"My boyfriend and I have been together for almost two years, living together for most of it. We are very introverted and spend most of our time together at home. His family is half-Cuban, very religious, and likes to have a lot of family time. My boyfriend and I are not religious and only really want to see his family maybe once a month due to how draining they are.

Yesterday, I went to my boyfriend's old best friend's welcome home party following his internship overseas. Party guests ranged from 16-50, and everyone except me was either family or so close that they considered one another family. I have interacted with some of the older guests a few times, as ""family dinners"" at my boyfriend's parents' house usually mean their friends coming over, but they were all in a group talking politics and middle-aged humor. I had only met the friends our age a handful of times (1-3 times depending on the person, and sometimes just in passing), and they have yet to warm up to me. The group is very close, having been ""The Team"" since middle school or so. (The males are very bro-esque, while my boyfriend is the nerdy one.) The first thing they learned about me two years ago was that I am a stripper, which was due to my boyfriend's indiscretion. They have never discussed it with me, but bring it up to my boyfriend on the rare occasion that he sees them. Note that several of them cannot even remember my name, but feel happy enough to judge whether I am a good girlfriend because of my job. They have never bothered to talk to me to find out anything else. During the party yesterday, they brought up strippers twice and one guy kept giving people half-assed lap dances. It was as though they were making jokes about me right in front of me, but I could not respond because my boyfriend's family is unaware of my job and would not approve at all.

I have social anxiety, as does my boyfriend. When he goes with me to see my friends, I sit by him, facilitate his entry into conversations, and leave if/when he asks. If he does not want to go to social events with me, I do not pressure him, as I know how shitty anxiety is. But yesterday, as every other day that we see his group, he left my side within minutes. I was told the party was indoors, so I dressed well and did my makeup. The party was actually a pool-centric one, and the woman whose house we were at is a size XS. I do not own a bathing suit, and our home is an hour+ from theirs anyway. Borrowing would have meant asking someone to drive to her home to find me something, and given that I have DDD cups, my options were limited at best. (The males of the group suggested I borrow another girl's suit, then took the opportunity to remark on my chest size when they realized I could not possibly fit into this girl's clothing.) My boyfriend borrowed swimming trunks and got in the pool for about five hours while I was left to socially flounder in 100 degree weather, despite having discussed how he totally wouldn't socially abandon me like he usually does.

Despite my anxiety, working in clubs has made me able to initiate and further conversations with strangers if the other party is remotely willing, but his friends would hardly speak to me. I asked the old bestie how his internship was, followed up with questions when he said it was ""okay,"" and recalled things he told my boyfriend about school in front of me and asked about how those issues were going. He answered, but did not elaborate and never asked me anything in return--not even a generic ""how have you been"" or ""could you pass me the chips."" Were he a customer, I would conclude that he did not want my company, and I would have excused myself quickly. So I asked another friend about his upcoming work on a book project. I am a writer and love to read, and he would have known that if he bothered to do anything other than talk about himself for three minutes perhaps, then return to instagramming photos of a volleyball. The only person who talked to me wanted me to tell him what my tattoo means (it's in German), but was doing it in the creepy yay-excuse-to-touch-you way. He wanted me to speak to him in German, but I explained that I hardly speak it and my best friend is German and wrote my tattoo out for me. The group perked up and discussed how dumb it is for people to get tattoos in languages they don't speak (keep in mind it's a passage from a German writer, thus the language change; it's not like I got the sign for ""love"" in Chinese on my ass or something), and one guy informed me that my tattoo looked stupid. The same guy asked me if it was about God (knowing I am not religious) in front of several extremely religious people with Jesus-related tattoos. My boyfriend was on the other side of the patio by then, and the only way I know how to handle people being dicks is to either explain how they're pieces of shit or excuse myself. Only one seemed like an option at the time, so I went inside and chilled with the family dachshund in the guest bathroom while I composed myself.

The best friend has hung out with my boyfriend with me a few times, but every time he does, he gets drunk, corners me when I'm alone, and tells me my boyfriend can stay with me for as long as it takes, but he will always love the friend more and ""come back"" to him. It is really creepy and ex-girlfriendy, but my boyfriend dismisses it as him being drunk and thinking it's funny. He did it again yesterday on our own, then in the group setting kept touching my boyfriend's nipple with his toes while telling me to be jealous. By that point, I was almost in tears from being in the heat for seven hours (I have Lupus and the heat is really, really not good for me) and being insulted every time I tried to be friendly, so I just nodded. I had asked my boyfriend to leave an hour previously, he agreed, then sat down and opened another beer anyway.

We ended up in a huge fight over it, and I cried a fuck ton. I thought we were breaking up over it. We at least established that he doesn't mean to make my experience with his group so miserable, but his parents are throwing him a graduation party this weekend, and I am so anxious I am almost in tears again thinking about it. He said that he'll lie and say I'm sick if I want, but I think it's really shitty that the ""solution"" to his friends being rude to me is for me to just not show up to my boyfriend's party. (Side note: his mother devoted thirty minutes to telling me that ""the man may make the living, but the woman makes the life,"" and it is my duty as a female to make my boyfriend more social, so me not showing up would turn into A Thing.)

I do not know what to do at the graduation party, or what to suggest to my boyfriend to make things easier for me. I realize my anxiety contributes to this issue, but I genuinely think that his friends are at least half of the problem. My boyfriend has agreed to discuss how we can fix this, but I'm at a loss. I've encountered people being this mean to me before, but I didn't have to be around them like I will this weekend, so I'm pretty terrified.

TL;DR: I have social anxiety, and my boyfriend brings me into situations with his family and their group of friends without helping to facilitate my entry. His friends hardly speak to me, so I end up either being insulted or ignored while there. They also gossip about me being a stripper when I am not there, and seem to make stripper-related jokes to my face without acknowledging that they know my work. I have to go to another party with them this weekend following a disastrous one yesterday, and I do not know what I can do to have a less than miserable time."
1k93ak,1,2013-08-12,Stay in School or Take the Job?,halcyon425,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1k93ak/stay_in_school_or_take_the_job/,"Hi all. I'm going to have to make a potentially life-altering decision in the upcoming weeks, and would like to get some opinions on what is the best course of action.

I'm a community college student starting my sophomore year at the end of the month. I currently have a 4.0 GPA, and graduated high school with honors and a 4.1 (weighted) GPA. I also do a lot of hobbyist programming, largely in game development, and have ~4 years of personal experience in Python and C++.

As of now, I'm working as a paid intern doing a variety of work, but largely related to web development (back/front-end, DBs, etc). I've been informed by my supervisor that I will be receiving an offer soon to work a full time, salaried position for the company. No details on pay yet, but the minimum in CA is around $80K.

As you can imagine, this seems like an incredible opportunity for an 18 year old. But I am forced to decide between staying in school, or taking this job (and maybe going back to school later, but I'm not sure about my willpower in that regard). Ideally, I would like to see myself working at a big tech firm, or a game studio, *not* doing web development as I am now. At its core, my question is this: if I take this offer and ever decide to quit, what are my chances of achieving that goal with my current experience (plus that of the job)? 

I am considering making them a counter-offer to stay an intern and part-time. I would explain that education is important to me / my parents, an educated employee == a better employee, there's almost no loss in productivity vs. full-time, and that thusly it's more profitable for the company to keep me as such. I definitely want to keep working there, as it's a solid source of income I desperately need to keep myself afloat as I go through college.

**TL;DR** Sophomore at a CC: get a Bachelor's, or take the $80K salary?"
1k921a,1,2013-08-12,Finish school or take the job?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1k921a/finish_school_or_take_the_job/,"Hey all, I would like to hear some thoughts on a potentially life-altering decision I'm stuck with making in the upcoming weeks, and would like to hear some opinions on what would be the best option for my dilemma. This is a throwaway to prevent any potential identification from my employer.

I'm starting my sophomore year at a community college in the upcoming weeks, where I currently have a 4.0. I do a lot of programming projects on the side, largely game-dev related, with 3-4 years personal experience in C++ and Python. I've been working as an paid intern at a small business doing a variety of work, largely related to web development (back / front-end, DBs, etc). I I landed this largely due to my various hobbyist projects (mostly gamedev) With the summer coming to a close, I was approached by my supervisor and informed that I would be receiving an offer for a full-time, salaried position (no details, but it should be a minimum of ~$80K/yr because I'm in CA). My question is simple: is this worth it?



I have considered making them a counter-offer, as I am able to work part-time during the school year. I was considering touching on the fact that education is incredibly important to me / my parents, that an educated employee == a better employee, that my productivity in the work place would be relatively similar if I stay on an hourly basis, and that thus it would be more profitable to the company to keep me as such. 


I would basically like to hear some of the pros and cons of finishing school vs. gaining experience / money now, and *possibly* going back to school later (I'm not sure about my willpower in that regard). In an ideal world, I see myself working for a big tech firm, and *not* doing web-dev as I am now. I'm aware that my current level of education is basically meaningless; given my level of experience would I be able to get the job I truly want later down the line?

1k90t6,73,2013-08-12,Happy news to share! :),tallie5367,BDSMcommunity,https://www.reddit.com/r/BDSMcommunity/comments/1k90t6/happy_news_to_share/,"Back in June, I started out on a journey to find someone to hold me accountable to certain goals I had, and to provide me accountability in a Dominance/submission lifestyle sense. It’s no secret that my Daddy and I met on [r/bdsmpersonals](http://www.reddit.com/r/bdsmpersonals), and when I originally first wrote my ad, I had no idea just how much of a difference the dynamic he and I negotiated together would help me to change my life for the better.

I went from being someone who skipped more college classes than she went to, to having perfect attendance. I went from settling for mediocrity in my academic endeavors to getting an A in one of the (if not the) hardest classes in my area of study (intermediate macroeconomics). I have been dreading this class since the first time I attempted taking it. I felt like I would never be able to learn the material, that maybe I was barking up the wrong tree trying to major in economics. I fully expected to take this class with the attitude of just trying to get out alive with the C I needed to pass it.

Well I’m glad to say that I never have to deal with this class ever again. And I did much, much better than I ever expected. With my Daddy encouraging me, supporting me, and believing in me every step of the way, I’m proud to say that I earned an A in the course, the highest grade possible. I completed every assignment, actually read my textbook, and studied until my brain leaked out of my ears. I’ll be able to say that I have a 3.0 GPA, which should open doors to jobs and internships that were previously closed to me.

I’m finding that I believe in myself a little more every day. I’m seeing that it is worth it to work hard, because it really does pay off. Acting defeated doesn’t get you anywhere. Being afraid of greatness won’t open any doors for you. My confidence has increased dramatically.

And I know every day won’t be easy. I know that there will be bad days when I don’t feel great about myself and old patterns of thought creep back into my head. But I also know that I have the most wonderful support system in the world to come home to. I know that my Daddy will always listen to my concerns, no matter how irrational they may be, and that he’ll do everything I can to cheer me up and keep me in line, if need be. 

I thought I would share just to show that if you’re patient, know what you want, and refuse to settle for less than that, that it is possible to meet someone to create the type of dynamic that you want, who will push you and nurture you into achieving your goals and beyond what you ever even dreamed of. If this is the kind of relationship you want, don’t settle for anything less because you feel like it’s not possible or you won’t find what you’re looking for. It may take some time to find that right person, but they’re out there. Have faith, you’ll find them! I did!

TL;DR: Since I met my Daddy, we’ve been working toward some goals, one of which was to better my class attendance and academic achievement. In my summer class (intermediate macroeconomics), one of the hardest in my major, I finished the class with an A. I just wanted to share my happiness with one of my favorite subreddits, where (in a way) everything started. :)"
1k8zol,7,2013-08-12,Finding an Internship,Treasy,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1k8zol/finding_an_internship/,"So summer's over and I feel that stinging regret of not making the most of my time.  I recently switched back to a BS in Computer Science after testing out a few other disciplines.  I have all of my gen-eds finished so I am doing what amounts to basically a crash course of the core comp sci courses over the next 3 semesters. 

I live in an area where the tech industry is nascent.  There's nothing really beyond IT jobs or front-end web development within 100 miles.  So I will have to look out of state for an internship.  I didn't feel as though I was qualified enough this summer to get an internship that would bring me across the United States (A self-fulfilling prophecy, I know), so I told myself I would work on personal projects/school instead.  

I've worked and had internships in a variety of fields, but never in anything related to computer science.  This coming summer will probably be my last before I graduate, so I want to use that opportunity to get myself an internship that I will really learn a lot from, but I don't know how to find one.  

I understand that career fairs are a solid option.  My school draws a plethora of companies to its annual career fair, but is better known for its business and economics programs than its computer science program, and many interesting smaller companies can't afford a spot at a career fair.  So how do I find companies to apply for outside of the big players?  Do I just look for opportunities at companies whose products I use?  Should I send my resume to anyone willing to listen?

Similarly, how often do companies hire out-of-state interns?  Do any of you have experience with taking an internship in a different location?"

Details inside.,robotrock1382,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1k8tq0/im_having_a_hard_time_deciding_whats_next_any/,"Before i get started, thank you to every one who reads this and takes the time to give a nice informed answer. 

Ok, so I'm 31, engaged, and am trying to figure out this school thing. For the last year, I have been taking Trig every semester, and all 4 times I've not passed. I've tried tutoring, staying late with the teacher, and working extra hard. I just am not amazing at math. The only thing that stands in my way of a degree in my field is this math class. I should let you know that besides my difficulties in math i have a 3.7 GPA. Also i should mention i have very high test anxiety and often times would start crying in class and/or the way home after a frustrating day. Besides the trig class, most things in my life are wonderful. I work a part time job, that helps with money, and my amazing fiancee is fully supportive and encouraging in every way. Also i do a lot of work for a National non profit organization, and this year i received an award for my services over the years. Lastly, in about 7 weeks i'm getting married. The planning is wrapping up and we're both extremely excited to finally be husband and wife ( we've been together for nearly 7 years).

This is where it gets tricky. Because of my anxiety, and also for the reason that I thought a few months away from school would help me to calm my mind and jump back in in January. My Fiancee agrees somewhat with that. Yesterday however, my cousin's husband gave me a call asking what was up with school. My uncle had mentioned to him that I was thinking about taking a semester off to get married and to enjoy some marriage time. He disagreed with that suggestion. 

Now, I like him alot, and i highly respect him, and deep down I think he has awesome points. He may even be right. But the way he went about it just made me feel like even more of a failure. He talked about how i'm 31 and working a part time job, and that I'm my fiancee's burden because once we get married I'll be on her insurance plan. He highly suggested i go back this semester. He said the wedding was just one day and it isn't a valid excuse to take a semester off. 

He also mentioned how jobs wouldn't think much of a 31 year old person who's still trying to get his life straight. I appreciated all he had to say, but i feel like he's jumping to a lot of conclusions. After everything he said I could at least be trying to find a school that offers an alternative to trig that my school would accept. I actually called 5 schools today about that and have a few options now. 3 of those school don't offer what I need, and one is getting back to me, but the most likely one is an hour drive away and my fiancee uses the car to get to her job as a teacher. It just seems like the timing isn't right. I still don't think it would be the worst thing in the world to enjoy my wedding without any anxiety and stress over what may be happening in my class, but I don't want my family to think i'm a loser. I have amazing things going for me, but this is just the last piece of the puzzle. Plus, I'm still pursuing internships and jobs in my field while I finish my degree. Thanks everyone, please give me some advice. "

He just finishes his BS in Comp. Sci/Software engineering, and is looking for a job. He has 6 months XP and 3.3/3.8 GPA (cumulative/major). He is saying he shouldn't go below 50k post-tax if he gets a job in SF and not between 40k and 50k if he gets a job in a more out there region like Dublin or Walnut Creek. Is this about right? Or will he get better offers? 


From this September until end of May 2014 he will be living at home to save up. Ill also be cutting corners and saving up. I will also spend the year doing free or low pay internships while finishing my degrees. We also expect to get at least ten thousand from our wedding(may 2014). Does this sound like a good plan? 


I rented for years in Los Angeles. I'm not use to the market here. I had a good deal in el cerrrito (1600 per month for three bed and two bath near bart) that I had before moving to on campus housing 19 months ago. So we are really not use to this market. 


The good thing is that we do have excellent references and time to build up credit/parents to co-sign. He also already has a car 100% paid off. Ill be buying a bicycle before the move as well since I don't drive. 


We lack most furniture as well but have all the other stuff like cooking supplies and other needs. I've also lived away from home for six years already so I know how to make us only spend 120$/month on groceries. 


My concern is just rent. I have health issues and cannot take mold, rats, pets, or vermin. Add in the fact we need to be within a mile of a bus stop or train stop the cost further increases. He also needs a one bedroom with office or two bedroom unit. 


So what are we looking at here? What should we do? I need help please.

Edit - we don't drink smoke or use drugs. We only pay for Netflix for our TV fix. We can also forgo heat as my flat now and in el cerrito lacked heat. "

1kdn7p,2,2013-08-14,"A ""visit to dad's work"" serving as viral marketing for ""collectable"" Pepsi bottles.",griffer00,HailCorporate,https://www.reddit.com/r/HailCorporate/comments/1kdn7p/a_visit_to_dads_work_serving_as_viral_marketing/,"This post is currently garnering upvotes in /r/Weird. It is more subtle than a lot of the viral-marketing posts that are currently inching their way up the rankings, 

Link to post: http://imgur.com/a/ao9ki

The gallery's true intentions are betrayed in several ways. 

1. There are a disproportionate number of photos of ""dad's Pepsi can collection"" compared to other items-of-interest in the office. For some reason, this gallery has **six** photos focusing on the collection. Every other point-of-interest in the office has **one** photo. We're supposed to assume that the photographer has pure intentions. **Gallery's photographer sez:** ""Oh, my dad's office is soooo cool! But the *coolest* part about it? He hoards decades-old trash! Oh man, this is some sweet, sweet trash... better take half-a-dozen pictures of it to show reddit. Hmm, you know what? I haven't had a Pepsi in a while... maybe I'll pick one up from the vending machine on my way out of work."" 

2. Some of the gallery's shots focus on a newly-designed ""collectable"" Pepsi bottle, suggesting that Pepsi is embracing a newer, greener, progressive attitude. Soft drinks are becoming increasingly unpopular due to their perceived health risks, especially among those who embrace the ""Go Green"" movement. In many of the shots, the new bottle serves as the centerpiece, and is compared to previous generations of bottles/cans, suggesting ""evolution"" of the design. Taking advantage of cognitive biases that are typical of all humans, the new design gets equivocated with an improved, modern, and greener Pepsi Co. **PepsiCo's ""hip"" CEO sez:** ""This isn't your grandfather's Pepsi, oh heavens no. Pepsi is not above exploiting fads, and it shows in our newest bottle. It's green, emblazoned with the word 'together,' which in-turn is typecast via edgy graphic design principles. Complete your collection of worthless trash by purchasing a 24-case of these LIMITED EDITION bottles. Your money and our corn syrup *can* make the world a better place. PepsiCo Inc., TM, R, C, your first born, etc."" 

3. The Pepsi collection photos begin 1/4 the way through the gallery, which helps to deflect the perception that this gallery is, in fact, an advertisement. If the Pepsi collection photos were presented at the start of the gallery, this would immediately set-off reddit's ""sixth sense"" for crappy viral advertising. On the other hand, if the collection photos were placed towards the end of the gallery, it's likely that many of the readers would have missed them. Just as the reader is about to click the browser window's ""X"" button... BAM! Bright-green Pepsi bottle, right in your face. To fortify the photo's attention-grabbing properties, it follows a photo featuring action figures of some of reddit's most beloved fictional characters: Woody and Superman, carefully nestled betwixt bottles of half-consumed Pepsi. **PepsiCo marketing wiz hopes the target demographic sez:** ""This gallery is pretty boring, it looks like it's just -- OH SHIZ, IT'S WOODY AND SUPERMAN XD !!! Okay, mebbe I'll give this gallery a second chance. Boy, all this web browsing is making me thirsty for a sweet, fizzy, refreshing, Pepsi-like beverage.""

4. Notice the associations between Pepsi bottle collection and symbols of masculinity, which is perhaps an attempt to reconcile Pepsi's ""new image"" as compatible with the lifestyle of the average young male. First, the photos take place in the poster's *dad's* office, who apparently does some sort of automobile ""garage"" work. What does this archetype of masculinity consume when he's not getting caked in corroded oil, or getting chewed-out by his ""sonuvabitch"" boss? Pepsi, of course! There are other indirect fortifications for the manhood-Pepsi association. For instance, the tongue-in-cheek ""trophy for being man of the year,"" the WWII helmet, the blood-drop tacks, and a stereotypically ""male"" office (i.e. scattered papers, trash, action figures). Pepsi wants us to embrace our modern masculinity... with the important caveat that Pepsi is included, of course. **Target demographic's lowest-common-denominator sez:** ""I'm a modern guy. I work hard, but I like to think that I have fun while doing it. My dad is a testament to this creed, and I've finally reached the age where I can truly appreciate his wisdom and dedication... and his choice in soft drinks! But, I can't tell him this directly because he'll awkwardly change the subject... instead, I'll connect with him by drinking Pepsi. And maybe I'll play with these actions figures instead of submitting my expense reports. Pew pew pew!"" 

5. Wacky man-child ""hijinx"" ensue in many of the photographs, and the ""I finally understand what my dad meant when I was a teenager"" card is played heavily here. Overall, this suggests a target demographic of young males in their late 20's. Oh, there are the zany action figures and the ""man of the year"" trophy that I previously mentioned. There's also a ""secret garden"" containing a buried horse head. Now, let's interweave these images of office-acceptable tomfoolery with the previously-discussed symbols of nostalgia and masculinity, and we get a good idea of the ad's target demographic: the demographic is young enough to be impressed by the ""individuality"" underlying a trashy office, and just old enough to be in denial that they're no longer as cool as they once thought they were. PepsiCo wants you to know that it's okay, and it loves your money -- er, I mean, *you* -- just the way you are. **Borderline type-II diabetic guy sez:** ""Screw all the metrosexual Hollywood superhunks! I'm just a normal guy who enjoys the simpler things in life, like goofing off with my friends, and losing important documents. It's okay to be a dude. Now that I've embraced myself in my truest form, I think I'll reward myself with a Pepsi!"" 

**Comments**

First, Pepsi, this is a pretty good piece of viral marketing: you've obviously put some thought into this, and it shows in subtle ways. You've managed to communicate associations between your product and some profound themes, without immediately ""outing"" the gallery as a viral advertisement. Second, Pepsi, I think I see what you're going for here: you want young males -- i.e. me and my friends -- to associate your product with the simple pleasures of being a young male in modern society... next time we're playing video games with the broskis in our mancaves, perhaps we'll be more likely to pick up a case of Pepsi instead of Coke. Third, Pepsi, you made me sit down and think about your product for 20 minutes straight, for the cost of internet access and a summer intern... pretty cheap when compared to the prices paid for television and magazine advertisements. Fourth, Pepsi, by creating this post, I have unwittingly furthered your viral marketing campaign for your bottle's ""new and improved"" design... for better or worse. Everyone who reads this post is now aware of the new bottle design, and that's more than enough to meet your marketing department's goal for increased product awareness. Touche, Pepsi... very touche.

The internship was focused mostly around general exposure vs producing deliverables. As the internship comes to an end, the company has given me the opportunity to continue full time as ""DBA Trainee"", but I have chosen to go a few days a week to keep my focus on school. 

The ""problem"" is that they are leaving it me to decide what I would like to do on my days in. Now that I've gotten past the ""I had no idea what DBA's did"" stage, I'm trying to figure out what to do/focus on specifically to become marketable. This company uses all the major RDBMS. My thoughts are to focus on SQL server as a good starting spot, so by the end of the semester maybe I can go for a cert or something along those lines. 

My biggest fear is that I get towards the end of the internship with the realization that I haven't really learned anything besides reading random content.

**Things you hear with**

[Headphones](http://www.amazon.com/Sony-MDR-V6-Monitor-Series-Headphones/dp/B00001WRSJ/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1338493715&amp;sr=8-1) - [tatumc](http://www.reddit.com/r/BuyItForLife/comments/ued0f/request_high_quality_headphones_for_60_bucks/c4und2k) made the same recommendation I do.  The V6 is an industry standard and they last forever.  You will need to buy new ear foam every 10-15 years if you use them heavily/professionally.  Runner-up of the [ATH-M50s](http://www.amazon.com/Audio-Technica-ATH-M50-Professional-Monitor-Headphones/dp/B000ULAP4U).

[Earbuds](http://www.monoprice.com/products/product.asp?c_id=108&amp;cp_id=10823&amp;cs_id=1082303&amp;p_id=8320&amp;seq=1&amp;format=2) - suggested by [SaSSafraS1232](http://www.reddit.com/r/BuyItForLife/comments/zzbvr/request_earbuds_that_last/c694yse) a good set of earbuds that won't break the bank.  More likely to lose them then actually break them.

Studio Monitors - I'm willing to bet any manufacturer worth their salt will always make a studio monitor that is BIFL, save you throw it at a wall.  It's happened.  It comes down more to price point and what you want out of a studio monitor outside longevity. 

[Gaming Headsets](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16826306004&amp;nm_mc=KNC-GoogleAdwords&amp;cm_mmc=KNC-GoogleAdwords-_-pla-_-Headsets+%26+Accessories-_-N82E16826306004&amp;gclid=CI3QpJqM_bgCFa9eQgodo2IAgA) - a good all in one headset.  Recommended by a lot of users here

Speakers/amplifier/turntables/cd players - go thrifting.  There will always be a flavor of the year/decade, but nothing beats the warm sound of a gently used 30 year old cabinet hooked up to vintage gear.  Look for brands like Pioneer, Polk Audio, Technics, Dual, Marantz, and many more.  AVOID CROSBYS.  You will also find that once about every decade there's a major shift in audio media, and nothing so far (outside digital distribution) is BIFL.



**Things you talk into**

[Dynamic Microphone](http://www.sweetwater.com/store/detail/SM57/) The SM57 and it's sister mic the SM58 are an industry standard for a reason.  I have had talent cough, sneeze, spit, throw up, kick, swing around until it hit a poor intern and a brick wall and it still sounds like out of the box.

[Condenser microphone](http://www.rodemic.com/mics/nt1-a) - Hands down the industry standard in condenser mics.  Incredibly versatile, and will last you your entire career. 

[Remote Recording Microphone](http://www.sweetwater.com/store/detail/DR05/) - yes there are higher quality portable recorders.  Yes there are portable recorders with video cameras.  But audio, like all electronics, date very quickly.  Next year you can record twice the quality for half the price of this year's model.  When you need a portable recorder, you need something that won't break the bank, that's small, and that will do the job for life.  That's the DR05.

**Topics of discussion**

[Why you shouldn't buy that USB microphone](http://www.reddit.com/r/BuyItForLife/comments/1ca5n8/bifl_request_the_best_microphone_for_recording/c9ewrz5) - /u/UnordinaryAmerican makes an excellent case for why USB recording devices are not BIFL

[Don't buy a gaming headset](http://www.reddit.com/r/BuyItForLife/comments/1bt0jv/bifl_request_over_ear_headset_with_a_mic/c99vxvw) /u/very_lazy makes a good case of buying several dedicated devices rather than one all-in-one headset.


Note: I'm sure I will get back to this later and add things as I find them.  Let me know what sort of items you'd like BIFL options for."

I also want to eventually write what I understand are called ""bots,"" programs which iteratively identify patterns, then write scripts for themselves to investigate and test those patterns, and name them, and repeat.

I don't want to manipulate servers and things like that. I respect that those tasks are very valuable and important, but it's not where my interests lie.

1kbval,3,2013-08-14,Life has been pretty shit for the past 6 months.,about7beavers,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1kbval/life_has_been_pretty_shit_for_the_past_6_months/,"So it all started when my girlfriend broke up with me. I was pretty sad about it at first, but then she started dating another guy just a couple weeks after that. This caused me to sink into a full on depression, and she just kept making it worse all the time. She guilted me into staying ""friends"" with her, even though breaking contact for a few months would've helped me heal from our break up. I really loved her, and we had talked about spending the rest of our lives together. 

Anyway, as a result of my depression, my grades dropped in school. 

I briefly thought things were looking up when I started dating my best friend, but then I found out my ex had sex with her rebound boyfriend, after telling me that she wanted to not have sex again until she found a guy she could see herself with for a long time. That really fucking hurt. We had lost our virginity to each other.

Then I couldn't find any jobs in my field of study, while she got an internship at her top choice company. Then I could barely find a job at all, before finding a job working just above minimum wage with hours completely opposite what my friends were working at their internships, which were paying more than my crappy job. 

To add to the shit sandwich that has been my life recently, over the course of four days I found out I lost my scholarship, my grandpa, and found out my uncle has bladder cancer. 

I just feel like I'm a failure, and my life is continually sustaining losses that I'll never recover from. I've done all the things I was told to do to succeed in life, but it's just been one horrible thing after another with nothing to show for it. My scholarship was really nice, a lot of money to lose, and just barely at that. I needed a 3.2 and got a 3.12 GPA. It was the only thing to show for all my years of AP classes, good grades, good SAT scores, and years of learning programming. And now it's gone. 

I may get my scholarship back through appeal, but I have no idea what my chances are. I feel like I'm at least as qualified as my friends in computer science, but here I am working a shit restaurant job while they're working high paying internships. 

The few good things in my life are: I finally told my ex I was cutting off contact for at least a few months to heal from our incredibly painful break up and all the shit she did to me after. My new girlfriend has been wonderful, the one consistent good in my life for the past almost 4 months. And my uncle was able to have the cancer removed fairly successfully. 

I know this is a really long post, but this shit has been bothering me for a long time, and nobody seems to have anything to say except ""It'll get better, trust me."" I've been waiting for it to get better, but here we are 6 months later, and I still feel like shit.

TL;DR: Girlfriend broke up with me and caused a lot of emotional trauma. Lost my really nice scholarship. Got a shit job way under my qualifications while my friends all did way better. Grandpa died. Uncle got bladder cancer. Some upsides including new wonderful girlfriend, cutting ex out of life for a few months, and my uncle had the bladder cancer removed for the most part. Thanks for letting me rant, and any words of encouragement would be very much appreciated."

However, I have several questions. And I really just need some people to give me some insight.

* So my first question is, what exactly is the AMCAS? Is it pretty much like the CommonApp, but for med schools? And how early do you recommend I start filling it out? I read somewhere that students usually start filling it out their junior year of undergrad.

* Also, I'm very worried about getting internships and clinical experience. How did you get internships? Does an internship at a hospital pretty much involve desk work? How would I ask for an internship? And do you recommend that I shadow a doctor? Would that count as clinical experience? And I hear many people talking about doing research during undergrad. Is it required to get into med school?

* The last question I have for right now is how early should I start studying for the MCAT? And when should I take it (Please remember that I plan on finishing undergrad in three years; this is because I received my associates degree through a dual enrollment program at my high school).
Thank you so much for taking the time to answer this!

1kbent,3,2013-08-13,I have one year of undergraduate studies left and I don't want to work in a lab or go to grad school. I want to open a German Restaurant.,crayfl,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1kbent/i_have_one_year_of_undergraduate_studies_left_and/,"I am currently between my Junior and Senior year at a prestigious college. I study cellular and molecular biology. I really liked biology in high school, and I can handle the work fairly well, but my heart just isn't in the subject anymore. While other kids are getting internships and volunteering in research labs, I often feel unmotivated to secure any opportunities in my field. I often see facebook statuses from friends and acquaintances in science fields, and I realize how much more excited they are to be studying science than I am. 

Due to my inability to secure an internship this summer, I have had a ton of free time. I went to Europe earlier this summer, but after that I couldn't find a job for the summer and ended up volunteering at a day camp for homeless children 2 days a week. It is somewhat fulfilling, but more frustrating due to how hard it is to control some of these kids. 

My dad has been bugging me about taking steps to secure a lab technician job after I graduate at the end of this upcoming school year. I originally wanted to go to graduate school for genetic counseling, but he convinced me to pursue that after I pay some of my student loan debt off. I am inclined to agree with him because he is helping me with a big chunk of the debt, and I understand how big of a financial burden it is to go to grad school. 

My problem is that my ""job search"" feels like a waste of time. It is very hard to imagine it paying off. I keep telling myself that I'll be regretful that I didn't spend more time searching for jobs when I am swamped with schoolwork a couple of months from now. Yet this is not enough to motivate me to keep searching. 

Recently my family rented a cottage on a lake for a week. There, I found a stash of German cookbooks and food books. For some reason I found them fascinating. I loved learning about how and what German people eat. I don't speak German, have only been to Germany for a layover, and have only been to a handful of German restaurants. This makes my fascination all the more baffling to me. 

At some point during the week, I had a revelation: I want to start a German restaurant. Of course I told myself that this was just a pipe dream, but over the past few weeks it has been all that I can think about. Imagining the menu, how I would make everything, what kind of beer we would serve, what the decor would be like, etc. It might just be my mind trying to distract myself from the job search, but it is the first time I have felt any real passion in a while. It has even got to the point where I have been researching how a person can become a restaurateur. 

My vision for the restaurant is this: 
* A variety of freshly made sausages
* A variety of sauerkraut, fermented in-house and unpasteurized to preserve the health benefits
* A variety of fresh-ground mustard
* House-made pretzels made in the Bavarian style with lye instead of baking soda
* Home-baked desserts such as strudels and cakes. 
* Fresh Veggies incorporated into meals
* An emphasis on craft-beer instead of imported beer
* An emphasis on importing as little as possible

Basically I want to revitalize German cuisine, which in America has been in a low-quality comfort zone for too long. I want to introduce it to a new generation by making fresh traditional dishes with heart, without all the old-world kitsch. 

Do I know that the chances of a new restaurant being successful are pretty low? Yes.
Do I know that starting and running a restaurant is extremely demanding? Yes, but I don't know why exactly, and that makes me feel naive.
Am I going to follow my dream eventually? I really don't know at this point. The amount of debt I will have is pretty daunting, and I don't think that working my way up through the restaurant biz right after graduation would be wise. I have fantasies of paying most of my debt off with a lab job, quitting, getting a waiter job/apprenticeship, work up the manager ladder, and find a way to raise money to make a restaurant. 

I just don't know though. Maybe I can make this work. Maybe I'll just be wasting my education. Maybe I'm wasting my time dreaming about it. I'll give it time.

Thanks for reading. 


TL;DR I am having doubts about my passion for science and I want to open a German restaurant instead.

When I tell you I'm the laziest person in the world, and don't exercise (except for when I dance) even though I know I should, I kid you not. I haven't consistently exercised in years.
  
Well, this summer for the past 6 weeks I got an internship in a new location. And, since I don't have a car nor a license yet, I had to figure out how to get to and from work. Well, my landlord let me borrow his bike and when he doesn't drive me, I would ride to and fro work.

The transition was terrible. My work is about 3.5 miles away with alot of hills and the first day that I had to ride to work I stopped to walk so many times it was embarrassing. Yeah, my body was so not ready for this. That first day, it took me about 50 minutes to get to work (yeah 3.5 miles) and I was simply exhausted and sweaty. Well these past 6 weeks, I slowly noticed as my endurance went up and my legs strengthened and quit yelling at me to stop. It went from me stopping at random moments, to me stopping only at hills, then this week, me riding the whole way through in 20-25 minutes. I'm sure I can do it under that time but the lights, traffic, and sidewalks all seem to be conspiring against me. 

I'm just amazed at all you people riding 10+ miles commutes in record times and that's pure commitment in my eyes. Cycling is definitely a big deal and its so rewarding when you feel your body getting stronger throughout the weeks. When I get back to school, I will make sure to go to that gym, and hit the bike, so I won't lose all my progress.

So from a previously thin yet unhealthy, to a now semi-healthy girl who's eating right to sustain my cycling, I SALUTE YOU ALL and wish you long, tiring, but worthwhile bike rides and commutes."

[ off, thank you two so much for doing this. I'm a huge fan of *(500\) Days of Summer* and am very much looking forward to *The Spectacular Now*. As a directing/screenwriting student, I appreciate opportunities such as these. The interwebs are a wonderful place.  I'm always curious about the process of writing as a team, versus solo...  Seth &amp; Even say they write in the same room, literally back to back. Do you guys work in a similar way, or do you spend more time apart? Would you say the final result is typically 50/50, or does one take more credit than the other? I'm sure by the end of the day, you're looked at as equals, credit-wise. I'm more so asking from a personal standpoint. I can't imagine the two of you have too many major conflicts if you're still working together, but I also can't imagine it's always sunshine any rainbows. Any stories you'd like to share?  Thanks for doing this! You're brilliant writers and I look forward to your future projects.  Bonus question (time permitting\): Is the Screenwriter's Bible all it's cracked up to be or would you recommend other sources? Thanks again!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kfxma/we_are_scott_neustadter_and_michael_weber/cboit0s?context=5)|Thanks for your question! weber and i met a long time ago when we both lived in new york. even when we lived in the same city, we never ever ever wrote in the same room. 500 was written when i was in london and he was in new york. and subsequently all our stuff has been written with me in LA and weber in new york. the process is pretty simple. lots of talking in the beginning until we get a solid outline down. then we divide up the scenes and send them back and forth. hope thats helpful! 
[For an aspiring screenwriter, do you have any recommendations of must read scripts and great movies to learn from? What really helped you each to learn storytelling when you were starting off? Thank you. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kfxma/we_are_scott_neustadter_and_michael_weber/cboj7nj?context=5)|Read EVERYTHING. good, bad, movies you like, movies you hate, all the different genres. its the most important thing you can do if you want to write. plus, check out stephen kings book ""on writing"" and william goldman's book about hollywood called ""adventures in the screen trade."" they will both make you feel like anythings possible and that you can do it too which when you're just starting out, is really nice to hear! - scott.
[The writers seem to be king in television, yet for film it still seems to be the director has all control even over the script. How involved are you with your script while the film is in production and do you find yourself fixing dialogue on set, or when you finish your final draft are you done. Have you seen a shift of involvement of screenwriters in film for the better and what are your thoughts?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kfxma/we_are_scott_neustadter_and_michael_weber/cbokett?context=5)|We've been very lucky - with both 500 and Spec Now we've been very involved.  Marc Webb was hired over a year before we started shooting 500 so we had a lot of time to bond.  i think he knew how important the movie was to us and hopefully we were a resource to him on set.  with Spec Now we were also producers so we were involved in finding James Ponsoldt and casting.  as producers it was expected of us to be on set and fortunately James wanted us there too.  it won't always be this way but so far we've enjoyed staying involved as much as possible.  -Michael.

[I loved 'The Spectacular Now' and although it is based on a book - I can imagine that you all were able to flesh out and shape characters in the screenplay in ways that the author hadn't. Were there real life people or other fictional characters that influenced how you wrote any of the characters? Once you had chosen the cast, did you go back and rewrite anything based on either Shailene or Miles's style? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kfxma/we_are_scott_neustadter_and_michael_weber/cboj0r0?context=5)|In terms of your first question:  the ""tool"" we rely upon when we write anything is we ask ourselves &amp; each other a very simple question - what would really happen?  it's a question that guides us when we're outlining, we're writing, when we're problem-solving.  and b/c of that i think so much of what we do - including The Spectacular Now - comes from a real place, things we have experienced, people we know, etc.  and for your 2nd question:  you're almost always tweaking the script.  when Shailene and Miles came on board they certainly had some thoughts.  nothing changed significantly though b/c they each had such a great understanding of Aimee &amp; Sutter.  in only a few small places did either of them want to change what was written and always their ideas were for the better!  -Michael 
[I'm a young screenwriter trying to break into the industry. What's the best way to break in? How did you guys do it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kfxma/we_are_scott_neustadter_and_michael_weber/cbojcwx?context=5)|I started interning when i was in high school. every summer, real job on the weekends, working for free during the week. i read every script, learned some of the ins and outs, and was fortunate enough to get hired when i graduated college. because of this, when i did decide to get serious about the screenwriting thing, i had people who were one degree of separation away from someone who could be helpful. and that was key. always helps to put a face to the name on the cover page of the script thats buried amidst fifteen other scripts on a producer's desk. - Scott.

[1\) After (500\) Days of Summer, what made you two decide to stick with independent filmmaking, whereas the director went way into the mainstream with Spider-Man?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kfxma/we_are_scott_neustadter_and_michael_weber/cbokp5m?context=5)|Spec Now started as a studio movie, with the same people who made 500, and then they decided not to make it.  we still believed in the project so we decided to go the independent route.  it took almost 5 years but it was worth it!
[How does one go down the independent route? did you fund the films yourself?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kfxma/we_are_scott_neustadter_and_michael_weber/cbokyz3?context=5)|In this case, we had a script, actors, a filmmaker, passionate people who wanted to see it made - but we had no money. it was only when andrew lauren read the script and was able to come in with his own money that we actually were able to make a movie. the cool part is 16 years earlier, i was andrew's intern. - scott.
[Hey i recently acquired a great interest in writing and reading scripts,i have no education on these,i learn all by reading other scripts. What advice could you give me?  Also one of my biggest fear is that my screenplay looks like other people style how can i avoid that?  Also What you guys think about Quentin Tarantino?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kfxma/we_are_scott_neustadter_and_michael_weber/cbojnww?context=5)|We love QT and his films!  and were lucky enough to meet him once a few years ago.  he couldn't have been nicer to us.  reading scripts is a great start - keep reading 'em and keep watching a ton of movies.  bust most of all KEEP WRITING!  and then write some more after that.  -Michael.
[Hi huge fan love (500\) I've spoke to one of u already over twitter lol . can I ask? do you have any writing advice? :~\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kfxma/we_are_scott_neustadter_and_michael_weber/cbokk3q?context=5)|This is so simple but it's everything:  write... write some more... and then write more after that.  write every day.  don't wait until you have a good idea or are in the mood to write - write especially when you're not in the mood, when you don't have time, when it's the last thing on earth you want to be doing.  make writing more important than just about everything else in your life... and then, in time, you will see a big difference in your writing.  good luck!  -Michael.
[A lot of reviews of The Spectacular Now are using John Hughes as a reference point, was he an influence on the movie at all?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kfxma/we_are_scott_neustadter_and_michael_weber/cboiu1v?context=5)|Definitely!  we both love the work of John Hughes.  he wrote about young people without talking down to them.  Ferris Bueller's Day Off was especially a touchstone for Spectacular Now.  Sutter Keely has some Ferris Bueller in him.  personally i've seen FBDO a few hundred times - no exaggeration.  i cut waaay too much high school b/c of that movie.  quick trivia question: anyone know who fouled off the ball Ferris caught at the Cubs game? -Michael.
[Hey guys. I used to work as a reader and there were probably three or four scripts out of the hundreds that made me cry. Spectacular Now was one of them. A beautifully told and honest story. So nice to read material where writers treat teenagers like real people...with complexity, as opposed to cardboard cutouts. What did you see in James Ponsoldt's work &amp; vision that convinced you he was right for this story?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kfxma/we_are_scott_neustadter_and_michael_weber/cboj6mg?context=5)|Love to hear that. its always nice to make someone cry! as for james, we both went crazy for his previous film smashed. we were slightly concerned that he wouldnt want to do our movie because of all the drinking in both stories but when we sat with james, all we did was talk about the movies we loved, what it felt like to be young and immature, and then we knew he was the right guy for the job. we were thrilled he said yes to us! - Scott.
[Hi guys, this is awesome, thanks!!!  Just a few questions, when did you realize you wanted to be a screenwriter? What pieces influenced you in that journey? Also being a part of some excellent films, what is the most important thing when telling a story that you want your viewers to know? I think that in life there's always underlining meanings and inspirational values that stories reveal to us. What are some of your thoughts considering the works you've been a part of? Thanks in advance, you guys are awesome! ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kfxma/we_are_scott_neustadter_and_michael_weber/cbojhbp?context=5)|I always wanted to be a writer but i didn't consider screenwriting till i got to college (Syracuse - let's go Orange!).  what influenced me was watching 5+ movies a week - the work of Woody Allen, Cameron Crowe, Billy Wilder, Hal Ashby... i could keep going.  in terms of our work... before we start we ask ourselves a simple question:  would we go see this movie?  we're fans first so we only want to work on movies we'd go see.  -Michael.
[What are your favorite movies?  What are your favorite sandwiches?  What're the best steps a young screenwriter can take to get better and get noticed?  I wish I could ask you questions whenever I actually can think of good ones! ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kfxma/we_are_scott_neustadter_and_michael_weber/cbolaay?context=5)|See my answer below about PBJ - it's my daily go-to.  yesterday i had an incredible proscuito &amp; fig jam sandwich - i'm still thinking about it.

The Good, The Bad &amp; The Ugly... ask us questions anytime on twitter!  - Michael.
[In an interview you guys said that with The Spectacular Now (and maybe TFIOS?\) you have to make the script cinematic while doing justice to the original material. How does that work with your outline process? How do you know which scenes would be good for screen and which to cut?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kfxma/we_are_scott_neustadter_and_michael_weber/cbojsmd?context=5)|We don't always know!  we talk about it a lot.  we outline and re-outline.  and we understand that a script is very fluid - it will change when a director comes on board.  a script is a map for the director to go make a movie.  and we will spend a lot of time with the director talking about how to make it more cinematic.  - Michael.
[Hey!  I just did an interview with your Costume Designer, Peggy Stamper!  I saw this film at Sundance and loved it.  I think it gives ""The Breakfast Club"" a run for ""Best High School Coming of Age film"" ever.  Just wanted to say thank you too for avoiding the cliched tropes and delivering a genre-defining film.  After doing ""500 Days of Summer"", how did you too decide that TSN would be your next project?  Why this genre?  What other stories/genres were you considering?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kfxma/we_are_scott_neustadter_and_michael_weber/cbojnnu?context=5)|In the same way that summer was a reaction to the way hollywood was making romantic comedies, weber and i very much wanted to find a way to bring back the more sensitive, honest, teenage coming of age movies we grew up with and loved so much. tim's book seemed to give us a great opportunity for that and so we dove in. - scott.
[Were you at all worried about having such a major character as the one played by Kyle Chandler not come into the picture until so late in the film?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kfxma/we_are_scott_neustadter_and_michael_weber/cbokthq?context=5)|Not at all. SPOILER ALERT: its kind of like jaws. or i should say anti-jaws. we hear a lot about sutter's dad, what a great guy he is etc. so when we finally do get to meet him, we have expectations. he's been built up in our minds to be a certain thing. and then kyle chandler opens the door and you're hopefully all ""hey coach taylor is the dad! this is gonna work out great!"" which of course it does not. but thats all part of the fun. would have been quite a different thing with a different actor opening that door. - scott 
[Saw The Spectacular Now at Montclair FF and thought it was absolutely brilliant. Which three films should every aspiring screenwriter watch (read\)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kfxma/we_are_scott_neustadter_and_michael_weber/cbojd95?context=5)|Thank you! i think that depends on what you want to write, what stories move you. for me, i would say ""the graduate,"" ""annie hall,"" and ""almost famous."" theres definitely no set three and three is nowhere near enough! - scott.
[Hey guys, I saw *The Spectacular Now* yesterday and loved it. It was great to see a high school movie that has complex characters with dimensions and unique personalities.  My question is, Do you like it when Actors use some improvisation to add to scenes or would you prefer for them to stick to the script?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kfxma/we_are_scott_neustadter_and_michael_weber/cbojo9s?context=5)|God no!  stick to the damn script!  just kidding.  we love when an actor has a deep understanding of the character b/c then they bring ideas to the movie that we never thought of.  we've been lucky with both 500 and Spec Now that everyone involved wanted to make the same movie.  which means there were a lot of good, new ideas when the actors came on board.  -Michael.

[For my senior project I am working on a short film screenplay. I am so stoked for Spectacular Now to come to Pittsburgh, and I am a huge fan of 500 Days of Summer. What advice do you guys have for first time screenwriters? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kfxma/we_are_scott_neustadter_and_michael_weber/cbojftp?context=5)|First time screenwriters:  hey i think Scott may have already answered this but... watch a ton of movies, read a lot of scripts... and then don't be afraid to make mistakes.  the only way to get better is to write and then write more and then more after that.  keep doing it and it will get better.  good luck!  -Michael.
[How did you sell (500\) days of summer? was it a difficult pitch?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kfxma/we_are_scott_neustadter_and_michael_weber/cboklgk?context=5)|We always called it ""boy meets girl meets memento."" that was our pitch. of course we didnt pitch it and if we ever had pitched it, we would have been laughed out of every room. in this case, we had the script, it was what it was, and we hoped people would get it. some did, some did, but even those who did did not want to buy it. and so it sat there, unwanted, untouched, collecting dust on shelves across los angeles, until some passionate producers convinced a cool guy at fox searchlight to take a chance. and a year later we made the thing. - scott.
[How was the writing process different for writing The Fault in Our Stars, knowing it has such a crazy fan-base with all the nerd-fighters anticipating it's release, and would you guys adapt any other of John Green's novels'?  My last question is, i have always felt that i can somehow maybe get my voice out there in script form. While i can just write a narrative, what books or computer programs would you recommend to get started?  Thank You!!! :\]](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kfxma/we_are_scott_neustadter_and_michael_weber/cbokc6k?context=5)|I dont think the fact that fault was so beloved and had such a huge fan base was an influence on our writing process or on what we kept and didnt keep from the book. the truth is, the book is just so good that it made no sense to deviate from it just for the sake of deviation. our goal was to capture, translate, and visually communicate what all of you (and both of us) loved so much about this book. and we hopefully did that. - Scott.
[John Green said your script moved him and he barely cries with TFIOS stuff. As writer of the screenplay, did you get emotional writing it? or were you a bit detached?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kfxma/we_are_scott_neustadter_and_michael_weber/cbolhoh?context=5)|Thats great to hear about john. i didnt know that. reading the book, i of course was very emotional, and probably not just because i had just lost my dad. the book packs that kind of punch for everyone i think. reading the script, i kept my emotions in check - but watching some of the auditions, man, i was a weeping mess! we've got an amazing cast and i think its gonna be really moving. invest in kleenex stock, everybody. - Scott.
[How complicated was the notes process on a priorly unheralded screenplay like 500 Days of Summer versus a 'brand' property like The Fault in Our Stars? You guys write films that are a little left of center. Any interesting studio headbutting anecdotes to share?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kfxma/we_are_scott_neustadter_and_michael_weber/cbokzwm?context=5)|On both projects the notes process was fairly simple - sorry, no headbutting anecdotes.  Peter Rice, who ran Fox Searchlight, had only one really smart note on 500 - and that note ultimately led to the reality / expectations splitscreen.  on TFIOS the only notes were a few typos!  we start shooting TFIOS in 2 weeks so hopefully we don't have to change anything between now and then...  -Michael.
[How do you hope the die hard TFIOS fans react to the way you've adapted it? I know there are always issues with things not being included due to time and whatnot, but do you think the fans will react positively to how you've understood the book and adapted it? Thanks for doing an AmA guys :\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kfxma/we_are_scott_neustadter_and_michael_weber/cbokmfh?context=5)|It's our hope that fans of the book are just as passionate about the movie as they are the novel. thats all we can hope for, really. as a fan of john's and as fans of ""fault,"" our aim is to make sure everything great in the novel finds its way into the movie. a really hard thing to do but we definitely feel like everyone involved wants the exact same thing. so we're confident... - Scott.

Is it going to stay true to the book?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kfxma/we_are_scott_neustadter_and_michael_weber/cbojp9e?context=5)|Oh yeah. we feel very much like the protectors of this book. one of the reasons we wanted to do is was to make sure no one else did for fear they'd change too much or get things wrong. of course a book and a movie are two very different things, but overall we suspect fans of the novel will be happy when we see the movie. ask john, he's feeling good so far! - scott.
[Gents, I'm a huge fan of your screenplays!  I've been lucky to read quite a few of them and I want to thank you guys for making my reads incredibly enjoyable!  I especially enjoyed ""No Relation.""

[When did you first get together to write?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kfxma/we_are_scott_neustadter_and_michael_weber/cbokl3p?context=5)|We met working at Tribeca Productions in NYC in the late 90s.  we became friends b/c we loved many of the same movies and had many of the same heroes.  at Tribeca we learned a lot about development - what happens to a script after it leaves the writers hands.  and then at a certain point we tried writing together - mostly just to see if we could do it, if we could make our friends laugh.  and they did.  and that's all that happened with our first screenplay but it was encouragement we needed to keep going.  - Michael.
[Which one of your screenplays did you find to be the most challenging to write?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kfxma/we_are_scott_neustadter_and_michael_weber/cbojhoo?context=5)|They all present their own challenges, of course, but sometimes the challenge is the thing thats exciting in the first place. capturing tim tharp's first person voice in spectacular now was a fun challenge. the same with hazel grace's voice in fault. the challenge of 500 was being able to open and honest about my own personal, ridiculous issues. we love a challenge! - scott.

It took a month to work up the nerve to call him on Monday.  He sounded excited and immediately started asking me about school, about my grades and about my accomplishments.  I told him that I am going to pursue my master's after I graduate.  He added that I might as well go for the Ph.D.  Although he did mention that he was excited for me to ""prove my maturity"" since I had been a ""bad daughter"", I decided to ignore those comments.  I was feeling happy that maybe we could finally have a ""normal"" relationship after a horrid childhood.  We scheduled to meet for lunch on Thursday.  He would call me after his rounds at the hospital.

Today I waited for his call.  After an hour and a half, I called him.  First he told me he had a flat tire. Then he told me he was late for a meeting.  After that he said that we didn't actually set a time together to meet.  He then informed me that I need to get organized because he is a busy man with lots of demands.  He asked that we ""tentatively"" schedule for two weeks from now.

I am a 26 year old, married woman and I feel like my father still has the power to destroy me.  During the course of my internship this summer, I could hardly speak because I lived in fear that I would be screamed at or punished for doing something wrong.  I have no real personal friends and my mother still lives and breaths for my father even though they have been divorced for over ten years.  My husband is a lovely and supportive man, but is getting to the point that he can't take my constant fear and anxiety.  Even though people feel that I'm competent and strong in the workplace and in my life, I feel that I am completely emotionally crippled.  How do I begin to heal?"

I'd been a very troubled teenager, and even had minor outbursts that resulted in a juvenile criminal record, so you can imagine how happy they were. I needed the experience, and this was a great start for me. 

I remember how hot it was when I first arrived at the facility. The heat, combined with my nervousness caused sweat marks beneath my armpits, the anxiety was unbearable. If that wasn't enough, the 20 foot-tall barbed wire fencing was screaming ""Who the fuck are you?"" I mustered the courage to buzz through the intercom, and told the woman inside why I was there. It was at that moment I met Dr. Kent, a tall guy with the softest handshake I've ever experienced. He gave me a welcome speech and asked me if I had any questions before we got started. Really nice man, but had a reluctant attitude about him, almost like he was constantly anxious. 

When I first stepped into the ward, I was taken back by how big it was. I'd always based my opinion of psych wards off of television and movies, so seeing so many long hallways and corridors there were kind of freaked me out. I pretty much shadowed Dr.Kent around the ward as he checked on patient reports, this doubled as my tour of the workplace. About an hour into the day, he was told a patient was freaking out in one of the ""white rooms"", so we rushed to the woman's room hoping to prevent it from escalating. I knew right fucking then that this was not the career for me. This woman was throwing a fit, biting, scratching and screaming death threats at every one in the room. The guards held her down and the doctor administered an injection into her thigh. I was shit-scared, which amplified into petrified when the woman held a steady, half-conscious glare into my eyes and kept repeating ""Why not you?"". Those words played throughout my head for the next 2 hours. 

After the doctor apologized and informed me that sometimes the patients will dedicate their focus to new faces, we spent an hour distributing medication on level 3. This was considered the ""safe"" area, as most of the patients were non-violent, with heavy depression and shit like that. I didn't mind it there, I felt a lot more relaxed in that atmosphere as opposed to level 2. When we finally got called to level 1 my heart started pounding like a bass drum. My previous encounter really creeped me out, so the thought of going somewhere worse was terrifying. 

This level was like something straight out of a Stephen King book, you couldn't dream up a more frightening-looking psych ward. Throw in the whispering, the loud chants and the lonely crying of a woman begging for her baby and you've got this fucking place. I tried asking to use the bathroom we passed on our way in, but the doctor pointed to a staff restroom next to the security booth. I remember trying to piss for 2 straight minutes before I gave up and tried to gather a bit of courage. I just wanted the fuck out of the place, I'd already decided this wasn't the career for me and I didn't need a convicted baby killer trying to shank me in search of her dead child. I had to get through the day, that was my only objective. 

The first stop in psychological hell? Paul Henry. Dr.Kent was nice enough to start listing the disorders he'd been diagnosed with. Bottom of the list was an intense form of OCD, followed by some other brands of dementia, topped by the Schizophrenia that got him put in there in the first place. Apparently he'd been practicing surgery on dead stray cats as a kid, which with age, manifested into a violent attack on a prostitute and an altercation resulting in a man having his eye-balls cut out. They found Paul huddled up beside the fridge whispering ""see no evil"", rocking and holding a lighter to one of the eye-balls. Once again, I was petrified.

In the corner of a heavily padded room, a slim, balding white man sat pressed up against the faded, torn protective material. He didn't look at us when we entered, he just sat there staring at the opposite corner of the room, gently caressing what seemed to be a raggedy old stuffed-animal. The doctor started asking routine questions - ""How do you feel today Paul?"" and ""have you been eating your meals?"". These questions went unanswered, and with time I began feeling more comfortable in this scenario. Of course, at the very moment my heart rate returned to normal, Paul opened his mouth : ""They don't know, do they?"". He was staring at me, distorting his calm demeanour with an eerie grin worthy only of someone with his track record. Before I could enquire as to what he meant by that comment, he started chattering rapidly: ""Marco… Polo… Marco… Polo!"". The doctor could see I was clearly disturbed by what was happening, and he asked security to escort me back to the front of the ward. 

There, I waited… and waited… and waited. In sheer boredom I began reading through security's procedural handbook. It was basically a politically correct guide to dealing with the most fucked up kind of people on Earth. ""If I followed that shit, I'd be wheeled down to the basement on a stretcher before I got to the second chapter"" the guard stated, after watching me genuinely attempt to learn from the manual. At this point, my ""shift"" was almost over, and I wanted nothing more than someone to guide me through this maze, out of this hell-on-earth, and back to the comforts of my easy-going, middle-class life. My day couldn't get any worse… and then it did.

8:23 - That was the exact time on the clock. I was watching the hour hand crawl towards the 9 for what felt like an eternity, and then 'click'…. darkness. Not the kind of darkness you experience when subtle light illuminates from windows… I mean complete, blinding darkness. Those horrific seconds felt like hours, until relief came in the form of an emergency light. The generator had switched on and allowed for security to begin a safety check of the facility. There I was, alone, scared and confused in one of the most terrifying environments your imagination could ever conjure. I wanted to be home with my parents, I missed them now… ironically, after years of consistent arguing and heated altercations, it was my mother and father that I wanted the most at that very moment. 

The ward had slipped into near complete silence, shy of a lonely voice echoing down through the corridor, pleading for someone to turn on a light. My eyes began to swell, and before I knew it I was sobbing like an infant. This traumatic moment was scarring me with each passing second, and then… darkness. The sound of the generator shutting down caused my heart to race quicker than Cadillac Silver, the greyhound I'd made a thousand dollars off the previous summer. Silence. The man's eerie plea for light had disappeared, leaving nothing but a suffocating silence throughout the ward. I wanted nothing more than to hear something… anything. Regret swallowed that thought as the sound of metal puzzles unlocking travelled through the corridors, rapidly gaining momentum as the clicks and clanks worked their way towards me. I didn't need anyone to inform me as to what was transpiring. The rooms had unlocked due to the power outage, a safety procedure that occurred in order to prevent loss of life in the event of a fire. I'd read about it in the manual, however it failed to outline just how horrific the sound of dozens of heavy, secured metal doors actually is.

""Hello!?!"" - I'd mustered up the courage to search for a friendly voice. Nothing. Where the fuck has security gone? Why isn't the doctor rushing back to ensure me that everything would be ok? Should I stay where I'm standing? Should I search for someone? Words cannot describe the vast array of emotional reactions that ripped their way through my body… I was trembling, visibly shaking… and I was alone. Seconds felt like hours, and my lack of action was beginning to taunt me. I needed to find the doctor, at the very least he'd possess the knowledge and know-how needed to react to the situation we'd been placed in. I remembered he'd been seeing to Paul Henry when I'd last seen him, that was where I needed to go. My knees nearly gave way to the weight of my upper body as I slowly shifted through the corridor. I think I prayed to God a thousand times during that walk, a crushing revelation for a dedicated Atheist such as myself. ""Dr. Kent???"" - I asked quietly, ""are you there Dr. Kent???"" - I wanted to shout those words, but my fear of attracting the attention of a patient allowed for only a whisper. I repeated my cry for help, but was interrupted by the sound of a woman mocking me from what could only be a few meters behind me. ""Dr.Kent"" she echoed, followed by what sounded like the school yard laughter of a young school girl. My heart dove into the pit of my stomach, my throat successfully blocking any oxygen from reaching my lungs. As my fingertips caressed the hallway walls, I slowly approached what I believed to be Paul Henry's room. 

""Doctor… Dr. Kent?…?"" I whispered. Nothing. I was broken. Fear swallowed me hole at that moment, and I collapsed into the corner of the padded room, sliding down into a fetal position, whimpering in despair. I'd given up. My survival instinct was overcome by an intense feeling of hopelessness. I began apologizing through my tears… to my parents… to friends I'd wronged. At that moment, the only thing I wanted in the entire world was forgiveness. 

""Marco"" - my sobbing was interrupted. Again… ""Marco"". I sat there, huddled in a corner, attempting to remain as silent as possible in order to avoid any further interaction. It continued in my silence. I didn't want to respond, but the sound of coordinated footsteps approaching provided a comforting sense of security. ""Polo"" - I responded softly.  My response interrupted the voice as it attempted to repeat the word once again - ""Mar.."". The man fell silent abruptly. The fear began to strangle me as I sat helplessly in the corner of that padded room. What felt like a decade passed before the voice spoke once again - ""see no evil"" it whispered. With that, I felt someone's presence enter through the dark doorway. The voice began to scream violently. Pleading for help, cries for mercy were interspersed with the phrase he'd previously whispered - ""SEE NO EVIL!""

Laughter reverberated off of the corridor walls, travelling like a wild pack of hyenas encroaching on their prey. I could hear nothing but my parents voices begging for it to stop, my mother shrieking ""DON'T HURT HIM! PLEASE!"" at the top of her lungs. ""Mom??? Why is she here???"" I thought desperately, rocking viciously on the padded floor, my eyelids clenching down tightly as if being forced closed by a steel vice… then it stopped. I sat through the silence for a few seconds before slowly opening my eyes. The lights were on… I was alone once again, still huddled in the corner of the familiar padded room. 

Dr.Kent was standing above me, along with the security guard I'd met earlier. I was relieved, the overwhelming feeling of joy caused me to erupt into unstoppable laughter. ""Dr.Kent!"" I shouted - ""Where is my mother? I heard her here! Has she come to pick me up? Please take me to her!"".  The look on his face was unforgettable, it was as though he was genuinely perplexed by my request. ""Mark…"" he replied, ""tell us about Paul."" Why was he asking me about Paul? He knows about fucking Paul, I just wanted to see my parents. I reacted with anger, how dare he ask such a trivial question after I'd experienced such a horrifying ordeal. ""You already know about Paul!"" I shrieked - ""I just want to get the fuck out of this place!"". With that another doctor entered the room, and a collection of uniformed individuals attempted to persuade me to calm down. The feeling of the syringe being jammed into my thigh is unforgettable, however the forceful sting was mellowed by the overwhelming feeling of peace that followed. Unable to speak, I watched calmly as Dr.Kent began showing the contents of a file to the most recent arrival. I observed motionless as a photo drifted gently to the soft, white floor. The image depicted what seemed to be a man in his late 40's, lying in a pool of his own blood and feces, lifeless on the kitchen floor. I remember feeling disgusted, appalled at the idea that someone was capable of such evil. As my eyelids began to close, Paul's voice returned once again… ""Marco"" he whispered.

The following weeks were a blur. I think the trauma I endured forced my memory to block out much of what followed, although I'd love to have a memory of the moment I reunited with my parents. We're closer than ever now and our lives are pretty much the epitome of what you'd consider the perfect American family. I see the world differently, almost as though everything is in bright and clear high definition. I have reconnected with old friends, made right of my wrongs, and am generally happy with the life I've made since that terrifying ordeal. However, almost every night since, I keep having these recurring dreams. There I am, huddled up in the corner of that padded room on level 1… staring at Paul as he whispers softly… ""See no evil… see no evil"".

A copy of [my resume can be found here](http://imgur.com/szeFhHo) in a rough format.

Quick Background - I attended school for Business Communication and English with the goal of writing speeches for political campaigns. After a few internships and a major job in my field, I decided that it wasn't for me. Luckily, I spent a good deal of time doing IT support for all the campaigns and that transitioned being hired at my current company, a small tech start up. Dealing with technology, I feel that I've found my calling. At my current position, I've advanced three times over the past 2.5 years and am now holding a leadership position that has me overseeing 8 employees full time.

I am an extremely hard working individual that has a short, but proven track record of strong leadership, communication and organizational skills. I'm hoping to find a job that requires the ability to understand and communicate technical concepts (possibly technical writing) or just any roles that require the ability to deal with technology and the end user, but I'm really open to anything (especially in the gaming industry.)

Thank you everyone and anyone who took the time to read this! If you have any questions, general advice or know of any potential leads, I would be extremely grateful. "

[How serious of a threat is Islamic radicalization in Russia via both the Caucasus and the quickly growing Muslim population in other regions?  Will Putin's often times heavy hand lead to instability via this particular demographic?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kf8ni/i_am_julia_ioffe_senior_editor_of_the_new/cbobae1?context=5)|It's a pretty serious threat, and I can't say that the Russians are doing a good job fighting it. For one thing, they've installed a guy named Ramzan Kadyrov to run Chechnya (once torn up by war) and he's running a pretty Islamist ship. (If you want proof, look at his Instagram account.) And Putin, who is in many ways hostage to him, can't do much about it. 
[I'm a black college student and am wondering if it would be safe for me to study in Russia. I'm sure on a day to day basis I may be fine, but what i'm worried about is the one time something goes wrong. What would be your advice as a Russian-American?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kf8ni/i_am_julia_ioffe_senior_editor_of_the_new/cbobkax?context=5)|Hmmm, that's a tough one. I think that, for the most part, you'd be okay -- if you consider people glaring at you and cracking racist jokes okay. (Russians are, er, not the most tolerant bunch.) There's quite a bit of violence against people considered to be black, which includes, in the Russian mind, people from Central Asia and the Caucasus. My advice is go, but stick to the city center and try to go to a bigger city like Moscow. (St. Pete is crawling with skinheads.) Be extra, extra careful and make sure the American Embassy knows you're there. They have a special unit to deal with threats to American citizens, so you should report anything that happens immediately. You should ask, btw, Jelani Cobb, who spent time teaching in Moscow, if he has any advice.
[Wow. Thank you for the detailed advice.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kf8ni/i_am_julia_ioffe_senior_editor_of_the_new/cboch8b?context=5)|No problem. You should definitely go, but talk to Jelani first. 
[Hey Julia,  First off, your recent ""mansplaining"" article (link for those interested: Link to www.newrepublic.com was EPIC.  Question: Given your unique life experiences -- both personally and professionally -- what would you say your very best piece of life advice is?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kf8ni/i_am_julia_ioffe_senior_editor_of_the_new/cbob9u2?context=5)|Speak up when you know you're right.
[Julia,  Is Navalny really as right wing as they say? What are his views on incoming migrants?!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kf8ni/i_am_julia_ioffe_senior_editor_of_the_new/cbobb81?context=5)|I don't think he is. He is as nationalist as most Russian liberals, who aren't really liberals at all, but are closer to the libertarian end of the spectrum (a natural reaction to a suffocating Russian state). If you ask Navalny, he would tell you that migration is a serious problem (Russia has the second largest number of migrants, after the U.S.) and it's a problem not just for Russia, but for the countries the migrants leave (fatherless families, torn up social fabric, etc.). Moreover, because these migrants live in the shadows in Russia, they don't have access to health care, the courts, etc. His view is that if you don't talk about this, the neo-Nazis will. And I tend to agree with him.
[What are your thoughts on 2014 Olympics? Should gay athletes not attend, attend but protest? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kf8ni/i_am_julia_ioffe_senior_editor_of_the_new/cbobdn2?context=5)|I think gay athletes should absolutely attend, kick ass, and show Russia and the rest of the largely homophobic world that they are an athletic force to be reckoned with.
[Where did you pick up your voice or your writing style? best advice you would give to aspiring journalists or your 18 year old self?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kf8ni/i_am_julia_ioffe_senior_editor_of_the_new/cbobbdn?context=5)|My best advice is, read a ton of good writing, especially before you sleep, but, when you write, don't try to imitate it. Just write as yourself.
[Hi Julia, we, who are not particularly knowledgeable about Russia, still think of it as having  a pretty sexist culture. Are women treated more inferior there than in other more 'westernized' countries?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kf8ni/i_am_julia_ioffe_senior_editor_of_the_new/cbobibl?context=5)|Yes! Omg, yes, yes, yes. Russia is still extremely sexist. I can write volumes on this, but, good lord. Basically, it's a matriarchy parading around as a macho patriarchy. That said, the wage gap between men and women is smaller in Russia than in the U.S. And once a year, on International Women's Day (March 8) Russian women get tons and tons of flowers -- I guess to make up for being treated as cooks/strippers with uteruses the rest of the year.
[Thanks for answering! Any awful experiences in your work you'd want to share?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kf8ni/i_am_julia_ioffe_senior_editor_of_the_new/cbocxh7?context=5)|Once, I had coffee with a political analyst. Then I made the mistake of trying to pay for the coffee, which confused him. He said, ""What are you doing?"" and ""Why?"" And I said, ""Because that's the rule: the journalist pays."" And he said, ""But you're not a journalist. You're a woman!""
[Do Vladimir Putin and the Russian government have complete, total, absolute control over this AMA?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kf8ni/i_am_julia_ioffe_senior_editor_of_the_new/cbobb87?context=5)|Oh, you bet.
[Do you think Putin is really this homophobic or is he just making a statement? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kf8ni/i_am_julia_ioffe_senior_editor_of_the_new/cbobcmy?context=5)|I don't think Putin is any more homophobic than most Russians, which is pretty homophobic -- Russians, like I said, are pretty ignorant about homosexuality and think it's abnormal). I also don't think it was his initiative. This law, unlike many, came up to the federal level after being introduced in cities around Russia, and Putin signed into law what the Duma gave him, which obviously signifies his approval: if he hadn't approved, it would've never made it out of the lower chamber of the Russian parliament. That said, the law reflects a tone set by Putin by bringing the Orthodox Church, a very conservative institution, increasingly not just into public life but into the government. It's all part of a pattern of looking for a more conservative, ""Russian"" national idea -- whatever that means. 
[Could you talk about some of the international initiatives have been killed - or can never be pursued - due to Russia's veto power in the UN?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kf8ni/i_am_julia_ioffe_senior_editor_of_the_new/cbobeed?context=5)|Russia kills anything in the UNSC that it thinks violates national sovereignty, not because they're such fighters for self-determination, but because they're afraid these measures will eventually be used on them, say, when they crack down on dissent.
[How fare the efforts of making Russia cease its support of the Assad regime?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kf8ni/i_am_julia_ioffe_senior_editor_of_the_new/cbobeed?context=5)|The efforts of making Putin stop supporting Assad are not going very well, in part because Russia is a big, nuclear power with a UN veto, and takes that very seriously (image-wise), so yelling at them and telling them to stop doesn't really do anything, just as it wouldn't work if someone did that with the U.S.
[What can and should we, as individuals, and our international politicians do about the Russian anti-LGBT Olympics that's more than just a symbolic gesture of frustration?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kf8ni/i_am_julia_ioffe_senior_editor_of_the_new/cbobeed?context=5)|As for the anti-gay stuff, that's your answer, too. We can get angry and pour vodka into the gutters all we want, but, ultimately, this is something Russia needs to work out on its own. After all, the vast majority of Russians (like over 70%) still see homosexuality as a disease or a psychiatric aberration. 
[Hey Julia! And thanks for your great article (all the previous ones as well\)! I live very close to StPete so I see how (wealthy\) Russian gays come over and be ""free"" even for a weekend. I feel so sad for them. I read a great article by Miriam Elder as well where she pointed out why this all is happening in Russia right now. Very scary. What is your opinion - can this all just go on? Can all this harassments &amp; violence just go on? Is it only happening cos Putin &amp; Kirill needs someone to blame? Today a silvermedalist dedicated his medal to his GLTB friends. Everything goes so fast, do you think that #boycottsochi will happen? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kf8ni/i_am_julia_ioffe_senior_editor_of_the_new/cbobpf4?context=5)|Miriam Elder is a close friend but also a brilliant journalist, so I recommend reading everything she writes.
 |As to your question, this is something Russians have to work out on their own. American pressure isn't going to change the minds of Vanya and Petya in some central Russian village that gays are freaks of nature. And look, America doesn't have the best history with this stuff either. We *just* repealed DOMA and still have a very, very long way to go, not just in terms of gay rights but general equality (see: gutting of the Voting Rights Act). We have a lot of work to do at home, too.
[Can you speak to Russia Today? They have a growing audience in the west, who seem unaware of their connections to Putin's Kremlin. What's your take on the objectivity, or trustworthiness of RT as a news source?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kf8ni/i_am_julia_ioffe_senior_editor_of_the_new/cbocy0v?context=5)|Russia Today was created and is still financed by the Kremlin. Their mission is not to bring objectivity, but to serve as ""a counterweight"" to the West. (Which, you'll agree, is weird for a news outlet.) Putin talks about RT's editorial policies as ""we."" So, no, RT is not a news source. It's a joke.
[Thank you for the response. That's my take too, but I figured I should get some perspective from a professional with actual experience.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kf8ni/i_am_julia_ioffe_senior_editor_of_the_new/cbod68d?context=5)|Lord, you only have to watch it to understand. Have you seen their segment, in the wake of Assange's sex charges, about how Sweden has become a U.S. colony? It referred to ""The United States of Swedamerica.""
[Here's a naive question: I know that you and the Forbes writer Mark Adomanis often disagree. My understanding of Russian politics is unsophisticated, though, so I have trouble grasping the specific faultlines of your ideological differences. How would you characterize his work as opposed to your own? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kf8ni/i_am_julia_ioffe_senior_editor_of_the_new/cbobw41?context=5)|Mark Adomanis is a very nice fellow. That said, he's never lived and worked in Russia, nor does he speak language. He is too credulous of what the Kremlin says. He is often counterintuitive for counterintuitiveness's sake. He is academic in the way that academics ignore the parts of reality that undermine their nice, abstract theory. That's about it, I guess.
[That makes a lot of sense. Thanks. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kf8ni/i_am_julia_ioffe_senior_editor_of_the_new/cbocisg?context=5)|NP.
[Is there something about Russian Culture/Society that makes the country  so prone to authoritarian dictatorship-esque regimes (Stalin, USSR, to Putin\)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kf8ni/i_am_julia_ioffe_senior_editor_of_the_new/cbobewa?context=5)|I think Stalin set the stage for Putin, and the czars set the stage for Stalin. If the czars taught Russians that they were eternal subjects to the holy emperor and his Church, Stalin drove home the notion by jailing and killing millions and millions of Soviets, of making people afraid not just to speak up and resist, but to trust each other. The scars of what he did are there, but they're fading in the generation born after the fall of the Soviet Union. I don't know that it's a cultural thing as much as it is hard, cruel historical training.
[What has living in Russia made you realize about US politics? I know that Rolling Stone's Matt Taibbi has said that it was pretty eye-opening.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kf8ni/i_am_julia_ioffe_senior_editor_of_the_new/cbocnyu?context=5)|Living in Russia made me romanticize America. It was a pretty rude awakening to come home to Newtown and the background check fail, the AP leak investigation, the NSA run completely amok, and to see that old white men are still obsessing about abortion. Sad Ioffe.
[Do you think the Times does accurate, fair reporting on Russia? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kf8ni/i_am_julia_ioffe_senior_editor_of_the_new/cbobdul?context=5)|The Times has a fantastic bureau in Moscow, staffed with wonderful, intelligent reporters. Can't say enough good things about them.
[You lived in Russia for a long time. Favorite vodka?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kf8ni/i_am_julia_ioffe_senior_editor_of_the_new/cbob97h?context=5)|Horseradish vodka. It's the best. 
[How have I never heard of this? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kf8ni/i_am_julia_ioffe_senior_editor_of_the_new/cbobakb?context=5)|They have it at most Russian restaurants. For best results, make sure to chase it with something savor: herring, lardo, something pickled. #fact.
[When you say that those who bear the scars of communism are being supplanted by subsequent generations, what are the implications of this? Does this give hope to the idea that people will be less tolerant of endemic corruption and oppression?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kf8ni/i_am_julia_ioffe_senior_editor_of_the_new/cboc27v?context=5)|Yes, exactly. The problem is that hope and fearlessness don't last forever. If the Russian state doesn't change itself to fit them, they'll either leave or become embittered and cynical, just like their parents and grandparents.
[Hey again! What do you feel about May6 prisoners? Do you think that they will get very long sentences for nothing? Is there any possibility that they will go free?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kf8ni/i_am_julia_ioffe_senior_editor_of_the_new/cboc99d?context=5)|Unfortunately, I doubt they will go free, and it breaks my heart: one of my very good friends, Maria Baronova, is among them. [Link to www.newrepublic.com](http://www.newrepublic.com/article/magazine/politics/105735/maria-baronova-anti-putin-activist)
[Your little dustup on MSNBC about Putin not being omnipotent(a surprisingly controversial assertion\) seems intuitively correct, but I was hoping you could go into a little more detail about the Russian 'power structure'.

It was recently announced that Khodorkovsky might be released as soon as 2014, do you expect that to happen and if so, what are the implications?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kf8ni/i_am_julia_ioffe_senior_editor_of_the_new/cbobgf4?context=5)|Nope. I hear they're now cobbling together a third set of charges. This is how Russia does things: slapdash, and without any grand strategy. Really, when they tried him in 2005, and the public opinion jury was still out on him -- Khodorkovsky was the worst of the worst in the 90s -- they should have given him 20, 30 years. By now, everyone would have forgotten. Instead, they keep brining it back into the spotlight, where it becomes increasingly apparent to everyone who has eyes that this is political.

Russia has mostly ignored China, while China has gobbled up energy markets in Central Asia. Russia always wanted to focus on Europe as a customer of its natural resources, in part because the Chinese drive a hard bargain and the Russians jack up their prices. Recently, though, we're seeing a new pivot in Russia toward the Chinese energy market. Smart, but very late.

The regular sysadmin, in all his genius, managed to break the spool of cat 5 that was neatly nestled in a box to allow for easy pulling. So he pulls out the whole roll to fix it. Spool looks similar to [this](http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51O3XkB1KFL._SX342_.jpg), but wound with cat5. Problem was that the top and bottom plastic pieces pulled apart separately, and now was causing issues.

Anyhow, next time he utters the words ""Is your hand small enough to fit in here?"" I'm going to lie. 20 minutes, a scraped up knuckle from the tight fit of squeezing it into the center of the spool, and his adamant refusal so give up and just mount it on some PVC pipe or a dowel, we finally managed to get it back together. 

Bonus: he probably just ruined the couple loops of wire that were being pinched as he tried to manhandle the halves back together, so that'll add some bonus fun down the line.

Added bonus: He also just cemented his status as ""that creepy loud guy"" to the interns we have on staff as he let loose with pretty much every swear word there is in those 20 minutes.

1kfdr4,1,2013-08-15,Anyone out there hiring?,[deleted],Seattle,https://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/1kfdr4/anyone_out_there_hiring/,"Hey Seattle,

I'm currently in the process of trying to move from St. Louis to Seattle this fall/winter and I was hoping you all might be able to point me in the right direction. I've visited Seattle a few times since I was a kid and I've always told myself it's where I wanted to live some day. Well, I'm 26, ready to move on from my current position and am certain now is the time.

I'm currently seeking employment in or around the Seattle area with the intention of having a job lined up prior to making the big move. A copy of [my resume can be found here](http://imgur.com/EQIfapZ) in a rough format. I've began applying to jobs in the area, but my concerns right now are a lack of connections in Seattle and employers hesitation to hire someone who does not live in the area at the time of applying.

Quick Background - I attended school for Business Communication and English with the intention of writing speeches for political campaigns. After a few internships and a major job in my field, I decided that it just wasn't for me. Luckily, I spent a good deal of time doing IT support for all the campaigns and that transitioned being hired at my current company, a small tech start up. Dealing with technology, I feel that I've found my calling. At my current position, I've advanced three times over the past 2.5 years and am now holding a leadership position that has me overseeing 8 employees full time. Unfortunately, I do not have the back end experience that I would like in IT and my knowledge of coding &amp; networking is relatively undeveloped. My hope is to begin attending night courses once I get settled in, with the hope of A) gaining more back end knowledge/experience and B) an MBA, focusing on technology management.

Shortcomings aside, I am an extremely hard working individual that has a short, but proven track record of strong leadership, communication and organizational skills. I'm hoping to find a job that requires the ability to understand and communicate technical concepts (possibly technical writing) or just any roles that require the ability to deal with technology and the end user, but I'm really open to anything (ESPECIALLY in the gaming industry.)

Thank you everyone and anyone who took the time to read this! If you have any questions, general advice or know of any potential leads, I would be extremely grateful. 

TLDR; Looking to move to Seattle, but need to find a job first. Short career but solid experience.

I've been sliding in and out of depressive episodes for years now. It nearly fucked over my second year of uni, and reached the lowest point in October of last year when I thought I was going to snap. It was genuinely the scariest, most miserable point in my life and I dread going back.

Since then I've been dealing well and improving. I passed third year with flying colours, got into a special course for next year and gained a summer internship in a field I really want to go into when I graduate. 

But all my uni friends left the city over the summer while I was doing my job, while all my friends back home got together every other day and enjoyed themselves like nothing else. And after those six lonely weeks were over and I managed to come home, everyone returned to the university to start the course again and all my friends are now too busy to do very much. I can't even leave the house very much, because we have a new puppy and it can't be left alone or taken anywhere yet.

1keq95,8,2013-08-15,How to convince boss that I want to quit internship?,kigzvlue,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1keq95/how_to_convince_boss_that_i_want_to_quit/,"The following is a x-post from /r/needadvice : http://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/1kemse/how_to_convince_boss_that_i_want_to_quit/

I currently work at an internship now at a very small startup. (The only employees are the two cofounders, CEO and COO.) The rest of the job is done by interns, including myself. While others, who are both college students, work as designer and publicist, I work as a coder. When I applied for this job, I was hoping to learn programming on the iPhone while getting mentored. It was perhaps a productive way to spend my summer after graduating high school. As it turns out, my job is pretty much debugging code my boss (CEO) wrote. Whenever I encounter a problem, my boss tells me to just Google it, even after I have. He occasionally takes interest in my work when he isn't busy, but otherwise he's prioritizes his own work.


I thought keeping my internship was better than quitting and potentially squandering time this summer, until recently a friend offered me a job. While taking a break from his engineer job at a reputable social media company this summer, he began working on a personal project. He wanted some website design and development help, and wanted me to learn Rails and even promised to help me whenever I got stuck in coding. We are neighbors and we've already comfortable with each other - often our rants about technology went late into the night. He urged me to quit my job and just join him.


I certainly got excited by such prospects. He's already got plenty of coding experience and time to help me. While I could stay at my job without any significant contributions, helping my friend's project would enable me to learn  how to make my own projects from scratch. Besides, the communication would be much better; while there is seldom casual non-work communication at my current workplace, the communication between my friend and myself would hardly see any friction.


I'm certain that I want to quit my current internship. But I don't know how. Outside the workplace, my boss and I almost always go out for lunch together and we chat. We also once had a small party to welcome me. It is quite difficult for me to inform my consent to quit this job. I already have notified my consideration, hoping that my boss will allow me to leave. However, he urged me to stay until I leave a month later as I intended at the beginning of the job (which would coincide with the time college starts). He said he had intended to delegate some more work for me, indicating the choices of iPhone apps I can work on to fix bugs he wrote. He suggested to work on Rails during my free time. I said I'll think about it. Meanwhile, he's expecting me to work on another app he began.


As this job was my first internship, I was interested in this job at the beginning of this summer. However, my enthusiasm waned, and now spending time at work drains my energy further. I get paid, but money matters less to me than satisfaction. I am eager to quit now, but how can I convince my boss?"
1keq32,3,2013-08-15,I [25F] just broke my engagement with [25M] because I feel he is not ready to get married and go through the activities needed during engagement that lead to a good marriage built on a strong foundation. Please help me figure out if this is the right choice.,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1keq32/i_25f_just_broke_my_engagement_with_25m_because_i/,"*Basics*


We have dated for 5 years and been engaged for 3 months. The marriage is (was?) to be in Spring 2014, right after my graduation. We semi live together, his flat is in in the same building as mine and I sleep over 5 nights a week, and overall have a happy relationship. ***I*** have no doubt this is the man ***I*** want to marry, but I feel ***he*** doesn't know if ***he*** actually wants to 'wife me'.


*Issue*


He and I need to plan many things as from now and our proposed wedding date such as...

* plan and do a religious and court marriage plus hold the wedding reception

* get jobs (and I also need an internship pre-job as it's required by my degree programme)

* get an apartment

* meet his family 

* finish university (he is done in less than a week. I am done right before the wedding)

So far we have date ranges, and that's it. It is pulling teeth to get him to talk about this stuff. We are suppose to meet his parents this Sunday to discuss. They want details that we do not have. When I try to get him to discuss what he wants from a *wife* rather than just a girlfriend he doesn't have much to say. He feels very little will change, and what will change can be taken/worked through as it comes. I feel the opposite. If I press the issue he gets a severe headache and cannot discuss things for at least a day. I feel he cannot handle this type of stuff, so I'll do it... but how can I do this stuff if I do not know what it is?

So far all I have from him is that he wants me to work and take care of the house since my income will most likely be at least 10k less than his. In return he'll do the budgeting and take out the trash. Oh, and deal with buggies. :) Anything else? He rather us just talk about it as it comes. He doesn't want roles or anything. Oh, and I'm suppose to go to a family gathering once per month. This stresses me a lot. Does he want a skinny wife? Does he want a career getter wife? Does he want me to cook him work lunches from scratch? No idea. I can *guess* what he wants and I offer my guesses, but this isn't communication in my eyes. 

It's very annoying. If I try to bring up wedding planning he doesn't want to hear it either. I feel he hasn't done anything engagement-y besides have me meet some of his family as ""the girl he'd like to marry"" vs just some random girlfriend. There's no ring cause we cannot afford it, but when I asked for a 10$ gift? Yeah... he forgot about it. I reminded him a few times.. but I then let it go. It's not that he doesn't do things for me, he's very caring and generous, but I wanted him to give me a motion may it be a letter or a necklace or a special book saying ""Heeeeey GreenBlossom I want to marry you with all my heart, we be together 5eva yo."". He only even asked me to marry him because I gave him a timeline, I told him by our 5 year anniversary we need to be engaged or I'm gone. Well, a few days after the anniversary after that and me reminding him that I meant what I said.. he asked. He asked a simple question in the living room while I was playing a video game. There was no special words just ""err I'm suppose to do this err will you marry me? :)."". 

But all of this is small issues I don't care about. I just realized while talking to him once again about marriage stuff that he has not done one thing (besides family introduction) to show he wants to marry me. I can say with 100% truth that not one action coming from him has EVER shown me he wants me as his wife. Picture a guy shrugging and saying meh sounds like the best option since we want to live together with family being mad meh you're not a giant troll from a fantasy book, guess you work meh. That's what I'm dealing with here. Add in a guy holding his hand to a wall saying he cannot hear this cause he's getting a severe headache (+100 other avoidance techniques go here like I'm tired or I have homework or I'm busy or not now or I need to do dishes or I just will be quiet and not respond at all etc). Also add him him running off to escapism-video games the moment the girl shuts up. 


*Aftermath*


So I left. I told him that I need him to want this and I need to feel I'm not forcing him into it therefore we are no longer engaged. I told him that I love him and want him to be my husband, but I need him to feel ready for it. Lastly I said that I feel he isn't ready for this, and the only way he'll take me seriously is if I left him for one week. One week no contact. This hurts. He is my best friend. On a practical level he is my alarm clock, my blanket, and my confident. I'm use to cooking for him. I'm use to doing many things with him. To go one week without him is simply a decrease in my quality of life. But, I don't know what to do. I told him no more discussions with his parents till the week is over and he has some things to say. I feel he and I aren't ready for the talk they want to have with us since he isn't ready to be engaged. 

I feel so weak and powerless. I feel like he won't marry me at all now. I just don't know what to do. Did I make the right choice? I feel like going back to his room right now and just falling asleep in my bed. I want to just avoid it all and pretend we don't have all these pressure issues like he does.. 

 
*Questions*

Where do I go from here? Is the one week no contact et all a good idea? How can we communicate better? 


**TL;DR**

My boyfriend (ex fiance???) has issues talking about marriage and future planing stuff. I feel there's no way to talk to him or have him take me seriously as he uses advoident techniques and he knows I'm weak so I'll always come back to him. I just left his house and enacted one week break/no contact/broke the enagement event stuff to make him take me seriously. Was this a good idea, or a bad idea? "
1kepc6,27,2013-08-15,Is it wrong for me [21M] to value my potential career over the relationship with my girlfriend [20f] of 2 years?,joborgirl,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1kepc6/is_it_wrong_for_me_21m_to_value_my_potential/,"My girlfriend and I are both going into our fourth and final year of college. We've been dating for 2 years and will have been dating for 3 years by the time this school year is up. 

I just finished up a very prestigious internship and am coming back home. I got an offer from this internship and have a few months to decide/apply to other places. This offer is very very prestigous, you have all heard of this company. I really really really enjoyed working here and would in a heartbeat spend the rest of my life doing this for a living, and the compensation is really good, like 120k+/year immediately out of undergrad with tons of room for upward mobility.

The problem is this offer, along with many other offers I might get if I applied to more places would put me on the other side of the country, away from my girlfriend. This wouldn't be a temporary thing like my internship, this would be permanent, me moving to wherever I go.

During the internship we had some issues with the distance, it got to her pretty bad, and because of such a prolonged lack of contact (3 months) other than skyping, texting, and phone calls, she questioned the value in staying together pretty often, especially considering our positions put us in a place that there is a strong possibility we will not be together after school ends. 

Is it wrong for me to focus on my career, and focus on what I can do to better it rather than staying back, and taking a possibly major blow to my career and quality of life, and even happiness at my place of work if it means staying with her?

1kemse,3,2013-08-15,How to convince boss that I want to quit internship?,kigzvlue,needadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/1kemse/how_to_convince_boss_that_i_want_to_quit/,"I currently work at an internship now at a very small startup. (The only employees are the two cofounders, CEO and COO.) The rest of the job is done by interns, including myself. While others, who are both college students, work as designer and publicist, I work as a coder. When I applied for this job, I was hoping to learn programming on the iPhone while getting mentored. It was perhaps a productive way to spend my summer after graduating high school. As it turns out, my job is pretty much debugging code my boss (CEO) wrote. Whenever I encounter a problem, my boss tells me to just Google it, even after I have. He occasionally takes interest in my work when he isn't busy, but otherwise he's prioritizes his own work.


I thought keeping my internship was better than quitting and potentially squandering time this summer, until recently a friend offered me a job. While taking a break from his engineer job at a reputable social media company this summer, he began working on a personal project. He wanted some website design and development help, and wanted me to learn Rails and even promised to help me whenever I got stuck in coding. We are neighbors and we've already comfortable with each other - often our rants about technology went late into the night. He urged me to quit my job and just join him.


I certainly got excited by such prospects. He's already got plenty of coding experience and time to help me. While I could stay at my job without any significant contributions, helping my friend's project would enable me to learn  how to make my own projects from scratch. Besides, the communication would be much better; while there is seldom casual non-work communication at my current workplace, the communication between my friend and myself would hardly see any friction.


I'm certain that I want to quit my current internship. But I don't know how. Outside the workplace, my boss and I almost always go out for lunch together and we chat. We also once had a small party to welcome me. It is quite difficult for me to inform my consent to quit this job. I already have notified my consideration, hoping that my boss will allow me to leave. However, he urged me to stay until I leave a month later as I intended at the beginning of the job (which would coincide with the time college starts). He said he had intended to delegate some more work for me, indicating the choices of iPhone apps I can work on to fix bugs he wrote. He suggested to work on Rails during my free time. I said I'll think about it. Meanwhile, he's expecting me to work on another app he began.


As this job was my first internship, I was interested in this job at the beginning of this summer. However, my enthusiasm waned, and now spending time at work drains my energy further. I get paid, but money matters less to me than satisfaction. I am eager to quit now, but how can I convince my boss?

It is my dream to become a Media Planner/Buyer and work for an an agency. A class I took in school last semester (Media Planning and Buying) really opened my eyes and allowed me to have fun and enjoy working hard. We were put through very realistic simulations and giving real world type projects.

But anyways, I have been having trouble finding internships directed towards being a media planner/buyer. Only a few I have found had the position title of Media Planning Intern.

So I was wondering if there are other internships that could help get me into this field and good places to look for internships in the advertising world (websites and such).

Also, would it be worth it to find an internship with a media outlet as someone who would sell media if I want to become the person who buys it? Or should I keep trekking and look for the one I want. 

Any other internship insight and tips would be fantastic as well!

1kipol,2,2013-08-16,Career advice needed: boss is playing reality show with me,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1kipol/career_advice_needed_boss_is_playing_reality_show/,"TL,DR: In company for almost 2 years, got indicated to better position. Working with new boss for 6 months now, still no hire – he keeps saying I’m in “evaluation process”. What should I do?


I’ve been working as an intern for 1,5 years in the same company. During this time, I’ve received extremely positive feedbacks both from superiors and peers, and managed to build quite a reputation among coworkers. 

The thing is: I do business intelligence for a tech company, and our marketing department is actually abroad. The only local position for marketing is intern. Considering this, I was planning to look for a “real job” mid July (since I’ll graduate this December) when my boss told me he was making all he could to create a position for me. Which included the possibility of relocating me in the holding that owns our company (M&amp;A is quite recent, so we’re not fully integrated. Next year we’ll join them in a new office, which will also be close to home)

So he made an agreement with the new MKT Director at the holding: that I’d be working for both of them for a while, and if the guy liked me, I’d be hired.  

I’ve been this guy’s bitch since March. Been working up to 4h past my shift (hey, I still have to attend college at night!!) and recently he demanded I moved to his office – 40km away from home, which means basically a 2h drive in the morning and another 2h in the night. 

When I said I wouldn’t go as an intern, that my condition would have to change, he said I was being evaluated and this would count. Grand finale to the conversation: he threatened to open my position to the market. So I went back to my old boss and said I wasn’t too confident, and was considering leaving the company. He spoke to our CEO, who personally asked me to stay and endorsed me as a great professional to new boss. New boss said I’d be hired in November and offered me a notebook, so I could work from both offices. Silly me took the offer.

Now I’m not getting any extra money, but my commitment to the company keeps growing. Also, the energy I’m investing is huge. In the other hand, he’s not very present (dude, then why do I have to stay in your office?!) and plus, he’s been showing some more and more authoritarian behavior.

The cherry on top happened today: he said I’m gonna have to go through HR selection processes, make tests and have an interview, so they can consider me among other applicants. He asked me how I feel about it and I had no much reaction, just said I was happy the company had such an elaborate assessment and that in the end, if I didn’t have the company’s profile it wouldn’t be good for any of us (WTF, aye?!)

Am I being too stubborn to get FUCKING pissed at this? I never heard of a job application that lasts 6 months, really. This is not a damn reality show.

Should I quit? If so, how should I do it?

1kie9l,9,2013-08-16,I'm Stuck,sad_lawyer,whatsbotheringyou,https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsbotheringyou/comments/1kie9l/im_stuck/,"SO. I've been depressed for probably two or three years now because I hate my work. And not in the, ""Duh, everyone hates their job"" kind of way; but in the ""Before I started taking Lexapro I cried every day on the way to work and at work because being a lawyer sucks the lifeblood out of me"" kind of way. Because of the depression, my work suffered at my last job - not the quality necessarily, but I'm so incredibly burned out that I just wasn't billing the hours I used to. This rendered me obsolete to my boss (after six years of loyalty) and I was let go. I had been looking for a new job for a while, but was OK where I was because I knew the people and the work and could kind of be on auto-pilot. I was taking my time so as to find THE job, not A job. Of course, being let go changed that plan drastically and I, essentially, had to take a job that I really didn't want. The people at the new job think I am dumb and I am treated like an intern rather than a functioning attorney with almost ten years of experience. I'm still looking for THE job but can't find anything - I've looked within the legal field and have applied to lots of jobs outside of the field and can't seem to get people to look past the fact that I have a JD. I feel like they see my resume and think, ""she's a lawyer, she should go be a lawyer.""

A friend and I recently both applied for an in-house counsel job. Which she got. On the one hand, I am so very happy for her because she's still at my old firm (which is no picnic) so I am glad she gets to escape. On the other hand, I am so insanely jealous. I have been trying to find THE job for the last five years and have come up empty. 

So here I sit. Still filling out useless applications for jobs I'll never even get an interview for. Still depressed. Still burned out. Working for people who think I'm an idiot and feeling so incredibly sorry for myself that I might cry. It's so awful to know exactly what the problem is in your life and be powerless to fix it.  "
1kic0p,2,2013-08-16,Long time depression/suicidal tendencies suddenly hit with divorce and a get out now. SAHM to toddler.,breakingupTA,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1kic0p/long_time_depressionsuicidal_tendencies_suddenly/,"I've had serious mental health issues most of my life.

This is just the event that broke the camels back; I've thought of killing myself before but never this tether to reality and my life has been severed.

My mom often has to take my young son to her house to watch him because of my severe depression, I'm unable to take care of him right now.

My husband and I have been married for coming up on four years (actually, our anniversary is in five days.) We've had our share of problems, but things we've always managed to work through.

Tuesday, he told me, totally as a shock, he doesn't love me anymore and that he hasn't in a long time. He doesn't want to continue the marriage or get counseling together. We actually slept on it and talked about it Wednesday morning.


That morning, he told me the things I've done wrong, and he accepted blame for some things. Mostly to him it comes down to ""not working well together"" but before this, we had ups and downs but nothing that seemed unfixable. We were fine now. He said he can't take it anymore. He doesn't know HOW to love me. That hurt so, so much...

but he did something wrong. Something you shouldn't do to someone who is emotionally unstable. He told me he CAN love me. That we'll be stubborn and work through this. He rubbed my back and held my hand. He told me we will work on this and make it right for our son.

I go out to dinner with my best friend. By the time I'm back, he told me he lied to me earlier and he just can't work on this marriage anymore. I've never felt so low. I can't even begin to describe it. I felt like he could have literally stabbed my heart and it would feel about the same. There is no WAY he's going to hurt me like this! That night I took quite a few pills just to ease the pain. The next day he said such hurtful things I hit my head into a concrete wall and pulled out wads of my hair. 

Things have gotten worse, of course. He's so cold. It's not the divorce but how cold he is that kills me. He doesn't acknowledge that I'm still in love with him, so he should be a bit kinder even if we are to split up and not make it work. We had passionate sex on Monday. There was no hint at all of a problem in the marriage. He insists it isn't someone else, but just recently he had an intern flirting with him but he took it to his boss because she was harassing him via work email.

Me: stay at home mom. No substantial income. No car. No place to go (my mom is a hoarder in her spare bedroom, no room. Son is fine there. Has baby room.). Some college, no job experience. No insurance to help with medication or counseling. 

I truly do not have any help for myself or my son. This has taken my severe depression to a new level. 

It wasn't a bad marriage that I should at least be optimistic about leaving. This was a fairly good marriage with a man I was/am totally in love with. It hurts me so much. His coldness is eventually what will end this for me.

I constantly fantasize about suicide now. The only thing that is stopping me is lack of courage. I didnt know where he went the other day, left in the middle of the night and asked a friend if he stayed there. The husband/wife team (who have had it out for me a bit, frenemies) decided to block me JUST BECAUSE I said ""Did (name) stay there last night?"" We'd been friends for six years. Sent my husband screenshot proof that is all I asked. 

I'm so bad that even the friend thing made me want to die. Everyone hears this diluted story of what actually happened with us. He stays out until 3 am partying and stuff and all of a sudden I call him at 2 am (when he was supposed to be home at 10) and I'm the bad guy and the c razy insecure wife. Hello. You're in your mid thirties, not 21. 

Everything is reminding me of what I should have done years ago before I had my child. I know that I am linked to him now, but it's hard to think when people just tell you that you should stay alive for your child. He's an amazing reason, but I feel like I have to suffer just for that reason.

I'm in a bad place. This has driven my elderly grandfather to be so upset (my divorce) that he is anxious and needs consoling. I'm consoling him for something I am grieving myself.


I'm not sure if I make a lot of sense. I typed this quickly.

I'm currently undecided as to whether I want to go down a software engineering career path, or a security/Information Assurance career path. I'm leaning more towards SE. Would the 4011 and 4012 certs be worth putting on a resume for a SE job search?  So far none of the SE job postings I've seen ask for any type of security background or credentials.

Would I be better served to just work on a personal project instead of getting the credentials?  I'm already doing an internship, but it's not related to security."

Met a girl on OKC. She lives in NYC, I live in New Haven. When we started talking, she was going through a bunch of things - illness, apartment hunt, etc. so after a few messages on OKC, I said I'd come up to NYC, but she delayed and did so for the next couple of weekends. That's fine, she gave me her name and phone number and told me to call her.

For the next three or so weeks, we'd talk on the phone every day into the wee hours of the night, watch shows together, play games, etc. She disabled her OKC account, so I did too. It was fun. I started to grow really fond of her, and I like to think she felt the same way. She went on a trip to visit her family for a few days. When she came back, she moved into her new place that had terrible connectivity to her phone, but she'd call or ask me to call whenever she went out. Otherwise, we talked on fb chat.

Anywho, last Wednesday she restarted an internship that's very intense. She didn't reply to my messages, then last Friday she messaged me saying sorry and that she's swamped with work. I've sent her a few fb messages and a text since then but I haven't heard a word from her.

So it's been a full week. Options are A) She's really busy and is going full radio silence to focus (which is fine, but I wish she'd told me); B) she's not interested anymore and cut me off cold turkey (which is also fine, but I think I'd like an explanation); C) something bad happened, and my neurosis-filled upbringing is bringing old fears to the forefront.

I guess my main question is: Do other people do that? If life takes over, do you suddenly go completely silent? I'm a busy guy too but I take the time to reply to people.

1khsql,5,2013-08-16,Welding Simulators - What do you guys think?,Aradalth,Welding,https://www.reddit.com/r/Welding/comments/1khsql/welding_simulators_what_do_you_guys_think/,"Hi, my name is Henry, and I've been a summer intern at a cool company called 123certification Inc. They currently design and sell welding simulators.


I was just posting here to try and get some views and opinions about whether current welders of all different levels of serious (hobbyists, experienced welders, teachers and instructors) think this is a cool concept that you might be interested in, that you consider a constructive innovation that will improve welder training and that might garner more interest in young people to become welders by profession. Currently, 123certification's product allows you to ""virtually"" weld using 5 of the different processes including GMAW, SMAW, GTAW, FCAW and MCAW. Basically how it works is that you have a real weld torch attached to a machine with a screen, you put on a real welding mask that has 3D goggles built in, and you see yourself in a welding training room, and are able to practice welding with 9 different welding assemblies (more are being developed) including the T-joint, butt joint, lap joint in all positions.



Basically the concept of the simulator is to allow new welders to practice and learn in a safe and comfortable environment, and allow the college or program that is teaching them to conserve on materials and energy. So it is both a money saver and a tool that makes welding seem more accessible to young people. It is only getting better and more refined everyday, but it currently focuses on the basics and to teach the hand-eye coordination and manual dexterity required for all good welders. It is meant to build a strong foundation (and make the student feel comfortable) before proceeding to real and more complex welding. It also has built in a powerful instructor guidance tool that allows instructors to set up welds and create a learning program designed specifically for each student. It also gives extensive feedback on each aspect of a student's weld to show them where they need to improve.

I'm coming to these forums as a young person going into first year university, and I wouldn't be doing so if I didn't honestly think this is a very cool idea. I've been told that there is a large shortage of new welders worldwide, and I think this could be a way to garner new interest. I know that welding is a fundamental profession for human infrastructure and projects and robots will never be able to replace human welders, especially in cramped or on-the-fly locations like welding repairs on oil pipelines or underwater.

What do you guys think about this? Would you consider trying it yourself? Recommending it to new students? "
1khqac,11,2013-08-16,Another Feminist writing about Women of Color in Mainstream Feminism...,GenderEqualityKing,MensRights,https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/1khqac/another_feminist_writing_about_women_of_color_in/,"When women of color speak out about the structural racism that has been reproduced within mainstream feminism – as occurred when women of color like Flavia Dzodan and brownfemipower spoke out about Hugo Schwyzer – they are typically met with exhortations not to reveal divisions within the ranks of women.  To remain in the feminist club, we are expected not to betray our gender in favor of our race.  The fact that we can’t separate those parts of ourselves even if we wanted to is conveniently overlooked.

This superficial solidarity benefits the few to the detriment of the many, a total bastardization of the Industrial Workers of the World’s classic call to solidarity, “An injury to one is an injury to all.” (It is pertinent to note that the Wobblies were unique among US unions in the early 20th Century in organizing across race, class, gender, immigration status, and industry.)  While the stifling of women of color’s voices may help to advance the concerns and careers of a select few, it does not improve the conditions of women in general.

The calls for pseudo-solidarity are representative of a strain of feminism that exalts individual achievement and self-actualization.  This is the feminism of leaning in to unpaid internships, of obsessing over whether some women can have it all while ignoring the vast majority of women who are struggling just to have enough.  It’s the feminism about which opting-in and opting-out trend pieces are written, the only feminism that makes it into the mainstream media.  Overwhelmingly, it’s a feminism by and for middle-class, educated white women.

That this exclusionary feminism should have co-opted the language of solidarity is infuriating to me because I believe that true solidarity is what feminism needs, not as a way to stave off criticism, but as a tool to achieve our collective liberation.  In a brilliant essay at Black Girl Dangerous, Asam Ahmad quotes Sara Ahmed defining solidarity: “Solidarity does not assume that our struggles are the same struggles, or that our pain is the same pain, or that our hope is for the same future. Solidarity involves commitment, and work, as well as the recognition that even if we do not have the same feelings, or the same lives, or the same bodies, we do live on common ground.”

Over the past few days, I have seen many white feminists respond to #SolidarityIsForWhiteWomen by pledging to listen and learn.  This is welcome and needed humility, and a step to achieving solidarity, but listening and learning is not enough.  The work Ahmed speaks of requires more.  After a requisite period of listening and learning, some mainstream white feminists might start writing and talking more about women of color, but in so doing, they will continue to drown out women of color speaking for themselves.

It seems that, if I'm not mistaken, that the consensus on this sub-reddit is that if you are hoping to work in industry, then it is more prudent to enter the workforce as early as possible, as to get more experience and move up to more senior positions. (I.e. Internships). 

In this vain, the costs of pursuing a PhD or MsC in CS (I.e. time) for those not interested in Academia, outweigh the limited benefits in career advancement gained through the extra schooling.

I am current 20 years old and about to start my junior year of college. This past March, I lost my father due to a form of leukemia and my mother, sister, and I have all experienced some hardships. I haven't smoked since June 21st as I have come to the conclusion that I dont like not being able to think straight and have not smoked in a while! Before I last smoked, I had cut down to once a week and that was going on for a month before that so from May 20 - June 21 I probably smoked around 4 times to slowly cut down instead of quitting cold turkey. I moved home for the summer and that really helped in terms of me quitting.

We have met all the requirements for the club, which are: 1) Student leaders, which we have. 2) Teacher sponsor, which we have. 3) Mission Statement, which we have. 

While other clubs just get signed and approved within a week, our club has been blocked for many months by our superintendent, and we need advice on where to go next. 

We have a lot of students who want to join the club, and we have started to circulate a petition to get students to show support for the club. We also know that, due to the Equal Access Act, the school cannot legally stop our club from starting, but we want to avoid legal action at all costs. 

Our principle is the one who has done all the talking with the superintendent, but we don't feel he is really pushing her to get the club started. We have met with him repeatedly about the club, and we have asked for the status on the club many times, but it always the same thing. 

Has anyone else gone through similar roadblocks, and how did you overcome them? 

**Update:** What we decided to do was first write letters to the Principle and Superintendent that hinted at legal action and told them that we were serious about the club. 

The letter we sent to the principle is as follows: 

""Hello (Principle's name here), 

We understand that there is pressure against the club forming. While we have no clear indication of who is behind the pressure, we would like to send them a letter explaining our reasoning behind the club, and why we think it is important. We believe that the person behind the pressure is (Superintendent here), however, we are not 100% positive. Is it (Superintendent here) who we need to address the letter to, or should we address it to someone else? 

We trust that you have been on the right side of convincing whoever it is against it to allow us to start the club; however, we feel that providing the rationale and personal impact from the students who want to start the club would be greatly beneficial to helping us get the club started. 


Thank you for your time,

**The letter to our superintendent**

""Dear (Superintendent here),
 
We are students at Topsail High School, and we are trying passionately to form a Gay-Straight Alliance within our school. 

Even in today's society, high school is extremely difficult for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender teenagers. In fact, studies have shown that 90% of LGBT teens have faced bullying due to their sexual orientation. 
Bullying, especially when coupled with the complexities and challenges of being an LGBT has contributed greatly to the increased rate of depression, low self-confidence, self-harm, and in the worst of cases, suicide. LGBT teens are up to 4 times as likely to commit suicide than an average teenager, a statistic that is both alarming and sad. 

It is for these reasons and many more, that we are so passionate about establishing a gay straight alliance within the school. A club such as this would prove monumental to the well-being of LGBT students.
Our club would focus on supporting the students involved in the clubs, while stridently protecting their right to privacy. Because sexuality is such a confusing and complicated thing, having the ability to open up to peers and discuss the matter would allow students to fully understand their sexuality and come to terms with it, which would cut out a lot of the stress associated with being a Gender/Sexual minority. 

It is commonly accepted that a form of therapy is to hold group discussions; places where people who face similar issues can freely discuss their experiences, and others can give advice on how they handled the situation. By having this in the high school, students who get bullied because of their sexuality would be able to turn to a community of support, rather than turning to self-harm. 

We understand the concern on how such a club would be viewed by the community; however, the freedom of speech guarantees all speech, not just popular speech. Additionally, we feel that a large majority of students would be supportive of the LGBT community, and most of the ones who aren't would not feel that such a club reflects poorly on the school system. However, such a club being blocked may reflect badly within both communities. I'm fact, quite a few students who attended Boys' Nation said that they would not feel comfortable moving to a place that did not have such a club when it was mentioned that we were in the process of starting it.

The Equal Access Act was passed in 1984 to ensure that all clubs would have the opportunity to form at public schools. The law was originally passed due to several school districts not allowing religious schools, but the act eventually was used to support Gay-Straight Alliances. So, even if parents do complain, which some will either way, you can remind them that administrators of the school are legally required to allow the club to form, and failure to do so is illegal. Essentially, by allowing the club, you would not be held responsible to the parents or the court system. 

**Also, by not allowing the club to start, there is a possibility that news agencies will get a hold of the story, and run with it. Discrimination, especially LGBT discrimination, and especially within schools are very popular topics in society, and news organizations would fight for the story, I'm sure. Bad press is not good for the school system, and there are many students like those at Boys' Nation who would not feel comfortable about moving to the school system if such a club were not allowed to form.

We deeply appreciate you taking the time to read this letter. Is there anything else that we need to do before starting the club? 

**We will begin work shortly on a petition in favor of the club to prove the public support for it, which we will distribute to friends, family, and general members of the community to sign. 

Thank you, 

(Names here)""

**These two paragraphs are controversial within our group of five, so we are talking to quite a few people on whether or not we should include them. We all agree on the rest of the letter though. We also replaced LGBT with LGBTQ and GSM, and some other minor changes. 

We're in the process of drafting letters that we will send to the NC ACLU and letters that we will send to sympathetic news organizations if we do not get permission for the club by our set deadline, which is September 15th. I also have a friend who's an intern for a state supreme court justice and has lots of connections with the media, democratic party, and ACLU, who has agreed to help us out if we pass the deadline.

1kgu3v,3,2013-08-15,I need advice on how to get a Gay-Straight alliance started at my school.,[deleted],lgbt,https://www.reddit.com/r/lgbt/comments/1kgu3v/i_need_advice_on_how_to_get_a_gaystraight/,"A few friends and I have been trying for ten months now to get a Gay-Straight Alliance started at our school. We have met all the requirements for the club, which are: 1) Student leaders, which we have. 2) Teacher sponsor, which we have. 3) Mission Statement, which we have. 

While other clubs just get signed and approved within a week, our club has been blocked for many months by our superintendent, and we need advice on where to go next. 

We have a lot of students who want to join the club, and we have started to circulate a petition to get students to show support for the club. We also know that, due to the Equal Access Act, the school cannot legally stop our club from starting, but we want to avoid legal action at all costs. 

Our principle is the one who has done all the talking with the superintendent, but we don't feel he is really pushing her to get the club started. We have met with him repeatedly about the club, and we have asked for the status on the club many times, but it always the same thing. 

Has anyone else gone through similar roadblocks, and how did you overcome them? 

**Update:** What we decided to do was first write letters to the Principle and Superintendent that hinted at legal action and told them that we were serious about the club. 

The letter we sent to the principle is as follows: 

""Hello (Principle's name here), 

We understand that there is pressure against the club forming. While we have no clear indication of who is behind the pressure, we would like to send them a letter explaining our reasoning behind the club, and why we think it is important. We believe that the person behind the pressure is (Superintendent here), however, we are not 100% positive. Is it (Superintendent here) who we need to address the letter to, or should we address it to someone else? 

We trust that you have been on the right side of convincing whoever it is against it to allow us to start the club; however, we feel that providing the rationale and personal impact from the students who want to start the club would be greatly beneficial to helping us get the club started. 


Thank you for your time, 

(The five of us had our names listed here)""

Not all of the credit, though. I deserve most of it. I worked my ass off.  

That being said, based on advice I read here, plus a growing interest in possibly getting a Ph.D., I quit my job in IT at the end of my sophomore year, and was lucky enough to get a job as a research assistant. I did that all summer, and throughout the course of the next year. The summer after my junior year, I got an internship with a pretty big tech company (I'll just say you've probably all owned / currently own products made by us and leave it there).  My internship ends tomorrow, and yesterday I was offered (and accepted) a full-time job once I graduate.  

Over 8 months to graduation, and I'm already set.  It's been a great ride...can't wait for the next school year, and then onward to industry!"

Information
-I will be attending the University of South Carolina.
-I am going to major in either Business-Management or International Business
-I am not on any financial aid due to scholarships and my parents preparing quite well for paying for my education.

Questions
-Should I join a Fraternity? (Growing up with 3 sisters I have always missed out on a sense of brotherhood, and this is why fraternities appeal to me. But I am not sure I want to commit that much of my life towards something I am not 100% about.)
-Does a High GPA or internships get you a job after graduation? 
-Should I take the time to join clubs and sign up for a lot of extra curricular activities?
-Should I major in business-management or international business?

-None of my friends or anyone from my school is going to the same school as me, and I am quite a shy person, I'm not weird or awkward or anything I just don't put myself out there. I was just wondering what is the best way to make friends and connect with complete strangers?

1kgo3n,5,2013-08-15,I hate college and I don't want to go back.,[deleted],self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/1kgo3n/i_hate_college_and_i_dont_want_to_go_back/,"Exactly one year and two months ago, I had to come to a decision that would impact my life for the next 4 years, possibly forever. After much deliberation, I narrowed my options down to three.

University of Washington. ($35K/yr)

University of California at Santa Barbara. ($10K/yr)

University of California at San Diego. ($5K/yr)

The reason why I wanted to go to **UW** so badly was because it seemed like a funner, less shitty version of the place I grew up in: [Sunnyvale, CA](http://a.abcnews.com/images/Business/ap_apple_headquarters_nt_130605_wmain.jpg). Actually, Seattle is the exact opposite of shitty. [Seattle is *awesome*](http://media.royalcaribbean.com/content/shared_assets/images/ports/hero/SEA_01.jpg). I absolutely hated the culture (or lack thereof) in my hometown, but I wanted to program for a living. Going to school in Seattle was the perfect fit. It has culture and jobs. It was my top school. If money was no object, I would have gone there in a heartbeat.

**Santa Barbara** was an option because of its social life, its [alumni](http://www.saurik.com/), and the [campus](http://engineering.ucsb.edu/images/news/ucsb-campus-aerial.jpg) (and the abundance of attractive girls). But mainly because of the [CCS](http://www.ccs.ucsb.edu/welcome/). Just seemed like the perfect college experience.

**UC San Diego** was an option because it was the cheapest.

Guess which school I ended up choosing.

_________

Now, here we are, one year later. Going back to school in a month.

The reason why I hate UCSD so much is probably due to a multitude of things, but I narrowed it down to this:

* Location
* I have no friends there
* The lack of culture

Now I know you guys are thinking, ""wow, this guy must be an asshole if he made no friends at the school"". It actually had more to do with the fact that I did not live in a dorm my freshman year and something very bad that happened with some former friends that I made there.

The lack of culture is a big thing for because I grew up in a cultureless location (Silicon Valley), and I was expecting college to be an escape from that. Being deprived of that kind of sucks.

You might suggest transferring, but that's off the table. My grades were absolutely horrible, too. I think I got a 2.5GPA and I failed one of my classes. This is mostly due to the things that happened with the former friends of mine. It made me borderline suicidal. If you have ever been in that position, I'm sure you'd understand why my grades were so shitty. If you're planning on killing yourself then grades at University don't really scope.

And it isn't even like I'm a lazy fuck, either. In high school, I got straight A's, I was a year ahead of everyone else in math (in a Cupertino HS, mind you), and I got 800's on all math-related SAT tests, 5's on all math-related tests. Even my AP Computer Science teacher said I had ""leet coding skills"".

I also got an internship and a $60k/yr job offer at a Silicon Valley startup whose technologies are used in the products of Microsoft, DuckDuckGo, Ask.com, Nokia and Sprint.

I know dropping out seems like the stupidest thing in the world to do, especially at a good university where I'm paying **$5K a year**, but I HATE IT THERE. I literally cried of joy when I was in the car driving away from that horrible place, finally free for 3 months.

What the fuck do I do?"

I will be a senior this fall at UMD studying civil &amp; environmental engineering. My school lumps these two together but seperates them into tracks. mine is water resources aka environmental. I have had 2 internships both dealing with stormwater and stream restoration. I have experience with CAD and GIS. I am not doing so well at school and have a 2.65 cumulative. I will work to boost my grades senior year but it is not possible for me to reach 3.0 which ive learned to accept. Because I am behind I will be hopefully graduating next august which is just 3 months beyond 4 years in total for my degree. Firstly, when is the right time to start applying to jobs. Should i start in spring or will people take me seriously in the fall and know in advance they need someone fall 2014? Will they look down on the fact that i am behind and not finishing until the summer? Or should I wait till spring or summer after I have finished my degree. I am not sure if companies typically offer you a position until after you graduate. My second concern is with the FE exam. Firstly is obvious do I have to take it to get a job and be content with my life? Will i regret it later or not be able to pass once ive forgotten material? Will companies only hire people who have passed? Also should i take the general engineering test, civil, or environmental? My grades are low and I struggle with material across the board so idk what my strengths are. What is the most effective strategy for preparing for this? I know it seems i am freaking out over stuff in the future but i really cant fuck up this year and am scared about not getting off on the right foot. Do i even have a shot at a decent job with my poor grades? Any advice is greatly appreciated"

Sorry for not writing in Italian, unfortunately my knowledge of Italian does not extend beyoned greeting and cursing :(

A little background: My GF and I are both relatively recent college graduates. She's Italian, I'm a GCC citizen. We met in the UK and we'd been together for about 2 years. Both of us went back to our respective homes after graduation, I got a cushy job in the financial services industry, and she helps manage her parents' small company. She's based near Milan. Well, turns out, we can't really do the long-distance thing. We looked into her moving to my country, but that means we have to be married to make things easier for us, but we are not ready for that yet. Now she keeps insisting that I move to Italy with her and work there, which I don't mind in principle, but practically it just seems so freakin difficult. For starters, I don't speak the language, I'm a foreigner, and not really familiar with the country. She's overly-optimistic and tends to oversimplify things, but whenever I read unemployment reports in italy or news about italians moving abroad to work I get very anxious. So I'm hoping you guys would give me better, relaistic, and varied opinions... My plan is to do my master's in Milan so I can learn the language, get a feeling for the country and hopefully do some networking to land a job there if things go well. Here are my questions:

* What language is usually used by professionals in large financial services firms, banks (think corporate; not retail), and multi-national corps.? 

* Are there foreigners working in the financial sector or is it completely Italian?

* What's a typical contract for entry-level looks like?

* Compensation-wise, how much should I expect with a master's degree (MBA/Finance) and little experience? 

* I keep hearing there are many North-Africans in Italy, and they're viewed somewhat negatively... I have an Arab name and I could easily pass for a North-African, will that actually hinder my chances of getting a job? Do people actively discriminate against them? Do companies care?

* I intend to get an internship while doing my master's. Are internships always not paid? Do they usually result in full-time placement? Are they actually helpful career-wise?

I don't really know what to do, or how to respond to my ""friends"" when I return.

For the ones who probably purposefully drifted away because I was too negative---what do I say to them?

For the friends who disappeared on because I spent most on my time in the hospital and not at bars with them---what do I say to THEM?


I'm just feeling very nervous about it all, and I am absolutely NOT excited to start school on Monday.

It doesn't help that I feel like a giant loser. This is my senior year of college, and everyone had great summer internships, summer romances, whatever.

I spent my entire summer in the hospital, getting harassed by debt collectors, etc. If I there was an award for most personal setbacks in a 4 month period, I would win it.

I guess I kind of hate myself right now. :/

It's been good, because I've been able to finance myself the entire time, have only had to take a tiny bit of loans (relatively), and haven't needed to rely on my parents for any support.

The downside is that my grades have suffered somewhat from having to balance work and school, and I've not been able to commit to taking as many classes as I need to in order to graduate when I'd like.

The current ""programming"" internship I've been doing since November has been alright in that it pays decent for a part time college student job in this area ($14/hour), but it isn't really teaching me anything or giving me any relevant skills. Calling what we do ""programming"" is a bit of a stretch. 

Anyway, I *think* I have enough money saved up that I could live off of until next Summer, at which point I plan on getting a much better summer internship. Quitting this job would free up enough time for me that I could focus a lot more on school, and my own personal projects. I've got a fairly decent stack of them that should look really good on my portfolio. I kind of feel like having those projects continually fleshed out/adding more, would be more impressive on my resume then staying at this dead end job another year. Something I wouldn't have much time for if I kept at this job come this next semester.

It would be taking a financial risk, but if I did run into financial issues there's a previous job that I'm pretty sure would hire me back in a heartbeat (and they've said as much in the past).

I guess I'm wondering whether someone with similar experiences can tell me of the virtues (or lack thereof) of not working while going to school, or whether I'm crazy and should just stay with what I have."

When first going to school at the age of 18, I really screwed up. I changed majors a hundred different times, and before I took an extended ""break"" from college, I left with a 2.7 GPA. This was all done at a Community College.

Years have passed, and I've been doing a bit better now. I'm a bartender at a hotel (Possible business internships.) and I own a house too. I'm ready to get back into school. I would really like to major in finance, with a minor in CompSci. I live in Dallas, Tx.

Here are my questions (thanks again for your help.)

How important is the school you choose in regards to Finance? 

My GPA is not exactly competitive, from what I hear, if I want to get into UT Austin, someone suggested to me that I change schools so my GPA doesn't transfer, and THEN ask for a transfer to UT Austin.

Your thoughts on that?

I live in Texas, but I would prefer to stay in the DFW area. What school would you recommend for me in regards to ROI, and more importantly risk?

Finally, given my major and my minor. What language would you recommend I begin learning? I'd imagine Mandarin, or German.

1kjfam,165,2013-08-17,Tips For the New Working Adult,detroyecl,malelifestyle,https://www.reddit.com/r/malelifestyle/comments/1kjfam/tips_for_the_new_working_adult/,"I started working this summer, just as an intern (things I learned from that job are a whole other topic). I had my own apartment and these are a few of the things I picked up from living alone. Most of these things have already been said by many people but I wanted to reiterate them and say if you aren't doing them, start now.

* 1)	**Keep track of your expenses** --
Keeping track of your expenses lets your know exactly where you money is going. I found I was doing good in keeping my food budget under what I needed but some entertainment expenses were a little high so I was able to stay in a budget and fine tune my living and have more money for other things.


* 2)	**Keep a journal** --
I started keeping a journal while I had time at night. It helped me organize my thoughts well and keep track of what I had done. I had lists, explanations of how I spend my time, and thoughts on subjects. It’s something you can give to your kids or grandchildren as well as read when you are older and the memories have faded. It’s a good way to spend a few minutes every few days. 


* 3)	**Learn to cook** --
Cooking your own meals will greatly keep weight under control. Having to plan your own meals lets you figure out healthier options than fast food as well having leftovers for work. I personally enjoy cooking and eating my own creations as well. 


* 4)	**Diversify your savings** --
Don’t keep all your eggs in one basket. Have an emergency fund of a few hundred dollars and then once you have that, start investing in stocks and mutual funds – even land and other businesses if you can later on.


* 5)	**Exercise** --
I don’t exercise every day but at least twice or three times a week. The benefits should be obvious. You feel better…


* 6)	**Read** --
You can learn a lot from reading both online and in paper books. Get away from the TV and expand your mind. Reading about other people and their adventures and thoughts is a better way to spend your time then *always* in from of the TV of Play Station.


* 7)	**Take up a hobby** --
I have woodworking. I can’t do much in an apartment but carving and refinishing certain pieces of furniture passes the time well and is a productive way to spend time and better myself. It’s not terribly expensive either.


* 8)	**Get out** --
Go out and do something. Almost anything. I hit up an arcade, a movie theater, do some shopping, and see a show. Enjoy the place you are in right now. Hiking is always good for outdoor people, even right after work in the late afternoon. Do some fishing, racquetball, dance lessons, anything! 


* 9)	**Call your parents** --
If you are blessed to have parents, then call them every week at least. Doesn’t have to be long, but they love you and are interested in your life and how you are doing. Visit them when possible and help around the house or garden etc. Give back to the people that gave up some of their better years to guide you to adulthood. 


* 10)	**Clean** --
I’m rather OCD myself, but everyone should clean their house/apartment often. If you keep things clean anyway it’s never much of a chore. Fold your clothes when you come home and put them away. Take out the trash as soon as it’s full. Vacuum once a week, clean the bathroom once a week, and wipe things down every few weeks and dust. Not much more than that is needed for a single person or couple with no kids. Keeping things organized and put away constantly will make your apartment life easier and much more enjoyable when you are home. 

I wanted to share the things I learned. Thanks for your time!


Edit: As some of the commenters pointed out, the emergency fund should be *3-6 months expenses*. I failed to remember that right but that is definitely the better amount to have.

[Hey Mandy, have you spoken to Aaron Sorkin about the whole ""Bad Mandy"" thing since the episode aired? What did he have to say for himself?  That whole thing was so fucking shady and it made me hate him even more than I already did. He's such a narcissist. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kj2ks/im_mandy_stadtmiller_ama/cbpgnxv?context=5)|He asked to get a drink with me a few weeks back. It was my first time I had seen him in a year since I wrote the story. Our drink lasted about 10 to 15 minutes. The first thing he said when I sat down was: ""I just have one question. Why did you do it?"" I told him that since he hadn't made good on his professional promise to use me as a consultant and had gotten an entire character and plotline inspired by me and inside information I told him, I felt that I at least deserved professional credit by writing a story about it. He then followed this with: ""So it was just revenge?"" And I said, no, it wasn't revenge. I didn't say that. He then said, ""You printed every email between us."" Which I did not. We have exchanged over a hundred emails and purposefully took out anything personal or embarrassing or intimate or not related to the development of the character he told me -- in writing -- that I inspired. During this drink, he continued to tell me that I had done the wrong thing, violated his privacy, it couldn't have come at a worst time, he thought we were friends with the potential to be something more, and had I NOT written that I would be making thousands a week because he would have hired me as a story editor. Then he started going into how if the show got picked up I would then eventually become producer and on and on. It reminded me of the scene where McAvoy buys the engagement ring just to try to torture McKenzie. He was never going to hire me. Even though the first thing I said when we got a drink back in 2011 was asking him to become a consultant and he said, done, I'll be in touch -- and let me know if you ever want to go a date. When I started to point out these things -- and how I could have really used the money and the credit and I never would have written about it had he come through on anything he told me, he said, ""How much do you think you deserve? I'll write you a check."" And then he changed the conversation pretty quickly after that. When he noted to me that I hadn't written him back after he wrote me after the article, I then repeated back to him an email he sent to me. The first email he sent me after the article ran basically said he was sorry it made me cry and was a kind note. The second email said, ""I deserved it because I'm getting a paycheck from HB fucking O? What would you do if I won the lottery, shoot my daughter in the face?"" I didn't respond to that one. But I quoted it back to him and said, ""My father -- who actually was shot twice in the face -- really enjoyed that email. He thought it was really witty."" At that point, Aaron stormed off. He then sent me an email with a bullet point list of items trying to counter everything I had told him. Whatever. I'm as complicit in that entire thing as him. When you have two people who are fairly manipulative dancing with one another and the best intentions are not involved, you come up with Nina Howard, one xoJane article and one angry Aaron Sorkin.
[Was there a five to ten minute self-important soliloquy full of smart people words involved?  Life, after all, does imitate art.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kj2ks/im_mandy_stadtmiller_ama/cbph5w3?context=5)|You imagine it however you want to imagine it, friend. He's a smart man. I have a lot of respect for him. Hence me not being all Sydney Leathers about it but instead ""hey, I'm a shady starfucker and here's my story about the whole thing"" without revealing anything truly intimate or unrelated to the character development. That said, I'm glad that all of the following events conspired to inspire me to write the piece. These events were: I watched Scarface twice in a row on AMC after spilling lentil soup on the dress I wore for about a week straight, my friend Bonnie McFarlane texted me that the Hope Davis episode would be airing soon while I was living at home with my parents in San Diego -- and when I emailed Aaron about the episode saying some stupid suck-uppy thing like ""I knew it would be great"" got an auto-reply that said: ""This is no longer Aaron Sorkin's email address."" All of these events pretty much clinched my decision for me to write my story but do it in a self-effacing way. I'm rarely a scorch the earth type person. I hate hurting feelings and burning bridges. I think a lot of people bet on this with me. Oh, and I did call him when I got that auto-reply, and he gave me the new email, but the humiliation of this pretty much cemented that this dude was never coming through on any of the professional promises he made me. God bless. Love and light, dude.
[I wondered if that bit about the NY Post writer woman who tweeted about the snub from Will (from the most recent episode\) had anything to do with this situation... thoughts? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kj2ks/im_mandy_stadtmiller_ama/cbpssll?context=5)|I'm behind a couple episodes because I was interviewing Hannibal Buress for my podcast at his Sunday night Knitting Factory show and then Breaking Bad trumped Newsroom obviously. Should I catch up? Part of me doesn't really care.
[Has it sunk in yet that there won't be any more episodes of Enlightened?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kj2ks/im_mandy_stadtmiller_ama/cbpfz79?context=5)|Ugh. it does suck. But I got more over it from falling in love with new shows -- and from weeping at the perfect ending to Season 2. I'm glad he closed it up so nice. I don't know if there's anything on TV that has made me feel quite the same way is that show, though. It really affected me emotionally and viscerally.
[Don't you freak out about your mother reading your articles?  That's totally why I don't write about my own life under my real name.  Also, why do you follow me on Twitter?  (My twitter handle's not the same as my Reddit handle, so this is more of a ""why do you follow who you follow?""\)  And finally, as you're such a fan of porn and supporter prostitution, have you ever considered these as a career?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kj2ks/im_mandy_stadtmiller_ama/cbphyno?context=5)|I wouldn't say I'm such a fan of porn or a supporter of prostitution. I had a bizarre assignment at The Post involving a prostitute and I took it. I was asked if I thought sex workers should be decriminalized and I do. I've watched porn occasionally and I think it takes a lot of strength to be a sex worker. I guess my thinking would be that your question could be compared to asking a woman who is pro-choice, ""If you're such a fan of abortion, why don't you become an abortion doctor?"" Or even, ""Why don't you get one?"" My biggest aim in a lot of the things I write or talk about it is to try to break down the Madonna/whore paradigm where you are either ""such a fan of sexy sexy sex sex"" or you are a good girl who knows that in polite society our mothers might read things and we can't admit that we are sexual creatures because that then makes us BAD. None of this is a slag on you, I'm just trying to explain this the best way I know how. My mom is a very interesting individual in that she and my father both have masters in counseling and say that they raised us as if ""life were just a big encounter group."" Which I think explains a lot. She is a provocateur who married a guy because he was even angrier than her father. So I think I've always been raised to try to challenge things -- and for me demonizing or even quickly categorizing a woman for tainting her prestige by talking about sexuality is an area I like to unpack. All of this said, I remember telling my mom about a threeway for the first time, and I was mortified. I had never felt such shame. So much shame. I've worked a lot to fight against shame, which I think does a lot more harm than good. As for following you on Twitter, I used to use TweetAdder which would auto-follow people of similar interests so that might be how I found you. I definitely employed on Twitter the strategy of following a lot of people to increase my own follows. I'm using ManageFlitter now to try to trim it down, but I'm still over 20,000 which is pretty ridiculous.
[Hey Mandy,  What is the best resource for the best juice re: non-hollywood figures, in your opinion? I'm thinking things like Valley Wag, Jim Romenesko, etc. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kj2ks/im_mandy_stadtmiller_ama/cbpiyk2?context=5)|Oh man, that's interesting. Well, I have a separate Twitter that I use since I follow so many people on my main Twitter that staying up to date on things as a breaking news source isn't the best. That (secret) Twitter is @mandystat which I first registered just for people who misspelled my name. But I've come to use it as a feed for all things breaking news. I've had interns find sources to follow. My big cheat is this: Go TO the sources and see who THEY follow. So for instance, we write about issues of sexuality at my web site so I don't just follow Dan Savage on that breaking-news-focused Twitter I've gone through and followed who HE follows. Because a lot of times that is how news is breaking nowadays. I think a lot of news gets culled from reddit and 4chan. I would look at who Adrian Chen from Gawker follows on Twitter. That guy breaks so many great stories. I think the key is to just keep going deeper and going primary-source. Anonymous and Wikileaks are good obviously. College sites are great for stories -- like, just look at how many stories from Gawker have simply been ganked from Ivgate.com or just by repurposing and repackaging breaking news with YouTube video from the @ap feed. Great question! I think there are also a lot of message boards that have great subcommunities in them, but I mostly stick to twitter and reddit. I'd like to get deeper into 4chan and Anonymous though. I had someone recently contact me offering to give me hacker news. I should probably take him or her up on it. I love that stuff. Also -- did you know there are whole parts of the Internet that exist in secret? I have to share these links... written about by Gawker at some point, of course. But I need to find them. It'll take me a second...
[Okay, The Silk Road is one. A place where you can ""buy any drug imaginable."" Link to kotaku.com.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kj2ks/im_mandy_stadtmiller_ama/cbpjc0t?context=5)|The Armory is another. The ""secret online weapons store that will sell you anything."" [Link to gizmodo.com](http://gizmodo.com/5927379/the-secret-online-weapons-store-thatll-sell-anyone-anything)
[How's the dating life treating you ?!  I feel like its been awhile since I saw a story on XoJ. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kj2ks/im_mandy_stadtmiller_ama/cbphkdc?context=5)|It's been okay. I'm still seeing that guy I wrote about in the ""grown-ass man"" article. He's a really good guy. I'm not sure where it will go, but I enjoy him. I'm trying to go pretty opposite day in terms of my dating life. I used to be very hellbent on getting married again by 40 (because I got all freaked out by ""Marry Him"" that Lori Gottlieb book I like to joke fucked me harder than any man could) but now I think I'll be fine. I have oily skin so tend to look younger than my age (not drinking helps too) and I think I'll make my own money and I never have trouble finding someone to date or have a relationship with -- so I think I'm looking at the whole thing as less of a societal challenge now. It's like the song ""Little Boxes,"" you know? I always think of that song when I think about how you really don't have to go down one path. I feel like having this attitude is making me value myself, my time and definitely leading to me coming from a much stronger position of power (which can be hard for women who have esteem issues). Also, last week the dude I'm seeing -- I called him The Rugby Player -- brought me flowers and popsicles and sushi pre-Breaking Bad, which was dope.
[Oh you're gorgeous, I don't think you'll have any problem in the looks department.  If anything I think guys will be intimidated by you.  Heh.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kj2ks/im_mandy_stadtmiller_ama/cbpi071?context=5)|Honestly, anyone intimidated by a woman or a man, my advice? Just ask her out anyway. She'll either say yes or no or not respond, but I think it's so great to push yourself to try. I've written about how shy I used to be. The only way I've gotten at all confident is by pushing my way, inch by inch, with things that intimidated me. Sorry to be all Earnesto Cheese, but whatever, I believe in that shit :) So many great people who don't try things because they're intimidated. And who cares? A million failures is a huge success because you went for it, dude. Jesus. I think now I'm just like straight up cribbing Wayne Gretzky.
[What has been your favorite or most memorable interview you've done? Also how was the whole male prostitute thing lol? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kj2ks/im_mandy_stadtmiller_ama/cbpfyv5?context=5)|I always point to Billie Joe Armstrong at the VMAs because I adore him and found talking to him electrifying. But Dr. Brad Blanton probably changed me the most when we talked about radical honesty. The male prostitute felt like an undercover reporting assignment challenge slash bad date -- in that I had to shower with him immediately. It was like proving I wasn't a narc with no wire. (Even though I guess I kind of was.)
[Do a lot of bad dates start out that way for you? I can't remember a bad date that started that way. Though I can't remember a good date that started that way. Unrelated side note I can't remember a date.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kj2ks/im_mandy_stadtmiller_ama/cbpg745?context=5)|Ha, no. Although I've hooked up a few times with strangers from Craigslist Casual Encounters back in the crazy-party-day (2009 mostly) and that did lead to being naked pretty quickly.
[Are you interested in screenwriting? Written anything you're hoping to get produced? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kj2ks/im_mandy_stadtmiller_ama/cbphn9r?context=5)|I'm very interested in screenwriting. I haven't given it a serious go since I wrote an Arrested Development spec script in 2005. (I've written a few other old specs besides, but my comedy writing and my writing in general have improved a lot since.) I think I'd like to try another spec or two. My thinking is that I need to finish my book -- which needs a lot more work -- and most likely if that got optioned then I would have input in that regard and learn more about screenwriting that way. I also have the monologue packet and the sketch packet that landed me as a top 3 finalist writing for Jimmy Fallon and he said when we met, ""You're here because we love your packet,"" but alas, I did not get that gig and those sketches were not produced. Eventually. I have time! Are you a screenwriter? Do you have any advice here?
[Would you ever do stand up? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kj2ks/im_mandy_stadtmiller_ama/cbpgt34?context=5)|I've done standup. Full time? No. But you can google to see some things of me online.
[Much appreciate the advice! I'll be grabbing that book tomorrow, before spending the rest of the day procrastinating against better judgement, because, hey, that's *always* step one. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kj2ks/im_mandy_stadtmiller_ama/cbpism8?context=5)|Nope. Fuck that shit. No cutesy putting yourself down ""Art of the Gifted Child"" b.s. Do it. Fail. And then sometimes succeed. Seriously, do it :) Make one of your friends a partner in motivating you. Or find a MeetUp group of writers who will hold you accountable. Seriously! &lt;3.
[""art of the gifted child"". Hilarious. I'm into it and, of course, you're right. Matter of fact, I'm going to hit page 1 tonight. Lets make a pact-- first one to the Newsroom writers room burns it down. HBO, here I come. I'm joking but seriously, thanks for being cool and offering some wise words. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kj2ks/im_mandy_stadtmiller_ama/cbpixup?context=5)|I love motivation from Internet people! And yes, first one of us who is a producer gives 10 percent of the earnings to charity! That's what you said yeah? Glad you piped in here, and fuckyeah Art of the Gifted Child references!
[How or what do you generally think about your readers or audience? do you imagine them (us\) as supportive friends? a crowd you're trying to win over? voyeuristic drama-addicts slavering for their next intimacy fix? who do you generally write for, or to, and how do you keep reminders of other less-that-ideal audiences from negatively affecting your work? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kj2ks/im_mandy_stadtmiller_ama/cbpkah7?context=5)|That's a pretty great question. I think that I try to remember my own advice that I give to people in terms of networking and the career world. Which is demonstrating value. I try to do it either by telling a good story, starting an interesting discussion or providing insights I might be able to offer. The ones who I have interacted with in comments I really care for, as a lot of times their reactions are what inspires me right back.
[What's your take on the whole Bustle thing? Especially as a writer for a publication that caters to, oh you know, all the things Bryan Goldberg said no existing publications currently cater to for women.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kj2ks/im_mandy_stadtmiller_ama/cbpg2r0?context=5)|I was pretty surprised by that statement as were a lot of people it seems like from checking Twitter and seeing how many people took the piss out of him for that exact statement. Having said that, I was impressed at the writing when I checked out the site. Especially the #solidarityisforwhitewomen article. Then again, I haven't gone back since. Maybe on principle because of that statement. What do you think of it? Are there comments? The few articles I looked at seemed to have no place for discussion, which maybe is on purpose? To share articles only on social and then let little mini-discussions emerge from there? Or did I just miss something?
[Provocative, eh? What is the most weiners you have had in your mouth in 24 hours?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kj2ks/im_mandy_stadtmiller_ama/cbpgfmi?context=5)|In the last 24 hours? None. I'm mostly seeing this one guy and I see him every few weeks because my work keeps me so busy. The most weiners I've had in my sex in 24 hours? Probably three. Maybe two. Never more than one at a time to be clear not that there's anything wrong with that. (And if this is my mom asking the question, HEY GURRRL HEYYY)
[Before switching gears; my friend wants to know if there is such a thing as too small. He would ask himself, but I'm far too shy. Err, not me, him! He is too shy about his package. Mine is great!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kj2ks/im_mandy_stadtmiller_ama/cbpgnyl?context=5)|I've been with a few guys who had extremely small penises. It was fine. They have other skills. Who cares. A lot of times big-dicked guys are the laziest in bed. It's all about skills in my opinion. Also, unrelated but sort of related, I gave a friend the WeVibe I had sent me from a publicist, and she said it was amazing for increasing sensation and pleasure. Not an official endorsement as I've never even used it. But I think that might be the market for that thing. Dudes with small peen.
[What podcast do you host? Sorry my question sucks but you deserve a question for actually doing a 3 hour AMA.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kj2ks/im_mandy_stadtmiller_ama/cbpjc3n?context=5)|Hey there. I host a podcast called ""News Whore,"" which debuted last month and has been consistently in the top 50 comedy podcasts on iTunes (its highest ranking was #22 after I did O&amp;A). We've had guests like Colin Quinn, Taylor Negron and this week was Hannibal Buress who was fucking hilarious. Free to subscribe which you can do here: [Link to riotcast.com](http://riotcast.com/newswhore) Thanks for letting me plug! :)
[What grudges are you holding and why?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kj2ks/im_mandy_stadtmiller_ama/cbpgwmq?context=5)|I hold a lot of grudges against my father. But it's hard because he has a head injury (sorry to be a broken record about the whole blind shot dad, but my dad survived two AK-47 rounds in Vietnam, then met my mom, then had my sister, then had me). So I try to look at my grudges as opportunities for: What is the lesson here? What is there for me to learn? Sometimes it's patience. Sometimes it's that I need to be my own person. Sometimes it's that I need to have a backbone. Sometimes it's that I don't have to let someone else's energy affect my own. Other grudges, mostly personal. A lot of times they're pretty pain and grief based. Doing Al-Anon has helped a lot with that. The whole detaching with love technique is baller.
[When is News Whore coming out?! Not the podcast; the book!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kj2ks/im_mandy_stadtmiller_ama/cbpfy44?context=5)|I've got a prequel coming out any day now which is a compendium of my blog posts from 2004-2010. The roman a clef about The Post I want to do well and take a bit of time with. My goal is 2014.
[Aside from Al-Anon, do you have any advice or go-to resources for people who grew up with similar situations?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kj2ks/im_mandy_stadtmiller_ama/cbphdlq?context=5)|Don't knock Al-Anon. You parents don't even have to be alcoholics. They can just be dysfunctional. Reading ""Courage to Change"" was like a soothing tonic. Finding a great therapist is good. EMDR is touted by a lot of people. In terms of therapists recs, going on the resource page at caron.org is a start, and emailing or calling them for recs can be one way to go. I did the Caron Breakthrough program which allows for dramatic re-enactments to be done of situations like this. For some reason it helps. The therapist asked me to let out the tension I felt from my childhood and I emitted two bloodcurdling screams. I need to scream more. I think it really does release energy. And you can do it in a pillow. Just like Lydia on Breaking Bad. Also meditation can be helpful. And writing a letter to someone saying ""What I got from you was X, but what I needed was Y."" It lets you give voice to things that you may have been storing up. Louise Hay's ""Releasing Anger"" meditation is good, too. I also found ""Waking the Tiger: Healing Trauma"" to be really tremendous, but I've never done the experiential therapy they talk about in the book -- but there are several excellent practitioners of it.
[Thanks so much, you have no idea how helpful this is.  Not knocking, just curious about the other resources you'd recommend.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kj2ks/im_mandy_stadtmiller_ama/cbphtkn?context=5)|Awesome! And yeah, I've been to some shit Al-Anon meetings. Go to like 4 or 5 and see if you meet one or two people who you think might be chill to talk to. There's something about talking to like-minded people that can be really helpful I find. Also, do you do morning pages? I've been getting back into them recently at 750words.com and it's definitely helping my focus and working out my shit.
[Thanks for the motivation!  I've thought about trying again for a long time.  (But I actually always recommend it to people, who are also hesitant about going.  Is there a meeting for people who hate the idea of going to meetings?\) I do write morning pages at 750 words, and because of you!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kj2ks/im_mandy_stadtmiller_ama/cbpjk52?context=5)|That's tremendous. I'm trying to get up the motivation to do the 750 words for today even though it's 5:30pm but I think I'm going to make myself :)
[Anything that's off-limits in your comedy or writing?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kj2ks/im_mandy_stadtmiller_ama/cbpgv4b?context=5)|The stories of other people who haven't given me permission to tell these stories -- unless they are a public figure and their actions have warranted discussion. Exhibit A: Andy Dick. Exhibit B: First legal male prostitute. Exhibit C: Aaron Sorkin taking inside information I gave him, telling me he would make me a consultant, failing to do so and me writing an article about this portion of our relationship -- but nothing, mind you, truly intimate or explicit.
[If the pen is mightier than the sword, than why do actions speak louder than words?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kj2ks/im_mandy_stadtmiller_ama/cbpgfo9?context=5)|Your question is relying on the supposition that I agree with the first statement, my dear secret international spy friend. I would counter that a sword's ability to behead the gentleman writing the pithy phrase ""the pen is mightier than the sword"" proves yet again that actions speak louder than words. I'm an action girl. Too much bullshit in the world. It's a waste of time.

I have a few audio books I haven't been all that motivated to listen to, but the start of ""The Survivors Club"" sounded good. As for getting the courage to pitch, I think people should definitely get over their mental blocks -- but before they pitch they should do their research to see what else is out there and then write a paragraph of what the meat of the story is to see if there really is a story along with the headline they envision. Doing all these things guarantees that you really have a story in the first place.

Especially her Whitney Houston piece. It's extraordinary. I also think she's gorgeous and has great style. I'm excited for her book. (I also dig AJ, if she's still dating him.)

I largely work from home because I spend a lot of nights and weekends on news-related stories. But I really love all the people who work there. Jane inspires me to take chances even more. Emily inspires me to be stronger and more fearless. Corynne inspires me to be better organized. Lesley inspires me to be a better feminist. Madeline inspires me to be better at social media. Olivia inspires me to be a better photographer. Marci inspires me to be more wordsmithy. Annie inspires me to be more DGAF in general. And all the contributors are fantastic as well.

But I've always had vivid dreams -- but I definitely notice that when I take Zoloft they are even more heightened. I once had a really terrible dream and I was so disturbed by it and this lovely reiki practitioner I saw (Britta Dubbels, who used to be this super-sexed up model so google her just for that) said something great which I always think about. She said that a lot of times our subconscious can be purging out what we don't need in our dreams. So when they are dark and disturbing, I like to think of it as a purging -- my body working out what it doesn't need.

I wrote a little about this in the branding series I wrote on xoJane. And it's what I've done as a paid consultant a few times for people who have hired me to come up with a name for their brand or to distill what they would be wise to focus on. A few big secrets: consistency, having one big idea, having secrecy at all (why do you think those stupid fake speakeasies were so big), having extreme empathy with how other people give zero fucks about you or the players in your world and ""owning"" whatever it is that may be the most difficult thing for you to own. For me, I would say that is the whole play on words of News Corp with the News Whore thing. I can be a bit of a media whore and also probably ""slutty"" by mainstream society's standards.

1kizxo,3,2013-08-16,Internships: is it important to appear loyal?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1kizxo/internships_is_it_important_to_appear_loyal/,"Hi all, I'll first describe my situation.

I am an entering 3rd year, likely doing 5 years to get my BS in CS. I have an internship this summer (2013) at a well-known company. I also have another internship at a different well-known company this coming fall. I already feel a little odd at my summer internship, like I'm basically leeching all of the knowledge at one company to go use it at another. 

Adding on to that is my feeling that I'm in a good position for an internship at one of the big 4 next summer (2014). This is because of my (no longer nonexistent) work experience, a *really* great semester last spring, and research experience that's been ongoing.

Now my worries.

1) Applying for a summer internship while I'm in the middle of a fall internship will look bad. What do I say when interviewers ask me why I'm applying for the job? Is it at all appropriate to leverage a current internship to secure a future one?

2) While I want to sample the industry as much as possible, I don't want to get a reputation as a ""serial intern"". I know that many of you are full-timers; what is the perception of interns who continuously hop between companies? Is this a positive, a negative, or a wash?

Any insight that you all can provide would be really helpful."

I'd never admit it but when they made fun of my body it hurt, I never showed them that and always made a truthful comment towards them with venom but latter I would cry. I know from health checkups I'm a healthy weight, but I'd never know that they were just jealous of my body bc of my curves. my body developed before all of theirs and now I look like a college student roaming the halls and often mistaken for an intern, combined with my studiousness its not surprising...to anyone but me. I'm headed to the locker room to change in the bathroom, I hate seeing them snear at me and very conscious of other girl that have had pictures taken of them in the locker room by said mean girls. I open the door avoiding looking to right or left despite hearing a ruckus...there is always a ruckus in here over something when I hear a cheerleader voice shout ""oooh!! even better!! come over here Ginger we have a gift for you"" she chuckles evilly.




I roll my eyes only coming in bc I need to get my street clothes so I can get out of softball practice clothes. my black tank top is damp and bc of it emphasizes my ample DD breasts and pale skin as I round the corner. I gasp shocked seeing my friend tied down on a bench butt naked and cock erect, tied and leaking. his face is red as he screams on panties stuffing his mouth for help. she laughs bouncing on his chest making him lose his breath as I scream ""what the fucking hell are you doing!?!??"" I throw myself at her grabbing her and pulling her off him as she yells at me. I start trying to untie him when I hear him screaming louder his eyes shifting terrified in front of me begging me to look down.



I gulp seeing her holding a lighter a flame next to his cock, he tries flexing away but he bobs back closer to it as he cries struggling while I grab at the lighter screaming at her again. she laughs the bitch. I see two more girls now with lighters and ciggeretts, my friend is over 6 foot there is no way I will be able to grab all of them; one standing near his head, bitch at his groin and another waiting and lighting her lighter for when I move to pounce. I look at bitch girl in front of me. ""what the hell is the matter with you?? shut it off and stop this!!"" I scream at her




""phh some friend he is, you defending him....would you if you knew he was planting a camera in here?? hmmm?? or that he was aiming it at your locker-probably doesn't know you change in the bathroom bc you're too good to be around us. now we are very pissed, either I get to leave some marks so dummy here remembers this and doesn't try this again....or... you sit on his mouth. you heard me, sit on his mouth and let him make you cum, and then ride his cock till he cums...in your pussy, then sit on his mouth again. I want him to clean up his mess, so you STAY there till your pussy is clean. then I don't care what you do with him, we'll leave. you have my word, but untill you finish.. we'll stay nearby ....just in case you get cold feet you know. Ginger my hand is getting tired I could just drop it....hot metal an all you know..."" I swallow my yells at her as I look at you on the bench.



I had always liked you my friend...but not this way and certinally hadn't ever thought of doing somthing like this to you. I look at you feeling like a bad friend even if I would have beat the crap out of you for the camra I wouldn't have done this. your tearful eyes look at me pleading as one of the girls pulls panties out of your mouth. ""please Ginger, she means it!! they ugh "" I hate seeing the fear and shame in your eyes when the girl that pulled the panties out caresses your face ""hmm he's a real good pussy licker Ginger, a wonderful tongue. like a vibrator but better! just take a seat see, he wants you"" she chuckles seeing your cock leaking pre freely now despite the tie.



bitch chuckles, ""should have brought you in sooner"" she laughs as you look at me pleadingly ""please...don't let her burn me"" its almost a whimper. I want to hug you and make your fear go away as she gives me an evil eye and brings the flame closer. you yelp crying trying to pull away ""Please Ginger just fucking sit!!"" I look at you with compassion and hate to her as I slip my shorts off exposing my toned thighs I straddle your chest. bitch makes a snort behind me seeing my soft silky black panties still on as I hover over your mouth. "" just bc you like an audience doesn't mean I do."" I sneer at her as I pull the pannties aside and sit quickly on your mouth. I moan to my shame as I feel your open hot mouth on my sex your tongue laving my clit like a kiss as you look up at me. I expect to see hate or shame, but instead I see lust, and gratefullnes. I don't understand how you could have either for me as you mumble thank you on my cunt. I moan feeling your vibrations as your eyes smile seeing how sensitive my body is. I know why it is, part of me fear. I know I'm pmsing and that I'm at my most fertile... but if you clean me...that would help prevent it right?

1kisz9,19,2013-08-16,"I'm joining the Army for 4 years, and while in I have the opportunity to get a degree. Should I do that, or think about my deep down desire to move to the midwest and work a trade/manual labor job when I get out? Details inside",[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1kisz9/im_joining_the_army_for_4_years_and_while_in_i/,"I'm a 20 year old guy, and I'm leaving for the Army in a few months. I have a great job secured, IT Specialist, and as part of training I go to tech school to learn the basics of networking and stuff like that. That in itself is cool, and there's lots of tuition assistance options and programs that will make it super easy for me to get a degree while in. I have a 4 year contract, so I might be able to complete a B.A. by then, but if not then it can just extend out into my civilian life. I could get a degree in IT, MIS, business, it could be anything. So theoretically that combined with my Army experience and the tech school and getting certifications, I should hopefully be pretty well off upon coming out. 

That is the safe option, and it sounds really appealing. I have a general interest in computers and technology (I got that job because I put it as my job preference, not really expecting to get it because its rare). So before enlisting I hadn't really thought of a career after that. However, I don't want to dive fully into a degree in IT on top of my other training if I don't really like it. I like the idea of working in the Army in IT because it'll be dynamic (I will have Airborne and Ranger training so I can work in some cool locations), but upon getting out, do I want to work in an office?

I've always had this sort of fantasy that I move out to some part of the country that most people wouldn't want to go to, 'the middle of nowhere' if you will, and working a manual labor or trade job. Maybe start my own business of some sort. Something not very huge, something modest, like the guys who cut branches from trees or work on windmills or welding or just something like that. I know this sounds dumb that I don't know the specifics, but the thought of working during the week at a hard job, making enough money to get by and enough to support some cool activities like hunting and fishing (hence living in that kind of area, but location isn't important for this question) sounds lovely to me. Rather than working in an office and working toward that with internships and being stressed all the time...

I'm rambling, and I'm sorry this is long, but any insight would be appreciated. I'm joining the Army for the adventure, travel, and for service to the country. I don't want to go for a full career, because I'd want more personal freedom, but a 4 year enlistment is just right. After that....I could use the skills I have from that time to work in IT and be secure, or 'throw it away' and work for a living. I don't know what I truly want, so its not a case of merely picking what I want more. They both sound great to me. So any general advice? Anyone go through a similar situation? How hard would it be to make a path for myself in a new place after leaving the Army? Thank you for any discussion or tips or advice. 

TL;DR: I'm enlisting in the Army for 4 years, I have an IT job (IT Specialist, networking, routers, switches, etc, basic stuff). While in, I could get a degree if I want. Should I do that and work a 'real job' when I get out with that degree, or go another route, where I go to some random place thats comfortable, work a manual labor job or start my own business, and just live simply. Any advice? "
1kmtxy,13,2013-08-18,I[25M] have some concerns about my girlfriend[23/F] She constantly fights with her parents but she's perfect with me. Is this a sign?,inluvwithluv,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1kmtxy/i25m_have_some_concerns_about_my_girlfriend23f/,"She fights with her mom and dad but is incredibly kind and supportive with me. She's always there and sweet to me. I met her mom and she was absolutely fantastic and kind. Her dad sounds just as amazing. I just don't know why in the world my girlfriend would fight with them.

We've only been dating a few months so I haven't seen a lot of behavior up to this point or any degradation in the relationship. Hormones and lust are very much alive and potentially clouding my judgment. Is her behavior a sign of bad things to come?

EDIT: She fights about everything, from petty thing to big things. For example, when she shops with her mom for things she's rude and standoffish about any ideas her mom throws her way. When her mom is in the car with her and comments on her driving she gets incredibly peeved and is very short with her responses. She never yells, she just has a rude and offhand tone to the way she says things. The big things she has fought about make sense: such as her needing a new job or an internship to advance her career. Regardless, her history is that she was treated very well by her parents. They have a good amount of wealth and they've been there for her emotionally so I don't perceive there to be anything lacking in her upbringing.

My ex texted me out of the blue the other day to see how I was doing.  I stupidly responded and gave her an update on my life.  In the time since we broke up (5 weeks) I have moved out of my house and into the city she lives and works in, my band is doing incredibly well, and I've gotten a new internship that I'm excited about. 

At first it made me feel better to tell her these things, because I felt like it was my subtle fuck you to her for not letting her get in the way of my life.  So after a few exchanged messages I felt a bit better... This was until she proposed that we go grab a drink and catch up.  I agreed to meet her and we just went out for a couple hours.  Pleasantries were exchanged and we caught up and had an okay time by all accounts.  This was until she told me she had to get going because she had to meet ""her friend"" at a restaurant nearby.

It's obvious that it is another dude as I heard from a friend that she had been hanging out with someone very soon after our break up.  So now I'm back at my house and hating myself for seeing her.  I had almost forgotten how gorgeous she was and how much I liked myself when I was around her.  

I hadn't spoken to her in weeks and now I feel like I've hit absolute Rock. Fucking. Bottom.  I wanted her to see that I was a confident happy dude through all my new endeavors, but now I'm just thinking of her on her date with a guy that isn't me and I just don't understand what he may have that I don't.  I'm beside myself right now and kicking myself for not only breaking NC, but agreeing to see her.

I can't go through these motions anymore.  I'm lost as all hell.  

tl;dr:  Saw my ex after our breakup for the first time and she left our get together to go see another guy."

I would likely be doing software engineering material (unpaid) for this internship for about 10 hours a week. 

I feel like my skills are worth something, but I don't want to shoot myself in the foot by turning this down and having no programming internships completed when I graduate this spring.  I also dislike the idea of doing paid work for free. 

I don't know if pay would even be negotiable for this internship, but somehow I feel not (I guess I'll know when I start next month). What should I do?  Looking for the smartest decision here in the long term.

So in CS, I'm basically taking freshman/sophomore year classes this year, and junior/senior classes next year.

I'd really like to get a more CS-oriented internship this summer, and I'm not sure how to list my year/major.  It seems a bit disingenuous to call myself a junior CS major, when I'm really not at that level of classes yet.  From my transcript, that will be very obvious, but I don't want my initial description to be misleading.

I was raised in another state by my parents who divorced when I was in my early teens; it's not a big deal to me, and I still see and keep in touch with my parents and siblings frequently. I'm in my last year of university. I like to smoke weed pretty frequently, but not all-day-every-day like I used to in my first two years of school. I'm lonely and would love to love someone, but I'm pretty hopeless. I've never had a real relationship longer than a month. I figure that I must be polyamorous since monogamy has never worked for me, and I tell myself that I won't be restricted to monogamy again.

She's 20, working in the lab at a big hospital in that big city. She identifies as lesbian, but has history with both men and women. Her biological dad has been absent since birth because he is severely addicted to hard drugs and alcohol. She was raised by both parents who divorced earlier in her life and lived far away. Her dad is great, but lives far away. Her mom has a history of relationship instability, is emotionally abusive (in my opinion), and doesn't accept her as lesbian. My fiancée has a certificate degree in her field, and aspires for more education. She has a severe anxiety disorder with panic attacks, but this is undiagnosed and she doesn't realize her anxiety is abnormally high. She doesn't really smoke weed at all, but she likes to drink once in a while. She has been in a couple serious long relationships, one of four years, and the most recent of one year. She's been single for a couple months, and isn't looking. She's monogamous.

October

We meet at the hospital. She tells me she thinks I'm beautiful, and I'm completely flattered. I get her number. A couple days later, she comes over to my apartment at around midnight (we're both night owls) and I serve her dinner. We go on a walk outside through our neighborhood and in a park. She tells me she wants to kiss me, so we kiss. I tell her I love her. We fool around a little bit in the park and it's the best sexual experience I've ever had. She spends the night and we cuddle in bed. I wake up in the morning and she's gone. We talk some more, she comes over again, and she's not there in the morning. I'm already confused and heartbroken. We hang out some more and eventually she spends the night. Because I tell her I'm poly, she sleeps with a 35 year old male coworker at a party when she's drunk. I'm too stoned to really care when she tells me about it. I'm falling in love.

November

We spend pretty much every night together at either one of our places, so we decide to move in together. We get some of her stuff and her two cats moved in. I explain to her that I love her dearly but I don't think I can be monogamous with her for the rest of my life. She gets upset, we have a big long talk, we have rough sex, and fall asleep together. The next day she puts everything back in her car, tells me she's probably going to get drunk and sleep with some random guy that night, and I can't stop her. She leaves. I go to work overnight. She gets drunk, meets up with a friend of a friend, who is a 35 year old male friend of a friend who is currently in a monogamous relationship. They get more drunk, go dancing together, go back to his place, and they have sex. She leaves and drives home drunk. The next morning I am upset and so I go to the bar early in the morning after my shift and drink with a friend. I go home and see she has posted pictures of her and this other guy to Facebook, and they both look drunk and happy. I get very jealous, for the first time in my life. I go over to her place with flowers, a card, and her favorite junk food, and beg her to take my back. She does. We cry and fall asleep next to one another. A couple weeks later, I convince her to come with me to my home state for a couple days where I am going to celebrate Thanksgiving with my family. We drive for many hours and dance to a romantic country song at a rest stop in the middle of nowhere late at night. I realize I want to spend the rest of my life with her. We get to my home state, and she meets some of my family. We go shopping at the mall the next day, and I pop into a store to buy some cheap earrings. We talk about getting engaged, so we buy matching five dollar rings from Claire's. That night I bring her down to the river at this spot where I used to smoke weed, and I ask her to marry me. She agrees, five and a half weeks after we met. She tells me she has been proposed to three times before (years into those relationships) and always said no. I feel very lucky. The ring quickly starts to turn her finger green, so she wears it on a necklace for a while, and then after a couple months doesn't really wear it at all anymore. I'm anxiously awaiting my ring. She flies back to our city before Thanksgiving so she can be with her family. I stay and celebrate with my family. Her ex-boyfriend is invited by her parents to eat at Thanksgiving with them. My fiancée, her ex-boyfriend, her mom, and her step-dad have an awkward meal together. Her parents really want her to be straight, and they liked this guy, even though he's 30 and a loser. The next day, he shows up uninvited and unexpectedly at her apartment after she had been talking on the phone with him for a couple hours. She lets him inside. He starts acting crazy, making threats, and saying how he feels like he's on cocaine. She tells me what's going on. I tell her to tell him to leave. He doesn't. I call 911 in that city and get the police sent to her place. The cops take her ex-boyfriend away. I leave that night to drive back home to be with her. I arrive home and we are safe.

December

I turn 21. She is still 20, so she stays home while I go out with friends and have a good time. We fall more and more in love, and spend literally all of our free time with one another. I legally change my name and my gender, and she comes with me to court, the DMV, the social security office, and everywhere else. She is extremely supportive and I love her. She decides that maybe she isn't so female after all, and considers being more masculine. (Later she claims that I pushed her into this.) We agree that I start calling him by another name and male pronouns. I am under the impression that I am being supportive of him and that he appreciates this. After all, he is the more dominant one in the relationship, and always on top when we have sex (because I really prefer the bottom). He goes to Mexico with his dad, step-mom, and two sisters for a week. He comes back home and we have one day together. Then I leave for a week and a half back in my home state for the holidays. I get home and celebrate with my family. I miss my fiancé dearly. I have to stay in town because I have a court date for a speeding ticket on New Year's Eve. A couple days before that, I go out drinking at a gay bar with an ex-coworker of mine whom I have known for three years and also have a crush on. She has recently figured out that she is a lesbian. She is single. We both get very drunk, and she drives me home. She is stupid for driving, and I am stupid for going with her. She drives the wrong way down one-way streets. We finally get home, and as I'm getting out of the car, I go to hug her. Our lips meet and we kiss for only a second or two. I realize what's happening, break away, tell her thanks but no thanks, and go inside. She makes it home safely. I tell my fiancé that I'm home safe and that we had a good time, but decide not to tell him about the kiss. On New Year's Eve, my court date goes well. I stay at home and have champagne with my lonely mom while my two little siblings go out and party. My fiancé tells me that he is going to go hang out with a coworker after work, because he doesn't want to be all alone on New Year's Eve. I am worried but I realize I can't say no. They go out, and for a while, I am unable to reach him by phone. Eventually he calls me back a couple hours after midnight and tells me that he is home safely, and that nothing happened between him and his 35 year old coworker. I believe him completely. I drive home New Year's Day to be with him. I bring my mom so she can see where I live.

January

On the ride home, my fiancée tells me that she wants to go by her female name and pronouns again. I wonder if that's just because my mom is coming. It isn't. My mom, my fiancée, and I spend a couple nice days together. After my mom leaves, my fiancée and I are so happy to be together again. Life is swell. I realize that she has severe anxiety and panic attacks, and I tell her this. She is happy that at least she understands why she feels this way for so long. She encourages me to stop smoking weed, and I realize that it's probably a good idea, so I taper off and don't smoke very often anymore. I start my last semester of university. We rent a U-Haul and move into my place together, successfully. We are happy, but her two cats get on my nerves sometimes, but whatever. We are in love. I am very anxiously and impatiently awaiting my engagement ring, and hint about it all the time.

February

She tells me that she wants to go to school after I graduate, but in another location. For months we try and figure out where she wants to go to school and where I can get a good job. We celebrate Valentine's Day together, and it's really nice. I am starting to feel more and more guilty for not telling her about that little accidental drunken kiss, but whatever. Life is pretty good for us. I smoke weed very, very rarely, which makes her happy, and which makes me miss smoking weed so often, but whatever.

March

I go away for a week to another city for an internship. I complete all my work in the first couple days. She has a very severe panic attack while I am gone late at night. I decide to come home as soon as possible. I change flights to leave the next day. I spend that evening cramming in all my tourism and exploration. I go to a famous gay bar, buy one drink, and the male bartender buys me the other. I kiss him on the cheek as a thank you. I go back to the hotel, pack my things, and fly out the next morning. I return home and we are happy. She asks me about my trip. She asks me if I was with anyone. I say no. She can tell I'm lying. I tell her about how I just kissed the old male bartender on the cheek to say thank you for buying me a drink and that was it. She gets upset. I decide now is a good time to tell her about that other kiss. I do. She freaks out. She tells me she might leave me. She tells me she doesn't know if she'll be home the next day when I come back from work. She tells me with a very malicious intent of hurting me that she had sex with that guy on New Year's Eve. Twice. (He was 35 and she just met him that night at the hospital. They went back to his hotel room after walking around the neighborhood for a while, and got naked, and did stuff, but didn't actually have intercourse because she was feeling guilty. She drives home and calls me telling me she is okay and going to bed for the night. I fall asleep happy. She drives back to the hotel because she feels like she didn't get the job done. They get naked and do stuff together again, but no intercourse because she feels guilty. She is completely sober this entire time. She tells me she felt like she needed to have sex with him because I wanted her to be too masculine and dominant at the time, and she needed to feel feminine and submissive.) My world falls apart. I cry. I tell her I want to work things out. I ask her to please be there when I get home from work the next morning. I go in to work overnight. I feel like shit. I don't know what to do. My work partner advises me to leave her. I don't want to. I come home from work. Neither of us says anything, I just fall into bed next to her and cry to the point of being unable to breathe for at least an hour. She doesn't really cry. (I cry very often about almost everything, and she almost never does.) We promise each other to work things out. I feel like all of my trust in her is completely shattered. I wonder why she doesn't seem so upset. Things become difficult for me. I lose motivation to go to class or complete homework. We love each other though, and are happy that we can move on. She turns 21. Her and I go out to a gay bar together and get pretty drunk and take a cab home. She doesn't have a whole lot of friends. The whole night her cheating on me is in the back of my head. I try to ignore it. She can tell. We are sad. A couple days later, I smoke weed (for the last time) with a coworker. She is upset that it happened and that I didn't tell her about it immediately. I promise never to do it again. A couple days later, we are cleaning our house, I say something spontaneous and romantic, and she asks me to marry her. I say yes. I love wearing the ring constantly even though it turns my finger green. I am very happy. I am still sad.

April

I almost fail my classes because I have no academic motivation. Probably because I'm depressed because I'm constantly sad about my fiancée cheating on me and also I miss smoking weed. I feel like I can't trust her. She whoops my ass into class and I pass everything by the skin of my teeth. My parents fly out to see us, and I graduate university. I am very happy to be done. I am still hurting from the loss of trust. We are still figuring out where to move for her to go to school and for me to get a good job.

May

We both work. I'm working full time now and my company is really shitty. The paychecks bounce often. We need to move. She wants to go to school. We consider so many places. I am happy with my fiancée but at the same time I am seemingly unable to overcome our trust issues. I tell her that I want to trust her, but I don't feel like I can. I still love her. She still loves me. Eventually we decide to move to another state far away so she can go to a specific school she has fallen in love with. I get reciprocity for my paramedic license in that state. We make plans.

June

We are getting ready to move. I get hired at a good ambulance company after a phone interview. I am excited to have a new job that is not so shitty. I am also excited to move to a place where no one knows that I'm transgender unless I tell them. I'm looking forward to people getting my name and pronouns right. She is looking forward to going to this specific school. I really want to spend the Fourth of July at home with my family, though, because I haven't been there since New Year's, and I miss them. We decide to move all of our stuff and both of our cars, drop everything off at our new apartment, and then go back to my home in one car together for a week and a half. We consider giving up her cats. We decide to bring them with us. We pack up our cars and move. We arrive, sneak the cats into a hotel with a no-pet policy, and hunt for apartments. Eventually we find a very expensive one in a very nice and very large suburban community that is geographically convenient between her school and the place I am going to work at. We tour her school and are extremely underwhelmed. She doesn't want to go there. She does find a program that she likes at another nearby university, however. She decides to go to a community college in the area for two years first and then to transfer. We pack up some stuff and the cats and go back to my home state. We get there and stay in my mom's basement, where we had stayed in November. We go to the gay pride parade with my mom and little sister, and have a good time. I want a calendar with pictures of the sexy firefighters, and she gets angry. I apologize. She asks me if I am really a gay man since I want to have a calendar with pictures of sexy male firefighters. That is a ridiculous question.

July

We drive up to my aunt and uncle's vacation home with my little sister and multiple members of my extended family. We have a good time playing cards, enjoying the lake, and eating good food. I love spending time with my family. My sister, my fiancée, and I have a conversation about my gender. My sister is upset that I don't identify as binarily female and my fiancée defends me, demonstrating understanding of my gender identity, which is very complicated but not the reason we are having difficulties. My fiancée wants to leave a day or two earlier than I had planned so she can get the house cleaned and organized and get ready for school and get me ready for work and whatever. I don't want to leave, because I never get to spend time like this with my family, and after I leave and start my new job, I am officially grown up living a big girl life and I will never get to spend time like this again, unemployed and out of school. She emotionally manipulates my sister and I into leaving early. My family is confused and wonders if she doesn't like them. That's really not the issue. My fiancée is just anxious and doesn't feel at home. I am upset but I love her so we pack up and drive back to our new home. We don't really need to be there that early, but whatever. I get ready for work and she doesn't really clean or organize the house and she doesn't need the time to get ready for school. I start my new job. I really like it. I am working two or three 24 hour shifts a week and she is very upset about that. She doesn't like me being away for so long. She is still job hunting. I tell her that I am working so much because I need to pay for our rent and bills and other stuff. She tells me that she understands that, but she still makes me feel guilty for being away from home so much. I find out that my manager's kid, who works at the company with me, is transgender. This is a very good thing. I like my job. I am in love with my fiancée. I am still depressed about the infidelity and I don't know if things will ever get better. I miss smoking weed, because I now live somewhere where it is legal, and my job doesn't drug test. She doesn't want me to smoke. She likes spending time outdoors, and I am constantly exhausted. She makes me feel guilty for not going outdoors with her so often. She meets these two guys while she is walking around one day while I'm at work. They become acquaintances. My fiancée and I go somewhere outdoors (I planned it and it was completely my idea) and she has a severe panic attack. I don't respond in the way that she thought was appropriate, even though I'm a paramedic, and I deal with her panicking all the time. She is pissed. We have so many issues. We fight about smoking weed. I don't feel like I can trust her due to the cheating. We consider couples counseling.

August

She gets a part time job. She gets ready for school. She works a couple shifts at that part time job. I am enjoying my new job. We fight about me smoking weed. She tells me she doesn't know if this is working out. I become afraid she is going to leave me, call my mom, and tell her everything including our infidelity issues. My mom calls my fiancée and give her honest opinion. My fiancée is upset that I called my mom. Their relationship, which used to be very tight, is strained. My fiancée goes to hang out with those two guys she met. I come home from work while she is over there, so I go over there too. They make us dinner and we all talk. They are both straight. One is 35 and the other is 30. They both look younger. I feel like everything is awkward. My fiancée tells me that I have her permission to smoke weed, and if it doesn't work out, then we can reassess. One night she is angry at me and tells me to leave her alone. I leave to go buy weed. She is upset with me. On the way home, she tells me she doesn't want to be with me anymore. I tell her that if that's how she feels, then I won't smoke. This is like the closest we've ever come to breaking up. She is home when I get there. I throw the weed away in a trash can outside our apartment. We fall asleep sad. In the morning, she tells me that while she was sleeping, she looked in the trash, and couldn't find the weed. I'm not sure if she believes that I threw it away. I tell her I don't know if we can make this work, and tell her I think we need to split up. She freaks out and gets angry at me. I regret what I said and tell her that I want to make things work, but I just don't know how. She tells me that she is dropping half of her classes, going to school part time instead of full time, and finding a full time job. I am very upset about this because I want her to succeed educationally. She won't budge, drops her classes, and finds a full time job. We both love one another and want to make it work. She spends a lot of time together with this 35 year old guy while I am at work. I want her to make new friends here, but I am uneasy about this guy. The three of us go fishing. He tells us how he is really attracted to my fiancée, and how his roommate is really attracted to me. He promises us that he is not going to many any moves on my fiancée, however. My fiancée and I fight more about me smoking weed, which, at this point, I haven't done in like five months, and really miss. I just want to do it once in a while to relieve stress. I am really stressed out with moving, and I am still depressed about her cheating on me. I am having severe trust issues. Eventually I tell her that I don't like her hanging out with that guy. She admits that the last time they hung out, he was hitting on her. She calls him and tells him that they can't be friends anymore because he won't respect her boundaries. I appreciate this but feel guilty for running the one friendship she has had so far here. My fiancée tells me that she can't have drugs in her life because her biological father hasn't been in her life because of drugs. I understand that, but I also try to explain that smoking weed once or twice a week isn't the same as having an addiction to meth or heroin. She won't budge. The situation is such that I either lose her, or I never smoke weed again in my life. I miss smoking weed, and don't know if I can actually not smoke it ever again. We buy furniture and I put my name down on the credit application for thousands of dollars worth of furniture. Even though her name isn't on the documentation, she promises me that she won't let me go into debt, and that she will help pay everything off, even if we were to break up. I believe her. We fight about how she thinks I don't want to do anything but lay in bed and Reddit, and how she wants to go outdoors and be active. In reality, I'm just depressed and also constantly exhausted.

Today

We have so many issues. I don't know trust her completely and don't know if I will ever be able to trust her again like I used to. I want to smoke weed once in a while, but I think she would leave me if I did. She thinks we have different interests. I am fine going outdoors with her, and I actually usually enjoy it, but I am always exhausted when she wants to go. We have ten months left on our lease on an apartment that is now geographically inconvenient and that neither of us really likes. A small part of me is hopeless and tells me to leave her, and a bigger part of me wants to stay and work things out. I'm nor sure if that will ever happen though. She is literally my entire life right now, and I would be devastated and directionless if we split up. This would be easy if I didn't love her, but I do. I can really see us spending our entire lives together, and raising children, which we discuss often. She understands me better than I understand myself, and she really loves me for who I am. I don't feel like I could ever find that in another person for as long as I live if I left her. Cuddling up next to her in bed is pure euphoria and I don't want to leave. But I don't know what to do. I'm not sure if things can or will get better. I know we need counseling, but I thought that maybe you all could help me. So, please, offer me any and all advice. Be brutally honest. Feel free to ask clarifying questions. I am open minded and really need to hear some outside advice. Please. K. Thanks.

tl;dr

I proposed to my fiancée five and a half weeks into our relationship because I feel head-over-heels in love with her. She cheated on me and I haven't been able to forgive her. She proposed to me five and a half months into our relationship, and I said yes. We moved across the country. I want to smoke weed occasionally, and she won't let me. Also I feel unable to trust her no matter how hard I try. We fight often and I am constantly sad. What do?"
1kmc9x,9,2013-08-18,"Hey guys, I could use some help making a big life decision right now. Anyone have any advice?",phunkystuff,advertising,https://www.reddit.com/r/advertising/comments/1kmc9x/hey_guys_i_could_use_some_help_making_a_big_life/,"So I recently graduated this past spring and have just finished my 10 week internship at a very notable agency. I'm from another city, but have been going to school relatively near this agency and have all my belongings out here right now.

I really enjoyed my internship at this agency and would really have appreciated a return offer, unfortunately the agency doesn't go through its budget analysis until October which is when they will know whether or not they have the funds to hire more people or whatnot. MEANING I'm currently jobless in a city I may or may not be able to afford for much longer.

I've sent my resume out to many other contacts and HR at other agencies already, but so far I have been hearing the same response and that these agencies werent able to offer their interns full time positions either.

So now I'm really wondering what I should do. Should I move all my things back home and once I hear back from somewhere, move everything back out (Last resort). Should I get a full time lease on an apt out here and wait it out until I hear back from these agencies? (or just use it as a home base to continue applying elsewhere) Should I store my things here and move back home?? Store my stuff and just travel around a while??

I'm really at a loss of what to do since I'm really not sure what to expect in the next coming months. I don't know what my chances are of receiving a return offer and I really don't know what the hiring situation will be like in this city in the coming months... I don't want to move back home only to have to come back and rush finding a place to live, but then I don't want to commit myself if I end up moving to another city entirely (again I don't know what the chances of that happening are either though).

Does anyone have any advice?? Sorry if anythings unclear also, I can try to clarify about my situation if its unclear too.

Thanks so much everyone"
1km3vg,4,2013-08-18,What would you do ?,secondtryatlife,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1km3vg/what_would_you_do/,"I am a recent chemical engineering graduate looking to break into the industry. I recently had a on-site job interview at a really small company ( 4 people- 2 founders, 1 full time, 1 intern ). They liked what they saw on my resume and I have a decent chance of getting the job. However the policy of the company is that I have to be an intern before I can transition into full time. They also said that in order to be an intern I have to be a degree seeking student, so I told them that I can re-enroll in my university and seek a minor in Tech Writing.

The thing is the pay is gonna be very shitty ( I am assuming cause this is a new company ). Another thing is that they have hired a few ChemEs in the past and weren't happy with their performance and let them go. The thing for me is that I would have to be in school ( after I have graduated ) and be an intern, with no guarantee that they can fire me any time they wish. My parents won't support me financially so I would have to do this all on my own. And I don't know if I will get FAFSA seeing how I probably exceed the unit cap.

So my question is : would you take this offer? IF so why ?

1km0jl,2,2013-08-18,I think I am now depressed,[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1km0jl/i_think_i_am_now_depressed/,"So a year ago if someone had asked if I was depressed I would have laughed, in fact I even got into an argument with my brother about depression because I thought depression was never actually real and that anyone who committed suicide was being stupid. But now, I feel very differently.

I am 20 years old and going to be a junior at a great university that's in a large city. I have two parents who are relatively young, healthy, active and love me a lot. They have provided me a great life so far. Pretty much all of my extended family is also alive and well, even my grandparents. I have a lot of friends at my university and I am currently on track (and trying) to go into investment banking. For those who don't know about investment banking it's actually a really hard job, the hours are insane (80-100 for at least the first 6 months) but the pay is the best a first year grad could get, and it provides exit opportunities after about a year or two into just about any field within finance. Right now it seems to me like I have to go into this field, everything else just seems second rate.

By all accounts I have a perfect life, that's just the problem that seems to be bothering me. I don't want it to end, I don't want it to change. I don't want to grow up and watch my parents, all my family, and myself age. I don't want to graduate from school and take on an intense job along with the other pressures of the real world. I am having a really hard time coping with all of this and last month I sort of broke down in the middle of the night and just felt a terror like I've never felt in my life about my impending death and the impending death of everyone I love. I seriously have no idea how to cope with it and it's been dragging me down in everything I do since then. I have frequently cried about it, I have sort of tried to talk to others about it but it hasn't helped. I don't have any friends trying to go into my field or in my situation so it's sort of tough to discuss. I am living alone for the summer working at an internship (I have friends living close, I'm just alone until my roommates move in at the start of school) and it bothers me almost every day now. I just wish I could pause time to this moment and never have it end, everything is so great, why does it have to change. I know next year will probably be the best of my life so far but I won't even be able to enjoy it because the fact that I know it's going to end is killing me. 

How do people cope with these things, because I'm not sure I can."

&gt;&gt; Add some coconut to that shit.

I got a short internship in another continent. Before leaving, I had an excellent relationship with my girlfriend. Mind you, I have been with other people before in quite serious terms so I was sure and fully aware (and still am) that this last person I found was the closest I could reasonably expect for me to be a perfect match. I thought a couple of months away from her would be easy to manage while being submersed in work but...

Just a week ago another girl that works in this place and I started talking. I found her to be quite physically attractive but I never thought I would ever go beyond seeing her walk past me in the corridors. When we started talking she let me know she was aware of my presence (something about describing a couple of distinctive physical traits of mine). Of course, I know that this can be a perfectly neutral statement without any other motivation but curiosity. She was also pretty quick to mention she had a boyfriend and that she enjoyed the relationship.

Fast forward some days, we went out drinking with a group and I saw her again. Mind you, this would be only the second time we actually talk. By the end of the night, we were all pretty wasted and I decided to crash at the office. The group I was drinking with, including her, took a cab and I couldn't fit in but I had to work early anyway so I didn't mind. Well, in my crappy state of existence I decided to crash at a bench halfway between the office and the bar (separated by little over 100 meters, mind you). What I didn't expect, yet was secretly hoping for, was she showing up. Yup, she said she wasn't leaving me there because she would feel bad.

Well then, I proceeded with my plan of crashing somewhere inside the building (they do have some nice couches) but she kept insisting to take me back home. I didn't budge because i) if I went back home I knew I wouldn't get back to work ii) delaying the issue meant having her around longer. After a bit of random talk, she decided to show me her work (it's actually pretty interesting, won't go into details, but it involves lasers). And then, something inside me snapped or whatever. Not only was I there with a beautiful girl with whom I got along quite well, seeing her cheeriness and pure bliss as she showed me how her stuff worked made something inside me feel very very happy.

So after her demonstration we are about to leave and then in a succession of events I cannot quite reconstruct, I stated I wouldn't leave with her and then proceeded to ""kiss"" her which really was me crashing my face against her. I just muttered a quick sorry and went for the couches on another floor. I think I heard her call me a couple of times but I just waited for her to leave. Or maybe she didn't call for me and I just wished she did.

I haven't heard from her since and I'm still far from recovering the full extent of my mental capabilities but here's what I have:
---
* She seems to be happy with her relationship.

* She has given me no clear indication that she wants to be anything more than a friend to me (we had some good laughs, many common likes and dislikes as well as playful eye play but I am well aware that interpreting this is highly subjective).

* **Here comes the kicker:** even though I have a great, healthy relationship back home, the kind of happy I lived here I cannot compare. Both are great, and I want to have both, and I feel terrible for this.

My drunken logic converged on the following course of action: apologize for my behavior the other night, tell her what I feel and do try as much as possible to get her to spend some time with me in the few weeks I have left before I go back home. And yes, I want to actually kiss her, feel her skin and hold her close to me while being completely sober. I feel like this is a unique opportunity to experience a flash of something beautiful and unique. If we both agree to it, we will be able to resume our respective relationships without any problems. At least for me, I feel like actually going through with this is no more morally reprehensible than wanting to and I don't want to regret missing this moment later.

**tl;dr**: have girlfriend back home, completely charmed by girl with a boyfriend here, I don't mind trying for her. wat do."

Next september/october I will be moving to Berlin to do my master's project at TU-Berlin. I have studied telecommunication's engineering at Barcelona, and I will be doing a (hopefully interesting) project on the processing of certain satellite signals.

I have been trying to find a room in the city through wg-gesucht, but I think it's almost impossible to do it from abroad. And I can't come to the city before september, as I am currently doing an internship here at Barcelona. 

So, I was wondering if there were any berliner redditors here with a room to rent at their flats, or if someone knew about someone leaving a room for these dates. 

I am a 24 years old guy, that loves reading, cycling, climbing, doing geeky stuff, cooking and drinking beer. And I love Berlin! I have been there 4 times, and I am really looking forward to live there :)

My mother tongues are catalan and spanish, and I also speak fluently english and german. I would like to live with german speaking partners, so that I could improve my speaking abilities!

If any of you does know something about this topic, I would really appreciate your help!

Vielen Dank, und liebe Grüsse!!"

Btw.. The processor has such a low price because I got it As a combo with the mobo for $100 off.

I'll be using this build for gaming and programming as I get into college next year. I mainly play Starcraft II. Other than that, I'll be trying out Planetside 2 and Splinter Cell Blacklist that came with the video card. Idk if I'll get time to play any other games. I know it might be an overkill but I worked as an intern this summer and just spent most of the money I made on this build to make it last the longest it can by getting better parts.

Finally.. the pics: [HERE](http://imgur.com/a/5BTOt#0) ya go. One thing though, I love taking pics so there might be too much ^.^

I'll be doing some benchmarking and will report the results in an hour or so.

EDIT: Sorry for being late: [here](http://imgur.com/a/TUNPr#0) the bench marking results!

Questions:
1) How long can I expect this PC to live?

2) How long before I need to change the cooler? How long can I expect the Liquid cooler to last without destroying my processor?

3) I haven't tried overclocking yet, is it helpful? I don't really play any high-end games on ultra so.. do I need that speed? Will it hurt my processor's longetivity?

If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to ask. I'll try to answer them."

About 2 months ago it ended while she was away at an internship. We had it rough up until that point of the break up. 

We had done everything but sex and I always pressured her which is one of the reasons why things weren't going so well. The break up was my fault, i'll admit that. I try to get back but this time it wasnt working out. We barely talked and I always told her how much I loved her.

A week a go, I just couldn't take it knowing that she didnt want to be together so we just stopped talking. 

Today I get a call from her from a weird number. She tells me that it's been the 2 worst days of her life. She told me she had been raped. She wanted me to spend the night. There was a lot of talking. At first in my head I try to blame her for being so flirty. It was in my head, she had sex with some random dude but not me. That thought quickly went away though and I felt sorry for her. 

She wanted to spend the night but I couldn't take it. I told her I would drive her to her parents house which I did.

Now I am confused, she wants to be with me, but only after the recent events. Before she didn't want anything to do with me at all. Now she wants me again. I love her to death but I also feel disgusted. I feel like she is using me because I was such a steady part of her life.

I dont know what to do anymore. I just don't know what to do"

We had a good few months together, but I will be moving a couple states over for college very soon and we both knew that. There's no way either of us was gonna let this turn into a long distance relationship cause it was never a real relationship to begin with.

The thing is, he wants to keep in touch and I've been used to clean cut breakups where you just cut off contact completely. At first I thought he was just looking for a biannual source of sex (cause I'd be home for winter break and summer) but when I asked if he would still want to see me if I had a boyfriend he said yes and that we would just hang out as friends. And that I should contact him every few months and just let him know how I'm doing because he likes me.

Also, since I grew up in the Silicon Valley and I'll be studying computer science in college the chances of me being in the same area as him for upcoming summer internships or even indefinitely for a job is very, very plausible. And it's definitely possible that we would be compatible in a long term relationship (provided we're in the same city), there just wasn't enough time to figure that out and I could just be idealizing it.

**tldr**: Had summer fling, he wants to stay in contact, I don't know if I should or what the tangible pros/cons of doing so would be"

I recently had a on-site job interview at a really small company ( 4 people- 2 founders, 1 full time, 1 intern ). They liked what they saw on my resume and I have a decent chance of getting the job. However the policy of the company is that I have to be an intern before I can transition into full time. They also said that in order to be an intern I have to be  a degree seeking student, so I told them that I can re-enroll in my university and seek a minor in Tech Writing. 

The thing is the pay is gonna be very shitty ( I am assuming cause this is a new company ). Another thing is that they have hired a few ChemEs in the past and weren't happy with their performance and let them go. The thing for me is that I would have to be in school ( after I have graduated ) and be an intern, with no guarantee that they can fire me any time they wish. My parents won't support me financially so I would have to do this all on my own. And I don't know if I will get FAFSA seeing how I probably exceed the unit cap.

So my question is : fellow engineers, would you take this offer?

1kov6l,5,2013-08-19,[xpost from /r/relationships] Me[22M] with my Ex [21F] were together for over 5 years and have been broken up for 2 months. She is trying to take my little girls away from me.,tw09,Custody,https://www.reddit.com/r/Custody/comments/1kov6l/xpost_from_rrelationships_me22m_with_my_ex_21f/,"My ex broke up with me out of the blue. She believes that I am manipulative, and I really don't know how. She refuses to tell me how I've been manipulative, and is really mad at me, so we broke up. She has been in Seattle for the last 2.5 months for an internship. She got offered a job while I am going to school 1,800 miles away. She is telling me that she is taking the girls away from the home we've built here. I called a lawyer and I'm really afraid about what is coming next. No one in my family history has gone through separation like this and I don't know how to properly prepare myself.

A little background (optional): We started dating in high school. While in high school, we had our first daughter. She was born in Indiana, about 1,000 miles away from where I live and since I was so close to finishing high school, I stayed and finished. I visited frequently and drove in the middle of the night to see my first little girl be born. She graduated high school at the same time as me and stayed with me over the summer.

I went to a university that fall and she decided to take a semester off before starting and lived with her parents with my first girl. I visited nearly every weekend I could. She started going to the same university that spring and we moved in immediately.

As you can guess, things were very rocky at first. She became controlling, judging and criticizing everything I do. My friends blame her for chasing them away, and as the reason we don't hang out anymore. Things started to get better.
That summer we had a fight. She kept saying how she was taking my first little girl away from me, and started walking away. I know this was wrong, and I am not an abusive person, but I hit her. I immediately regretted it and apologized over and over again. She doesn't forgive me, and I don't blame her. I have never been physical since.

I got a job and we conceived second girl. I worked full time, while going to school at this point and I had a hard time getting time off to take care of her. She holds a grudge against me for this. Around this time is when she came at me during one of our fights and tried to choke me, and dug her nails into me. She has since hit, especially at night.

Around this time her degree became intense. She was required to go to school from 5 p.m. to midnight. I either had to get time off of work, or we had to find a babysitter, or she brought the first girl with her to school. We rarely had sex for a few months.

We had our second girl, and I couldn't be the one to bring her to the hospital because I had to wait for someone to get to work because I was the only one there. I was about 45 minutes late, but she was nowhere near delivery. I was forced to work at 2 p.m. the next day, or lose my job. She holds a grudge about that, too.

After about a month after the second girl, she went on an unnecessary trip through school to Iowa for a week. She did that every year. When I worked, hers or my parents helped watch the girls. When I didn't, it was just me.

Around this time is when she started going out drinking at least once a week. I supported it and even encouraged it.

I worked for a few more months and quit. In reality, I should have quit the day I was asked to stay late, but we needed the money. I mostly quit because she told me that she will need to stay after school every day for the next year. She pretty much did, and I spent a lot of time with the girls. Also, our sex life was incredible up until we ended it in Seattle.

I made sure to keep the home clean for when she came home and took care of everything, otherwise I'd get chewed out. We were busy, so we couldn't go out on dates as much. She was rarely home, so I took my oldest to gymnastics and got everything done.

Also at this time, she started to have an emotional affair for a few months. She distanced herself from her family, always on the computer or phone when she was around. She bashed me to this guy a ton and naturally he began trying to convince her to leave me. I didn't know this was going on so I was planning an engagement. I was so excited. I found all of this out by looking at her phone. She immediately promised to stop.

A month later, she goes on her week long Iowa trip and meets a guy. They don't do much physical other than hug and cuddle all night, but had an emotional affair. This I found out because she left her Facebook logged into my computer when she left and I started to see messages popup between the two of them. I confronted her, she lied, and then I showed her and she left.

She comes back and promises it won't happen again. Things were great for about 5 months. It was like we fell back in love and we were going out on dates. We started looking at houses and talking about a third kid.
Then she started distancing herself. She was always on her computer or phone and ignoring her family. She got an internship in Seattle refused to Skype with me and the girls when she was gone. She says I forced her to go, but that isn't true. I pushed a little bit, because jobs are difficult in her field and this was a great opportunity, but in the end it was her coming to me and saying yes.

(The more important part): I started to get suspicious when she started downloading Skype one night. She admitted that it was for her friend, [Dave]. I asked if we'd Skype, and she said maybe.

For the next week I notice that she is talking to him nearly non stop. I ask confront her about it telling her that I am uncomfortable. She says that nothing is happening, so I sign up for therapy to adjust my trust issues.

When she left for Seattle, she was nearly absent for a couple days. I start wondering and my trust issues get to me, so I sign into her facebook and see all these messages saying that I'm not involved (opening him up to pursue) and start talking about being together. I confront her again and it leads to a break.
I call two days later to break up but she begs to be together. I say yes because I love this girl. She ignores me for the next two days, even though she was available all day, and I admit I overreacted and broke up with her again. We don't talk all week.

We bought roundtrip tickets to Seattle a month before she left, so we fly out. We get back together again, but this time she refuses to say ""I love you"". She yells at me in public about not being there to get the girls (I was cooking dinner) because she couldn't watch them. I find out later that she couldn't watch them because [Dave] was going into deep detail about how he is going to have sex with her.

Throughout this whole time, she is kissing, hugging, cuddling, and asking for sex.

We take a break and eventually break up again. I yell at her like I've never done before. I shouldn't have but my heart was broken.

Another day, I am out touring with the girls, and I come home and she is Skyping [Dave]. He is naked, and she is flashing him. They stopped before the girls could understand what was going on, and then she introduced the girls to him! That drew the line and I started looking for a flight home.

Eventually, through all the emotional stress, I cave and I ask for a break. She agrees, saying that we had good times. We get kicked out of the apartment because there was too many people in the studio.

Things are great for about a week, asks for sex, cuddles, hugs, kisses. When we leave, she even tells me that she loves me. We get home and we talk sometimes (but I give her space). She stops telling me she loves me, doesn't call the girls once (she was gone for over a month without them at all), and eventually breaks up with me saying she needs another relationship.

So we stop talking and out of the blue last night, she tells me that she is taking the girls with her to Seattle, or to live with her mother, saying that she is afraid that I will hit her and the girls and that I have been manipulative. She agreed to couples therapy before she left and now she refuses. I am so heartbroken. I only added the bad details, because we rarely fought, agreed on almost everything, and supported each other. I cannot move to Seattle.

Right now, she is pissed because I won't bring them up to her mothers house, because she flat out said that she won't let me take them back.

I also want to clarify that I've supported her through everything, even when no one did. No one wanted her to go for that major, but I supported it. I supported her being gone from 9 a.m. to midnight everyday. I supported her unnecessary trips to Iowa, drove her to see her family frequently, took her on dates, paid for EVERYTHING, gave her nightly massages, kept the house clean and the girls happy and held her when she cried. I was there for her, but I don't have any proof...

tl;dr: I love my girls and have been there for them through everything. They have a home here. Please, what can I do to make sure she doesn't take them.

I know its long so this is necessary. I just added details that might help.

UPDATES: I talked to a lawyer and I was told that I don't have any legal rights, despite establishing paternity. We were never married and in my state, custody goes to the mother. He literally said that if she takes the girls, there is nothing I can do about it.

She is demanding the girls, she doesn't have her car either. I have been with them for 2.5 months alone, and she hasn't tried calling the girls in the last month.

1kotna,3,2013-08-19,Need advice on salary negotiation for first job offer out of college!,azngoHAPPY,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1kotna/need_advice_on_salary_negotiation_for_first_job/,"I am a graduating MIS major and was just offered $67,000 starting salary in an entry-level IT position with a $2,500 signing bonus. I have already read the sidebar links but am unsure about how to start the process, especially considering there are a few unique aspects of my job.

For example, the position I was offered is not a traditional job title, but one where I'll be doing rotations around the company in various areas ranging from being an analyst, project manager, or application developer--thus making it a little difficult to do the research. 

I have heard from colleagues before in this current position, during my internship with the company, that their salaries were around $70,000. However, they were also CS majors.

While I do have intro to intermediate college course knowledge in Java, C/C++ and Python--I have never actually utilized any of these skills outside of class. However, I have done basic web development with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Wordpress.

**(tl;dr)** So two questions:
1.) How would I initiate the conversation? 
2.) What are some things I can leverage considering my position? (i.e. being an MIS graduate with a BBA)"
1kol12,0,2013-08-19,I am a [22M] who recently broke up with [21F] after 2 years (1 of living together) because I graduated college and had to move back home.,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1kol12/i_am_a_22m_who_recently_broke_up_with_21f_after_2/,"This might be a little long so I apologize, but here goes.

I dated a girl for the last 2 years of college. We did long distance for about 4 months while I did an internship in another city. When I returned from the internship we moved in together for a year, my last year of college. 

We basically met in May of 2011 as coworkers for a summer job and as we got to know each other we became really close friends because we got along so well. For a long time there was physical attraction, but we both only wanted to be friends. We got to know each other really well and at the conclusion of the summer job we started dating in August. Things were so great between us and we decided to stay together when I left for my internship in January 2012.

The long distance was hard, but there was no question that we were going to be fine after I returned from my internship. We moved in together in May 2012 and lived together until June 2013. Living together was great until we returned from winter break in January 2013. She started going home more, going out with friends without me more often, and was almost avoiding me. I tried for a long time to figure out what was wrong with our relationship, but every time I tried to get it out of her she would say ""I don't know"" or it would be some small problem that I would fix.

After a few months of this she finally realized the root of our issues and opened up to me about it. I was graduating in a few months and in order to get a job I would have to move away. She had a semester left of school meaning we would have to do long distance again and she would have to move to a city she might not want to. She had followed a guy to college and regretted the decision ever since, and didn't want to make the same mistake twice.

I tried everything to keep us together because I had never felt this connection with someone before. She agreed to try and fix things, but she never fully committed herself because she was so afraid of me leaving her and felt there wasn't enough time.

Fast forward to our last few weeks in the same city. We were fighting all the time. We avoided each other. Things were really tense. I finally said, ""Fine. It's over. I give up."" We lived together broken up for about 2-3 weeks. Our last 2-3 days together we put aside our differences and really got along well again. The day I left she said she laid in bed and cried all day, and continued to do so for days. It takes a lot for me to cry (I'm not trying to be cool) but I cried once I was home.

Once we were apart I deleted my facebook and stopped talking to her. She wanted to continue being ""best friends"" because she missed me so much, but I couldn't handle it. I felt that I had no choice but to move on, and to do that I needed to cut off all ties.

We've been apart for almost 12 weeks, but neither of us have closure. She reached out to me the other day and wants to see each other again. I am not willing to travel to her city, and she is too busy to come to mine. We are both very prideful and aren't very willing to show when we're hurt, but she swallowed her pride and admitted that our once perfect relationship falling apart is entirely her fault and she regrets it.

Since being apart I have been with other girls, and she has been with other guys but we still miss each other and can't replace each other. We spoke on the phone and we're both still holding onto the idea that we might be in the same city again after she graduates. She says she has never been more homesick and that I was her family where she is.

Here's where the real predicament starts. I don't know if I want her back, but I know I miss her. I wish I knew she didn't want me, or that I was completely over her. I know it hasn't been long enough to get over her, but it is really hard to keep moving on when I compare every girl I meet to her and nothing comes close.

Part of me wants to continue with not talking to her because I have no choice but to keep moving on, and because talking to her hurts so much. The other part of me hates that I moved away and wishes I had done more to stay in the same place as her, and wants to do everything I can to be back with her, but I know it won't happen unless we live in the same city again. I don't think she will move to my city after she graduates. It's highly unlikely. Even if she did move to my city, or close to it, I don't know if I'd want her back but it's the not knowing that kills me. I want answers but I can't get any.

I know I'm still very young and I have plenty of time to move on, but I am not a romantic person with romantic aspirations, but she and I were so close and so compatible that it's hard to move on.

The kicker is that I am not a huge fan of marriage, but she knew she wanted to get married (ideally she wanted to before she graduated college). In order to keep her I was planning to propose this fall shortly before she graduated. Had things not deteriorated I am confident that I would have wanted that.

I'm not really sure what advice I am expecting or anything, but it is at least therapeutic to type it out.

**tl;dr**: Really good relationship. Girlfriend freaks out that I'm graduating and moving away and ruins relationship. In different cities and trying to move on, but both are finding it difficult. Don't know what I want or what to do."
1kogmc,1,2013-08-19,Being laid off from work and feeling like I'm being replaced by friends.,Incendio88,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1kogmc/being_laid_off_from_work_and_feeling_like_im/,"Life keeps getting harder. Im 24, had full time employment until this afternoon, trying to finish my University degree which has take 5 years (possibly one more depending on my repeat exams), a year longer than it should have. I've already dropped out of another degree before this. So thats 6 years of my life in university. I'm still hung up on the same girl who broke up with me a year ago and was for a long time my support structure, my other supporter lives with her and hasn't talked to me in over a week for reasons I just don't know.

Last week I sat my repeat exams, stressed out of my mind, some people helped, but those i rely on just weren't there. Even when they took me out for an evening to get my mind off things I felt ignored. Because both of them are in relationships, the ex-girlfriend is dating a guy from within our circle of friends so its tough. I want to get away from her in particular, but she's at every gathering of the group.

Today I was called into a meeting with my manager and his boss, its a small company with 15 people. They took me on as an intern for 6 months last summer. When I went back to uni for my last year they kept me on part time to help out with projects. When my finals ended they took me on for a short contract with the possibility of it being extended. Today I was told it wouldn't be extended, thats ok, I was struggling with the work, they are a small company and under a lot of pressure from investors.

But its just come at a time when i'm feeling like i'm being replaced by most of the important people in my life. My ex has a new boyfriend, doing stuff with him that I've asked her to do with me but never wanted to. The other friend just hasn't talked to me much like I said, and has yet to talk to about being laid off. I feel like i'm being replaced and pushed out in all the important parts of my life.

I'm 24 and I just don't know where to go in life now. The few supports I have feel like they are disappearing, the job thats helped me through feelings of loneliness, self worth and anxiety issues need someone more competent, my circle of friends doesn't feel like that anymore because I have to deal with my ex and another friend dating.

I'm at a horrible low point and don't know what to do with my life. Starting over feels too painful to even think about, staying the same isn't an option because it's just gonna get to me. I'm not really sure what to do. Thanks for listening to me vomit on the screen about my problems"

I'll be moving to San Francisco for a one-year internship (with a tech company) starting at the end of September. I'm currently looking for a room in the city, preferably somewhere not too far away from Market Street :-). It would be ideal if I could move in sometime between Sep 10 to Sep 23. All I need is a small room with a bed and an Internet connection - I'm not very picky, as long as it's not in a bad neighborhood.

I'll be interning for a full year as a Software Engineer. I studied Computer Science at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH) in Zurich, Switzerland. I'm super easy going and would love to hang out and make some friends :-). Since I'm flying in directly from Switzerland I can also bring over some hand-made chocolate.

Also, some additional questions: Once I get to the US, how and when can I watch the final episodes of Dexter/Breaking Bad? Any additional advice for moving? 

Thanks! :-)"

She is trying to take my little girls away from me.,tw09,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1ko32k/me22m_with_my_ex_21f_were_together_for_over_5/,"My ex broke up with me out of the blue. She believes that I am manipulative, and I really don't know how. She refuses to tell me how I've been manipulative, and is really mad at me, so we broke up. She has been in Seattle for the last 2.5 months for an internship. She got offered a job while I am going to school 1,800 miles away. She is telling me that she is taking the girls away from the home we've built here. I called a lawyer and I'm really afraid about what is coming next. No one in my family history has gone through separation like this and I don't know how to properly prepare myself.

A little background (optional): We started dating in high school. While in high school, we had our first daughter. She was born in Indiana, about 1,000 miles away from where I live and since I was so close to finishing high school, I stayed and finished. I visited frequently and drove in the middle of the night to see my first little girl be born. She graduated high school at the same time as me and stayed with me over the summer.

I went to a university that fall and she decided to take a semester off before starting and lived with her parents with my first girl. I visited nearly every weekend I could. She started going to the same university that spring and we moved in immediately.

As you can guess, things were very rocky at first. She became controlling, judging and criticizing everything I do. My friends blame her for chasing them away, and as the reason we don't hang out anymore. Things started to get better. 

That summer we had a fight. She kept saying how she was taking my first little girl away from me, and started walking away. I know this was wrong, and I am not an abusive person, but I hit her. I immediately regretted it and apologized over and over again. She doesn't forgive me, and I don't blame her. I have never been physical since.

I got a job and we conceived second girl. I worked full time, while going to school at this point and I had a hard time getting time off to take care of her. She holds a grudge against me for this. Around this time is when she came at me during one of our fights and tried to choke me, and dug her nails into me. She has since hit, especially at night.

Around this time her degree became intense. She was required to go to school from 5 p.m. to midnight. I either had to get time off of work, or we had to find a babysitter, or she brought the first girl with her to school. We rarely had sex for a few months.

We had our second girl, and I couldn't be the one to bring her to the hospital because I had to wait for someone to get to work because I was the only one there. I was about 45 minutes late, but she was nowhere near delivery. I was forced to work at 2 p.m. the next day, or lose my job. She holds a grudge about that, too.

After about a month after the second girl, she went on an unnecessary trip through school to Iowa for a week. She did that every year. When I worked, hers or my parents helped watch the girls. When I didn't, it was just me.

Around this time is when she started going out drinking at least once a week. I supported it and even encouraged it.

I worked for a few more months and quit. In reality, I should have quit the day I was asked to stay late, but we needed the money. I mostly quit because she told me that she will need to stay after school every day for the next year. She pretty much did, and I spent a lot of time with the girls. Also, our sex life was incredible up until we ended it in Seattle.

I made sure to keep the home clean for when she came home and took care of everything, otherwise I'd get chewed out. We were busy, so we couldn't go out on dates as much. She was rarely home, so I took my oldest to gymnastics and got everything done.

Also at this time, she started to have an emotional affair for a few months. She distanced herself from her family, always on the computer or phone when she was around. She bashed me to this guy a ton and naturally he began trying to convince her to leave me. I didn't know this was going on so I was planning an engagement. I was so excited. I found all of this out by looking at her phone. She immediately promised to stop.

A month later, she goes on her week long Iowa trip and meets a guy. They don't do much physical other than hug and cuddle all night, but had an emotional affair. This I found out because she left her Facebook logged into my computer when she left and I started to see messages popup between the two of them.

I am looking for advice and/or leads on how to get into the video game development industry in Montreal. I have a B.Sc. in computer science (2004, U of Calgary), but so far, I’ve been mostly working in other fields (GIS technologies and technical writing). I am now looking to start a new career, which is quite a daunting thing to do.

I know there are some large development companies in Montreal (Ubisoft, Bioware, Eidos, etc.) and many other smaller companies, I was wondering if someone here would be willing to share their experience in getting on with any of these. I’d be up for internships, or testing, or basically anything that would get me in the door, as I figured I might as well start low then not at all. I do have a little experience in development (C++, Java, Python), but not a lot. I’d be willing to take some courses if it would help.

Thanks.

1knxcb,0,2013-08-19,My [20F] boyfriend [23M] will be overseas for 2 years and promises he will return to me,r3dd177hr0w4w4y,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1knxcb/my_20f_boyfriend_23m_will_be_overseas_for_2_years/,"We started dating 8 months ago, and have been official for 4 (took a while because he was overseas for 3 of the beginning months). We met through mutual friends at uni.

At the end of next year, he'll be going overseas again for career reasons for 2 years, but plans to ultimately come back and live here permanently. I've known this for a while, but we only just started discussing it. It's a while away, a lot could change before then, but I'd like to settle some of my thoughts now.

For me, I'm not sure what I'll be doing yet - I will likely be going to the same country (we're studying the almost the same degree) for a bit, not sure when or for how long, at least a few months for internships, probably starting from the end of next year too. I too will most probably end up living here.

We both share the view that you should not marry your first girlfriend/boyfriend, and that you should have different perspectives. He also said that he does not expect me to maintain a long distance relationship for 2 years with a guy I've only known for 2 years, and I think I agree that a long distance relationship would be difficult.

We were each other's firsts for many things - first kiss, first sexual experience, first girlfriend for him (he had dated a few girls but did not progress into a relationship), and he'd be my first boyfriend as an adult (my last relationship of around half a year was 4-5 years ago), it was my first time meeting an SO's family, etc. I wasn't really that interested in dating and relationships before I met him. 

Since we both haven't had much experience, I do logically agree that it's inevitable that we probably would not be together (though I'm currently very happy and would be sad to let this go). He said it's probably for the better that he has to leave - he would not be able to bring himself to say me he wants to try different people before making a commitment - even if he really needs to - if he were still here.

We've agreed that we'll remain as friends and continue updating each other on our lives, keep talking online and messaging as we do now. We are compatible in many ways, and I know an amiable friendship can be kept. For now we'll just enjoy things while they last. I don't mind that. Though I do have mixed feelings - I, similarly, would not be able break things off simply for experiencing some other people, so I guess this is a convenient opportunity, but I also obviously like him a lot and would feel a bit weird thinking about him with other people (at least initially). A fairly common situation I'm guessing?

Here's the thing though - he said something along the lines of ""I promise I'll come back to you. When I come back, I'll ask you out again - that's a promise."" He seemed to really mean it. Though it makes me feel safe, I'm not sure about this promise. There's so many complexities involved with a promise like that. He'll be almost 27 when he comes back. People can change a lot in 2 years. And dating others while keeping a promise like that - how does that even work? Just having your ex as a close friend can cause issues with a lot of relationships, but keeping a promise to your ex that you'll return to them - isn't that kind of weird? Perhaps he meant more casual relationships? Or an open relationship kind of thing?. I have no idea, I'll have to clarify later I guess...Has anyone else experienced something like this? What happens when I do go over to that country at some point, which I will... And so many what ifs -  What if when he comes back, our feelings have changed, or one of us is happily attached already, or plans have changed and I end up moving or he ends up moving or whatever? It's a romantic proposition but so hard to keep.

I haven't brought this up with him since our conversation about it last night, but I'm a little confused at the moment, not sure what to think - would like to mull over it a bit before further discussion. Any thoughts, past experiences or stories, advice, etc would be very much appreciated.

I'm very efficient in everything I do. A lot of my fellow students complain that they have too much to do for the courses, and can barely keep up. I do almost nothing for uni and have a shitload of free time. My grades are As and Bs though, and I'm one of the best in most of my courses. I'd never do any ""extra"" activity, like an internship or anything the like, because I'm just not that interested in it. I do a lot of sports as well and I'm very motivated and dedicated once I find something that I'm truely interested in. I'm starting a new bachelor next semester (computer science, which seems to be a favorite of a lot of INTJs), so I suppose that you could argue, that I'm doing something to advance my career/future, but it just doesn't seem enough. On top of that, I get bored very easily.

My big problem is, that I waste a lot of my time. I feel like I could accomplish some awesome stuff with all the spare time I have (especially considering said efficiency), but I let it all go to waste, playing computer games, watching netflix and the like. I usually do my work in the last minute (like writing a 12 paper work in the night before it's due, after having 2 months time for it). It doesn't really hurt my grades, but I still feel like I'm throwing my potential away.

What do you guys do to avoid this?

1knpdc,3,2013-08-19,I believe eating out is cheaper than cooking your own groceries. I am a college student. CMV,[deleted],changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1knpdc/i_believe_eating_out_is_cheaper_than_cooking_your/,"**MORE IMPORTANTLY**, I would like to know more about the factors involved in Eating Out VS Home Cooking. I understand that conditions vary from student to student, but I am uncomfortable with the vast amount of Home Cooking recommendations from numerous experienced individuals in my life. 

My current estimates are like this:

    Monetary value of my time:
        $10 per 60mins (campus pays this much for volunteers in psychology experiments)

    Eating out:
        $8 expenses (price of cafeteria all-you-can-eat buffet during holidays)

    Cooking at dorm:
        $2 expenses (about $15 per week as suggested)
        $? storage expenses (I can't estimate fridge and electric bill)
        10mins shopping (about 1hr per week)
        15mins preparing vegetables
        15mins cooking
        10mins washing dishes
        10mins cleaning kitchen and table

* Assuming storage expenses are irrelevant...
* Cooking at dorm = 1 hour saving $6 each day. 
* If I spent that hour participating in a psychology experiment instead, I would have gained $4. 
* Given my educational/family background, I expect to make significantly more than $10 an hour in the future.

----

**Guiding Questions**

* Are there any unrealistic estimates?

* Are there any estimates that may change when transitioning to independent life outside the campus bubble?

* Are there any factors I haven't accounted for?


I want to regularly cook my own food to impress my family and friends (it'll definitely make my mom really happy). My new dorm has its own living room and kitchen that will go to waste if I don't use it (my three other roommates definitely have no intention of cooking). But I'm also short on time from being thoroughly undecided during the first two years of my college life. I am playing catch-up in courses, internships and my portfolio. 

Thank you in advance, for any input. "
1knhcq,10,2013-08-19,I'm fine in my bubble but can't handle anything outside of it.,[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1knhcq/im_fine_in_my_bubble_but_cant_handle_anything/,"When I'm at home or with my friends, I feel fine, great even. I have a better image of myself and feel more hopeful. If I know the situation is safe, like meeting friends with a friend already there, I can be much more of my good self. Anytime I think outside of that though, I can't handle it and put myself in a slump.  
  
I'm lucky to have people in my life, like my mom, siblings, friends, etc. I can talk to my mom about my problems and what I'm going through.  
  
When I think about things like getting a job (which I especially need to do sometime soon), getting a relationship, getting new friends, being in school, talking to people in school, talking to professors, having demands put on me, constantly look for opportunities, etc, I can't handle it.  
  
I instantly go from feeling my normal state to depressed. I get out of it a lot faster (I think thanks to the medicine) but still.  
  
I've held one job 6 years ago as a bagger and could only handle it for a month. I don't even know why I didn't like it. Having demands put on me, standing still for a long time, being drained and bored out of my mind, etc. I know it's supposed to be boring but I don't how other people can tolerate it. I can't even pinpoint a reason.      
  
I tried meeting new people and girls for the past few semesters, but it was incredibly draining and nothing came of it. I hate college. I feel like I'm wasting so much potential by being there and can't utilize it. Other people make friends, have relationships, network, talk to professors, have jobs, join clubs, do internships, get recommendations, etc, and all I do is sit in a chair on my laptop all day just trying to block out the screaming loneliness. I talk to people (very rarely) in class and they might say hi to me, but I have no friends. I hung out with someone once outside of class, my first outside-class-hangout, and I was incredibly anxious the entire time.  
  
I hate this. Every time I think about the future and what I need to do to actually function, I always think about dying. It's just such an easier option and I'd never have to deal with any of this shit. I know there's people in my life and stuff, but it's just so much burden on me that I automatically think about it when I think about the future. I never want to put effort into anything, and the times I've tried, I wasn't any happier or successful from it. I might've learned things, but not anything useful apparently. It's just too much stress to get out there and place myself in the world. I just want to be on my laptop at home all the time. Or like those chairs in Wall-E. I found a therapist I liked and it hasn't been that long but hopefully something can happen."
1kn570,3,2013-08-18,Wondering About a Double Major Comp Sci/Comp Eng,1ibertyordeath,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1kn570/wondering_about_a_double_major_comp_scicomp_eng/,"I'm about to be a Senior in high school and I was wondering if there were any huge benefits to this. I work managing a cloud server that backs up data for schools/businesses. I also currently work with a firm that specializes in SEO/Web Design/Video Marketing and basically any other marketing. I make a decent amount of money from that and it's taught me a lot of things, but I'm looking towards a Network Security/Computer Security type job, or that's at least what I plan to do after College. 

So my question is, would a double major help me get a job in that field or would it be extraneous? 

I've also dabbled with the idea of staying an extra semester or two and getting a minor in Chinese or another language. I don't have to worry about College expenses as my other jobs, which are long term part-time, and very flexible, can easily cover the costs. 

Assuming I pursued the the same amount of internships, which is the better use of my time? Going and just getting the computer science degree, double majoring, or going and double majoring + the minor in a foreign language?

Thanks for your help."
1kn228,1,2013-08-18,Me [26M] bothered by attempts of former friend to contact me.,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1kn228/me_26m_bothered_by_attempts_of_former_friend_to/,"Through a circle of friends I [then 24M] met someone [then 18 or 19F] with whom I rapidly developed a rather intense friendship.  We talked about everything, exchanged gifts in the mail, texted all the time.  At one point I developed a crush, but I am asexual and those feelings, while they can be painful and beyond my understanding when in the moment, are not serious and pass with time.  When I told her, she did not return those feelings but appreciated my candor so much that she said she wanted to keep me as close a friend as possible.  This seemed like a strong sentiment so early in a friendship, but I appreciated it at the time and reciprocated.  It foreshadowed her approach to all kinds of relationships, though.


Anyway, a year or so later we had a falling out over her boyfriend, who also is in that circle.  He was/is Creepy.  This is why: His attempt to seduce one of my closest friends involved forcing kisses on her when he had invited her and me to crash at his house one night.  That was after he isolated her in his bedroom (it had two beds) by assigning me to a couch in another room.  After being rebuffed, he mocked her behind her back for years for her eating disorder and other cruel things.  All the people I know about that Creepy pursued were girls with self-esteem issues, bad relationships with parents, and in their late teens (admittedly he was also in his late teens while he was molesting my close friend, but he is my age).


My friend had/has those issues.  She often expressed the feeling that she was never good enough for her friends and that she was afraid she'd do something to drive me away.  I said there probably wasn't one individual thing she could do that would make me stop being her friend because I felt there was a great deal of trust between us.


I saw signs that Creepy was after her, and I tried to discourage her from entering a relationship.  She even communicated with my friend that Creepy molested.  He was persistent, though.  He bought her hundreds of dollars worth of gifts.  He found her a summer internship near him using his work connections and had her move into his apartment rather than find a place of her own and without her family's knowledge.  She only told me about all this when it wouldn't be possible for her to hide that she was living with him anymore, and I was harsh and said how disappointed I was in her.  Even if Creepy was perfectly ordinary, I think I could say she was making irresponsible choices.  She had been hiding things for months and said she did so to protect my feelings, but I think moreso because she knew I'd disapprove.


She was angry at me for my harshness.  I felt like I couldn't trust her to be open with me anymore, and that our close as possible friendship was more distant than I understood.  We stopped talking.


Last fall, I felt remorseful for how negatively our friendship had ended and I sent her an email.  The gist was that I'd prefer to think of her as a friend that I grew apart from and that I didn't want to end our friendship with animosity.  She was eager to reestablish contact.  I tried briefly, but it was too uncomfortable.  I just wanted to apologize for how I acted and to bring closure, not reconcile necessarily.  I filtered all her emails to the trash folder and soon after stopped communicating with that whole circle in general.  Life took some turns and I couldn't make time for them, nor did I think it was a good idea to, anyway, given that Creepy was among them.


In May, I was looking in my trash for a receipt and saw an email from her.  I deleted it unopened, but I was bothered by how she was still trying after (then) over half a year.


Last month, a friend of mine told me she contacted him, asking if I was ""still alive"" and if I was upset with her.  I've never known someone to seek info on me like that, and I felt even worse.  It's sneaky and felt like a violation of my privacy (she has my phone number, she could have called if she was deeply concerned for my well-being).


I [now 26M] remain bothered...  It's been well over a year since we've been anything resembling friends, and nearly a year since our last real contact.  I don't wish her [now 21?F] any ill, I hope very much that she either gets away from Creepy or that he's a changed man, but I don't see the point in trying to be friends without trust.  Why won't she leave me alone?  I now regularly go into my trash and clear it while covering my screen with a sheet of paper.  How do I get over this anxiety?  What am I even anxious about?

1kn117,1,2013-08-18,Academic research assistant (RA) vs private experience for graduates,mikeyinthesfl,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1kn117/academic_research_assistant_ra_vs_private/,"Abstract:
I'm wondering how experience working in CS research (as an RA) in a university is looked at in recent graduates. Again, this is for academia, not private R&amp;D.  How does that compare to a grad who, let's say worked as a webmaster for a local business or did an internship, etc. while in school?

Full Text:
I'm computer science undergrad and currently working for the cryptology and infosec research  group at my university.  I work for 2 different professors in that group. One is Python, the other is mixed C++ and Java.  Very interesting work and security is definitely my area of interest. My job is mostly number theory and linear algebra, neither of which I knew much about when I started but both of which I learned a lot about.  I'm not an RA (no assistantship), just a cryptology programmer (paid as an undergrad student assistant).  I might be able to apply for RA positions if/when I get grad status.  My grades are excellent (but I've heard that grades don't mean squat when you apply to a company after graduation, it's all about what you can or cannot do).  

Right now, I'm the only undergrad (in either math or cs) that I'm aware of that actually works in a research group (undergrads are almost always directed-independent-study meaning they paid to take a class to be allowed to do something for the prof).  Everyone else is mostly grad (mostly phd students) or the actual senior professors in charge, so it can get intimidating sometimes.  I try to be as helpful as possible, write the cleanest code possible, ask for the fewest explanations, and do my work as quickly as possible with the highest level of quality I am capable of.  Basically I just try to shut my mouth, and make myself as 'small' as possible.  I guess I'm like 'beaker', like a lab assistant but for cryptology.  I truly enjoy my work and my programming skills have gotten noticeably better, and the extra math really let's me understand more in my classes.

My question is, am I better off staying in this job, going for the master's in cs (another semester and I can apply), and going for an RA position?  Or better to try to work for private companies as a coder?  If you vote for me going after an RA position, then should it be in the CS dept or should I try to keep my position with crypto as well?  This is already 2 jobs for me now, so would it advisable to try for an internship or part-time in industry on top of this?

I met the guy and he seemed like a cool guy and asked me what I knew. I told him I made an android app and made a few games and programs in Java, made a few flash games that are on the Internet and am currently learning the D programing language and made a program that prints pi to the billionth digit very quickly. 

I asked a few of those ""What would I do if I were working in your company?"" questions and we engaged in small talk for a couple of minutes and said bye and left.

I've tried making submissions on this subreddit and others (under different accounts) and forums but usually they just die away without a reply. Considering that I have nowhere else to turn, I would really appreciate advice (no matter how simple or concise it is). I'll try to keep this short.

I've completed around 60 hours of coursework at a good state university with a top 15 business school. I was planning on getting a business major but was rejected from entering the business school this summer. I'm paying out-of-state tuition, so to me, it seems reasonable that I should transfer and get the degree I originally came for instead of settling for a degree that I don't want.

I like to think that I'm intelligent. I had poor grades in high school but got into my current university because I scored in the 97% percentile on the SAT. have a decent academic record in college. My GPA is 3.33, mostly because of poor performance during my first fall semester. This last semester I took 21 credit hours and came out with a 3.55. I have a decent list of extra-curricular involvement that's relevant to my major.  

So school starts in a week and it makes no sense to go back since I can't get a degree that I want there. I hope to either take a semester or two off until the point where I can submit transfer applications. Right now I'm working a part time job at a fast food restaurant and desperately want to get something that will make me more appealing to a school, but as you might imagine, internship opportunities are sparse on such short notice.

I've been submitting applications to open positions but haven't heard anything back, despite tailored cover letters and résumés. I feel like I'm completely screwed right now and in a hopeless situation, but I'm really eager to try anything that will help me out of it.

Can /r/jobs offer me any advice?

I'm a student, but this summer I got an amazing internship that pays really well. If you were to extrapolate my income for the entire year, I would make approximately $48,000. So, appropriately, the government is taxing me based on expected earnings. I claimed zero dependents, I'm single, and my parents are claiming me on their taxes as a dependent. All state, federal, SS, and Medicare taxes total about 28% of my weekly paychecks currently. 

However, my internship is only for the summer, and throughout the year, I expect to make only a few hundred a month. My estimated actual earnings will be around $19,000. What kind of tax refund am I looking at come April? The difference between $48k and $19k is huge... Someone said I could get around a $4,000 tax refund. Is that true? Seems way high to me. But I also used TurboTax's calculator, and the difference between $48k and $19k was about $4k in taxes...

I was diagnosed with OCD when I was in elementary school, although my parents didn't tell me I had OCD until I graduated high school.  

Compulsive bathing (not based on contamination obsessions) and reassurance-seeking are my biggest ticks.  About 2.5 years ago I found myself taking 3-4 hour baths as many times a day as possible.  I began calling off of work because I couldn't get out of the bathtub.  I started seeing a therapist for my OCD for the first time then.  I met my fiance, was able to start taking showers and stop taking baths, and even made some huge strides in my reassurance-seeking.  

I'm getting married in 32 days, so my stress levels are through the roof and that reassurance-seeking is back.  The problem is that I continually seek the reassurance from the worst possible sources (i.e. my mother) and it's bringing a significant amount of frustration into my relationship.  My fiance is so patient and loving but he just doesn't understand that I literally cannot help it.  He's at the end of his rope, I think.  

To make matters worse, I am living in a new city where I don't have access to a doctor.  I called a local interns' clinic who offer income-based sliding scale payments.  They said they will evaluate which intern is most appropriate for my case and they will call me back to schedule an appointment.  

What do I do in the meantime?  I feel like I've forgotten everything my therapist told me a few years ago and I'm panicking.  Does anyone have any advice or help?

I was diagnosed with ADHD at a very young age and was treated for it all through grade school until I graduated. I stopped medicating and taking advantage of help when I first entered college. I think this was a pride issue along with the thought that the real world wouldn't give a crap about my condition. For the most part I've done alright in college, except for last year and especially last Spring. It was my fourth year of college and I was on track to graduate this December. Last Spring I failed two classes and got a D in another. I just couldn't get organized last semester and it severely affected my grades. Now I won't be able to graduate until May and I'm costing myself and my parents a lot more money. This Summer I've been at an internship and still haven't managed to get my act together.


What really opened my eyes though was a whole debacle with getting approval to live off campus. I never filled out the paperwork because I forgot about it. I went to residence life and was told the only way I would be approved would be to either get married or be approved my disabilities to live off campus. Well, I wasn't going to suddenly get married so I went to the disabilities office with my ADHD diagnosis and they told me I needed to get a doctor's letter to be approved for off campus but in the meantime, I could be approved for other services like extended test time or extended due dates. After a lot of hassle and having my parents get involved, I got approval to live off campus. This whole ordeal, as well as my last years performance has really shown me that I need to get my act together if I'm going to be a successful person. My parents insurance, which I'm still on, is changing soon but as soon as that is all settled I'm going to find a psychiatrist near me and get counseling and get back on medication. I'm happy with myself now and although I'm still struggling right now, soon it will all be better and I can focus on being a functioning person again.

Really need to work on sticking points.",-Golden,GothamSeddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/GothamSeddit/comments/1kqs2c/fr_more_fun_slow_night_lollipops_6set_harvard/,"Writing up the FR to internalize, but also welcome feedback on how to improve. Feels like my sticking points are directing the interaction after hookup, and building attraction before comfort. Maybe I'm reading myself wrong though! whatya think?

Met up with G-Lover and Mark at 13th Step.
We spend maybe 10 min just chilling, I'm itching to approach but don't see anyone hot and am also anxious. Mark points out a random set and tells me to ask them about the lollipop. Thanks for the encouragement dude!

&gt; 	1) I warmed up with a 2set, HB5 and HB6. ""What's with the lollipop?"" 
&gt; 	HB5 said points to a waitress who was passing out shots and giving lollipops if you took one. Said the shot was bad but I should get one. I asked the HB6 to get one for me since she's closer. She said I could get it easier since I can use my manly charm. (something weird to that extent) I'm bored and not into them anyway, I leave.
	
Sit back with Mark and G-Lover and a 6set sits at the table my stool is at, I'm facing the other way and don’t open. Mostly girls I think, white girls, maybe 1 or 2 were attractive but I didn't pay too much attention just chilling with Mark and G-Lover standing nearby.

&gt; 	2) One of the girls behind me keeps rubbing onto my back as she interacts with the group. After a while I'm also itching to approach so I turn around and say ""Well as long as we're neighbors best to get to know each other"" Introduce myself, ask what brings the group out. She says they're just out for Thirsty Thursday. I fluff about what's been on my mind lately. Ask her what she thinks about an apartment being 15min from the subway (I'm lookin to move to NY). In hindsight, pretty 'meh' convo. Looking back I should have engaged the whole group, just for the lulz. No big deal, I wasn't into any of them.

Mark and G-Lover decide its time they start approaching and I lose them for a bit. Eventually meet them in the back. Almost immediately I notice a sexy Asian HB8 in the corner with 2 dudes and Indian HB6. Again Mark with the clutch motivation speech!

&gt; 	3a) As I am walking almost straight across the room, HB6 notices and starts to make room for me. She stumbles so I gently help move her to the side and introduce myself, handshake. What brings you all out tonight? Turns out HB8's last day on the job so just out to say bye. Talking to HB8 I learn she's going on vacation Shanghai. I tell her how I love Shanghainese accent (odd, but true.) we chat about me travelling for work &amp; pleasure, turns out I once worked near where she grew up after moving to US, her being from Korea what does she identify more as Korean or American. How she likes NY from this internship and will return after graduating. (Harvard) All in all, solid. Some kino, close to her the whole time. I don't know if she was attracted though, or if I just skipped into comfort. Anyway, at some point I just ejected. 

Talked to Mark, who says it seemed to go well, I should get her #. I said I much rather setup a date and then # is just part of logistics. I find her and re-open.

&gt; 	3b) ""Hey lets go out on a date this weekend"" (Don't remember if I said 'Date' but I wasn't specific about the activity. I know should have date ideas prepared.) She said she'd like to but is flying out tomorrow (oops! Shoulda checked this in first interaction)she then said she'll be back before going to college, told me the dates. I take her # and say I'll get back to her when she returns. I tell her how on my long flights it helps me to drunk before the flight so I pass out for the ride. She agrees ""that’s the plan!""

Go back to Mark, who aptly reminds me 'dude, you're not gonna see her when she returns, you should try to close tonight'. As soon as he said it I realized the err in my ways. Thanks Mark! I wanted to re-open but felt like approaching some others first would be good for me instead of opening her 3x times in a row. I then wasted a lot of time not approaching and it was almost 12, I need to leave for NJ. I need to approach soon, or just re-open HB8 and leave.

&gt; 	4) HB7 walks by, I hesitate. She comes by again a few min later. I ask her what brings her out, she says 'what? To party obviously' and then just turns away. Meh. I leave it at that.

Unphased, I know what have to do, since clock is ticking.

&gt; 	3c) Time to re-open HB8. Ask her about her progress in getting drunk, she say's she's not too bad only 6. (I realize in hindsight, why am I asking her how drunk she is?? Dumb.) I say I gotta get going soon, come grab food with me on St Marks. She says she can't, introduces me to her roommmate an Indian HB7. I say hi, and then leave soon after.

Overall I think he interaction was 'okay' it was definitely one of my better ones. Probably 'meh' for many of you.

I'm not sure if there was any attraction. (Thoughts?) I think aside from not really leading the interaction after a set hooks, my other sticking point is just building attraction."
1kqlzs,2,2013-08-20,"In a little fix: What is the timeline etiquette of offer acceptance, when I am waiting for another opportunity to confirm its future?",runtothesun,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1kqlzs/in_a_little_fix_what_is_the_timeline_etiquette_of/,"So question for you guys regarding timeline of pending offers. 

I currently intern at a big 4 media company in tv news, but graduated with my grade degree 2 weeks ago. As a result, the internship is ending in 2 weeks and school is now done. 

A month ago, I interviewed at a marketing agency that does ratings analytics (my field), and was just called this morning with an offer, albeit below the salary level I requested, but it's a solid opportunity. 

Here's the problem: I have two weeks notice from this Wednesday (if I accept, the new job starts August 4th) and when I spoke with the hiring manager, I told him I wanted to take some time to think about the offer and I will get back to him tomorrow - I said this because I wasn't sure what else to do regarding talking this over with some friends and family. However, I just found out, post phone call, that I might be able to secure a full time position here at the media company, moving my year long internship to a salaried position. Ideally this is WAY more preferable than the other position because I have experience, friendships, and a love for this current internship. To discuss this chance to stay here, is on Friday with my current supervisor as I set up a meeting with her moments ago. 

Can I tell the hiring manager at the media agency that I wanted more time to consider this offer, or will this be perceived negatively and could result in them pulling it before I officially sign? Ideally I want to see how Friday will pan out, then get back to other company on acceptance, if I know my internship will end indefinitely. 

Any information helps guys.

1kqehk,2,2013-08-20,"[xpost /r/relationships, /r/custody] Me[22M] with my Ex [21F] were together for over 5 years and have been broken up for 2 months. She is trying to take my little girls away from me.",tw09,Divorce,https://www.reddit.com/r/Divorce/comments/1kqehk/xpost_rrelationships_rcustody_me22m_with_my_ex/,"My ex broke up with me out of the blue. She believes that I am manipulative, and I really don't know how. She refuses to tell me how I've been manipulative, and is really mad at me, so we broke up. She has been in Seattle for the last 2.5 months for an internship. She got offered a job while I am going to school 1,800 miles away. She is telling me that she is taking the girls away from the home we've built here. I called a lawyer and I'm really afraid about what is coming next. No one in my family history has gone through separation like this and I don't know how to properly prepare myself.

A little background (optional): We started dating in high school. While in high school, we had our first daughter. She was born in Indiana, about 1,000 miles away from where I live and since I was so close to finishing high school, I stayed and finished. I visited frequently and drove in the middle of the night to see my first little girl be born. She graduated high school at the same time as me and stayed with me over the summer.

I went to a university that fall and she decided to take a semester off before starting and lived with her parents with my first girl. I visited nearly every weekend I could. She started going to the same university that spring and we moved in immediately.

As you can guess, things were very rocky at first. She became controlling, judging and criticizing everything I do. My friends blame her for chasing them away, and as the reason we don't hang out anymore. Things started to get better. That summer we had a fight. She kept saying how she was taking my first little girl away from me, and started walking away. I know this was wrong, and I am not an abusive person, but I hit her. I immediately regretted it and apologized over and over again. She doesn't forgive me, and I don't blame her. I have never been physical since.

I got a job and we conceived second girl. I worked full time, while going to school at this point and I had a hard time getting time off to take care of her. She holds a grudge against me for this. Around this time is when she came at me during one of our fights and tried to choke me, and dug her nails into me. She has since hit, especially at night.

Around this time her degree became intense. She was required to go to school from 5 p.m. to midnight. I either had to get time off of work, or we had to find a babysitter, or she brought the first girl with her to school. We rarely had sex for a few months.

We had our second girl, and I couldn't be the one to bring her to the hospital because I had to wait for someone to get to work because I was the only one there. I was about 45 minutes late, but she was nowhere near delivery. I was forced to work at 2 p.m. the next day, or lose my job. She holds a grudge about that, too.
After about a month after the second girl, she went on an unnecessary trip through school to Iowa for a week. She did that every year. When I worked, hers or my parents helped watch the girls. When I didn't, it was just me.

Around this time is when she started going out drinking at least once a week. I supported it and even encouraged it.

I worked for a few more months and quit. In reality, I should have quit the day I was asked to stay late, but we needed the money. I mostly quit because she told me that she will need to stay after school every day for the next year. She pretty much did, and I spent a lot of time with the girls. Also, our sex life was incredible up until we ended it in Seattle.

I made sure to keep the home clean for when she came home and took care of everything, otherwise I'd get chewed out. We were busy, so we couldn't go out on dates as much. She was rarely home, so I took my oldest to gymnastics and got everything done.

Also at this time, she started to have an emotional affair for a few months. She distanced herself from her family, always on the computer or phone when she was around. She bashed me to this guy a ton and naturally he began trying to convince her to leave me. I didn't know this was going on so I was planning an engagement. I was so excited. I found all of this out by looking at her phone. She immediately promised to stop.

A month later, she goes on her week long Iowa trip and meets a guy. They don't do much physical other than hug and cuddle all night, but had an emotional affair. This I found out because she left her Facebook logged into my computer when she left and I started to see messages popup between the two of them. I confronted her, she lied, and then I showed her and she left.

She comes back and promises it won't happen again. Things were great for about 5 months. It was like we fell back in love and we were going out on dates. We started looking at houses and talking about a third kid. Then she started distancing herself. She was always on her computer or phone and ignoring her family. She got an internship in Seattle refused to Skype with me and the girls when she was gone. She says I forced her to go, but that isn't true. I pushed a little bit, because jobs are difficult in her field and this was a great opportunity, but in the end it was her coming to me and saying yes.

(The more important part): I started to get suspicious when she started downloading Skype one night. She admitted that it was for her friend, [Dave]. I asked if we'd Skype, and she said maybe.

For the next week I notice that she is talking to him nearly non stop. I ask confront her about it telling her that I am uncomfortable. She says that nothing is happening, so I sign up for therapy to adjust my trust issues.
When she left for Seattle, she was nearly absent for a couple days. I start wondering and my trust issues get to me, so I sign into her facebook and see all these messages saying that I'm not involved (opening him up to pursue) and start talking about being together. I confront her again and it leads to a break. I call two days later to break up but she begs to be together. I say yes because I love this girl. She ignores me for the next two days, even though she was available all day, and I admit I overreacted and broke up with her again. We don't talk all week.

We bought roundtrip tickets to Seattle a month before she left, so we fly out. We get back together again, but this time she refuses to say ""I love you"". She yells at me in public about not being there to get the girls (I was cooking dinner) because she couldn't watch them. I find out later that she couldn't watch them because [Dave] was going into deep detail about how he is going to have sex with her.

Throughout this whole time, she is kissing, hugging, cuddling, and asking for sex.

We take a break and eventually break up again. I yell at her like I've never done before. I shouldn't have but my heart was broken.

Another day, I am out touring with the girls, and I come home and she is Skyping [Dave]. He is naked, and she is flashing him. They stopped before the girls could understand what was going on, and then she introduced the girls to him! That drew the line and I started looking for a flight home.

Eventually, through all the emotional stress, I cave and I ask for a break. She agrees, saying that we had good times. We get kicked out of the apartment because there was too many people in the studio.

Things are great for about a week, asks for sex, cuddles, hugs, kisses. When we leave, she even tells me that she loves me. We get home and we talk sometimes (but I give her space). She stops telling me she loves me, doesn't call the girls once (she was gone for over a month without them at all), and eventually breaks up with me saying she needs another relationship.

So we stop talking and out of the blue last night, she tells me that she is taking the girls with her to Seattle, or to live with her mother, saying that she is afraid that I will hit her and the girls and that I have been manipulative. She agreed to couples therapy before she left and now she refuses. I am so heartbroken. I only added the bad details, because we rarely fought, agreed on almost everything, and supported each other. I cannot move to Seattle.

Right now, she is pissed because I won't bring them up to her mothers house, because she flat out said that she won't let me take them back.

I also want to clarify that I've supported her through everything, even when no one did. No one wanted her to go for that major, but I supported it. I supported her being gone from 9 a.m. to midnight everyday. I supported her unnecessary trips to Iowa, drove her to see her family frequently, took her on dates, paid for EVERYTHING, gave her nightly massages, kept the house clean and the girls happy and held her when she cried. I was there for her, but I don't have any proof...

tl;dr: I love my girls and have been there for them through everything. They have a home here. Please, what can I do to make sure she doesn't take them.

I know its long so this is necessary. I just added details that might help.

UPDATES: I talked to a lawyer and I was told that I don't have any legal rights, despite establishing paternity. We were never married and in my state, custody goes to the mother. He literally said that if she takes the girls, there is nothing I can do about it.

She is demanding the girls, she doesn't have her car either. I have been with them for 2.5 months alone, and she hasn't tried calling the girls in the last month."

Not sure if this is the appropriate place to post this or not, but here-goes.

So my question is, how does one enter the industry? Especially considering that I am already a mid-level engineer and wouldn't really consider and internship or something really junior like that. 

Do I need to continuously spam the big players with my resume until some thing pops up? Do I find a smaller game dev and do some startup work? Do I have to create my own project and showcase it?

Any advice would be appreciated."

Back in 2010 I was laid off from my music publishing job as we were bought by another company.  I found work again a year later doing music licensing and it just did not pan out as they were a small company and it was one of those things that just did not fit.  My time at my first company was much better.  I was there for 5 years and it was the job I first got out of college after interning there my senior year.  I moved up to a decent spot from Intern to Assistant to Coordinator of Creative where I brought in actual big revenue dollars for the company.  

Now since July 2011 I haven't had full-time, salaried work despite applying to many jobs that fit my experience.  I wanted to take a step up as I felt I was ready for that.  And I was going to get a job in LA but they decided to hire from within.  I was the clear cut best candidate outside of the company.  And this was a big company, so I felt I warranted those feelings.  

Now it's been 2 years and I have had 2 interviews despite a very good, detailed resume listing my accomplishments, not tasks.  When I got laid off in 2010 they set us up with a company who would help us with resume writing and such.  

I am now willing to take a step back for an assistant/coordinator position if it means that I can prove to myself and to another company that I can be the best hire they have.  I have a lot of confidence in myself and what I can accomplish.  My philosophy is this...if a baseball player can take a minor league deal and prove he belongs on the major league roster, why can't I take an assistant position and in a year or so, show that I'm capable of being a great hire.  

I'm really stuck in a rough spot.  It's almost like I'm too good to be an assistant but don't have enough WOW factor to be a manager.  HELP!!! "
1kppcb,25,2013-08-20,"Best non-workstation-GPU for a workstation? Also, the murky topic of modding/bios flashing a GTX card to run Quadro drivers...",savage_loins,buildapc,https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/1kppcb/best_nonworkstationgpu_for_a_workstation_also_the/,"I'm an arch student and I recently put together an i7-3930k build for doing CAD, raytracing and adobe work for school as well as internships. It's beautifully fast - what with the SSD (intel 520), ample ram (16gb - haven't used it up yet) and *beauty* of a processor - seriously guys, this 3930k is legiitt, especially compared to the Athlon x4 620 of my old build.

Anyways, my GPU is a reference HD6850 recycled in from my old build. It's been holding up quite well, since I'm not really a gamer (or at least a hi-res gamer... I still go for some civ 3 or some KSP from time to time...) and the tasks I perform are much, much more CPU-intensive than GPU-intensive. For the *most* part.

Now, I don't regret having spent well over a third of my U.S. $1.3k budget on the processor - I'd take twelve sexy threads of CPU power over GPU power any day of the week - but I'm starting to think *maybe I can do both...*

I'm thinking this because I've started to find that my performance in the viewport is a bit lacking in the openGL-based programs I've been using -- namely Rhino 5 and SketchUp -- i.e. I need to turn layers off for things to run smoothly once models start getting big (100+mb in rhino). Similarly, things get slow in PS/indesign/illustrator from time to time in ""viewport""-related tasks (e.g. rotating/resizing a heavy pdf, but not applying a filter e.g. gaussian blur). Now AutoCAD runs like a champ, even on the gigantic million-xref dwg's I work with from the arch studio I'm interning at. It could be better, but it's like comparing butter to melted butter.

From what I've read, GTX-series cards are actually *better* performers in DX11 viewports (i.e. autocad) than their Quadro counterparts. However, it's the opposite with openGL viewports and 2D work (i.e. adobe suite). I could be wrong - this is minimal research. But what I've definitely found is that **for the sub-$1000 budget, Quadros / workstation GPUs are not worth it.** I could be wrong. Call me out.

What a friend told me - along with some more minimal internet research - is that the main difference between GTX and workstation cards, besides the whopping VRAM, is the drivers they run; furthermore, it is possible to flash the BIOS on the video card (something which sounds terrifying, but potentially not terrifying after extensive research, like overclocking... or building a computer...) and I think do some small hardware mod (short like two contacts on the PCB?) and then voila: your GTX card now runs Quadro drivers and thus performs *like butter* in CAD viewports and 2D GPU work (adobe suite), in exchange for a small performance hit in gaming applications (which I honestly do not mind exchanging at all).

This could also be completely wrong. Please let me know.


In any case, if everything I said was true, then I'm leaning towards getting one of the 3GB models of the GTX770 - it fits pretty comfortably in my budget - and going in the direction of the Quadro BIOS flashing or whatnot after some research; I could wait and save more money if it's really worth it, or spend less if it isn't (and then put everything underwater with the leftover $... hehehe), but I'm definitely not going to shell out $1K+ on a workstation GPU.

Thanks in advance for any insight."

Unfortunately, I don't have any prior accounting internship experience, but I do have an accounting internship lined up for this winter (post-graduation) at a Fortune 500 manufacturer.

My question regards how to leverage (if at all) my upcoming winter internship when talking to public accounting firms about internship opportunities for next summer.

* Can I/should I list my upcoming internship on my resume/cover letters, even though I haven't started it yet? Especially because I don't have any other accounting experience, I feel this knowledge of an upcoming internship could add weight to my application, as it will show that I will have professional experience prior to starting a summer internship. Am I wrong? To be clear, I would just be listing the company name and a brief statement that I'll working there in the winter.

I'd appreciate any advice on my situation! Thanks!"
1ktri1,3,2013-08-21,How to leave an internship for another one after already verbally committing to it?,ineedajob1234,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1ktri1/how_to_leave_an_internship_for_another_one_after/,"I have been working at my internship since the beginning of the year, and one of the reasons I was hired over other candidates was because I told them I would be able to stay long-term. This is why they kept me over the summer, and because I previously had no plans to find another job, I told them I could stay for the fall semester. I like the job, but it is not relevant to my major, and I am getting to the point where it is crucial to start gaining experience if I hope to get a job in my major when I graduate. I've begun looking for jobs relating to my major, and I even got called in for an interview for one of them. The only problem is, I don't know how to quit my job because I feel like I will be letting them down after I already said I could stay. Also, I need to cut into some of my already scheduled work time so that I can interview for this other job. So my questions for you guys are:

* 1) How should I go about quitting this internship (if I get offered the other job)? 
* 2) They know that I don't intend to stay forever, as this job isn't relevant to my major, but they expected me to at least be there for the fall. Should I give any indication that I am looking for something new?
* 3) Should I tell the truth when I ask them if I can come in later on the date that I have the interview for the other job? 
* 4) Should I list my current boss as a reference? 


Thanks! "

It's helping?",[deleted],kratom,https://www.reddit.com/r/kratom/comments/1ktqa8/help_im_addicted_but_its_helping/,"Hi guys, two years ago, I was diagnosed with General Anxiety Disorder, and my symptoms progressed to the point where the ""disorder"" was pretty debilitating. I wasn't performing well at my internship, I never enjoyed myself while out with friends, and I couldn't even begin to consider dating. I discovered kratom, and my life got measurably better. 

I was motivated to hit the pavement in search of a full-time job and landed several interviews that same month. I got hired by one of the top agencies I was gunning for, and I found myself once again enjoying myself around my friends. Some even made quiet remarks about how much better I seemed to be doing. I was also doing well with the ladies. 

So here I am, about 4-5 months into my kratom habit. For all intents and purposes, my life is better than it was a year ago. I know this sounds like an endorsement for the drug, but it kind of scares me. When I stop taking it, my anxiety does resurface. I lose energy and have trouble taking care of myself. I'm worried that I'm completely dependent on this stuff to function. 

I have tried other medications before (benzos and SSRIs), but the benzos scared the shit out of me and I discontinued use, and the SSRI's side effects weren't for me.

SO -- is this something I should be scared of? Do I have to rely on kratom to be happy for the rest of my life? Is this powder that has seemingly helped me so much actually ruining my life? "

Its amazing how far technology has come. Looking at the Pentiums of today to the Pentium of my last computer is such a huge difference! To have hard drives almost reaching 1 terabyte, and 16gb of ram!! I want a big motherboard so I can use my Audigy sound card because I love that surround! Question: What are the best blue cold cathodes you can get? My last build was red-themed and it was great.

I'll be back to answer questions but I'm going to go watch ""The Internship"" with some buddies."

In March I met a great girl at the party. We talked there for a long long time, we share similar interest, sense of humour and found her really pretty. Didn't make a move later bacause she was taken and we live few hours drive apart.

Eventually start talking after nearly a month, she tells me she thought about me all the time. So did I. She tells me she broke up with her bf she was with for 1.5 years. I made a move and we started to talk every day for a few hours.

She comes to meet me. It was a great day. Went for a walk, kissed and had a dinner. We started meeting more often, visiting each other and became a couple. Everything goes ok, we do many things together, she's my gf and best friend. We had sex. She was a virgin before and often told me her ex was weak in bed and they never even tried. Everything goes well until her female friend tells her about her ex.

He's depressed about losing her, she blames herself. She meets with him and tells me about it later. We argued and when she tried to go away I pulled her and started yelling. She started crying and told me she was afraid I'd hit her. Feel bad, I would never do it. She doesn't talk to me for a few days but eventually we get along and are still together but I feel like she lost all feelings towards me. During those few silent days she met with him.


We later went to a festival and it was the greatest week of my life, 8 days with her. Her friends told her I'm a good guy for her, better than her ex, and really liked me but I saw she's torn. Midway through the way home she tells me she's leaving because she's not happy with me and still feels like she hurt that guy. I'm devastated and go home. The last thing I tell her is ""I love you""

She is in tears, tells me she loves me also but she can't be with me. I decide not to call etc. and give her freedom. She does it herself, though, and we talk. It goes like that for like a month and we eventually start talking like previously.


I drive to her once completely unannounced, she is really happy. Told me she doesn't talk to her ex and doesn't want to be with him again.
We've had a great day together, tells me I made her day and seems really happy. Then she visits me for a few days next week.

I get an internship in her city to be closer to her. We met few times here, had a great time together. She comes to my place and we have sex. She later regrets that, tells me she can't give me a false hope. Wants to keep contact but be ""just friends"". Apologizes and says ""I'm sorry I can't be the yours"".

Right now mindfucked, don't know what to do. I barely sleep, I think about her all the time, she tries to friendzone me, but we meet every few days. Sometimes we kiss and then she apologizes and says she can't be so erratic.

I don't know what to do. I want her to be my gf, she is a great girl but I don't understand why doesn't she want to be with me. She told me she doesn't need any more time and it's not about her ex anymore, she just can't be with me. She says that she'd like to be happy with me but can't

I know I fucked up, I sometimes loose my shit when we argue, but I never did anything to her and I wouldn't. My internship ends in 5 weeks and I go back. I feel like that's the only chance to be her bf.

**TL;DR** Met a great girl but our relationship is up-and-down. We've been together, but she broke up with me and we became something like a couple but weren't ""officialy"" together. Now she tells me she can't be with me even though she would like to be my gf.

1ktcno,11,2013-08-21,Should I quit my current steady job in an unrelated field for a programming internship? (24 y/o),bad_at_photosharp,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1ktcno/should_i_quit_my_current_steady_job_in_an/,"Since I graduated in 2012 with a Materials Science degree (specialization in Electronic Materials) I've been working at a large Automotive OEM as a process/quality engineer. I learned C and Matlab my sophomore year in school liked it so I dove in to Java on my own. For the past year and a half, I've been using every resource to teach myself C++ and consider myself to be at least at an intermediate level with it. I'm working on my own game now and have been looking for a suitable open source project to contribute to.

I find myself more and more fantasizing about a programming job but I have no idea how to break in to the profession without any experience or a CS degree. My question is, would it be wise to leave my current, well paying job for a programming internship? Or is it possible to break in to the scene another way?"
1ktaaa,5,2013-08-21,Electrical engineering student with emphasis on Nanotechnology/Nanoengineering,[deleted],engineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/1ktaaa/electrical_engineering_student_with_emphasis_on/,"Hello all. So I posed these questions in r/EngineeringStudents, and forgot about r/engineering. I figured you guys have much more experience and maybe some of you do in this field, so I decided to post here. I am a sophomore taking the normal route of electrical engineering in my university, along with suggested elective courses of: **Introduction to Nanoelectronics**, **Introduction to Nanotechnology**, **Electronic Materials**, **Physics III: Modern Physics**, **Quantum Physics Laboratory**, and **Introduction to Quantum Mechanics I**. If you could provide me with *any* valuable insight into the field, I would very much appreciate it.

Questions:

1. How well do you guys think these classes will prepare me for work in the nanotechnology/nanoengineering field? 

2. From several Google searches I've gathered information that suggests getting a Masters and maybe a Phd if I wanted to do research. I have no problem with this scenario, seeing as I have around two years of internship experience, so upon graduation I would go work in industry for a few years and hopefully my employer will pay my way through a masters and possibly a Phd.

3. What do you think of gainful employment in such a field? Will taking these 6 electives rather than some other classes hinder my chances at employment? 

4. Lastly, if anyone reading this is working towards an emphasis in Nanotechnology/Nanoengineering degree, or if anyone is already in the field, what is your day at work like? What projects are you working on? What sort of entry and mid-career pay should I be looking at? Do you work at a university, in industry, etc...? Any information is much appreciated.

Just for reference, these are the technical elective tracks my university. What do you guys think of these areas?:

* Power Electronics and Power Systems
* Optics
* Nanotechnology/Nanoengineering
* Microwave/Radio-Frequency Engineering
* Electronics
* Controls
* Computer Systems
* Communications and Signal Processing
* Biomedical Imaging

1ksugq,4,2013-08-21,Disabled student victimized by physical therapy instructor,ce2013,education,https://www.reddit.com/r/education/comments/1ksugq/disabled_student_victimized_by_physical_therapy/,"Have you ever dreamed of doing something that some said was beyond your grasp?  That was what my family encouraged me to do by attending the doctor of physical therapy program at a prominant Texas university despite the fact that I have a learning disability.  

Suffering from a learning disability all my life has provided me with an increased empathy for those with all sorts of other disabilities.  This is why I chose physical therapy.  Until an abrupt ending after I had walked the stage at graduation, I pursued my dream of learning to help people with disabilities.  Though it was more challenging for me and it took me longer to understand the material, I worked harder than all the other students in my class, forgoing the attendance of parties for long nights of study.  This brought about success in the classroom portion of my coursework, including an A an Neuroscience which is considered one of the hardest courses in PT school.  Following the classroom portion, there is a year of clinical internship.  In this, I continued to require extra time to grasp concepts and techniques, but with the help of great instructors, I was well on my way to becoming a physical therapist.  Unfortunately, I did not pass one out of my five clinicals.  For this reason, I had to remediate following graduation.  When I did my remediation, I was placed with a clinical instructor that had no patience for me or even his patients and coworkers.  He often talked badly behind patients backs and was offended when they said they were in pain.  He made sexist comments about how he believed that women should not be in the workforce, as well as fanatically quoting bible verses to make his points which only served to be more confusing.  He also violated medicare law by treating two medicare patients at once, which is illegal.  When I brought this to his attention and to the school's attention, I got no response.  This raised many red flags that I was in the presence of an individual that could be dangerous so I treaded lightly.  His boss even told him to let if go and lay off of me when he vented his anger towards me in her office.  Inevitably, he got upset with me over some of my documentation in which I had not added a phrase that no other clinical instructor in all my rotations had asked for.  I explained that I can learn anything that is taught to me, but I just need a clear explanation and a little extra time due to my learning disability.  He responded by saying he did not believe I had a disability, and ended the clinical in only two weeks rather than the eight that it was supposed to run.  The school sided with him and ended my career before it began.  This education cost $100,000.00 over a period of 7 years, and I had even passed the mock board exam which showed that I would be able to pass licensure and practice as a clinician.  To add insult to injury, in physical therapy schools, the credits do not transfer between schools, so my education is now useless.  I will never be allowed to practice or even have my doctor of physical therapy degree that I worked so much harder than my classmates to earn.  After being one credit shy of a doctoral degree, I am now forced to start completely over with my education all due to this one man's opinion. This man had a lack of patience with my disability, yet he is allowed to work with disabled people which I saw him losing patience with daily.  My question to you is does a man with such a lack of empathy for those with disabilities belong in the field of physical rehabilitation?  Does he belong as a teacher?  I am asking for help from the reddit community for anything that you can do to help right this terrible injustice.  My school even threatened that if I went through a grievance procedure, then I would have an academic dismissal on my record and never be able to attend college again.  Is this fair to deny someone the right to state their side of the story?  Should instructors be given this much power over the lives of students?  Please help.  This man will continue to victimize disabled people if something is not done."
1ksqe0,7,2013-08-21,Help... They're coming for me,Devynne,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1ksqe0/help_theyre_coming_for_me/,"I was taken by a tall man and a very old woman. It seemed as if they were a couple.  The woman seemed much older than the man, at least 20 years difference. They were completely silent the whole time, never answering to my pleas, only responding by brute force. Each time I would speak, the mans grip on my wrists would get tighter, as he drug me through the house. I kicked and screamed for help, but the only response I got was the echo of my own voice throughout the room. This place seemed like an endless maze.
 
Why was I here? Why won't they answer me? Why are they so silent? Am I the only one ?

I tried thinking of an explanation for the situation I was in. I looked up to see the man still dragging me along, chuckling to himself . What the hell was so funny? After a while of me struggling against his grip, he finally let go. I quickly got on my feet and glanced around, trying to find a way out. I couldn't see any other door except the one in front of me where the man was standing. All other directions were just long, stretched hallways leading into blackness. The man stepped closer to me and I backed myself into the nearest wall, practically slinking down to the floor. His gaze was intimidating, and his smile was unnerving. He roughly grabbed my shoulder, and shoved me through the door that he was standing by a second ago. I let out a yelp of pain as I fell onto the cold, cement floor. I heard the door shut abruptly and turned around just in time to hear the deadbolt click into place.

I began to shake out of fear as I got up and took a look around the room. I gagged as a rancid smell filled the air. I couldn't place the scent but it was unlike anything I had ever smelled before. The room was dark, but I could make out figures. It was as if there were chairs placed throughout the room surrounding a big screen that projected onto the cement wall. I gasped once I realized I was not alone. As I glanced around at the people here, I saw that there were at least twenty kids here. They seemed to range from the ages of seven to fifteen. It was mostly girls but there were a few boys that looked to be sixteen.

None of the children seemed phased by my appearance, as they just gazed sadly in my direction. A few of them just nodded to me, as if to acknowledge my presence. I tried talking to some of the older kids, and asking for help but they didn't talk either. Nothing seemed to work. I decided to sit down and came to the conclusion that I wasn't getting out of there. I started to cry softly. I sat there feeling sorry for myself until a light snapped me back to reality. The projector flashed on and began booting up. All of the children sat down and turned their heads toward the screen, almost as if they were trained to do it at the exact time. Like they EXPECTED it. The theater remained dark for the most part but I could faintly see the outline of a brown haired girls head in the seat in front of mine. 

Above the screen, there was a room that I didn't notice before. It was like the kind you see in movie theaters. The room that controls the video and audio. I saw the old woman and the man through the glass, and they were just talking. The woman began to mess with the equipment and suddenly the video started. I tried watching the video and keeping an eye on the couple at the same time, but when I looked to the video one second and looked at the room another, they were gone. I focused on the video. It seemed that the video was being taken by someone following a child. It showed a blonde girl in her teens walking along the street, when suddenly the camera man runs towards her and the video cuts off. It starts up again, but the scenery has changed to a very dark room with a steel door and a single wooden table in the middle. I see the same girl huddled in the corner of the room, screaming and pleading ""please don't do this.."" Over and over again. I started feeling sick to my stomach when I realized what came next. The camera was advancing toward her swiftly and I saw a knife in the side vision of the camera.

The girl starting crying out louder as she saw the knife. I looked away, but not fast enough. Right before I flicked my gaze away, I saw her being stabbed repeatedly, fresh blood staining the girls clothes and the floor beneath her. I felt myself dry heaving as I tried to hold back tears. For what seemed like hours, I heard her blood curdling screams echo throughout the theater room. Some children looked away, while others cried. The girl in front of me whimpered a name. 

""Whitney..."" She started crying, with her head tilted down, sobs wracked her frail body. Eventually the video stopped and I heard a few audible cries from the kids. 

I had to get out of there.

I got up quickly and searched for something that would help me escape. I saw a glass vase across the room and ran to it. I picked it up, smashed it against the wall and took a shard from the broken pile, shoving it into my boot to hide it. I needed an escape plan fast. I scouted out the nearest door, when suddenly it opened. The man stood waiting at the door, smile still on his face. The door slammed behind him. I walked calmly to the man and asked if I could use the restroom. He must have thought I wasn't lying, because he paused for a moment just before opening the door back up. He grabbed me by the shoulder, leading me out of the room. I still felt sick from the video seconds before but there was a feeling of excitement that was intensifying every second we got further from the theater room, because I knew that I was getting closer to the exit. When we reached the bathroom, I realized it was next to a door. I remembered that door from when I came in. It was the entrance that led outside. I made a quick glance at the door, but the man thought nothing of it. He followed me into the bathroom and I gave him an innocent yet startled look.

""What, a girl can't get any privacy around here?"" He stared at me coldly until I asked ""can you at least turn around?"" He reluctantly complied. Once he turned around, I saw my chance. I quietly took the shard out of my boot. I gripped it in my right hand, making a gash on my palm from how hard I was holding on to it.

""You're not gonna get away with this"" I said with more confidence than I felt. He started turning around swiftly, as if he was going to answer, but he wasn't faster than me. He let out a cry of pain when he felt the glass pierce his skin. I had pushed the glass shard into his side, making him paralyzed momentarily. But it was just enough to make my move. Blood began to seep through his clothes, and with a look of hate on his face, he snarled. My adrenaline kicked in and I was pulling him away from the door so I could make it through. I opened the door just as I felt a hand grip my ankle. I let out a yelp and kicked my foot free. I slammed the door behind me for good measure.

I ran across the hall to the door that led outside and unlocked the dead bolt. I was running down the opposite hallway when I saw the old lady literally sprinting in my direction. She was at least 20 feet away so I had little time. I let out a sound of frustration as the lock didn't budge, but right at the last second it gave way. I hadn't realized how much time had passed since I was brought here, but it was night when I got out of that sickening place. I was sprinting as fast as I could when I heard footsteps behind me. I decided to look back, when I knew that I shouldn't have. The man was just steps behind me, attempting to reach towards my hips to grab me. I shrieked out of fear and ran even faster. I lost him eventually, but I don't remember when. I remember being tired and stopping near some building. It was marked ""Police Department"". I frantically pushed the doors open and ran inside, panting. An intern at the department walked out from behind her desk quickly, asking me if I was alright. I began crying and sunk to my knees, exhausted and scared. I think someone helped me up and took me to an office, because the next thing I knew, I was in some officers room and they were asking me who they could call, and what had happened to me. 

I told them everything that happened and where I thought the house was. I described the man and woman to a sketch artist, and told them everything I knew. Everything I had done. 

As it turns out, the man and woman were wanted for murder and there was an open case about them that the police had been working on. None of the children  had ever made it out of there, and the couple was untraceable. 

The police searched the house I described to them, but all they found were the children. There was no trace of evidence that the man and woman had ever been there. They also discovered the source of the smell in the room. Apparently the video room above the projector was also where they found the bodies of the past victims. The police said the two must have fled the scene after I had escaped. The story was broadcast all over the news.

**14 year old girl escapes from certain death**

That was 2 years ago.

I feel terrified, because as I type this, I can't help but notice the two dark figures, standing in my front yard. With each minute, they draw closer.

 Help me... They're coming back.

1kshxe,1,2013-08-21,Yesterday I fapped because I wanted to know how I would feel,[deleted],NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/1kshxe/yesterday_i_fapped_because_i_wanted_to_know_how_i/,"It was kind of intentional to fail yesterday. Well, I don't consider it a failure, just a step to becoming a better person. I wanted to find out how I would feel after the orgasm. Well, a few months ago I would feel calm, relaxed and just ready to sleep.

But prior to yesterday, I was on a 73-day streak without PMO, so that changed things a lot. After I was done, at first I felt a bit depressed but that went away soon. Then I asked myself this question: ""Did this really make you feel happy?"" An immediate answer in my mind shot forward: ""No, I'm not happy right now"". I wasn't really happy with myself. I kept asking myself quetions and questions and no positive answers did I get. 

The conclusion is that fapping is not for me and right now I promise myself and everybody else that I will do the 90-day streak without any problems now, because I know that to be happy within, I need to quit fapping for good. 

Right now, I commit myself to daily exercise, study, learning languages, talking to friends in person, limiting my Facebook and social online activity, working more on my internship in a company and so on.

Everyone, have a nice day and the last thing I'm gonna say is that it doesn't matter if you fail, what matters is how you feel inside and you should be true to yourself, don't lie to youself ever :)"

If i didn't get anything, would it be a wise decision to only do say 2 units per semester next year? This would add extra time to my degree and give me the chance to get an internship.

25 years old

Graduated from a state college in May with a BSBA + 3 majors + 2 minors.

~$60k+ in debt with student loans

~$1k in other debt

Currently working a $7.25/hr + tips part-time seasonal position. Lately I've been bringing home 40hr a week paychecks, but at the most this could last a few more weeks before the season starts to slow down and ultimately laid off around the end of October-ish.

I am doing the coursework right now to get my substitute teaching certification as an extra backup plan and I should be certified no later than September 19th and able to work 3 days a week subbing (fully aware that substitute teaching is not guaranteed a single day a week).

I recently re-enrolled in college classes so that I could A) start deferring my repayment of the loans as I have a shit job with only one real job lead, B) finish up my Accounting major and participate in a statewide accounting firm recruiting fair in October, C) Milk out the rest of my student loan eligibility (maybe $3k total remaining) to use as an emergency/relocation-fund.

My current job is in hospitality, I have a BSBA in Resort Area Management, and I have completed an internship at one of the largest ski-resorts in the South-Atlantic region.

Towards the end of the summer (after I enrolled in classes) a position came open at a very distinguished and nationally known resort a few hours away from me. I applied thinking that I wouldn't get this just like I hadn't got any other position I applied for this summer. I submitted my resume at 11pm one night and before noon the next day I had received an email from a recruiter and set up a phone interview. Since then I have gotten two emails from the recruiter, and a voicemail from the HR person from the resort asking me to call back and see when I can come for an in-person interview.

I know this is just an interview. The promptness that they responded to my application and the fact that two different people have tried to set up this interview makes me think I have a good shot. But I don't know if I want this shot.

The position is a $30-35k 12-18 month management trainee position with the food and beverage department at the resort. Again... this resort is very upscale and nationally known. My bills right now are just a ~$100/month car payment, ~$50/month on a consolidated student loan, ~$35/month credit card minimum, gas to get to and from work, and some food. I don't pay rent (mooching off parents/grandparents).

IF I moved and accepted this position I would begin paying rent which I assume in the area would run ~$500/month, and in a couple months I would begin repaying the big student loan. I would possibly look into doing an online Masters degree just so I could defer my student loans longer, but I don't know what this is going to do to me financially.

Can you guys help me with this decision? Shine some light on things that I may or may not be seeing right now? I'm leaning towards not accepting the position, finishing this degree, and hoping/praying that I would be able to get an accounting job that typically starts around $40k in my state (but totally willing to relocate).

I am totally lost..."
1ks6sj,2,2013-08-20,Electrical engineering student with emphasis on Nanotechnology/Nanoengineering,[deleted],EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/1ks6sj/electrical_engineering_student_with_emphasis_on/,"Hello all. I am a sophomore taking the normal route of electrical engineering in my university, along with suggested elective courses of: **Introduction to Nanoelectronics**, **Introduction to Nanotechnology**, **Electronic Materials**, **Physics III: Modern Physics**, **Quantum Physics Laboratory**, and **Introduction to Quantum Mechanics I**. If you could provide me with *any* valuable insight into the field, I would very much appreciate it.

Questions:

1. How well do you guys think these classes will prepare me for work in the nanotechnology/nanoengineering field? 

2. From several Google searches I've gathered information that suggests getting a Masters and maybe a Phd if I wanted to do research. I have no problem with this scenario, seeing as I have around two years of internship experience, so upon graduation I would go work in industry for a few years and hopefully my employer will pay my way through a masters and possibly a Phd.

3. What do you think of gainful employment in such a field? Will taking these 6 electives rather than some other classes hinder my chances at employment? 

4. Lastly, if anyone reading this is working towards an emphasis in Nanotechnology/Nanoengineering degree, or if anyone is already in the field, what is your day at work like? What projects are you working on? What sort of entry and mid-career pay should I be looking at? Do you work at a university, in industry, etc...? Any information is much appreciated.

Just for reference, these are the technical elective tracks my university. What do you guys think of these areas?:

* Power Electronics and Power Systems
* Optics
* Nanotechnology/Nanoengineering
* Microwave/Radio-Frequency Engineering
* Electronics
* Controls
* Computer Systems
* Communications and Signal Processing
* Biomedical Imaging

1ks5vd,2,2013-08-20,Intern vs entry-level interview content,lithium42,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1ks5vd/intern_vs_entrylevel_interview_content/,"Today I was offered an interview for a full-time software dev position. I'm graduating March 2014, thus so far I've only experienced intern interviews. These have mainly focused on algorithms and data structures (as I would expect), but I'm not sure what the content difference is between an intern and full-time interview. 

It seems to me most intern interviews are looking for someone who knows at least one language well, can identify complexity, and can communicate well (among other things). While I expect algorithms and data structures to be at the core of a full-time interview, should I expect questions on things like architecture, kernels, or networks when interviewing for a generic software dev position?

I'm somewhat concerned because over these last two quarters I'll be taking some important courses: OS and networks. 

For a generic entry-level software dev position at a place like Microsoft, Amazon, or Google, should I expect to be tested on these topics? If so, would it be wisest to wait until I've completed one or both of these courses before applying for full-time positions?"

1krrgn,6,2013-08-20,"I've run 4:01 for 1500m, but can't break 17 for 5k. Advice?",lightcatcher,AdvancedRunning,https://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedRunning/comments/1krrgn/ive_run_401_for_1500m_but_cant_break_17_for_5k/,"I'm looking for some training advice. My current PR's are 1:55 for 800m and 4:01 for 1500m. I've only raced the 1500m 3 times, so I feel that I could possibly drop a ton of time in that event. I'm hoping to run 1:51/1:52 for the 800 and 3:52 for 1500m in the upcoming (2014) track season. (side comment: do these goals seem possible?) I'm currently 20 years old and entering my junior year at a D3 college.

Here's my relevant running history:

**Junior year of high school**: I solely raced 200/400 from when I started track several years prior until the middle of this season. I started racing the 800 during the middle of this track season, but I primarily trained with the 200/400 runners. Times: high 22/low 23 200, low 50 400 split, 1:59 800m.

**Senior year of high school**: This was my first season running cross country. Started the summer running 20 miles/wk, peaked at around 45 miles/wk. Ran mile repeats with 1-2 minutes weekly. Best times during XC season: 17:01 5k, 16:10 3 mile. For track season, I trained with the 800m group. Workouts were things like 12-18x200 on Mondays, 2x600 at 1:30 + 5x300, 6+5+4+3+2+1, etc. I probably ran about 30 miles/wk throughout this cross country season. I ran a 1:55.5 800 and again split low 50 for 4x400 split.

**Freshman year of college**: Ran about 20 miles/wk over the summer, but did great core exercise. Due to work, didn't go to preseason XC at college and thus only there for the last month of the season. DNF first 8k, 30 something for 2nd 8k meet, 28:30 for 3rd meet. Started doing track work as soon as XC ended (200s and 400s), kept doing track work consistently over Christmas break. I was the only 800m runner for track and the coach pretty much just asked me what I wanted to do as a workout everyday, so I continued doing the sort of track work I liked to do. I probably ran 15-20 miles/wk throughout the season. I ran 1:56.6 (about midway through the season) and 51 for 4x400 split then got sick for 2-3 weeks and didn't have time to fully recover before the end of the season.

**Sophomore year of college**: Again ran about 20 miles/wk over the summer (just distance runs) and missed pre-season XC due to internships. Only had 2 XC meets that year (again just caught the last month of season), ran 30:30 and 29:00. Took about a month off of running after XC season due to intense schoolwork (slept about 3-4 hours/night). Ran track workouts over winter break, trained like a 400/800 runner during the season (new much better coach, but I still did all of the workouts alone). I started the season running pretty well, and PR'd in the 800 (by .02s) about 1/2 way into the season. After that my 800 running started to fall apart (had 3 races in a row slower than 1:57) so my coach decided to try me in the 1500. I ran 4:05 the first time and later ran 4:01. I was physically falling apart at the end of the season (the exact same workouts felt harder then then they did at the beginning of the season) and I largely think this was because I wasn't in good enough shape going into the season. Possibly worth noting, I ended up throwing up after about 30% of the races I ran.

So, here I am now. I was hoping to get a good summer of running in before actually attending preseason XC (and having a full XC season). My goal is/was to reach 60 miles per week and then stay there. 8 weeks of running in, I've just managed to run 50 miles/wk last week. I do most of my runs around 6:50/mile pace. I tried time-trialing a 5k a few weeks ago, I ran 18:00. As I'm trying to increase my mileage, I often find myself just out of energy on the longer (7+) miles runs, and I haven't been able to run more than 8.5 miles this summer without walking for a while. Running slower than ~7:10 or 7:15 pace just feels horrible to me because I associate that pace with being exhausted. Additionally, I'm also concerned that this distance running will cause me to lose my speed, which is the main thing I have going for me for track (I'm a pretty good kicker).

So, my question is is it worth it for me to do all of these distance runs and XC? I really couldn't care less about XC; I just want to meet my goals for track. I'm seriously considering stopping all of the distance runs and switching to doing (not too intense) track workouts, such as 1k repeats at 2:50 and maybe doing 2x or 3x 5 mile runs each week. This new workout plan would maybe add up to 25 miles/wk, but much more of it would be on the track running paces that I'd rather run. Could this sort of workout schedule let me achieve my goals for track, or am I better off sticking with (and suffering through) the 50-60 miles/wk until December? Considering that I do almost all of my workouts alone (due to a tiny track team with no middle distance runners), its pretty important that I don't hate the workouts too much, and getting rid of a lot of the distance runs would help my moral. Attempting to run decent times for XC and get in a lot of mileage just feels like an uphill battle that might not even help with my track goals.

possibly relevant: I'm 5'9"" and range between 140 and 150 lbs.

Also, anyone have any theory why I have such a hard time running distance? I find it really odd that I can beat people by 5-10s in a mile and then they beat me by a minute in a 5k. I think it might mostly be a running form thing. When I'm in the middle of a track season, I feel incredibly comfortable running 29s 200s, resting 60s, and repeating for quite a while. My high school coach told me that my running form was pretty excellent, and frequently used me as an example for other people on the team. When I'm on a distance run, my form feels infinitely less smooth and I associate running those slow paces with just being completely exhausted during a track workout.

tl;dr: As an 800/1500 runner who doesn't like and isn't good at running much further, is it reasonable for me to start doing track workouts now and only run 20-25 miles/wk?"

[How do you feel about Texas banning the sale of Tesla cars?  Doesn't seem very American or Libertarian.  Link to news.yahoo.com.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kw9u9/i_am_ron_paul_ask_me_anything/cbt9cov?context=5)|It's un-American and it's unpatriotic and it's bad economic policy, and it should not be any business of the government what car you can buy. 
[, thanks for answering congressman.  *I do not like the idea of any government writing prohibitions in these areas.*  That's exactly what the bill you voted for was trying to do.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kw9u9/i_am_ron_paul_ask_me_anything/cbt9tr5?context=5)|I'll go back and look into it and get back to you.
[What can I go about doing to change away from the destructive 2-party system that currently dominates politics? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kw9u9/i_am_ron_paul_ask_me_anything/cbt8fzm?context=5)|I think the first thing that we have to do is recognize that we don't have a two party system. I sort of kid about this by saying that we have a one party system, and someday I'm hoping for a second party! Because my experience in Washington has showed me that the 2 parties are much more closely aligned than the people realize. Both of them support our foreign policy of wars overseas (which is wrong), both parties support the Federal Reserve System and the banking cartel, both parties have endlessly supported deficit financing, and both parties unfortunately have supported the attacks on our personal civil liberties. Now the problem is, if we don't have a process whereby you disagree with the two parties, you don't have anyplace to go because it is very difficult to get on the ballot, it's difficult to get in the debates unless you participate in the ""so-called"" two-party system we have today, and ultimately the changes come about not by tinkering with either political party - it only comes through education and getting people to understand the wisdom of non-intervention in foreign policy, non-intervention in personal liberties, and non-intervention in the economy.  
[Is there anything that Obama has done that you **DO** support?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kw9u9/i_am_ron_paul_ask_me_anything/cbt8ux3?context=5)|That's a narrow question. How long since it's been since I've strongly supported what ANY president have done? Unfortunately our Presidents and our Congress have been systematically moving in the wrong direction. They have been undermining our freedoms and bankrupting our country and supporting perpetual war. 
[Dr. Paul, if you could reverse one decision Obama made in office, which would it be and why?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kw9u9/i_am_ron_paul_ask_me_anything/cbt8eba?context=5)|Taking his oath of office! No, I don't have any one because I believe he is just continuing a process that has been going on for a hundred years of government ever-growing.  So there is no one thing that he has done other than (in a very general sense) continue the process. Continue the wars, continue the attack on our liberties - so it has to be a broad answer. Sometimes people would like me to say just one thing like ""Obamacare"" but it's not just one thing. It's the continuation of Big Government and the attacks on our personal liberties.
[Dr. Paul, what is the bravest thing you've ever done?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kw9u9/i_am_ron_paul_ask_me_anything/cbt8ey5?context=5)|To tell you the truth, I've never thought about it.  I've never thought of me doing a whole lot that I would categorize as brave. Other people have said that what I do standing up to the establishment and speaking my piece of mind and not backing down as being something brave, but I don't think of it in that manner. So I don't have a good answer for that, but I appreciate it when people compliment me on sticking to my principles. 
[Mr. Paul -- Thank you for taking the time to do this AMA.  What are your thoughts on Bitcoin, and cryptocurrency in general?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kw9u9/i_am_ron_paul_ask_me_anything/cbt8cyq?context=5)|My thoughts on Bitcoin and the other currencies is that they ought to be legal unless there is fraud involved. The government should not get involved in regulating private money if there is no fraud. I do not take a position on Bitcoin and other proposed currencies in a technical fashion, but I understand the political ramifications of them and I think that government should stay out of them and they should be perfectly legal, even though I don't endorse (technically) one over another.  
[Hi Dr Paul!  Happy late Birthday!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kw9u9/i_am_ron_paul_ask_me_anything/cbt8d7z?context=5)|Well they obviously ought to be protected and politicians pay lip service to that and pass laws to protect whistleblowers - but then they disobey the law, disobey the Constitution, and arrest people who actually reveal the truth. The only way that it can work is that the people themselves have to want the truth and tolerate the truth and understand that whistleblowers are trying to help us and not believe the propaganda of those who are trying to defend the Empire.
[My question is with Edward Snowden and Bradley Manning exposing government abuses, and subsequently being hunted - and prosecuted in Manning's case - what do you think needs to be done to protect whistle blowers?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kw9u9/i_am_ron_paul_ask_me_anything/cbt8d7z?context=5)|There's a saying that I use quite often - ""Truth becomes Treason in an Empire of lies."" It's a change in attitude where people don't want to live in an empire, or with a government that is abusing our rights or pretending to police the world and doing all these wonderful things. So we should do everything we can to protect the whistleblowers, but we need better people in government to achieve that. 
[What are your thoughts on free migration? Do you think restrictions against immigration violate the non-aggression principle? Do you agree with economists who say that the World's GDP would increase by magnitudes if you allowed free migration?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kw9u9/i_am_ron_paul_ask_me_anything/cbt8n7q?context=5)|That might be the ideal to seek and it should be talked about and maybe someday we can reach that. That is essentially what our 13 Colonies set up under the Constitution - we could move back and forth as freely as possible, and it's worked out rather well. The problem that we have today deals with the economy and the Welfare State. Because if the doors are wide open and you let all individuals in, all individuals suddenly qualify for welfare benefits - and you are looking for lots of problems. In a free society that is prosperous, the doors should be open as wide as possible. Even today we could do that if we could say ""Come and work, come and play, but you don't get automatic citizenship or benefits."" Those open doors would be very beneficial to us, but it's been messed up because of the demagoguery and welfare state. But in an ideal world, there would be an economic benefit to it. 
[Dr. Paul, you have been the most outspoken critic of the Federal Reserve. However, no matter how much I look into your positions on the Fed, something is still a little unclear. Would you prefer to have the Federal Reserve powers returned to the United States Congress and have congress control the money supply and interest rate, or would you rather those powers be left to the free market and have private competing currencies?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kw9u9/i_am_ron_paul_ask_me_anything/cbt8o64?context=5)|The second. I would allow the market to do it. I would not trust Congress either. But the guidance can come from our Constitution, because it says we are not allowed to print money and only gold &amp; silver can be legal tender and there is no authority for a central bank. But I like the idea of competing currencies, especially in a transition period, because it would be hard to take what we have today and suddenly have a gold standard without some problems.

The church should never run the state. They should never be synonymous. And the state should never interfere with the church.

Doing my part for personal liberty by plugging CryptoReddit.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kw9u9/i_am_ron_paul_ask_me_anything/cbt8dtf?context=5)|Education is the key to this, and then after that, there will always be a job for somebody who is (if they make themselves available) educated to spread the message. There is always a vehicle for the individual to help spread this message - whether as a teacher, as a politician, even as an intern or a college student. 
[Hi Ron! I am a huge fan of you and you new show, and I have a few questions I would like to ask you.    Do you have a stance on animal rights? If so what is it?    Which members of the 113th congress are you most impressed with so far?    Who would you like to see be elected president in 2016?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kw9u9/i_am_ron_paul_ask_me_anything/cbt8dbq?context=5)|I have a stand: I think rights are for individual human beings. I don't have a good conception on where an individual animal has rights. That leads to confused thinking on my part. That doesn't mean that abuse of animals should be tolerated, but in terms of rights, I am very precise. Individuals have rights, I do not believe in collective rights (because a person belongs to a particular group) and I don't believe in the principle that an animal would have the same rights in court as an individual like you or I.  Well you know that's a dangerous question because if I name 2-3, I might forget 3 and get myself into trouble! I know a senator from Kentucky that I""m related to that would have to be one of my favorites, but there are so many in the House now - there might be 6 or 8 or 10. The one individual who is one of my closest friends in Congress is Walter Jones from North Carolina because he has become very anti-war. Jimmy Duncan from Tennessee is a close friend, and Dustin Amash, and Thomas Massie are some others.
[What issue is most important to you and why?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kw9u9/i_am_ron_paul_ask_me_anything/cbt8dbq?context=5)|The most important issue to me is the broad issue of personal liberty because I believe it can answer all our questions if we can recognize that the individual is sovereign, and that sovereignty should be protected. But there are so many issues that are secondary, and are a reflection of individual liberty - because I speak quite a lot about non-interventionism in foreign policy, sound money, and free markets and property rights. That can all come from the concept of our natural rights to our lives as individuals.
 |I think it's too early for that - they started talking about 2016 the day after the last election! We don't even know who the candidates yet. I haven't even talked to my son the Senator about what his plans are, but I think it's too premature to be talking about what our plans are three years from now.
[Dr. Paul, I am a big fan. My question is, What is the most effective way for regular citizens to oppose NSA/FISA overreach? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kw9u9/i_am_ron_paul_ask_me_anything/cbt8hot?context=5)|There's a couple things to oppose.
 |One is to become very well educated, to understand how they came about and how terrible they are.
 |The next thing we do is we have to get other people to agree with us, which means we have to educate other people to know that it's important and in their best interest to know about them.
 |And the next thing we all should do is our very best in influencing our members of Congress to not vote for these things and oppose them when they come up and become politically active.
 |If one does this, they should not have to wait until they are penalized by these laws (and we are at this point today because every American is being spied on by our government and from my viewpoint, it is all illegal except for the very few instances when there is a proper search warrant received from a judge). 
[What's your favorite part about being a politician?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kw9u9/i_am_ron_paul_ask_me_anything/cbt9jr4?context=5)|My favorite part with politics has been interacting with young people, especially on college campuses, because their minds are more open to the principles of liberty, they generally are against war, and they understand the importance of following the Constitution. A lot of young people said that I got them interested in politics and in the Constitution, but I would credit them with inspiring me. 
[The Tea Party had so much steam in 2010.  Everyone was afraid of the Tea Party's political influence.  Everything fell apart by 2012 and the GOP blew the Presidential election.  What went wrong and what will you do to regain and maintain political relevance?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kw9u9/i_am_ron_paul_ask_me_anything/cbt8ddz?context=5)|Well I don't deal with the Tea Party (or the Republican party or any of that) per se, we must deal with the idealogy of the concept of liberty. The Tea Party was actually started during the Ron Paul presidential campaign in 2007 when there was a spontaneous moneybomb that was done on the anniversary of the original tea party. And it was strictly related to the issues and ideas I have just finished talking about. What happened after that was that a lot of people came onboard - including Republicans - who watered down some of the beliefs, and certainly changed the opinion of some on foreign policy so that the original Tea Party movement was taken over by the Republican Party, which I think was part of the problem.

Most of the pictures I had in my Congressional office were pictures of economists, which included Von Mises, and I essentially didn't have pictures of politicians. I had a picture of one president who was my favorite (Grover Cleveland) and under his picture the quote was (paraphrased)
 |""What is it worth to get elected, and re-elected, if you don't stand for something?""

It has been the best thing for us to have to spread our message. So it has been VERY instrumental in being able to get the message of libertarianism out. The other thing that has helped us with this message is the evident failure now of our Keynesian economic system which we've had now for close to 100 years, and also the obvious evidence that our foreign policy is a complete failure and people are looking for answers, especially the young people, because they see it deeply flawed.

1kwhzf,217,2013-08-22,A good manager and a bloody nose.,ktmrider119z,TalesFromRetail,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/1kwhzf/a_good_manager_and_a_bloody_nose/,"Got a story from when I worked at an amusement park as an  outdoor attendant.  Not exactly retail i know, but thought i'd throw my story in here

So a few years ago before i got my internship, I worked at a mini-putt/go-kart/arcade amusement park.  I was hired on because i actually knew how to work on small combustion motors and the like and was in general mechanically inclined.  

One day, I was working the go-kart track with a co-worker.  With two people, we usually run one guy in the pit area to watch the ride timer and have a good view of most of the track.  The other guy will sit on the overpass section of the track to get a view from up there.  So it's been a normal day and been fairly slow.  Then we get the night-time rush.

Huge line of people for the track show up.  I let the maximum amount of people in.  Everyone dashes to their perceived fastest kart and sits down after a bit of shuffling.  I walk up the pit line from the back making sure everyone is buckled up while my co-worker starts the safety recording.  I get 1/3 of the way to the front when I hear it.  *snap snap snap* ""Ey yooo!""  I put on the fake smile and look up.  This gigantic woman with a voice like nails on a chalkboard snaps her fingers (instantly pisses me off) and points to a kid that's about 12 years old up at the front of the karts and tells me it's her son and he needs help with his seat belt. I calmly tell her that I will help him when i make sure everyone else on the way is settled due to my position in the pit line.  she backs down a little and i get to the front and the kid has figured it out by then.  No big deal.

We then go to start the karts out on the track and i notice this kid has moved 3 kart lengths past the end line for the pit.  Ok, gues i know which line isn't going first.  I wave for the lines on either side to start out one at a time.  However, after the first line gets out, this kid decides he's waited long enough.  Kid makes eye contact with me and floors it out of the pit swerving to attempt to hit me on the way out.  WTF.  Kid is now on my shit list as I know he's a danger.  

All the karts get out and I and my co-worker take up our spots watching the track.  after 1 minute I hear the clang that is the tell-tale sound of a bump and I snap my full attention towards it.  Sure enough, it's that maniacal kid (MK from here out).  my co-worker gives him the initial ""stop bumping!"" warning while pointing at the kid.  the karts get to the hairpin which is generally the worst section of the track.  i see MK pit maneuver another car and spin another kid out.  Off i go to help this kid while MK continues around the track.

Before I can get this kid off the track rail, I see MK round the corner with a death glare on his face making a beeline for me.  He rams the kart i'm pushing at full speed and almost breaks my ankles.  I've had enough at this point.  I pull MK to the rail and tell him that if he does anything like that again he's done for the night.  Off he goes.

At this point, I hear screeching coming from the pit area. It's the mother and she is PISSED.  She will be Angry Mother from now.  I immediately catch ""Stop pickin on mah bebby jus kuz he black, cracka!""

FULL STOP.  First time I've ever been accused of racism.

Me: Ma'am your son only received a warning because he was bumping and a second warning because he spun someone out and deliberately rammed the kart while I was on the track.  It is a very dangerous situation for me.

AM:  I don't care it's yo job quit bein a racist cracka.

Me: I'm sorry ma'am.

At this point my manager has come over and has heard most of what has gone on.  I look at the timer and it's time for the last lap.  My manager waves me off when i go to open the gate.  That means i get traffic duty in the pits.  I HATE doing that because its dangerous because people come full bore into the pits all the time.

Pit re-entry goes well enough until I hear ""Hey, look out!"" from my manager.  MK is screaming full bore into the pits headed straight for me.  Death glare gleaming from his face.  At this point, time stops i desperately look for a way out of the way, but don't see one until it occurs to me.  UP!!!  I jump into the rafters and hang on for dear life while trying to pull my legs up to avoid getting hit.  My knee makes HARD contact with something and I see the kid's kart smash into the rest of the line.  Then I really see it.  The kid's face is a mess.  I think, ""oh shit I kneed him in the face I'm fucked"".

AM is over the divider fence before I even get down from the rafter screaming bloody murder about her kid.  

AM: he hit my kid in the face I want him fired right now screechy screechy screech and that's all I hear because I go into oh shit mode and shut down.  

manager tells me to get out of the pits and sit down becausee my knee is purple and the size of a softball and he is over there now trying to help the kid out of the kart but AM isn't having any of it.  I hear a ton of screeching and then *smack*.  AM has smacked my manager in the face.  My manager is a HUGE dude 6'5"", built like a brick shit-house, and is a bouncer at one of the local clubs part time.  He immediately tells AM to get her kid and get out.  AM starts yelling about discrimination blah blah blah and won't leave.  My manager then picks her up, throws her over a shoulder and deposits her outside the gate to the park.  

After this is all over, he gets back to me and helps me to my car as i can't walk because of my knee and tells me to go home.  I am freaking out thinking he's firing me.  He sternly says ""HEY!"" to get me to calm down and says, ""dude, no big deal you got hurt and I always have my employees' backs.  I'll leave you clocked in for the rest of your shift.  Just go get your knee checked out and let me know what's going on.""  In disbelief, I say ok and drive home.  My knee is just badly bruised and i have to Ice it for a few days.  When I get my paycheck, I find out the manager left me clocked in for another 12 hours which pushed me into overtime for the week.  I got 10 hours of overtime and 3 days off, Hell yeah!  never saw AM again but did find out she tried to sue, but after the insurance company talked to my manager and me, they dismissed it. 

So, I kept my job, became friends with the manager, and got a bunch of money for my trouble. 

TL:DR sorry I typed it out please read it :)

Sorry for the length, thanks for reading."

So I worked at an internship this summer where most interns get offered a full time position with the team they interned with.

Unfortunately I was put on a team that didn't really interest me, and my manager recognized this. Now this didn't mean that I didn't work on what I was supposed to.

I was one of the top performing interns as said by my skip skip skip manager. And I always did great work and my manager agrees.

Now the problem is, because my manager saw I wasn't as interested as he would like me to be, he said that I should work at the company, but on a different team. 

Now I found another team that would love to have me, and it seems like I will be receiving a full time offer, but this is where I lose all my leverage. 

How do I keep the same level of offer with this new team as I would've with my old. I will be negotiating with my recruiter, and the salary is pretty much set in stone. What I will be negotiating is the signing bonus and the stock options.

The only arguments for a better negotiation I can think of are these two:

""The cost of living is more in the city I would be moving to.""

And

""Look at the work I did on a team where I wasn't interested, imagine what I can do on a team where I have passion for the product.""

I am 23 years old and returning so I can secure a better job in the future. I have no professional IT experience, but my current field of study is Computer Information Technology - Security (AAS degree)

My question here is, how do I know if I am on the right track? I have 2 classes this semester, Computers and Applications I (The textbook is the A+ textbook by Jean Andrews) and Intro to networking (The textbook is the CCNA textbook) So I am fairly confident that by the end of this semester, I can sit for and pass the A+ exam, and the CCENT exam. Now next semester I will be taking introduction to network security, Intro to network operating systems (Novell and the like) and in summer, I finish up with laws and ethics of computer security, and measures/countermeasures (a lab where one team tries to pentest another team, and the other team has to secure the system)

The A+ course is my elective. 

So in total, this course of study seems to study:

A+ objectives
CCNA Objectives
Security+ objectives
VMware (already completed)
Novell
Windows server 2008
etc

Is this a good start? My adviser also recommended I consider dual-majoring for an AAS in networking (an additional year, 8 classes, mostly focused on things such as CCNP curriculum and an internship program)

Does it seem like I am off to a decent start? I am wholeheartedly interested in Information Security, but finding the necessary information on starting a successful career has been challenging. Any feedback would be appreciated.

I'm being paid to do it and learn the skills needed to do it, and I'm the sole developer on the project, in effect it's a real/legit job.

It's turning into an ""opportunity"" (I'm severely underpaid and locked at ""student hours"" of 19.5/week,) in that I can say, ""Yes, I am a iOS developer, I developed these apps while working for X-organization,"" and show it off as a portfolio, if you will.

So my question is next summer (of '14) should I bother to seek out an internship at all seeing as I have a 'real job' right now?  I'm kind of torn on the whole thing since the hours are very convenient for me and while I'm underpaid, it's enough to keep me afloat while I work (and I'm doing work in my actual field.)

As of right now I have my bachelors degree in ""Network Administration"". Below is a list of all the certifications that I have. (my school required that I get the certs to graduate..)

**CompTIA**
    A+,
    Network+,
    Project+,
    Security+

**Cisco**
    CCENT,
    CCNA

**CIW**
    Javascript Specialist,
    Web Design Specialist,
    Web Foundations Associate

**Microsoft**
    MCITP: Server Administrator on Windows Server 2008,
    And a bunch of MTA (ms technology associate) certs.

Experience:
    3 months internship (desktop support),
    1 semester teachers assistant (computer science),
    There are some local small business that I do desktop/network/website support for.

I really like the Cisco stuff and would be interested in getting my ccna security and ccnp one day but I would def have to work as a network engineer first before pursuing. I know my certs and education are mostly for networking but my real passion is for network security / pen testing. I would like to one day have my cissp or ccnp.

Anyway, do you guys know what would I should do next? masters? job? certs? all of them?

Thanks."

-I can use just about every single Microsoft Office program that I can think of, and I can do it pretty well. Word, Excel, Powerpoint, Outlook, etc.

-I am quite comfortable on both a PC and a Mac.

-I've worked in a million restaurants, so I know how to use plenty of POS systems (not really relevant, I guess.)

-I can use google sketchup and very basic photoshop.

-I can... navigate my way around the internet? What I mean to say is that I'm pretty good at using the internet to troubleshoot things and if I had to use some sort of online program, I'm sure I could figure it out.

That's all I can think of right now. Here's the problem though: Although I am by NO means some sort of tech-genius, I look at that list and I see a bunch of basic, no-brainer stuff.

1kvkq3,1,2013-08-22,Xcode questions. May be in over my head. Any help appreciated.,[deleted],iosdev,https://www.reddit.com/r/iosdev/comments/1kvkq3/xcode_questions_may_be_in_over_my_head_any_help/,"Hello r/iosdev,

I guess I'll give you guys some background information so you know where I'm at.

I'm working as a summer intern at an IT company and my boss asked me if I could handle an app development project as my last assignment. I had never done ios development before, but I have a decent background in java (3 years in high school, 1 year in college) and enthusiasm. I have spent a little while fooling around with Xcode lately, but I am far from comfortable with using it at this point. In addition, I don't really have any background in objective c. 

Seeking a challenge, I (foolishly?) accepted the project. I was given the Xcode files for the existing iPhone app. The app currently supports portrait mode only. There are currently 28 different scenes on the app.

Within 3 weeks, I have to accomplish the following:

* Essentially make the existing iPhone app universal:
     * Resize iconography and user interface to fit the larger format of the iPad without loss of aesthetics
     * In addition, make the app viewable on the iPad in both portrait and landscape modes
* Add a new icon to the home screen of the app that will launch a window displaying web-driven content

After that, I have another 3 weeks to do the following:

* Apply a split view to a map within the app when the iPad is in landscape mode
     * One side of the view will have the map, the other side will have a list of places / information (kind of like the view on maps.google.com when you search for something like ""barber shops"")

So now I need some honest advice. Am I in way over my head on this? Today is my last day of work, and I'm leaving for school next Tuesday. I should have a pretty tough course load, but I feel like I'll be able to work on this app for at least an hour or two every day while at school. This gives me approximately 30 hours to complete the first phase of the project, and probably another 30 hours to complete the second phase. Is this project too much for an unexperienced app developer to undertake as a first project?

Also, could anyone maybe lend me a hand by answering some of these questions?

1. The first thing I did was copy and paste the MainStoryboard_iPhone.storyboard into the MainStoryboard_iPad.storyboard file. I then spent a few hours resizing all of the views / icons / buttons etc. so that they would fit the larger iPad layout. I disabled auto-layout when I did this. All of the screens look good when the iPad is in portrait mode, but if I rotate the device in the simulator, everything gets messed up / overlaps. Is there a way to design the view for when the iPad is in landscape mode so that I can make sure these elements are formatted properly?

2. Does anyone have any idea how I can add another icon to the home screen of the app? There are currently 12 other icons, so I thought adding another one would be simple. I'm having a hard time finding where the icons are actually created in the code. I've tried copying the code from other icons and tweaking it around in hopes of creating the other icon, but it never seems to appear on the screen. 

3. The new icon that I'm making needs to display a screen full of web-based content when clicked. Can someone explain how I would go about doing this? 

I apologize for not being super descriptive in this post, but I'm pretty new to Xcode and app development in general. If anyone has any advice about other subreddits, articles or tutorials that might help, it would be greatly appreciated. 

Thanks!

You insisted, started stalking me. You fucking freaked me out. Why don't you get it: NO!!!
And what do you give me? Shit. For what???? Oh, did I harm your little ego when I said no? No to working for you for FREE??

I was oh so right to not trust you from the beginning. You just proved me right. 
Despite all this I understood something: you insisted, I said no politely, you gave me shit. That just mean you have your own lot of insecurities. You felt rejected and needed to get me down.

Any tips?",Reginald_Funk,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1kv2jf/me23m_with_my_ex_26f_4_months_i_work_at_the_same/,"So, I was with this girl for about 4 months. I had really intense feelings for her, and she had them for me. Then issues arose. She had been sexually abused as a child. Her libido dropped sharply after a couple of months. We went from sex 4-6 times a week to maybe 1 time a week. It made me feel pretty undesirable and that hurt. 

We tried to work on it, but on top of everything, there was a severe lack of communication on her part. Turns out that while trying to be a good girlfriend and doing nice things for her, she felt I was smothering her. She is a very introverted person, and I'm definitely a more extroverted-leaning person. When the relationship started she told me that she needs alone time, and I told her ""Fine, as long as you can communicate that to me then that won't be an issue."" So she goes ahead and doesn't communicate with me and lets herself feel so smothered that she couldn't take it. That on top of the sexual incompatibility made her end it. The thing that makes me mad is that she told me that she ""tried everything,"" when she could have at any point told me that she needed alone time, and I would have given it to her. Instead, she kept it to herself in fear of hurting my feelings. Well, I would have rather been with her less and had her be happy around me than be around her 6 days a week and have her be grumpy.

Anyways, she works where I work. We're both college students and she had this great job that paid well as a student internship. I was working 12 hours a week on minimum wage. I interviewed, and then a week later she broke up with me. At that point I'd pretty much gotten the job. This is a job I need, I really really need the money and I actually like the job well enough. I haven't worked with her yet, but I keep getting reminded of her existence at that job and it's a real bummer. I feel so much resentment towards her over many various occasions in which she either treated me badly, or moments where her intimacy issues got in the way of what could have been a wonderful day. I have such intense feelings for her. They used to be love, and now they're all resentment.

I want to be past this. I want to be able to go to work functions and not worry that I will have to talk to her. I want to let this resentment go so I can go pursue other relationships. But it's so hard. Sometimes I think I'm doing ok and I won't think of her for a while, and then something happens, like a girl I like rejects me, and it all comes flooding back. How do I do this?

Things I have been doing: Working out, being with friends and people who love me, reading

---

**tl;dr**: Girl I really really fell hard for dumped me. I've got a lot of resentment towards her. I want to move on and let the resentment go, but it's hard and I need help. Also we work in the same place, which sucks. And I kind of rambled on a bit at some points."
1kuuyr,1,2013-08-22,"Confused, could really use some advice on delaying MCAT or not",smoothmcgoose,premed,https://www.reddit.com/r/premed/comments/1kuuyr/confused_could_really_use_some_advice_on_delaying/,"I am signed up for the September 12th MCAT.

I have been studying for the MCAT for the past 2.5-3 months (started slowly around early-mid June, not sure exactly). Anyways, I used the Berkeley Review for most of my prep, along with EK BIO and EK 101 and TPR Verbal. I was able to go through all of the sections and take notes, but I fear that my content review was more breadth than depth. The reason I say this is because today I took my first post-review AAMC FL  (AAMC 4) and I scored a 30 (PS-11, V-8, BIO-11). I was about 2 questions away from a 12 on PS and 1 question away from a 12 on BIO. While taking the test, I found these sections manageable, except for several questions. However, verbal just attacked me out of nowhere. I felt really confused throughout most of the verbal, a feeling I rarely get anymore since I have completed 5 verbal tests. My average on these tests is close to 10 (consistently getting 10s, even got lucky and scored a 10 the morning after late night studying and not much sleep), maybe slightly higher too since I scored a 12 on one of the EK 101 verbal tests. Anyways, the verbal on AAMC 4 really freaked me out, and I'm not sure if verbal will be like that on test day. I am not satisfied with the overall score either (I hope that doesn't sound pretentious, I don't mean it that way).  It is just that only about a week into my content review, I took a Kaplan FL (the free one they offer) and scored a 28 (PS10, V8, B10). I figured I would get at least several more points added overall AFTER reviewing. 

**Short complaint about my content review**: My review consisted of going through all the TBR (physics, gen chem, and o-chem) and EK BIO sections, taking notes while reading, and doing about a 1/3 of the chapter specific questions in the TBR and the section quizzes in the EK. However, because it was summer break, and also because I was doing an internship in another city (took my prep with me though) for about a month, I kind of slacked off on really getting into the material. I guess I learned most of the material superficially, but I don't know if I really have a deep grasp of every subject in those books. To be honest, I slacked off, plain and simple, from the type of studying I should have been doing. As a result, I finished content review about a week ago, and *just took my first AAMC FL today* (real test in 3 weeks and I know that many people stress the importance of taking many practice tests before).

To give context, I will start applying for medical school in May/June 2014. I just finished my 2nd year (took all prereqs except physics 2) and have a couple upper division bio classes under my belt. This fall semester, the relevant classes I'll take are physics 2, molecular bio, and physical chemistry. I have a tough but manageable course load next semester.

So the big question is, is it wise to delay my MCAT if I am not scoring where I want to? I am considering delaying to late January. I don't really feel completely solid with my content review and I think I could use the extra time from now until then to really work out the kinks to get a better score. The next sentence will most likely sound pretentious too, but I really really do not mean it that way (just a young student dreaming is all). I would strongly consider retaking the MCAT if I score below a 34. That is the score I am aiming for, and I probably wouldn't be satisfied with myself otherwise. I know it is a pretty high score to have as a baseline, but I believe I can score that high if I just go over the content a little deeper. The problem is time.

To add a few details: If I delay, I will be studying for the MCAT while in school (but I have already gone through the content once). This is going to be tough, but I think if I push myself, I think it will be okay most of the time. If I don't delay, I risk not getting the score I want and having to retake it anyways. On the flip side, if I don't delay, I might get the score I want and not have to worry about this test during school.

So r/premed, please let me know what you think. Anyone been in a similar situation?

Looking for some input or advice.,Zazenroshi,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1kusbg/im_a_recent_cs_grad_suffering_from_postdegree/,"Thanks for reading, i'll attempt to be both descriptive and brief.

I recently graduated with a CS degree with emphasis in Software Engineering at the end of April.  I finished with a good GPA, 3.97, but I never found an internship or did any personal projects outside of the normal coursework.  The last year of school took a heavy toll on me, I was suffering from a lot of depression and anxiety from problems from a 5 year romantic relationship falling apart.

I kept a part-time job doing menial labor, but I stayed on top of my coursework and kept my GPA up; however, I never had the energy or motivation to do outside projects or seek internships.  After graduation, most of my focus has spent trying to piece my personal and social life back together, and I've written practically no code and my skills have no doubt gotten rusty.

It is now 3 months after graduation and i'm slowly recovering from my depression, but i'm finding the job search a little overwhelming and I don't know what direction to move in.  I've only had a phone interview which I think went really poorly, and a first face to face interview which went okay, still waiting to hear back if i'm considered for second round technical interview.

The degree coursework has given me a good foundation for CS topics and a few different languages, C++, Java, C#, Bash, Perl, and Python, a little RDMS and SQL work, a little web development in ASP.NET.  None of these technologies have really gripped me as a favorite and i'm struggling to chose a direction.  I know I need to do some independent study and projects to help my chances of getting a job, but I don't know where to start and with what.

* Anyone else have to take time off after college to collect themselves personally?  How did you get back on track to sharpen your skills and find a job?
* It would probably help me to get involved with a project that has some real benefit, instead of just throwaway code to learn syntax and concepts, how can I find open source or smaller personal projects to begin building a portfolio?
* Any online tutorials you would suggest to help me get back in gear and into the programming mindset?

Thanks again for considering my problems, i'm happy to expand on anything or answer any questions to get the best advice possible."

I'm a CS student at a university in Canada not well known for its CS program. I'll be entering my senior year in September, and currently I'm a on an internship as a software developer at a large, non-tech company.

They've approached me and asked to extend my internship by 8 or 12 months (delaying my graduation from 2014 to 2015).  I have personal reasons for wanting to delay my graduation; my SO is not graduating until 2015.  I plan on pursing employment in the states after graduation, so I'd hate to spend a year apart.  She is an american citizen as well, which will make the immigration process easier (I'll still need to get an H1-B but after than I hope to get a green card to remain in the country).

Also, if I take an 8 month extension, I'll have another opportunity at getting an internship at one of the big guys in Summer 2014.  I had an in-person interview with MSFT and a phone interview with AMZN for internship positions last year, but wasn't prepared enough.  This year, I feel much more prepared.

I feel that because my school isn't well known, getting my first job with one of the major tech companies will give me a sense of legitimacy when recruiters look at me.

I know many of you might say that I should just pursue full-time employment at one of the big guys after graduate, but I'm not confident I will be able to secure it.  The interview questions for new grads are much harder than internship questions.  I feel if I don't start my career with one of the major players I will be set back given my educational background.

What is your suggestion?  I understand that there is an opportunity cost with delaying my graduation so I need to figure out if it is worth it."

You ran towards me, jumped up, and gave me a big hug. The only thing I could think of was your perfect perky tits pressing up against my toned chest. You could definitely could tell I worked out a lot, now that I was in college. I wrapped my arms around you and swung you around, super happy to see you. I accidentally lost my balance and you just so happen to fall on me, straddling. I could feel your pussy pressed up against my groin, instantly turning me on. I had to push you off immediately, so you couldn't feel my dick getting hard. 

We sat down, continued talking about how college was and all that regular stuff. After dinner I went to go wash up. I was in my room just hanging out on reddit when I heard a knock on the door. I turned around and there you were. Wearing a tight dark tanktop without a bra on, and some loose sleepwear shorts. I could see your nipples barely poking through the fabric. I thought to myself fuck... when did my sister get so fucking hot..."

1kyxes,39,2013-08-23,It's not that I want to die. It's that I don't know how to live.,kupochu,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1kyxes/its_not_that_i_want_to_die_its_that_i_dont_know/,"I've been frequenting reddit for a while now, it has been my companion and amusement during sleepless nights when I feel down. I decided now that I needed some help, that I needed to talk and clear my mind.

I have been dealing with depression since high school, and for 8 years since. I met bullies every year, and I suffered because of a few assholes here and there. It took some time, but somehow I coped socially well after repeating a year as senior, and finally meeting wonderful people. But one thing that I lost in the early years was any semblance of a healthy relationship with work.

My parents had very high expectations of me as a kid, as in grade school I had obediently performed well. The transition to a prestigious middle school however was very rough, and because my parents believed me to be a sort of genius, they never felt the need to support me or help with my work, and I was completely alien to asking them, or anyone for help, grade school stuff being easy as hell. The fact that my grades took a nosedive scared the crap out of them, and from then on every conversation with them featured their condescension to my inabilities, and their concern with my grades. It did not help that the bullying started, and soon I believe my esteem was an absolute mess.

It was on year 3 when I had assignments months overdue, a refusal to do any homework or even go to school that my mom dragged me to see a counselor to knock some sense into me. Turns out I was pretty depressed and immediately given pills, and I recall the drive back with her shaking her head in disbelief, talking about this “fake disease” and “to snap out of it”. It was interesting that she expected me to be educated in one session, but instead she was the one being lectured, but it took a few years for my parents to accept that my depression was very real, and that I was on the verge of killing myself, having been through a life that was meaningless to me. I remember my mom crying about how I was rebelling and doing this on purpose, and my father would then threaten to kick me out of the household if I continued.

I continued to struggle to the end of middle school. The school’s system basically arranged groups of 30+ students to take their classes together, and after 2 years there was a reshuffle. It was fairly obvious that they placed students in their classes according to their grades, and nonetheless I was in the worst class. I remember having one friend to study with who was surviving a rough family, but was crazy focused enough to drag me through his studying regime. This being your typical worst class, even in a prestigious school, it housed a few ne’er do-wells, a smattering of students unlucky enough to get shafted in the class and thus went ghost, and numerous dickheads and jocks who pretty much lacked empathy whatsoever. The teachers were especially hard on the class, some understood, some did not. One teacher essentially gave up on me, and became the proxy of my parents every time he handed me my blank assignment back, or asked a question he knew I did not study enough to answer.

Every day, after arriving back from home, I would immediately head to the computer to play games, just to forget everything that ever happened. I still don’t understand how I hid the fact that I played all day and all night, it was a combination of pretending to do work, to online assignments, closing the door for concentration, research and what not, I had to get my daily fix, sleep for 3 hours and wake up for the prison that was school. I cannot count how many times I wept, because I wanted so much the life I saw those damn protagonists lived in those games, any life but the one I was in. Yes I was hopelessly addicted to those computer games, and every stressor I had, the games consoled me, took the pain away, made me forget the reality I was in.

But having that said friend, and a wonderful teacher counselor, I barely scraped a pass to the high school my school was affiliated to. The only subjects I performed decently in were those I could spout bullshit on (literature, English). High school wasn’t any better, halfway through middle school my mom wanted me to wean off the pills, as they were getting me too sleepy for class. My condition thus worsened right smack in first year, and I received my pills again, bundled with the condescension of my peers and teachers, as well as an order to repeat the year.

Things did change though. My school faculty knew I could draw, and thus bunched me up with a few students in the art program that year. They turned out to be the best circle I knew til this day, as when we were doodling for fun, they saw what I could draw, and dragged me to join the art program too. Unfortunately, my procrastination crept up on me, I completely put off studying til the last 3 months, along with a physically and chronologically intensive art final project. My poor friends were helping me sand down my sculpture in the last minutes of submission. Even before math finals, I was playing away, to take away my panic and fears, and duly so I got an E.

I still cannot believe I am in art university now.

Now, university was a different ball game. The time between ending high school and starting college was when I got some shit in order, and got my depression under control. But now that I was in a skill based environment based on a hobby that suddenly became viable, all my flaws soon revealed themselves. And the assignments were no longer the kind I could spend a single night completing.

I had intense difficulty starting every project, there always seemed to be this insanely ideal semblance of a work that was just out of my reach, and each attempt at any idea was a testament to my inabilities. Every single line I drew was shit to me. Every mark was complete and utter crap. I had to force myself to complete my assignments at the last moment without sleep. Again. And I would never look at them again, every time I presented it to my class, I never turned back to face my work. Nevermind the class or the professor loved it, it was ridiculous, it was shameful.

I was never proud of my works. Almost all the works were rush jobs, and their flaws were painfully clear. If only I had put in more time. If only I had not procrastinated. If only I was not this way. I never should have done it, I am not supposed to be here. Why are you complimenting my skills, why don’t you see my inadequacies? I mean, in comparison to every single piece beside mine? THAT work in the corner, what is he doing here, he should be quitting school and making it big right now! All these godlike artists, oh god I am so small, it is so futile. It was luck, my friends did it, not me. Nothing I do is right.

And yet I pulled through, with a decent grade I had officially obtained. I had a particularly stressful summer, having gone through an internship that displayed a lack of skill on my part, having been foolish enough to try something new that I was not used to. I had failed scholarship interviews, and expanded a bulk of my energy in leading freshmen for university orientation. All these were plans to improve myself, but they did leave me worse for wear, and with a bad taste in my mouth. But more weathered, more prepared..

And I cracked. This year, one of my classes had our professor depressing the entire class by showing us the work of gods, taking our sketchbooks and tearing them apart in critique. He talked about how many skills there were in a single piece of illustration, how long it took to master, how we may not be who we wanted at the end of university life. He simply did not sugar coat things.

It dawned on me how much time I had wasted. Many of my friends back in high school were originally worse skilled than me, but they had long caught up when I was still mulling over my games. They had gone to the legendary colleges and art institutions. And I still wept. I still refused to work hard. Every single moment in front of my assignment was pure agony, I could feel myself wanting to run away, rip away from the seat, and do something else, anything else. It was really frustrating, like I had the remote in the palm of my hand, but I could not press the buttons. My uni friends will catch up, and lap me rounds and rounds on end. I would no longer catch up.

Yet I could not pry my mind away from thinking about all the skills I needed to master. Composition, colour, value, angles, form, anatomy, animals, perspective, painting, photography, design, film, animation, 3D. Social life. Independence. Business and entrepreneurship. Living. It just.. overwhelmed me.

I never expected it to hit me so hard. All the negative thoughts just dogpiled me that night. And all my fears returned to me that night. Before long I staying up all night distracting myself with flash games. I did not submit an assignment the following day. At this moment I have a 3D modeling assignment to complete, but it’s 6am and I’m still on the same blank screen from last night. It is due at 2pm, but I have never touched this software before, and I am so tired.

I was just managing to get my life together. My social life was good, and I had just managed to practice enough discipline during the internship to complete what I set out to do. I was exercising, my mind was clearer. But I realize, I wasn’t happier. The core problem still remained. I cannot allow this to continue any longer, especially in a skill based environment, it is really competitive. I cannot pity myself, this is all on me. I don’t plan to tell my friends, I don’t want to ruin the happier context of our friendships, and in the end, I got myself into this mess, I have to lead myself out.

The problem is, I don’t know how. I thought I got past a stage, but I don’t know anymore.


If you had read all of that, thank you for spending the time looking through my really long rant. It is full of self-pity, dramatics and verbal diarrhea. I’m not sure what good it will do, but it’s off my chest.

**TLDR**: Depression born of pressure and isolation, self loathing. I habitually procrastinate, am unable to get work done because of expectations. Stuck in a very reinforced habit loop, no motivation or idea how to break out. Suicide a viable option, if I fail in university now, in continuity I will fail in career and life too."

I always have a little bit of anxiety about making the right choices in life, but since I was a wee one, I've always wanted to make games,cool stories etc. As I know much more goes on now that I'm older, I'm more excited to be apart of a design team, and equally afraid to fail.

I'm okay with working hard, or long hours, but I want a balance. I know that the industry is a very tough one to handle at best, so I decided, I can make it on my own terms if I become an indie developer, go to school, get some internships and what have you.

My question is not so much, should I do it, because only I can answer that. However, when large topics come up on game development, I see so many disheartening posts about being one. It almost NEVER seems worth it, and being as ruthless as it is, only the cream of the crop ever get any where in most cases.

Am I just chasing a silly childhood dream? Would being Indie be a better choice? Should I just switch majors?

If there are posts already talking about this very thing, I would like links, as to try and avoid breaking the sub-
reddit rules.


**Added-**
I really appreciate the insight from all of you, and in a lot of ways have encouraged me and given me some hope as what I should do.

It seems like it might be a bumpy ride, but if its something I truly want to do, how could I be wrong, just focus, be smart and get in it. 

And to that I appreciate all of the advice and encouragement. :)

If there is anything else you want to add or can think of I'd still want a look at what you have to say, surely out of 66,721 GD in this subreddit there are many more opinions and ideas, and all of which I'd love to hear from, and your personal experiences, too. Maybe this will help any one who second guesses them selves, or worries about making the right choice for them selves. 

Keep it going Gamedev!"

(MS in MechE)",MechECareerThrowaway,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/1kxk5d/hate_to_be_this_person_but_what_would_an/,"*First off, sorry for the throwaway, but I've been a bit too open on my actual account and don't want all these details there too.  Also, sorry for the novel*

I recently received an email from a company I had an internship at last summer.  They had offered me a full-time job after my internship as I graduated from my undergrad in December 2012.  However, I turned them down as nicely as possible because I had the opportunity to complete a funded masters at an accelerated pace.

Anyway, the people who offered me a job then emailed me to see how things were going.  I emailed back, and they indicated they wanted to have a phone call with me.  They seemed to really like me when I interned for them before, so I believe there may be a possible job offer in the future as I will be graduating from my masters this May.

The job they offered me before is in one of the areas I prefer - R&amp;D - and had the possibility of going into my other area of preference - controls (which is what I've been pursuing in my MS).  They offered me $60,000 which is pretty respectable.

However, I don't know how much is reasonable for salary now.

In my undergrad, I think I was a pretty good student.  I graduated with a 3.69/4.0, and I had a total of two years of engineering internships and co-ops at 4 different companies.  I also was a tutor for intro level MechE courses and German.

Grad school has not been so kind.  I've been battling depression, so my GPA is a 3.37 as of right now, and I technically only have to take one more class, so it's not going to change much.  I also don't have tons of research experience, but I'm hopeful I'll have at least one journal paper published.

Because of this disparaging achievement, I don't know what I should be expecting.  My school's report on salaries for MechE indicate for a BS that low is $24,960, average is $56,592 and high is $70,000.  I couldn't find numbers for MS, or MS might be rolled into that - I'm not certain.  Additionally, the company is is a low-ish cost of living area (Midwest).

So, any ideas?  I'm inclined to think I'm probably not worth much more than the $60,000 they offered me before, but that seems silly as I will (hopefully) have an advanced degree by then.

**TL;DR: I'm graduating with an MS in mechanical engineering.  My grades and experience for undergrad were good, but my grades in grad school are average at best.  What am I worth?**"
1kx60f,4,2013-08-22,Considering switching majors - good idea?,mike_br,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/1kx60f/considering_switching_majors_good_idea/,"Right now I'm an incoming transfer student in ChemE, but I'm considering switching my major to Computer Science. Lately, as I've been speaking to more students at the university I'll be attending (UCSD), while the engineering school as a whole is regarded fairly well, the chemical program seems to be mostly ignored in favor of other programs, and there seems to be little in the way of networking and internship options, whereas the CS department has much more in the way of opportunities at the school.

Personally, I'm more interested in the ChemE material, but I have more actual experience with programming and software design, not to mention the fact that everyone I know is in the software field, while I don't have a single connection to the chemical/process industry. For that reason along with the program's strength, it concerns me that pursuing Chem E will limit my options and possibly result in inability to find employment.

Am I being foolish and unnecessarily worried in wanting to switch my major based on concerns about the job market? My main concern throughout going back to school is that I end up being a viable job candidate."

I'll try to keep this a bit on the brief side but want to share my personal success with giving up on masturbation( hopefully for good) I'm a 22 year old male, who has been playing with the skin slinky since around the age of 7 or 8. I've always been very shy, insecure, reclusive and not very confident at all(especially with girls) . I used to jerk off at least once a day on average, sometimes 2-3 times if really bored or depressed. Once I went a couple weeks without jerking off just to see how long I could restrain myself but didn't know at the time that I would have been best off quitting. Porn hasn't been a big issue, as I would mainly fantasize alot, but I started to get into porn recently and have realized that I'm making my addiction worse and distorting my view of women. After discovering this subreddit and reading various success stories, I decided that maybe it's worth giving up masturbation for at least a couple months to see if anything would happen, especially in terms of overcoming depressing and confidence issues. I always noticed feeling especially moody and depressed when I would play with myself too often....

  I  am noticing all the usuall benefits/superpowers including increased confidence, energy, mood, etc etc. I haven't felt that this great in a long time, if ever! Feels like my true potential is very slowly being unlocked. Relapses almost happened but i had the willpower to resist by running or taking cold showers or something like that. Although I've only gone over 40 days, I am curious to see what will happen over the coming months. I am especially feeling alot more confident talking to girls and hopefully, I will get over a relationship phobia.( have had relationships before, most were brief partly because of the phobia and going after the wrong kind of girls.) 
   
While i shouldn't blame excessive masturbation for all of my problems, I feel like it is a catalyst for change that is helping me curb other addictions ( drinking, smoking, internet addiction, etc) and habits as well since I consider it to be one of, if not my worse addiction in life.  This abstinence is helping me also to focus on being a better person and start to be who I've always wanted to be. Hopefully this will also help with being more motivated for and do better in college courses, talk to more people, and get the internship I want for my field of study. I am very thankful for this subbreddit and plan to be a Fapstronaut for good!

Usually I don't post on reddit, but recently I don't really know how to deal with my current situation (this is a throwaway btw). Any advice is appreciated.

So it began last summer when I met this girl (let's call her Jenny) at my company. She was here for an internship. During that time, we hung out during work and our relationship began to slowly evolve into something more than friendship. However, I had a serious relationship with my girlfriend at the time (3 years), so I began to shy away from this girl because I didn't want to cheat on my girlfriend (Amanda). So after that summer, Jenny left and I did not have any contact with her besides some texts from her here and there. 

Fast forward to this year, my girlfriend has to take a trip to another city due to her company training. Unfortunately, the day that she left was when Jenny came back as a full time employee. I tried to say hi to Jenny the first day at work, but she was really cold to me and didn’t say much. However, after a couple days, we hung out. While we were hanging out, it was just like the year before. However, after we hung out, she would go back to the cold demeanor of ignoring me. This really began to mess with my head.

At this moment, I felt that I began to like Jenny which I know is terrible since I had a girlfriend. But I don’t know why, but I started to become more and more attracted to her. As time went on, I began to try to hang out with her more and more to the point where it became obsessive and unhealthy. It was completely different from the year before when she would be the one suggesting we hang out. I could tell that I was becoming more and more pushy in our friendship. I unfortunately wanted more.

It culminated to one day, where Jenny promised to meet up but didn’t show up. I was incredibly angry and distraught since I became really attached to her. That night, I forced her to come over by saying I had something really important to talk about, and I confronted her as to why she was acting the way she was. When she came she was noticeably upset.

That night, I found out that she broke up with her 4 year long boyfriend last year during her internship because she liked me last year and knew she didn’t have feelings for him anymore. However, since I had a girlfriend last year, she “knew I would never be with her” and she suppressed the feelings throughout the year. Now she said she didn’t like me as much as she did last year, but still had some feelings for me. 

I (being the idiot that I am) asked Jenny if I asked her out if she would say yes. She said she would. 

I had a trip to see my girlfriend that week. 

During the trip, my girlfriend could see that I was preoccupied with other thoughts on my mind and asked what was wrong. I told her the truth and said that I am starting to like this other girl (I know… I’m horrible…). By the end of the trip, I broke up with my girlfriend and came back feeling like I am the world’s biggest asshole and a little depressed.

When I came back and told Jenny, she was not happy. She avoided me even more and told me I shouldn’t have broken up with my girlfriend and she could see that my girlfriend really loved me. However, after a couple days, I was able to convince her to hang out with me again (again being really pushy about it), and we went on a date. During the date I asked her out and she (reluctantly I think) said yes. 

The next week was a nightmare. We would be considered dating for a day, then she would call me the next saying she’s not sure. However, when we would meet up, she would change her mind and say that she was sure again. This continued for quite a while and really messed with my mind even more. It just made me more desperate to hang out because she was “sure she wanted to be with me” when we were together and had doubts when we weren’t. Every day was like a rollercoaster ride

After a week of this occurring, we finally had a talk and could both say that we were not happy. She said she didn’t want a relationship right now and that she couldn’t put her heart into it if she still wasn’t sure if we were meant to be together.  She told me that she liked me but didn’t really like me. The feeling from last year was gone she said, and she doesn’t know if it will come back. I still wanted to be in the relationship, but I recognized how much pain is was causing both of us. We ended up deciding to go no contact each other for a few weeks. 

Looking back on it I think I’m being an idiot for a variety of reasons. First, I think that I shouldn’t have been so pushy with Jenny since she clearly was not ready for anything really serious. I was treating our relationship as if it were with Amanda  - and if you treat someone you meet similarly to someone you’ve been with for 3 years, they’re going to be scared away. Also, I think it was really stupid of me to ask her out right after I broke up with Amanda. I clearly wasn’t ready for a new relationship and needed time to piece myself together. I also shouldn’t have been attracted to Amanda in the first place. I should have never given myself the opportunity to start liking her. Once I knew she liked me, I should have avoided her to be fair to Amanda.

I feel really frustrated recently. I really wish that I loved my girlfriend because she is such a great person. I really believe that if we did have a future together, it would be amazing. At the same time, I can't seem to let go of Jenny. She’s constantly on my mind, and I’m just thinking of ways to get her back (although we’re still not talking). It's almost as if I can see the same situation from both sides (the one who wants to like the other person back and the one who wants the other person to like him back); however, the sad thing is I can’t seem to figure out how to solve the problem from either side. I've been tormented by this for a month and would love to just make a decision, but I find that even I don’t know what I really want. 

I don’t want to contact my old girlfriend unless I was sure that I wanted to be with her and I could provide her the love she deserves. I am still very much attracted to Jenny (which makes me not want to contact my girlfriend because that would be unfair to her), but I don’t know if I fucked up so much that it would be impossible for it to work. I think I really want to be with Jenny, but I don’t know if I messed up so much that I no longer have a shot. Does reddit have any thoughts? 

tl;dr I broke up with my girlfriend to be with a girl I have fallen for, and now I think I messed everything up"
1l0ruk,1,2013-08-24,Fear is the mind killer.,mind-killer,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1l0ruk/fear_is_the_mind_killer/,"That's what I keep telling myself. I've decided I'm seeing a counselor again on Monday, but that seems far away. I could use someone to talk to.

Some of this is from a previous post I made in the self help subreddit.

I miss my girlfriend terribly, and I won't see her for another 4 or 5 months. It's been 4 already. I want to visit her, but with student loans to pay off, I just don't have the money to visit. She has a different philosophy about money, and has a tough time understanding why I can't spend the $2,000 to go visit. Meanwhile I'm having trouble finding a job where I'd be able to make everyone happy, most importantly myself.

I don't want to discount the possibility of going to visit, but we got in a bit of a fight about the fact that I most likely wouldn't be able to visit because of money. I felt so terrible. I've been saving all summer so we could get an apartment together when she gets back. I've also had a lot of other stress with money because my parents make too much for me to get work study or other financial aid, and I'm looking for a job or an internship.

We've had a rocky period a few months before the summer where we broke up twice within a few months then ended up back together based on a mutual decision after a break. There were some issues with depression on her end during that time.


I still feel like she is angry with me, even though she says she isn't. Especially because she brought up that I should buy a ticket now since prices are going up, or then I'm ""not coming for sure."" I can't help but think she feels differently about me, or thinks I don't hold her as a priority. I can tell she feels angry no matter how non-confrontationally I try to bring it up. Maybe not at me, but certainly at the situation.

I would basically do anything to earn that money (or better yet, get a great job) at this point, just so I wouldn't have to worry anymore."
1l0jz5,1,2013-08-24,I don't know what I want [M24],purplepira,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1l0jz5/i_dont_know_what_i_want_m24/,"Hi reddit. Usually I don't post on reddit, but recently I don't really know how to deal with my current situation (this is a throwaway btw). Any advice is appreciated.

So it began last summer when I met this girl (let's call her Jenny) at my company. She was here for an internship. During that time, we hung out during work and our relationship began to slowly evolve into something more than friendship. However, I had a serious relationship with my girlfriend at the time (3 years), so I began to shy away from this girl because I didn't want to cheat on my girlfriend (Amanda). So after that summer, Jenny left and I did not have any contact with her besides some texts from her here and there. 

Fast forward to this year, my girlfriend has to take a trip to another city due to her company training. Unfortunately, the day that she left was when Jenny came back as a full time employee. I tried to say hi to Jenny the first day at work, but she was really cold to me and didn’t say much. However, after a couple days, we hung out. While we were hanging out, it was just like the year before. However, after we hung out, she would go back to the cold demeanor of ignoring me. This really began to mess with my head.

At this moment, I felt that I began to like Jenny which I know is terrible since I had a girlfriend. But I don’t know why, but I started to become more and more attracted to her. As time went on, I began to try to hang out with her more and more to the point where it became obsessive and unhealthy. It was completely different from the year before when she would be the one suggesting we hang out. I could tell that I was becoming more and more pushy in our friendship. I unfortunately wanted more.

It culminated to one day, where Jenny promised to meet up but didn’t show up. I was incredibly angry and distraught since I became really attached to her. That night, I forced her to come over by saying I had something really important to talk about, and I confronted her as to why she was acting the way she was. When she came she was noticeably upset.

That night, I found out that she broke up with her 4 year long boyfriend last year during her internship because she liked me last year and knew she didn’t have feelings for him anymore. However, since I had a girlfriend last year, she “knew I would never be with her” and she suppressed the feelings throughout the year. Now she said she didn’t like me as much as she did last year, but still had some feelings for me. 

I (being the idiot that I am) asked Jenny if I asked her out if she would say yes. She said she would. 

I had a trip to see my girlfriend that week. 

During the trip, my girlfriend could see that I was preoccupied with other thoughts on my mind and asked what was wrong. I told her the truth and said that I am starting to like this other girl (I know… I’m horrible…). By the end of the trip, I broke up with my girlfriend and came back feeling like I am the world’s biggest asshole and a little depressed.

When I came back and told Jenny, she was not happy. She avoided me even more and told me I shouldn’t have broken up with my girlfriend and she could see that my girlfriend really loved me. However, after a couple days, I was able to convince her to hang out with me again (again being really pushy about it), and we went on a date. During the date I asked her out and she (reluctantly I think) said yes. 

The next week was a nightmare. We would be considered dating for a day, then she would call me the next saying she’s not sure. However, when we would meet up, she would change her mind and say that she was sure again. This continued for quite a while and really messed with my mind even more. It just made me more desperate to hang out because she was “sure she wanted to be with me” when we were together and had doubts when we weren’t. Every day was like a rollercoaster ride

After a week of this occurring, we finally had a talk and could both say that we were not happy. She said she didn’t want a relationship right now and that she couldn’t put her heart into it if she still wasn’t sure if we were meant to be together.  She told me that she liked me but didn’t really like me. The feeling from last year was gone she said, and she doesn’t know if it will come back. I still wanted to be in the relationship, but I recognized how much pain is was causing both of us. We ended up deciding to go no contact each other for a few weeks. 

Looking back on it I think I’m being an idiot for a variety of reasons. First, I think that I shouldn’t have been so pushy with Jenny since she clearly was not ready for anything really serious. I was treating our relationship as if it were with Amanda  - and if you treat someone you meet similarly to someone you’ve been with for 3 years, they’re going to be scared away. Also, I think it was really stupid of me to ask her out right after I broke up with Amanda. I clearly wasn’t ready for a new relationship and needed time to piece myself together. I also shouldn’t have been attracted to Amanda in the first place. I should have never given myself the opportunity to start liking her. Once I knew she liked me, I should have avoided her to be fair to Amanda.

I feel really frustrated recently. I really wish that I loved my girlfriend because she is such a great person. I really believe that if we did have a future together, it would be amazing. At the same time, I can't seem to let go of Jenny. She’s constantly on my mind, and I’m just thinking of ways to get her back (although we’re still not talking). It's almost as if I can see the same situation from both sides (the one who wants to like the other person back and the one who wants the other person to like him back); however, the sad thing is I can’t seem to figure out how to solve the problem from either side. I've been tormented by this for a month and would love to just make a decision, but I find that even I don’t know what I really want. 

I don’t want to contact my old girlfriend unless I was sure that I wanted to be with her and I could provide her the love she deserves. I am still very much attracted to Jenny (which makes me not want to contact my girlfriend because that would be unfair to her), but I don’t know if I fucked up so much that it would be impossible for it to work. I think I really want to be with Jenny, but I don’t know if I messed up so much that I no longer have a shot. Does reddit have any thoughts?

1l0hv9,4,2013-08-24,Apocalyptic Dream and other weird stuff.,botanicusmusic,Dreams,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/1l0hv9/apocalyptic_dream_and_other_weird_stuff/,"Yesterday was the last day of my internship at a manufacturing plant, so my coworkers decided to take me out for drinks. We started drinking at 430 and I was in bed by 830. (I live in a small town with few friends and nothing to do.) I woke up at 440 AM (8 hours of sleep!) and wrote down what I could remember from this crazy dream:

---------------------
I was visiting a girl at her house. She introduced me to some of her family members and we all talked for a while in the living room. She had a brother, 2 or 3 sisters and her uncle was there along with both parents.

After talking with the family, we walked around the house. The house wasn’t a mansion, but it was a really nice house. Everything was really nice: large open spaces, high ceilings, amazing counter tops, appliancies. Huge, huge, spacious bathrooms, bedrooms, and rooms between bathrooms and bedrooms.

We were walking around the house and finally decided to go do something. She brushed her teeth (which I guess is important because I always brush my teeth before going to do anything cool or with people). We met up with a group of friends outside and started walking. I can’t remember where we were heading, maybe I didn’t even know.

I was wearing normal street shoes and clothes at this point. Somehow I remembered that I lost my pair of Ecco dress shoes and a polo/dress shirt. It was weird because another group of people on the other side of the street were carrying a couple pairs of dress shoes and a few shirts. I walked over to them and asked if they had found my shoes or polo. They gave me my shirt back but they didn’t have my dress shoes. I was like, “What the fuck?! What happened to my dress shoes?” Then I turned around to see someone sprinting in between two houses to a trail that went through a wooded area. I started chasing him because I thought he stole my dress shoes. After chasing this guy through the woods to no avail, I ended up on a riverfront area, where the group shortly caught up with me.

There were cities on both sides of the river and an overhead cable tram connecting the two cities, as well as a bridge on the left side. There was some flat land on the right. A small city/county fair was going on, one similar to a county fair where they have livestock and what not. The flat land on the right is where the cows were penned up.

As the weather started to turn bad, I looked at the tram traversing the river just in time to see it fall from the cable and land in the water. It made a huge splash and scared everyone at the fair. Some boat zoomed over there to try to rescue people from the fallen tram, and then it crashed.

The weather was getting worse. I looked over to the livestock area where all the cows were and noticed they were all farting continuously and a cloud of smoke was rising above them. Immediately after looking right, I looked left at the bridge that connected the cities. I couldn’t see any cars driving across, but I did see that there were gorillas perched like gargoyle statues lining the entire bridge. Above them there were hundreds of eagles circling around. I’m thinking to myself that something is definitely fucked up. Something is going on bad. People are starting to freak out. Our group decided to leave the riverfront area. Once we got up to the roads, we noticed that traffic was not moving, it was in gridlock. I walked past a cop car with two cops in it. I knocked on his window, but he didn’t acknowledge me, so I knocked again. This time he looked at me with a stern but concerned look. I asked him, “What’s happening?” He replied, “there was a 1.3 degree change in the polar regions,” or some shit like that. I looked at him and asked, “You mean, the apocalypse?” He said, “Yes.” My group is now freaking out.

We got back to the house where it was creepy and dark. We hadn’t lost power, but the impending storm made everything really dark. It was now just me and the girl. We were walking past one of the rooms in the house with a table and I noticed a glimpse of a short woman lying on a table. I didn’t think much of it the first time I walked passed. Later, the whole family and I were eating dinner. The small girl that I saw earlier came around a dark corner and started looking at everyone. I’m looking at the family for answers, yelling, “Who the fuck is this? Who the fuck is this?” They don’t seem scared, but I am scared because she is walking towards me. Looking back at the family didn’t help, so I picked up my chair to use as a defensive barrier or to beat her with it if I had to. She got closer and closer to me. I felt like she was going to attack me, so I started swinging my chair at her. She reached her hand out calmly and poked me with this small piece of metal in her hand and I passed out."
1l0giu,0,2013-08-24,Did I [23f] make a mistake by ending a 3 1/2 year relationship with my boyfriend [25m]?,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1l0giu/did_i_23f_make_a_mistake_by_ending_a_3_12_year/,"So it has been three weeks now since I broke up with him. Some days are harder than others, and last night which was my childhood best friend's wedding was one of the hardest. Okay, for some backstory:

We met at college, did long distance for a year when he went overseas after graduating, long distance again when we were in different cities while I was still in school, and then had one year (this past year) where we were in the same city and basically lived together. Besides this past summer/year, we have had a great relationship. We both love being outdoors and active, we run, bike, hike, camp, rollerblade, workout together. We have similar life goals and aspirations. His family loved and accepted me, his mom was basically planning on our future kids. Everyone, our friends, family, my SO and even myself sort of assumed we would get married in a few years. 

The Problems:

He has some serious anxiety and vulnerability problems that have really gotten to me.  He stresses out, ruminates, and obsesses over everything. Swollen lymph nodes? He thinks he has cancer. Messed up something on an exam? It's going to ruin his career. He is *extremely* anal and his obsessing gets really exhausting. I would humor him for a while, but eventually I wanted him to let things go which he had trouble doing. 

He also has problems being emotional and empathetic. He sort of had an emotional breakdown this past winter where he obsessed over death and how he would eventually lose everything he ever cared about (i.e. me, his family, career). I think ever since then he has been putting up an emotional roadblock again. He also values being restrained, logical and controlled so emotion really isn't his thing. However, it *is* my thing. I am a super emotional person, who cries whenever we get in fights because I hate being in conflict with him. This in turn, would really upset him and he would become defensive instead of comforting. 

We had been planning on seeing a couples counselor for the past 6-9 months to deal with our issues but it just hasn't been able to happen yet. He worked a 9-5, and life just kept getting in the way. We thought this fall might work, but I might be going to a different side of the country for an internship. Eitherway, I have a lot of work to do on figuring out wtf I am doing with the rest of my life. Finally, though, I was just tired and fed up of our fairly often spats over nothing. We just haven't been on the same page for so long now, and this past summer was so weird and different between us. There has just been more ""meh"" or bad than good times and I haven't been super happy.

I should also mention that I feel like he hadn't been giving me what I wanted for a while. Didn't try as hard as he used to to make me feel like a princess and make me feel like he was in love with me. Wouldn't respond to my jokes like I hoped. Wasn't as physically affectionate as I wanted. Many of the nice things he would do simply because I've told him I wished he would do those types of things. 

Now my question:

Did I end things prematurely? His main issue with the breakup is that we never gave couples counseling a real try. I love him so much still and it hurts not to be with him. Every day I imagine what fun things we could be doing and at the wedding last night, it sucked so much not to have him there with me. At the same time, I know it partly would have been artifical since things haven't been great between us.
---
 
**tl;dr**: Broke up my 3.5 year relationship because I haven't been happy. Still confused and regretting it often. Not sure if what I did was right. I've talked to my friends about this, but I would still like perspective from other people."
1l0aut,7,2013-08-24,CS junior looking for advice on prospective internship hunt,see-ess,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1l0aut/cs_junior_looking_for_advice_on_prospective/,"I'm planning on getting an internship for the Summer of 2014, but have the following obstacles that I was interested in getting some advice on to see how I may overcome them.

* My GPA is abysmal. I'm currently sitting at a cumulative 2.67 (with my CS GPA being 2.18) but may be able to get it up to a 2.77 (CS GPA) if I get all A's this upcoming semester and the one following it (Spring 2014).

* To get A's, I'd need all of the time available to me to study and would find it difficult to squeeze in time for side projects/open source contributions. 

* I don't have any previous internships.

* As a friend put it, listing coursework in my resume would not really be saying why I'm exceptional; every CS major has CS-related coursework. Thus, it's better to stand out by having actual personal projects and coding beyond what's taught in the classroom. 

Some considerations/questions:

* I have ideas for side projects that I'd really like to actually implement. The problem is I'd have to sacrifice getting the highest possible GPA (I could have a 2.9 CS GPA, tops and a 3.0 cumulative GPA, tops) to make room for those side projects. The cost of actually working to build those projects would make me have three A's and a B, or two B's and a C and an A, or anything else other than all A's.

Is it more worth it to have those side projects/open source contributions in terms of being employable as opposed to having the highest possible GPA I can have at this point?

* I find projects like [this](http://1ucasvb.tumblr.com/) and [this](http://intothecontinuum.tumblr.com/) and even [this](http://tane.us) to be awesome and totally worth my time, if I did something similar. Would these be good side projects to show in place of some other application on github, for instance?

* I don't really even have a resume worked out at the moment, but is there any advantage to listing the fact that I was a college algebra tutor for two semesters? The thing to consider is this was during Fall 2009 and Spring 2010.

Some background info:

* Currently a junior, gonna be a senior in Spring 2014 and graduating in Dec 2014.

I realize the situation is pretty bad, but I'd appreciate any sort of advice I could get. :)

1l07d3,2,2013-08-24,"Graduated last year, help on recruiting?",[deleted],Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/1l07d3/graduated_last_year_help_on_recruiting/,"I'm in Toronto, ON, Canada and I graduated last year. I had worked internships at a small sized firm before I graduated. After graduating I looked for work but did not find anything until December. In December, I was offered a position at a big 4 firm for their busy season (three months). 

They did not give me a fulltime offer though, and I was basically told to reapply in September. I've been looking for work since then, but have not found many CA articling student jobs (literally found 1, got the interview, but was not offered a job)

I have registered for a big4 recruiting event. I've attended these before, but never felt like I connected with anyone. I'm fairly shy. I created a linkedin account, but have not added anyone whom I've worked with (again shy and self-conscious, I always feel like why would anyone want to ""connect"" with me on linkedin).

So I was wondering what I can do to improve my chances? Is it even worth going to recruiting events? I feel like I'd be in a room with younger students, most in their final year of school, and I'd see recruiters who I've met at recruiting events in prior years, some of whom might remember me as the shy, nervous guy.

tl;dr graduated last year, how can I get a CA student job?"
1kzo5e,1,2013-08-24,Possibly moving to St. Louis for my first *real* job. Where to live and how much to pay? [Specifics inside],[deleted],StLouis,https://www.reddit.com/r/StLouis/comments/1kzo5e/possibly_moving_to_st_louis_for_my_first_real_job/,"I recently finished my PhD and I may be getting an offer for a job in St. Louis in the next few days that will be my first real job (i.e., not an internship, exchange program, or summer camp job).

I looked through a few of the ""moving to St. Louis"" posts, but I was hoping to get some more specific input about where to live and what a fair price range is for my situation.

Here are a few of the specifics:

1. The job would be in the Maryland Heights/Creve Couer area, and I would really like a fairly short commute (under 15 min), if possible.

2. My wife and I are around 30, but we generally do not drink or go to bars/clubs.  Furthermore, my wife is currently pregnant with our first, so we would prefer a somewhat more family friendly area.  

3. Adding to the last point, my wife will be a stay-at-home mom for the first few years, so an area with lots of activities for babies/toddlers (walking, playgrounds, etc) would be nice. 

4. We are looking to rent a place for a couple years and if it seems like I will be continuing the job for the long term, buy a house.  This would likely happen before our child was old enough to attend school, so the school system right now isn't a factor in our decision.

5. While we are not looking to spend more than we need to, this job will pay quite well and we are willing to pay a little extra if it is worth it.

So my overall question is simply where would be the preferred areas for us to live and what would be a fair price for a nice 2-3 bedroom apartment in those areas?

Any help would be appreciated."
1kzmh7,3,2013-08-24,I don't know how to deal with my idiot parents or their dog who constantly pisses in the house.,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1kzmh7/i_dont_know_how_to_deal_with_my_idiot_parents_or/,"I'm at my dad's house for the summer as I'm a university student studying computer science and I'm not taking any summer classes. They got a second dog back in March  and she has a few problems. She has a lot of anxiety and she pees in the house a lot. Because my dad and his girlfriend work and my internship only requires me to go into the office once a week (the rest of the time I work from home), it's my job to let the dogs out. However, the dog still pisses in the house and I get the blame for it.

They told me to keep a better watch over her. What do they want me to do? Have her chained to my desk while I work so she's always by me? I'm not going to sit on the couch and watch her sleep just to make sure she doesn't piss in the house. I suggested keeping her in her crate all day so it's not an issue but they cried out against how terrible that would be for the dog despite them doing that when I'm at school. I let the dogs out once an hour which should be plenty of fucking time, but the dog still pisses in my house. My other dog is completely fine and he only pisses once every five hours or so. How is this my fault?

So today, the dog pissed in the house again while I was in the bathroom taking a crap. Not much I could do there. I let the dogs out literally right before I went into the bathroom and when I came out, there was a piss stain on the carpet. Whatever. My dad's girlfriend uses this machine to clean out the piss stains when I'm away at work or back when I was in school, but I don't know how to use it. So, I clean up the piss the way we used to do it when our first dog wasn't bathroom-trained yet. I got on my hands and knees with 409 and paper towels and I scrubbed. I figured, no big deal. I'll just do that for this piss stain. It's what I've done for all of the previous ones and there hasn't seemed to of been a problem.

Fast forward three hours later and my dad's girlfriend gets home from work. I'm laying on my bed with the door open but she thinks I'm taking a nap. I can hear her pause when she gets to the piss stain, let out a big sigh, and goes to grab some paper towels. She must've rubbed it and seen that it was just wet still from the 409 that I put on there, but all of the piss was gone. No matter. She then proceeds to put some baking soda on the stain, vacuum it up a few minutes later, and that's that. She goes on doing her shit and I proceed to take a nap.

My sister lives with my mom and she comes over every weekend so after sleeping for about thirty minutes, I go up and go to get her for the weekend. I walk past my dad's girlfriend, say hello, she responds with a hello back, nothing. I put on my shoes, tell her I'm going to go get my sister, she acknowledges me, and I leave. Keep in mind that it takes an hour and a half for me to complete the trip total. A whole hour and a half. When I get back, I can hear her starting up the machine she uses to clean up the piss stains. Once I take off my shoes and go upstairs to get to my room, she looks at me and begins to yell, ""SHE PEED ON THE CARPET WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING. YOU HAVE TO USE THE MACHINE TO CLEAN IT UP."" I respond, ""No, she didn't pee on the carpet while I was sleeping. She peed while I was in the bathroom and I cleaned it up."" Instantly, she responds, ""IT DOESN'T MATTER! YOU HAVE TO USE THE MACHINE!"" I didn't think much of it as she bursts out a lot and went to my room.

However, thirty minutes later, my dad calls me. As soon as I pick up with a hello, he yells, ""YOU DIDN'T USE THE MACHINE TO CLEAN UP THE PISS? Phoxe, you're about to be twenty god damn years old. All you do is play video games all day and sit on your ass. Stop being so god damn lazy and clean that up. Why didn't you use the machine?"" I stated, ""I don't know how to use the machine. [Dad's girlfriend] never showed me how to use it, so I just cleaned it the way we cleaned up [first dog's] piss."" He quickly remarked in a very surprisingly condescendingly tone, ""You don't know how to use the machine?"" He then hung up the phone. My dad is a police officer, so it was surprising to hear him lose his temper. Five minutes later, he calls me back. ""What did you say?"" ""Sorry?"" ""You don't know how to use the machine?"" I honestly couldn't believe I was having this conversation. ""Yes. I don't know how to use the machine. I don't know what soap goes into it, if it requires any water, where to put this stuff, what setting to put it on. I don't know how to use it."" He responded by saying that we'll talk about this tomorrow.

Seriously though. What the fuck. There are so many things wrong with what happened that I'm not even mad with what happened. I honestly just can't believe that what's going on is going on. First off, for my dad's girlfriend: thank you for trying to lie to me by saying that the dog pissed while I was sleeping. She did not piss while I was sleeping. Second, thank you for waiting an hour and a fucking half to use the machine just so you could do it in front of me to lecture me. If you honestly cared about getting the stain out of the fucking carpet (which it already was, mind you. It just had to dry), you would have used the machine when you saw the fucking stain.

As for my dad, since when did your girlfriend take priority over your son? And when did you stop using your fucking head? ""You don't know how to use it?"" Yes, I don't. If I sat you in front of some fucking HTML/CSS code for a site from the 90s you wouldn't fucking understand that shit. And I'm not even half as lazy as you describe me to be. Just this morning you commended me on continuing to work out 5 days a week. In case you forgot, I'm just a LITTLE busy trying to sort out a bunch of events for the upcoming school year due to me being the president of the biggest club on campus. I'm just a LITTLE busy due to my internship in which I just got promoted to Managing Partner and am trying to prepare our product for a smooth beta test while I go into the school year. I'm just a LITTLE busy by dedicating two hours, five fucking days a week, to work out and transform my body. You THINK I'm playing video games all day because that's the only time when you're home. You work from 2pm-2am. You see me for two, maybe three hours a day from 10am-1pm. I play my games in the morning because my meetings start at 12pm and that's when I begin to work, because I end up working until 8pm. What the fuck do you want from me? And on the weekends? Sorry! I FORGOT I COULDN'T RELAX ON THE WEEKEND.

Fuck you guys."

-------------------------

I have always been shy and reluctant to talk to people. I was always a little reserved and got the perfect hobby for that, computers. Ever since the age of 4, I have been associated with computers and known for it.

I have always had friends but never got close friends until college. 

During elementary school, I had friends from school. I talked to them during school but that was it. I don't think I have ever went out with them. When they invited me out, I had always come up with excuses. At first they kept inviting me but then they gave up too. I don't remember those times very well.

I never really got hot flushes or shaky hands in social situations. I was attentive in class and wasn't very anxious around people.

I had a decent childhood overall. When you start to look at my past though, I think you might say that I had some bad social experiences. Some bullying in the first two years of high school but I don't think this is what is causing all the problems with my life. Nothing traumatizing but some of my experiences could have been discouraging. I'm pretty sure that many people had similar experiences and lived their lives without social anxiety.

My parents don't have the best marriage. They constantly argued as I was growing up and they still do. As I was growing up, they would have these all-night-long fights every three months or so where they would yell at each other with all the stress they accumulated in-between these fights. I can easily call it a loveless marriage. I don't have the best relationship with my dad. We always had arguments, and essentially never got along. I still am not fond of him and we still don't treat each other well. That might have had an impact.

When I look back, I think I have always been avoidant of social occasions. I remember, I was never that kid who sat in the corner. I would socialize with people only in school, though. I'm not sure why. I just didn't feel like it and always felt too shy (and ashamed maybe, for some reason. Makes no sense to me either but I think I remember feeling that way) to ask my parents if I could go out with friends.

College comes in. I make some friends and socialize with them. We go to bars and frats basically every weekend. For the first time in my life, I get a close friend circle but still constantly felt like I am actually not regarded as a part of the group. I am at a Junior right now and doing a great internship in California where I make a lot of money and meet with the industry leaders. I see all these people who are great at their jobs and also great from a social perspective. I thought you couldn't have both. That's how I was reassuring myself. More on this later.

I never had a girlfriend even though I liked some girls a lot and felt really close to them. There was this girl in high school, Melanie. I had a huge crush on her. 

I was very reluctant asking her out. Maybe I was too shy, maybe I felt inadequate, maybe I didn't want her to reject me. Maybe I just felt ashamed, I didn't know how to tell my parents that I was dating with this girl. Which is very funny because they would be extremely encouraging and they would get very excited and be very proud.

Melanie and I got close and she was showing signs of interest. I was really into her. I constantly debated with myself whether if I should ask her out. Never did. One time, I got really close. We were walking together from a class and I just stopped, looked her in the eyes and told her I wanted to tell her something. She reciprocated. She smiled and looked at me in the eyes. It was obvious that she was excited and I felt that she was expecting me to ask her out. I chickened out and told her something else.

Fast-forward a year (where we still kept in touch with a similar pattern). Our graduation ceremony... I see her after the ceremony is over and she sees me. I look at her, trying to say something. She looks at me and she is with her parents. I just go to her and hug her. We hug for something around ten seconds. I let go. She does the same. And then out of the blue, she hugs me again. This one takes longer.

We have another graduation party probably a couple of days after that. It was at a beach resort where we all get to drink, all expenses covered by the school. At some point, it is just me and her and we walk together by the beach. It is obvious she is expecting something and I should make a move but I end up not doing it. We talk about some stuff that are bothering her. Drink some more, plan to go to the after-party party. We go there and meet again. Get some more drinks. She gets distracted, I get distracted and we spend some time separately. She jumps into the sea fully clothed and is promptly carried outside. I stand by her all night, assuring that everything will be okay. She isn't very responsive to my attempts to cheer her up so I just tell her that I'll just leave then. She says ""no, please don't go"". I don't. I end up carrying her back to a cab and then to her parents place. Next day, she texts me, apologizes and thanks me for everything that I have done. I say no problem and this is the last time I have heard from her. Except for her appearing on my Facebook feed and me telling her that I really liked her over Facebook Chat and not hearing back.

My current self would be more proactive and confident in a situation like this. I have changed and improved ever since high-school, that's for sure. I wish I could see her and talk to her but we live in different countries now and even though I go back to my home country at least twice a year, I never tried to contact her.

Anyway... I know it looks like I am fixated on this girl, and while I admit that I used to be, that's not the case anymore. She is just an epic social failure in my past and that's it. If I improve, I might give her a call when I get back but that's a topic for later...

Back to the topic...

I had sex before, but never had a girlfriend. No girl that I was sincerely interested in and attracted to ever showed interest in me. I had sex with an escort a year ago and hooked up with a couple of friends of mine (that I wasn't particularly interested, so I had some erectile dysfunction)..

I am amped up about meeting with friends etc. but I always end up canceling the last minute because I just don't feel like going. The reason why I was able to socialize with people in college was because we lived right by each other.

I am now in California, the end of my internship is coming and even though I was imagining that this time would be awesome because I would have my own place in San Francisco and go out to bars every day, I went out once. Some friends invited me out constantly but I always came up with excuses.

I tried many nootropics, many psychostimulants, many supplements but none really helped. Racetams give me verbal fluency and that's why I'll keep taking them. Magnesium, Zinc and B6 seem to decrease my anxiety around people. I don't normally get sweaty or shaky but I get this shitty bodily sensation when I am anxious. It feels like people are paying attention to even the smallest of my actions and judging me. Which is unsettling and makes me even more self-conscious. I am consciously aware that this is not the case and people wouldn't call me out on an eye twitch or small gesture like that but I can't help that feeling.

I take ADHD medication daily. It helps me be more outgoing and sociable. I started taking it my sophomore year of college, and I think it helps. It makes me less avoidant, more sociable and more cheerful versus lethargic and cloudy. Granted it might be exacerbating my anxiety to a certain degree but I don't know what my options are.

I experimented with recreational substances. My psychedelic experiences were always positive. I felt blissful, music sounded amazing and I noticed that I had some things I didn't like about myself and that I can change them. I felt motivated to take steps to change myself but this motivation was short-lived. It faded away very quickly and I turned back to my old behavior in no time.

When I was young, I remember feeling ashamed in social occasions. For instance, when I was eating outside with my parents and I end up needing something (utensils or a refill or something) and a similar/same feeling of shame holds me back from asking to the waiter/waitress. I remember not having this problem when I am outside eating alone, or with friends. Basically, I am/was noticeably more introverted around my parents.

I am aware that exposure therapy is supposed to help. I am doing my best meeting with people on a daily basis, saying hi to random people at school or work, and getting into conversations with people. It hasn't helped much but it's something I have been working on. I don't think I have textbook social anxiety. Something is off somewhere.

I am totally fine with talking to authority figures, or customer service as I am returning an item, or doing a presentation. I am more comfortable doing those than walking on the street.

I never tried SSRIs or social-anxiety-targeting MAOIs. I went to a psychiatrist once when I was younger to talk about the problems I was having while trying to fall asleep alone. I was afraid, even when the lights were on. The doctor told me that it was an anxiety disorder and it should fix itself as I grow up. I felt this feeling that kept me away from closing my eyes and going to sleep until the junior year of high school. Interestingly enough, this psychiatrist insisted on seeing me at least weekly. I thought it was just for money at the time and adamantly refused it. I think she knew something. She knew that there was a high chance of this anxiety turning into social anxiety or something similar.

Anyway... long story short, I am not even sure if this is social anxiety. Reading your reports, this feels a little different. What do you think? My life is revolving around this problem. I am wasting the best years of my life and I should fix this.

I wasn't considering of trying SSRIs because of their side effects but I am feeling desperate to try anything right now. I recently tried Tianeptine (an SSRE) for a day and also Kanna extract (a natural serotonin reuptake inhibitor). They both exacerbated my social anxiety and made me feel even worse.

I don't know what to do."

I got a place right near Central station, and I need to commute to Belrose 5 days a week. According to Google Maps, that means I need to take the train from Central to Wynyard, then Forest Coach Lines from there to Belrose. Looking at the fare calculator, that's $100/month for the train pass plus $160/month for the bus pass?! Am I missing something here, is it possible to get one pass that covers both?

I'm thirty years old now, and in grad school. Alcohol has been a part of my life for a long time, and most of that time has been pretty good. but over the last summer I worked an internship that wasn't too stressful, and I filled up a lot of that extra time with partying and drinking. by the end of this summer I have been drinking every other day, or every day, often times starting around 2 pm and carrying on all the way through the night. And I've begun to have the worst hangovers, and that is the real problem. It's gotten really bad. Lots of anxiety, depression, sweating, feeling feverish. And it lasts all day long.
I'm in the middle of one of those right now and I just feel terrible. I'm just passing the time, waiting until its night time and I can go to sleep again. I don't want this to be a regular part of my life. I can't just be depressed all day long, and I know I would feel better again if I drank more today, but I'm not going to do that.
I'm not sure exactly what I was looking for here. Advice maybe? Or any thoughts any of you might have? I need to change this."

They basically hooked me with fast promotions and good pay. I'm now 28 and have been regretting not following my computer passion for several years. I've always done a bit of programming on the side, and the closest thing to a hobby is building and playing with electronics and computers. 
I know a bit of python, c++, and visual basic. Not enough to really matter though. 
I want to go back to school and get a computer science degree. I have a child and a full time job so this is going to be something I can do online at night. I know that sounds like a full plate, but I've been managing taking a full load at the local college just fine this way to get my gen eds out of the way. 
I'm at the point where I need to really look hard. at schools.  This is one area I would like some advice. Regis university has one of the two online programs that is ABET certified that you can do fully online. it seems like the school has a good reputation. has anyone heard different? or have other suggestions?
Unfortunately my time is going to be very tight. I won't be able to do a proper internship or do a lot of spare time projects. How much will this hurt me?  

Any other thoughts or suggestions? Its a pretty scary thing leaving a rock solid job and company I've worked for the past 12 years, but I'm really excited at the same time. It is possible I could land a job at the corporate office since we use quite a few in house tools, but I don't want to strictly count on that. "

When I started secondary school I was a gifted pupil with 'straight A*s on my horizon, I wanted to be a vet and as the school I chose was publicized as a Science Specialist school - I had made my choice. The first year &amp; a half went well, I was excelling in all my classes &amp; had a solid social circle, &amp; I met my best friend who to this day means the world to me. At the end of the 2nd year, it went a tad rocky - I had befriended one of the 'naughty' girls in my year &amp; started social smoking &amp; drinking (not excessively) - I was still getting my grades. My 3rd year everything went wrong - me &amp; my best friend had befriended these 2 other girls who were into bunking (truanting) &amp; we loved the thrill of it - we started missing school on a regular basis, staying out past midnight on school days (we were 13) &amp; just generally fucking up. My Mum &amp; Dad went awol when this started to happen - I had to climb from my 2nd story window if I wanted to go out, I was constantly 'grounded' &amp; when I did manage to sneak out - I wouldn't return for 3 days until they had calmed down. At this point I started stealing from my parents too - from cash, alcohol &amp; cigarettes to money out of their banks. At this stage I had also started smoking cannabis, but only occasionally &amp; it was always recreational. My parents cut all pocket money &amp; I resorted to shoplifting - this ceased when I was arrested (moderately). My home life was so unbearable at this point - I had made my parents resent me &amp; I was a thief, they couldn't even leave their wallets around their OWN home. The only thing I had which was solid was my social life, I had a best friend, a solid &amp; vast friendship group - I've always been social so this aspect of my life meant so much to me. One day I was out with my friends &amp; I kissed a boy who was at least 8 years older than me, this got out in my school &amp; I was briefly despised. It was my best-friend who had told people as she wanted me to 'learn from my mistakes' - looking back I agree with her. When aware that everyone knew, I felt lost. I felt that my parents hated me &amp; so did the world - I had no-one. This particular night my parents had gone out to dinner, it was rare for my Dad to go out apart from shopping &amp; to the doctors as he has chronic bronchitis and COPD. That night I took 10 packets of paracetemol, 5 of ibuprofen &amp; 3 of aspirin. I went straight to sleep &amp; woke up with the feeling I had been stabbed in the stomach. My dad being such an observant man had noticed I had put one of the medicine packets back in the cabinet the wrong way &amp; burst into my room asking if I had taken anything, even though I was denying it he could see by my body language &amp; that I was constantly retching that I had. He instantly woke up my Mum &amp; called an ambulance. I was in Hospital for 4 nights &amp; 3 days, luckily they pumped my stomach in time &amp; their was no permanent damage apart from a weaker liver than the average. My dad saved my life.
My social life returned back to normal - if not better. But week by week I was becoming more of a delinquent. My grades were dropping, I was barely in school &amp; I started smoking cannabis quite a few times a week, even alone. My parents started expecting my behaviour rather than getting so angry when I had done anything wrong. By the age of 14 I didn't have a curfew &amp; could basically do what I pleased. I have always been a Daddy's girl, even though I love my Mum no less. I was gifted with the wittiest most insightful man as a Dad, &amp; he was always the parent I had felt most comfortable opening up to. I am naturally clever, so I was still getting A's in English as all you need to be is articulate, but all my other subjects I had dropped down to border-line average as I wasn't in any lessons to acquire any of the knowledge I needed. My Brother stayed on the right route, getting top grades in all his GCSEs and Alevels, getting a internship at credit suisse &amp; going to the top uni for economics in London. Everything my Dad wanted for him, he was so proud. I was/am the complete opposite. The last year of secondary school I still had the same attitude - I had no work ethic nor motivation, even though every year I said would be a 'clean slate' . I was smoking weed daily at this point. During my Mock exams I tried MDMA (extasy) for the first time &amp; loved it - I was so happy like you wouldn't believe. I never got addicted nor took it excessively. I managed to scrape 5 C's in my GCSE's, even though I was predicted 10 A*'s when I had first started the school. I was actually surprised at the results - as in the last 3 years of school I probably only attended 1 &amp; a half overall. This was enough for me to be allowed to start my A-levels. I wanted a fresh start so I went to college rather than staying at the 6th form at my school- this was a horrible horrible mistake. When I was in lessons I did well, but I was rarely in them. My dad would scream &amp; scream at me in the mornings to get out of bed - I would scream the worst abuse imaginable to him &amp; lock myself in. I was addicted to cannabis &amp; when I was in college I was too paranoid that I almost always went home nearly as soon as I got there. The teachers there liked me, my attendance was 17% but I was doing better than a lot of the other students around me (it was a pretty shitty college). One night 3 days before my exams begun I was in central London with all of my friends just basically getting pissed &amp; meeting people. This night was the first night I took cocaine. I lost my friends that night &amp; I also lost my phone. I came home at 7am crying my eyes out just wanting to have a conversation with my Dad ( he was always up all night and asleep during the day because he was so ill ). I found my Dad sat down at the kitchen table slumped across it. He had had a heart attack &amp; died. The next few hours were a blur. I slept through the mortuary picking up his body, but I had to be interviewed by the police. At the time I had a boyfriend, who I cared for a lot, but he was a coke-head. As much as he helped me, I got into cocaine far more than I should have.  I went into deep deep depression and filmed myself on my laptop daily just crying &amp; conversing with myself. I felt so guilty &amp; I still do. As much as I knew that he knew I loved him I couldn't help but constantly think about how I could have made his life so much better, how I could have made him happier. I didn't attend my exams, understandably &amp; that whole summer was a combination of drugs, alcohol &amp; depression. My Mum is also very reserved so she dealt with it herself, so I had to aswell. My friends being 16 year olds didn't know how to handle it - personally I think they could have done a lot more - but I detached myself from everything - refusing to talk about it unless I was drunk &amp; then I just exploded in a fit of tears. It didn't get better with time as everyone had promised. All I wanted/want to do is to make my Dad proud of me &amp; become as successful as he wanted me to be, as I wanted to be &amp; what I'm capable to be. I enrolled back at my old school the following year adamant I was going to be a changed person. The first month I was excelling, I felt comfortable &amp; was doing well in my classes.  I was still massively depressed &amp; would commonly go home sit in my room with the lights off &amp; watch video's of soldiers being reunited with their daughters on Youtube &amp; just cry over them (I don't know why). I began to not turn up to a lot of my classes, the weed was a trigger as it made me so unmotivated, paranoid &amp; even more depressed. I was kicked out at Christmas because of my attendance. Since then I enrolled to private tutoring but as my Mum was always at work during the day - I lied about going. I never went. I lied to my friends, I lied to everyone. My best friend managed to fix up, she's going to university this September &amp; I am so proud of her. One day in January I made the rash decision that I wanted to move out of London in September &amp; have a clean slate - I chose liverpool (5 hour drive away). I love the idea of being whoever I want to be &amp; starting making new foundations. My house is just a constant reminder of that awful night. I want to get my A-levels &amp; go to university like I've always planned to do. Moving out is so soon &amp; I am so worried I will go into a vortex of depression, have no friends &amp; hate college &amp; the city. I can't go back now as I've paid for the accommodation &amp; I feel like I will be a laughing stock if I once again fuck up. I just got back from a festival with my friends, &amp; me &amp; my best friend had a massive drunken argument. 'You are only moving away because I'm going to University' 'You will never change' 'No-one really likes you' 'You've changed' 'You haven't been my bestfriend for years now' 'I hate you' 'You're a slag' 'I can't wait to get  rid of you' were a few of the things she said to me. We made up that night but I can't let go. I have only tried to kill myself once after my Dad had died - but I walked into A&amp;E as I realised how selfish it was - It would destroy my Mum &amp; she deserves so much better. Killing yourself is so selfish towards your loved ones. These past few months I have been constantly having more suicidal thoughts &amp; I think I am near the brink. I know this feeling too well. I am either going to end up running away abroad &amp; killing myself, moving to Liverpool and eventually killing myself, or killing myself before I move. But I can't. I feel one day I will just do it &amp; I don't want to but It's the only way out. Maybe I can never change. I understand there are people out there who have lost their whole families tragically, who have to walk miles for food or suffer from a terrible illness but I can't help but feel like this. I have read a few of the other posts, I am close with my Mum again now after my Dad passed, I love my friends dearly &amp; have a great social life. But my life is dead-end, I am so so so useless &amp; all I do is fret about 'who I used to be' &amp; 'who I am now'. Since my Dad died, I agree I have changed but I couldn't help it. He was my world &amp; now I feel I have nothing going for me &amp; never will. I'm not religious so even if I DID turn things around (impossible) I know he died knowing I was a fuck up, &amp; couldn't see that I had changed. This kills me. "

1l2eld,6,2013-08-25,How To Write A Challenging Letter Of Recommendation,Websitecontact6,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1l2eld/how_to_write_a_challenging_letter_of/,"Hello Readers,
Every six months or so I am often asked to write a letter of recommendation for the interns that I work with.  I would say that 80% of the time I am happy to do this and treat it as a compliment.  It is an honor to be asked to comment on colleague in a positive way.  It is obviously something I don’t take lightly.  I understand the importance of being a link between the employer and the candidate.  When writing a letter for a candidate that has proven to be a quality colleague, the writing is easy.  I can simply state their qualities, accomplishments and work habits.  However, I don’t want to write about the 80% of the individuals I write letters for.  I want to learn about how others responsed to the 20% of the people you do not want to write a letter for, yet feel obligated to.  

Here is what I typically do, but any other advice would be great!   I do believe that based on my position I am required to be honest towards the interns that work with me.  Part of my job is to help them grow into their position and become successful as they move on from our program.  Therefore, honesty is where I begin.  If a person continues to make mistakes and is never given constructive criticism, that person will never learn.  

When asked to write a letter of recommendation for that person I believe in being honest and explain where I think they have room to grow.  I tell them that I will highlight what they have done well, but perhaps they might want to follow up with another colleague who could speak more to their strengths.  If they continue to ask me to write a letter, I find myself in a predicament and typically oblige the request.  
I have included two letters of recommendations that clearly show the difference between how I valued their commitment to the job they did with me.  I have taken the view that I will not bash or slander a person on a letter of recommendation, but I also won’t lie.  I take the idea that the employer can “read between the lines” and follow up with any questions or concerns. 

Please let me know if you have any other suggestions.  



Positive Letter

To Whom It May Concern:

I am writing this letter on behalf of Kim Smith.  Kim was my teaching intern during the spring semester of 2012 at Eagle Primary School in a kindergarten, first and second grade classroom.  Kim was an incredibly valuable asset to our classroom community.  Kim’s compassion, enthusiasm and creativity inspired our students throughout the semester. 

Kim was natural at classroom management applying a firm but compassionate equality to all students.  Kim created a strong and creative curriculum unit focused on health and nutrition, which drastically changed many students eating habits and thoughts about health.  Kim incorporated all subject matter during her unit while keeping it focused on her thematic goal.  

Finally, Kim and I have talked at length about the drastic change of being a classroom intern compared to being a first year teacher.  Kim is eager to take on that responsibility.  She understands the commitment involved and the learning curve associated with those first years of teaching.  I have nothing but great things to say about kim; both as a colleague and friend.  I highly recommend Kim Smith as a teacher at your school.  Please do not hesitate to call or e-mail with any further questions. 

 

Sincerely,

 

Pat Smith

Not Positive 

To Whom It May Concern: 

I am writing this letter regarding Kim Smith.  Kim was part of the Eagle Primary Teacher Preparation Program for the 2012-2013 school year.  Kim was a teaching intern during the fall semester in my multiage kindergarten, first and second grade classroom.  It was evident from the start she was passionate about children.  Kim was caring and enthusiastic.  

During her time in my classroom, Kim gradually gained more responsibility as the semester progressed.  She worked in both full group and small group settings in all academic areas.  Kim was also responsible for writing a child study researching the developmental milestones and goals for an individual student.  

Please contact me with any questions you have regarding Kim Smith.

I answer for a director and work with a sysadmin and an intern. 

I started doing things that needs to be done like a imaging server and started to get backups for Internet, switches, servers etc. My problem is that I'm not used to this kind of job. The other sysadmin doesn't seem to like that I am doing new stuff instead of just doing tech support. He isn't doing anything to stop me but this is strange. This company doubled the users (100) in a year and the way it worked is that the sysadmin had to make things work. But now all he seems to do is the tech support that happens like 3 times a day. 
I think I am doing the right thing and have the same mindset of the director but everyone else seem happy to just keep the way things are. 

Any tips on how should I be doing this job? "
1l28rw,95,2013-08-25,"The Rules, and some helpful tips (as of Aug 2013)",7oby,forhire,https://www.reddit.com/r/forhire/comments/1l28rw/the_rules_and_some_helpful_tips_as_of_aug_2013/,"I sent this out as a message to all the mods to solicit feedback for a potential sticky a week ago. After their responses, I'm making this post. If there are questions, feel free to comment below and I'll try to explain. However, some rules were put in place a long time ago by the founder of the sub (/u/MediaMoguls) and as such I have to defer those to him. The main one is the No NSFW posts one.

##DISCLAIMER

If you find some way to post something that is against the spirit but not the letter of the rules, it will still get removed.  We reserve the right to create new rules as necessary.

For example: we previously didn't realize how popular it was for SEO people to ask students to create blog posts on their behalf, in an attempt to boost their pagerank with incoming links from a .edu domain.

##THE RULES

* No B2B (Business to Business). For Hire does not mean like a taxi. It means like a person who wants someone to hire them to do a job.  The original intent of the subreddit was connecting freelancers to gigs, not companies to clients.
* No asking students to blog about your company (buying ""backlinks"") on a .edu domain.
* No NSFW posts. /u/MediaMoguls posted about this [here](/r/forhire/comments/rzgxo) and [here](/r/forhire/comments/s1pvb). Please try /r/NSFWforhire
* Nothing illegal in the US, even if you're not in the US, because reddit is bound by US laws.  If you think it might be illegal, assume it is. If you're not sure, feel free to message the mods.
* We will not sticky your post. You can [buy an ad through reddit](/ad_inq) for $30 a day if it really matters. 
* No [Hiring] posts about buying comments on youtube or similar social sites, nor facebook likes or twitter followers or similar.
* No bounties/competitions/speculative work. See http://www.nospec.com/faq. [MediaMoguls agreed here](http://www.reddit.com/r/forhire/comments/1dto59/hiring_a_graphic_designer_to_create_new_company/c9tq429).
* Jobs must pay currency, not equity. People aren't here hoping to eat someday. They're hoping to eat _to_day.  If you're only paying in cryptocurrency with no fiat alternative, please try /r/jobs4bitcoins.
* Internships: Paid can go in /r/forhire _and_ /r/internships, while unpaid must go solely to /r/internships. ForHire does not work for free.

##Please Note

* All link submissions go straight to the spam queue. Experience taught me spammers would rather post a link submission than a text submission with a link in the text field. Thus, we now allow links, but all links are instantly in the mod queue and removed. We may decide later to allow it or not, but expect it to stay permanently removed. Basically, don't post links.
* Also, you may be interested in posting testimonials to /r/testimonials.  You might also benefit from posting location based jobs to a local subreddit, we have a huge list in /r/forhire/w/local. Some fields, like ""big data"" or ""game development"", also have special job subreddits that we link in /r/forhire/w/field.

##Not a rule but a guideline

* It seems some of you have decided to repost your [For Hire] threads weekly. While I'd personally prefer a good use of the search feature (since it's gotten better), it's an upstream battle, so the guideline seems to be wait at least a week between reposts. If someone's reposting every other day or something like that, feel free to report them, but actually send the mods a message explaining it or we'll think it was just the use of ""**SUPER DOWNVOTE**"".

P.S. Read the sidebar! It's got some helpful resources too.  The big green ""Hire a Redditor"" and ""Get Hired"" buttons will prefill a lot of the post for you and give you suggestions on what to write. "
1l26rt,4,2013-08-25,"Girlfriend (27F) and I (24M) in relationship of six months, having trouble with long distance/direction of relationship",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1l26rt/girlfriend_27f_and_i_24m_in_relationship_of_six/,"Two weeks ago, after years of wanting to move to New York City, I finally did. 


My girlfriend is extremely supportive and insisted that I go because she has been able to experience living abroad while I'd never lived outside of my home state. She's doing an internship and finishing her doctorate back home while I'm living in NYC, a good time to do so because she'll be extremely busy with work/school. The hope is that she'll move here at the end of her internship/degree, but she's not keen on the city at all. We've been together six months as of yesterday-- and shit hit the fan last night while we were Skyping.


I'm subletting an apartment while I job hunt, but the sublet is up on October 1. I started mentioning last night that I need to find something more permanent, maybe signing a year-long lease in December when rent is cheaper and I have a job lined up. She became upset and said that I wasn't considering her in my longterm plans. I really hadn't meant any harm by what I said... I DO need a place to live and can't necessarily wait to find out what she's doing because the apartment market here is extremely competitive. I fully admit that I understand why she would feel that way based on what I said.


This morning I woke up to text messages from her explaining how upset she is, how she doesn't know if she can be in this anymore, how she has a lot think about. She said she feels like I'm not considering her, like I wouldn't move somewhere for her and won't make sacrifices for our relationship. The fact is though that I've been here two weeks after saving and working for years to get to this point so, yes, I am hesitant to give up this dream that I just achieved. At the same time I totally understand where she's coming from and how it could look this way.

We've been together for six months which, admittedly, is not a very long time. But she's the first woman I've seriously discussed marriage and kids with. I could see this being a very longterm relationship. She's the first woman who has really loved me unconditionally and I've seen amazing growth in my life with her support. My life has been great with her in it. We get along well, have similar drive and expectations. I love spoiling her and really try to be a good boyfriend to her. We're both very much on the same page about a lot of things, though perhaps not everything. This has such great potential and I love her, which makes all of this very difficult for her and for me. 

When I think about things though, I do question where my head is. I'm mostly scared about her moving here for me. I don't WANT her to move somewhere that she doesn't want to be and doesn't like. I know it's selfish, but it puts a LOT of pressure on the relationship and me. I want to be with her, absolutely, but I feel like her moving here is very final. I feel like it's an expectation of a ring and a wedding in the not distant enough future. This city wouldn't be a great place for her but it feels like home to me and I've already had tremendous job opportunities in my short job search. 

I really don't know what to do here. I love this woman and we have a fantastic relationship, but part of me also realizes that geographically we're on different pages and chronologically (because she's a few years older) we're at different points in life. I want to work through it, but I don't know if it's the intelligent thing to do or not.


Redditors, if you don't mind offering me some brutally honest, well-rounded advice from your experiences, I'd greatly appreciate it.

---

TL;DR: 24M is in LDR with 27F. LDR is not going well because 27F doesn't think 24M is committed/willing to compromise. 24M feels pressure, recognizes difficulty in being away from each other and dealing with the age gap. 24M seeks Reddit's advice."

1l206e,1,2013-08-25,"Self loathing slut who does't believe in romantic love and thinks life unextraordinary, boring and pointless.",[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1l206e/self_loathing_slut_who_doest_believe_in_romantic/,"This is something that has been bothering me for a long time. Several things that have been bothering me for a long time actually. I'm in the process of getting up the courage to see a psychiatrist, but until then I wanted to see if I could even start to articulate what I am feeling. 

I hate myself. For many reasons. On the outside, people would think that I'm crazy for thinking such a thing. Anytime I hint at my secret self loathing to a friend they immediately treat me like I'm downright delusional. I graduated valedictorian at high school, went on to a great college, currently preparing for med school, lots of friends, popular at work, etc. On the outside, I'm every partent's dream.  That shiny outside however is totally at odds with how I feel on the inside. 

I hate my goddamn personality. I don't even really know who I am to be honest.  I feel like I act so differently with all the different people I know. Whenever I think about describing myself to someone, I feel like all I'm doing is attempting to validate my socially inept behavior. I HATE the way I act around people.  Sometimes I feel like an actor or a puppet forcing a smile and moving my mouth to someone else's speech. Sometimes I'm too loud. Sometimes I'm too quiet. Sometimes I'm too vulgar.  Sometimes I'm too prudish.  I'm always too much of something.  Of course, thats my own interpretation of my behavior.  I have no idea what other people really think of me, but sometimes I stop in wonderment at how some people, actually a lot of people, can actually stand me. Not even just stand me, but ADORE me. My friend had a wedding recently, and I was around a lot of people both from my past and present. They called me superwoman. Amazing. Hero. People were bragging about me TO me. How I go to school full time, work full time, and still find time to exercise; about my artwork, my ambitions, my guitar playing etc.  It was extremely unsettling, to think so little about myself and have my friends completely contradict me at every turn. I can't stand it actually.  They all make me out to be so much better than I really am. They are all much better people than I am, how can they not see that? How can they not see the walking-talking pile of crap that I feel like I am?

I don't like the way I look.  This is a very complicated concept for me.  I was the epitome of the ugly duckling when I was a teenager. Physically I've grown out of that, but mentally I look in the mirror and I see the same awkward, face I've always seen. Nobody else seems to see that awkwardness anymore however. As far as anyone else is concerned, I'm the only one who wouldn't label myself at ""hot"". As I've gotten older, grew into my body and lost my braces, I've noticed an ever escalating amount of attention. Its usually males.  They touch me, flirt with me, ask for my phone number, buy me drinks, etc. When I was younger, I might have killed for this attention.  Now however, its driving me to the point of insanity.  I can't go to work without someone staring at my chest, I can't go to school without classmates fawning over me, every single male I meet just wants to get in my pants. I'm sick of being told how hot I am or how great my body is.  I'm sick of all my male friends making moves on me. It's forced me to adopt and single-facetted interpretation of men as sex crazed maniacs whose only intention with me is to fuck me.  I used to get along great with guys.  Now I have trouble talking to men because in the back of my head I'm always positive their only motive is to screw me.  

Sad thing is, I'm not helping the situation.  I sleep with almost every guy I meet these days. I don't know why.  I don't know how to stop it.  It started with one and now It's like a fucking snowball effect thats gone out of control.  Every single time starts out because I'm drunk.  Sober I would never let them touch me.  But when I get drunk, that's when loneliness really starts to creep in and I'll do anything to get close to anyone. I'm a walking contradiction.  I'm so fucking sick of sleazy male attention and yet I continue to stumble into dark bedrooms..(and cars)..on a regular basis. I don't even remember what It's like to be properly courted by someone. But I suppose that's my fault to for being so fucking easy in the first place. I don't remember what its like to be with someone who actually cares about me on a level above your physical attractiveness and level of drunkeness. And that brings me to my next issue. 

I don't believe in romantic love. The idea of its just seems so fantastical to me after what I've experienced.  Men and women both: we're all cutthroat, sleazy, lying, dirty, selfish, cheating narcissists (myself included). How can something pure as ""romantic love"" exist in such a shitty environment as this?  Another contradiction: I'm a total romantic. I crave romance, the kind you read in books and hear in music.  I wan't someone to love me like goddamn Darcy loved Elizabeth or Rochester loved Jane. Fuck, I'd even take Heathcliff and Cathy.  I yearn so much for something that I don't believe to be real.  It's like wanting to go to Hogwarts, and It's causing me a lot of psychological turmoil lately.  I don't believe I'll ever fall in love like you're supposed to, I don't think I'll ever get married or have kids; honestly the future I envision for myself looks pretty bleak. If I'm lucky enough to get in to med school and make it through internship and residency, I foresee my life consisting of  either working in a hospital, or spending my free time at home with my eleven cats watching re runs of Greys Anatomy. If I don't get into med school, then I see myself working at a bar and spending my free time drinking at said bar until my liver turns to swiss cheese. 

Which brings me to life. I feel like its pointless.  Everything I've been told since I was a kid has led me to believe that my life should be important, it should be an adventure, it should be filled with love and you should die happy with your loved ones at your side and be remembered for all the good that you did. Yeah fucking right. Ever since I've entered the realm of adult hood I've realized that all the happy things they tell you when you're a kid (Like ""follow your dreams!"" and ""you can do anything you set your mind to!"") are fucking lies. Life is shit, total shit. In the great span of things, my life means nothing.  I won't do anything that will make any sort of major impact on the world. I will not have some epic life adventure like all the books and stories I have read have led me to believe.  There is no knight in shining armor ready to sweep me off my feet. I am in debt. I will spend the rest of my life working off that debt. Any excess money will be spent on a two bedroom house, a toyota prius, and a white picket fence. Yeah, good old ""american dream"" (?).  That doesn't sound too glamorous to me. It sounds boring; fucking pointless. You literally are born, you work, and you die.  I am devastated by that realization. I wish I could be one of the lucky few.  The doctor that cured cancer, the author beloved by fans everywhere, the musician who captured your emotions so perfectly, etc. But I know that will never be me. I will live and die faceless and unremembered. I'll never be known to anyone except my generously tipped coffe shop barista who will keep pumping out my lattes until the day I die.

If by chance there is someone who reads this, please do not worry that I'm suicidal.  I'm not. I'm wouldn't have the courage in the first place. I do fantasize about dying in an accident though. I'll be driving my car on the highway and in my mind I'll be begging for another car to crash into me. Or hoping my brakes will go out on a slick night and I'll wrap my car around a tree. That way, It can be over without me having to make the decision. I'm so bad at making decisions. I have full blown daydreams about this. I imagine the scenario from beginning to end: being hit, the car tumbling over, me being trapped upside down barely clinging to life but oddly at peace with it all, the nice young fireman freeing me with the jaws of life and pulling me from the wreckage, and as he tries to assess my vitals I just sort of slip away into whatever exists after death and fall limp in his arms while everyone around laments about the tragedy to befall such a young woman. These are the kind of fantasies I fall asleep to some nights. Its oddly calming at times. At other times, bitterly disappointing because I feel like I won't be facing the sweet exit of death for some time. 

I guess that's it. I'm tired. "

What should I wear?  Should I dress professional?  Business casual? Or just casual?  I know that normally for interviews, professional attire is usual the norm, but I'm getting mixed opinions on this because I sometimes hear that in the software/CS/start-up environment, they are pretty relaxed in what they wear.  I just don't want to come off looking out of place if I show up in a suit, while everyone around in the office is in their jeans and a t-shirt."

Got tired of being shat on in the corporate market because of it and went back to school. I've been taking 1-2 classes for the last few years working full time. Got burned out with the whole rat race recently and landed a night shift monitoring job at a data center that frees up a ton of study time, I’ve been hitting the pavement hard since.

I'm wrapping up my AS (ME emphasis, transfers to university as a junior), hopefully within a year. That way those credits are locked in and I have something to show for my 6 years of work so far, LOL. I’m working on the transfer process now with advisors. Senior year I plan to start on my FE &amp; hope to enter the market as an EIT. Due to job/family commitments, can only take 2 - 3 classes per semester plus summer &amp; may/winter semesters. I’m looking at least 4 years left. Depressing but what can I do, gotta keep my kids fed. 

My job now pays above avg ME starting salary, full benefits, etc. so I’m not necessarily in a hurry, although this shift sucks balls. Due to everything, internships are not an option for me -- I’m sure this will be my biggest hurdle. I'm hoping that my so called 'life experience' will supplement here. I'm also a massive tinkerer so I'm looking to expand my hobbies into more engr related things adding to my 'life experience' while I’m in school. (not really counting on this to benefit a career, but can't hurt, and it's good enough excuse for expensive toys).

Tl;dr: My questions are what I am looking at after graduation with my work experience and without an internship. Any insight or advise from anyone who's been here before or from anyone close with hiring managers, etc... I'm not going to change my course regardless.  I know it’s crazy, but I’m driven. This is my passion so I’ll finish come hell or high water. I struggle since I’m not fresh out of HS, but I’ve maintained a 3.8 GPA thus far. The only advantage is I know what I’m missing so I take my classes very seriously. 

Anyway, I just want to maybe hear some things to keep in mind on my journey. Thanks in advance.

1l1mkn,5,2013-08-25,Feeling Myself Slip Away,SuperRicktastic,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1l1mkn/feeling_myself_slip_away/,"So this is my first post to this subreddit, and even mustering up the energy to type is laborious. I've spent quite a long time dealing with emotional issues, ranging from mild depression to full on anxiety and suicidal thoughts. 

Recently, I've felt myself slipping back into the cycle of self loathing and hatred. Some of the things I catch myself saying, to myself, are downright appalling, things that, if I were to say to anyone else out loud, would likely get my ass kicked. I'm not sure what to do here, I've been in and out of therapy since I was a child, been on medication twice (and I refuse to take it again, last time the quack doctor cut me off cold turkey and it almost killed me), and I'm getting fed up.

I guess I should elaborate a little... give some background and story so I don't just prattle on about how much I hate myself, because trust me, I could fill up half the subreddit with that. 

My first (and honestly, only) major bout with depression was back in high school. I was under a lot of pressure from classes, was in a poisonous relationship, and was watching my relationship with my separated father slowly deteriorate and decay. I turned suicidal, but had enough sense to seek help before I acted on those thoughts. I ended up being admitted for psychiatric care, was released after two weeks, and put on medication for a year, therapy for two.

After all that, I felt better, I've only been back to my therapist once more when things started getting tough again. But now here I am, flat out hating what I see in the mirror. I had a two year relationship end in March this year, and while I'm the one who ended it, it was far from an easy decision. We grew apart, and I felt we would do better apart instead of forcing this unhappiness on each other. She moved on... found someone else, and I'm happy for her... I guess. I went from a small community college to a major university, and right now I'm taking a semester off for a 6 month internship (co-op).

In all honesty, I hate myself right now, I want nothing more than to just disappear. My job works me ragged; I work 60 hours a week, night shifts, so I barely get any social time as it is. I'm also lonelier than I've ever felt before, it's been months since I've had any semblance of intimacy, and I feel like I'm going mad. I feel like I shouldn't have left her, that I should just deal with the issues in our relationship, just so I don't feel alone anymore. Then I remind myself that she's already moved on... that I'm disposable, useless, worthless. That he's probably better than me in every way, and the she'd never even consider taking me back after being with someone as good as he is. 

And I haven't even met the guy... All I've got is her profile picture, which I haven't seen in months. I blocked her after that, just for my own sanity, which I seem to be losing slowly. 

And tonight, I vainly tried to change things by going out to a bar. Even if I could just pick up a one-night-stand, I'd be happier. I'm that f***ing lonely, that I'm willing to try and take home a party girl for drunk sex just so I hate myself a little less. Pitiful. That's what that is, goddamn pitiful. 

I guess this turned into a rant, so I apologize, I just needed to get that out. I don't know what the coming days will bring, and in all honesty, I don't want them to come. I hate myself, but I feel like a deserve it, so I should just sit here in justified self-loathing.

**Tl:DR - Slipping back into depression, I figure it's pointless to fight it anymore**"

We hit it off and got really flirty with each other. We exchanged numbers and texted all the time. He was in another state so we were not able to meet up for about three weeks. We went on a date and it was fun. He was a little shy but he told he would be once we met face to face. 

We live about an hour apart, I've graduated college but he is not finished yet. Because he is still in school he doesn't make a lot of money, which is fine. I'm not interested in that. He also has a job and an internship on top of going to class. 

Ever since we met face to face and went on our date he has kind of been ignoring me. I've been the one to start the conversations, a lot of times there is a serious amount of time between responses from him. I know that he is busy but I also am FB friends with him and follow him on Twitter. Both get updated pretty regularly. 

I know that a lot of people would tell me that he is not interested any more. Which is what I'm thinking but when I've tried to end it he says that he doesn't want to end it. I get attention for like a day and then it's back to being ignored. 

I guess what I want to know is has anyone gone through something like this? And what did you do? Is he just holding on to me until someone better comes along? I really like this guy but I am trying to figure out when enough is enough.

tl;dr: Met a guy through Reddit, after our first date I've been ignored. I like him but I'm over it."

It's a great industry and the company is something I think I would really like to be a part of. 



I was offered a job when I graudate ( in the spring ) as a COBOL programmer. The company wants me to maintain and update code and in the summer train a bunch of interns so I can build my own team.


The intern part sounds pretty cool. They're interested in almost building me my own small department and it's a large investment that they plan on following through with.





**Acutal Question** - If I do this will it ruin me? If I want to stay in financial services that is. I don't want my first job to disappear and for me to be useless or stuck in this one position for a long time. What I want to do is train up these interns for a few years than move over to a new department.

1l19sc,1,2013-08-24,Omg please make this work!,YourDirtySlut,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/1l19sc/omg_please_make_this_work/,"I had almost forgotten what that hole feels like. Even living together, with us both dreadfully miserable, I at least had him next to me to reach out to for comfort. 

Our problems have been going on for months. It was both of us, but mostly me. When we got back together, my spirit was spent. Or, you could think of it as being suppressed. I had spent the 8 months we were apart traveling the world, working hands on with big cats, swimming with dolphins in Honduras, zip lining through caves in Belize, and driving across the country to just name a few. I felt like I was flying and experiencing everything. When I came back home, we got back together. 

From the get go my sex drive was dead. I still don't know why. During the first 5 months of our separation, I was experiencing hyper sexuality. I took a lot of dangerous risks, and was very lucky to come out of it alive and without STIs. When I went to California for a 3 month internship, I took that as a chance to remain celibent. But when I came back, I couldn't get out of it. 

Before our 8 month break up, we had a ridiculous sex life, we had fun, we went out and did things. But during our second year together, I couldn't even get him to go on a walk with me. We thought we were ready, I thought it was what I wanted, so we moved in together. But his laziness really got to me. He would come home, plop down on the couch and turn on the computer. Sometimes we would work on his truck. And he eventually picked up a new hobby with building a tricopter. When I came home, I took care of the animals, did laundry, cooked dinner, did the dishes, etc. I only worked part time, but I spent my days off cleaning the house and cleaning up after my animals. I was crawling out of a debt caused by my internship, so I didn't have a lot of money. He supported me. Eventually I got a decent paying part time job and I was able to help out more. But he never helped me. 

But, apparently, it wasn't enough. I know he was sexually frustrated. I went to the doctor for tests, removed my IUD, sometimes forced myself. But at the same time, I was stressed. This led to a bad depression. Then I fixed that, but it was too late. I was being spread too thin, without any help. The only time I took for myself was a few hours in the form of naps. Only then could I really relax without worrying about what needs to be done, guilt about not being able to put out, or school worries (I had failed an entire semester during my depression). After a time, he saw this as laziness. And he let me know. He would wake me up at 7am on my days off to let his dogs out. He yelled at me anytime I took a nap. He lost his shit when I forgot to do something. I begged him to help me out. Instead of yelling at me because I didn't take the garbage to the can, do it himself or ask me nicely. 

In the end, he said I was the one who needed to change, that he had already changed enough for me. So I packing my things and moved out today. The thing is, I know there is still love there. I want so badly to try while I am living elsewhere. But he is the one that needs to do the thinking. Right now he is at a wedding reception as one of the bridegrooms. I just finished a 9 day stretch at work- he also got to go to a bachelor party and rehearsal dinner. He's off getting drunk, and I am by myself at my parents house, exhausted and stinky from moving all day. I am utterly fucking alone. "

You guys have always been helpful and give excellent advice, so I'm wondering if you could please help a fellow job-seeker who needs a morale boost... :(

My story is weird and complicated, but basically, I feel pretty behind my peers and because of this, have been feeling pretty terrible about myself lately. I graduated with a B.A. in English and Professional Writing in 2011, and afterwards went through a few personal things so I was unable to really look for work. I'm currently attending a mental health group that has been helping heaps, but the depression and hopelessness of being unemployed is mind-numbing.

A huge problem for me is lack of motivation to actually search &amp; apply on a consistent, regular basis, so I end up sending off resumes and applications here and there a few times a week. What I've heard from everyone, everywhere, is to aim for 10+ resumes a day and still it will take months.

I'm currently looking for jobs within the fields of corporate writing/editing/proofreading/communications, as some of my fellow graduates have had success working in these fields with smaller start-up companies. I'm thinking of branching out, though, to other positions that aren't so writing-focused. I don't have enough experience, though, even though I do have some freelance work and an internship under my belt... I feel like I still don't stand a chance in my field because of how competitive and over-saturated it is. Maybe I'm not really meant to write for a living like I always thought?

So, /j/jobs, any words of advice, or any comments about your own journeys would be so very much appreciated. I've stopped even talking to friends about the subject because I always end up moping about my situation and feeling bad about it. I wish I could put my I'm-an-adult pants on but after a lifetime of judging my accomplishment on academics, I feel completely lost in a sea of post-graduate disappointment. 

**Tl;dr - Graduated a few years ago and feel behind, low morale and motivation, could really use some help or advice.**

Edited to say that I'm so pleasantly surprised at the comments of advice and encouragement! I really didn't think this post would go anywhere. Thank you, /r/jobs, for reminding me that I'm not alone, and that I'll be okay :) You guys are so great. I wish everyone the best of luck in their future!"

I have to get away from this place, its making me depressed and affecting my marriage.

I have been working at my company for over 6 years.

The first two years I was an intern while in Graduate school (summers off). First year unpaid, second year I got a small stipend which paid for my travel and lunch expenses.

After I graduated with my Masters, I started working full time two days later. I felt great, the extreme minority of those who got a job directly in the field before even graduating. 

I started off with a very entry level salary, as a contractor. but I am good with money and budgeting, so it didnt phase me, I was just super excited to be working and enjoying my career. I was promised that my boss will try to get me off contract and be an employee of the company.

A year later, I asked to be included as an employee, no longer a contractor, to which my boss said he could only get me decent raise after a few tough discussions with corporate. I was happy all my hard work was paying off, but a little disappointed I wasnt recognized as an employee. Even though the new salary was still pretty low, I didnt mind since I LOVE what I do. 

Now in my Fourth Year since graduating, boss keeps give me the run around about why Corporate wont make me an employee, including budget issues. Recently, the team I work with, all Employees, got decent promotions -except me of course. I protested, saying I was a part of the team and the success and deserved similar treatment. 

Boss and I had a big falling out but he still said he would try for me.

Two month later, Boss hires his DAUGHTER as a contractor at an extremely better salary than me. She gets so many perks and I am barley making it every month. 

I confront him saying that he keeps making excuses when it comes to me, but when it comes to others, especially his daughter, it was a cake walk. she didnt intern for two years, she has ZERO relevant experience.

Her in the office has created a lot of resent me and heightened tensions. Every time I talk to him or her I get very uncomfortable, and they even team up on me sometimes. I think its Time I leave. I will find another job at my own pace. 

I have a great wife whom I neglect and am often times in a bad mood due to the crap I deal with at work. I want to take my severance, pay off some debt and hopefully move on to greener and healthier pastures. "

Some time ago, i contracted a virus from the water during an internship abroad and ended up losing an insane amount of weight. with school and another internship when i got back home, I didn't really focus on my health and stayed at around 83-87lbs throughout the year.


This summer, I decided that enough was enough and started consistently eating more than i was comfortable with instead of just eating till I was satiated. So far I've gained about 15 lbs, which is more than I've ever been able to do before! I was going to the gym for a bit in the middle following something close to the SS program, however I stopped as I found myself losing weight. 


So do I have to be at more of a skinny fat stage before I can start working out? The weight that I've gained is really noticeable in my face(which is great!) and the boobs, tummy, ass region. I would really like it to reflect more in my arms and legs, but am afraid to work out as I dont want to lose the little I've managed to keep on! advice?


**DIET**
breakfast: whole milk+cereal, 1 egg, 2 toasts (one with butter, one with cream cheese), banana.

lunch: salad, pasta or rice with lentil gravy, whatever fruit is available.

snack: usually more milk and cereal

dinner: usually same as lunch plus dessert.

before bed: warm glass of milk

My parents went through a bankruptcy when I where in a middle school.  They are short of money, I have a 3 younger siblings that are not capable yet to work.
My Dad has several problems with his health including his heart, lungs and diabetes. He still works for several hours a day. I'm a computer science student at one of the best universities in my country. I have a great girlfriend (which in fact has some issues with herself, but it is not a relationship advice subreddit).

I do some freelance stuff, I'm on a good paid internship, I'm almost healthy, have food, ability to learn, but still I've felt like sad for several years. In fact my Girlfriend is my last (I don't know if it is a proper phrase in english) ray of happiness in my life.

Since middle school I knew that I would like to work in computer science, but since last year of high school I just don't know if I want to do this anymore, but frankly I see no other choice of career. I would like to be entrepreneur, but maybe I weren't born to do things like that. In fact from childhood I easily gain interest in things, new projects, hobbies and loose motivation after few days and abandon them. I could earn good money several times but lack of persistence stopped me from doing those projects. And in computer science persistence is very important. I lost several freelance jobs because of missing deadlines because of lack of motivation in doing them.

 I hardly have any friend anymore, through high school I would usually choose to stay at home and help my father in his work rather than going to parties, meeting with friends etc. I don't have any hobbies anymore. I get up in the morning and think about how I don't know what to do with my life.

I'm shy, quiet, introverted and constantly tired, maybe a bit depressed. Only thanks to this great person with a blond hair and pretty face ( :) ) I've met some new people and done some new things lately.

After work I'm just to tired to do anything. In few weeks I'll get back to university again and I will have even less time and energy to do things.

I talk once with my Dad about taking a one year gap in studying and just travel a bit, work and just think what to do with my life, but he asked me to finish my studies as fast as I could, because after those studies I'll get well paid job, I'll be able to help my family.

I know that I should be a support for my family and my girlfriend (as I said, she has some issues with herself and last thing she should have and deserve is a sad boyfriend).

I know that those words are just whinings of young, spoiled guy, because there are people with no food, no health care, no access to education doing great things, helping people, and I'm here, in developed country with all tools to just be happy and successful, and this post is very selfish, but I'm just like... sad.

Frankly I don't know what to do with my life, should I continue with my studies, what should I do to feel less overwhelmed with a world? What to do with myself to feel happy. I'm not sure if I ever was like 100% happy for longer then a week or something. I need an advice what to do with my life.

I am planing to move in october 2013 to a country in Europe to a study a BS in computer science. I have got several acceptances but I do not know what should I consider when I want to choose where study CS.
I am accepted at the University of Nice, but I do not think I would find a lot of internship opportunities in Nice, France. Nice is more like a touristic city. However it has a great computer science exchange program with the University of Cambridge, and I am very fluent in French since I studied in a French Lycee.
I am accepted too at University of Hannover and University of Bochum. Germany is a known to be a great place to study engineering and stuff related to technology. 
I am also accepted in TU Wien = Technical University of Vienna. In Vienna there is Microsoft and there is IBM, and I am sure there is a lot of other international firms that are related to CS. And I have lived for one month in Vienna and fell in love with the city.
But I want to choose the best university between these since I am planing to do a master's degree in ETH Zurich or in a great university in the UK.And I need to have a great portfolio and I guess a great university will boost my chances of getting accepted in a great university.
So I have no idea what to look at to choose the best place to study.

Since May I have had applied to hundreds of jobs, and have yet to receive a call back.  My experience includes my editorial internship, event planning in college, and multiple retail supervision positions.

I obviously would like to find a job that would pay well, have room for growth, and utilize/require my degree, but I'm even applying to jobs that I am way overqualified for and can't get a call.

I started off my job search applying for everything and anything I saw that didn't require a higher degree or a specified degree I didn't have. 

I have since changed my approach to only apply for things I'm qualified for and limit myself to 3-5 jobs a day.  I feel less overwhelmed and more organized in my job search since the change, but I still haven't had any luck (even with jobs I'm overqualified for).

I'm not too picky with my search.  I only have a couple requirements. 

1) I won't work with food unless it is vegan (personal beliefs). So no McDonalds or anything until I find something better.

2)While I am more than willing to work for retail as a filler job, I won't work for Walmart. And would prefer a manager position due to my work history. 

3)I'm even willing to relocate as far south as NJ and as far west as PA, as long as the job is right. Obviously I'm not moving for a retail job, but a strong career will have my bags packed.

Something that has come up is being a 'package deal' for a company.  I think that with our particular specialties, this might be possible as we're similar enough that one company would likely have both departments, but different enough that we wouldn't be physically working together (look, I love him, but I don't want to be around him 24/7!).

I did have better grades in undergrad, but his are perfectly adequate, and we both went to the same school.  He's gotten excellent reviews from his current company, and I got good reviews from my internships.

I was hoping to get everyone's thoughts on reserve or auxiliary police; I trust reddit to give honest opinions.  I am interested in becoming a reserve deputy sheriff in Montgomery County, OH.  Police work has been something that I have always been genuinely interested in and I am finally at a stage in my career where I could commit to this.  The reserve program seems like a great way for someone such as myself  to help give back to my community and provide support.

A bit of my background:  I am a male in my late twenties.  I have a career as a financial advisor that has treated me extremely well and soon I will be leaving my firm to start an independent practice.  With this move I will have much more free time than I currently have which prompted this whole thing.

When I was in college I seriously considered going into law enforcement.  I did multiple ride-alongs and did an internship with my county's narcotics unit for over a year.  I absolutely loved it and the bug has been with me ever since.  Ultimately however the temptations to make a ton of money in the world of finance took over and I decided to go that route.

I was hoping to volunteer for the City of Dayton PD but their reserve program was not what I had hoped for; no arrest powers, no sidearms, etc.  I am passionate about my little city and it looks like the next best bet would be the County Sheriff.

How do real police view reserves?  I feel that I have the right intentions going into this thing.  I would not consider myself real police, I am simply a man that wants to assist and help those that I respect.  I am not here to take someone's job or overtime.  Of course I would love to patrol and take calls but if the department feels that I am better utilized by answering phones then by all means I will do it well.

If you have been or are a reserve, are you happy with your decision?  Would you recommend the experience to someone such as myself?  A full-time careerist outside of law enforcement who is dedicated to his career but still has the police itch.

Many thanks for your input, and thank you for your service.  Regardless if I do it or not you will always have a fan!"

I would like to ask a bit of advice as I am currently seeking a return to cs related work after a 4 year hiatus.

Relevant past:
From 2005-2008 I attended Montana State University where I was pursuing a degree in Computer Science (and a degree in History). In December 2007 I was employed as a QA Intern in a local enterprise level software firm. I remained there for 9 months, and in the summer I negotiated a full-time job in the Sydney, Australia branch as a junior consultant/QA/software engineer. When I got there, I suffered from culture shock, panicked, and resigned immediately as I was not ready for such a big life change. I believe I could have done the job, but I was young and stupid and I messed up.

Following that I spent a year with family in Tasmania getting my feet back. I enlisted in the Australian Army in 2009 as an Analyst Intelligence Operations where I picked up military skills, two languages (Diploma in Vocational Indonesian and Cert III in Vocational Javanese). I finished my stint in Psychological Operations, where I spent a year as an operations NCO. My responsibilities were personnel tracking, exercise planning, and general office miscellanea in addition to general intelligence analysis reporting and tasks. I also took on the development of our Sharepoint external page (within defence, but external to the unit), and spent a month-long exercise as a database manager.

I've returned to Montana as of August '13 in order to marry my fiancee, and I am looking for work. Specifically I would like to find work as a junior/intern level developer as I have maintained my skills at the level they were when I left. Is this realistic? What should I be doing while looking for a job that will improve my profile and my chances?

TL;DR : Dropped out of university 3 years in for a job offer in Sydney that I immediately left for personal reasons, joined the military in an unrelated field, returned to the US and am looking to return to cs."

The word ""family"" has never really meant anything to me. Anyone farther out than aunts and uncles was basically nonexistent, aunts and uncles were never really around or supportive, and my household just seemed disjointed. In junior high and high school I saw everyone's MySpace and Faceboon pictures from family get-togethers and reunions and whatnot, all ""So glad I got to spend time with my fam[ily]"" and all that junk, but never really got why it was so great. I always dreaded family get-togethers of any sort. We never really had anything on my mom's side until my grandfather remarried, and that was chock full of his cunty new wife's obnoxious, rude, redneck, sleazy, drunken crotchdroppings. My late father's relatives were all dead, but even if he had living relatives I wouldn't remember them because he passed when I was very young. My step-father's family was too busy schmoozing amongst themselves and with his ex-wife to make much effort to include us new additions.

Even in my household, it's just not a great dynamic. I just don't feel connected to them. I have very different political and religious views than the other three, and vastly different habits. None of them understand the things most important to me right now (college and career hunting) because neither parent went to college, my mom has never worked, my brother is in high school, and my dad can't relate to the non-blue collar job search. The three of them are strong extroverts and I'm very much not. It seems like everything I enjoy, none of them do. I've tried to bring us together over the years with various things, like trying to get everyone to play board games together or suggesting mini-excursions, but it never worked. Family vacations haven't happened basically ever, not because money was ever an issue, but because we couldn't reconcile what we all wanted to do. mom wanted to shop all day, dad wanted to sit around and drink beer, brother wanted to do sports stuff, and none of them cared for exploring local attractions or museums or finding outdoor activities to do. I've been on two trips with only mom, which generally went ok because we got along the best. 

There are a few things we do have on common ground, at least. I enjoy makeup and clothes to an extent, and so does my mom, but it gets really tiring and feels shallow to only have that thing to ""bond"" over. I mention books, and she just dismisses it because ""books take too much time."" I don't follow sports, and I don't agree with her methods of crash dieting, Facebook slacktivism, or evangelism. I enjoy being active and trying to keep my body healthy and my mind sharp, while my dad prefers to eat himself to morbid obesity and sit in his recliner all day. I can talk to him about career and financial because my mom's never had a real job, but he is woefully ignorant about opportunities in my chosen field and will not listen when I attempt to explain how my profession actually operates. My brother is all jock and is the epitome of the ""popular asshole"" stereotype I loathed in high school. Forget trying to talk to him about anything. I'm pretty sure I haven't heard him make any noises other than grunts in a year.    

Any effort to spend time together involves my brother acting pissed he has to do anything but be admired by freshmen girls, my dad stuffing himself with too much beer and food, and my mother throwing a tantrum for some reason or another. A lot of her personality characteristics are similar to some of the ones seen in /r/raisedbynarcissists but I can't tell if she's really someone with borderline NPD.     

I dated someone for nearly two years in early college who had the exact family I didn't. The household bonded over books, movies, board games, outdoor activities, all the things I ever wanted to do with my family. There was no senseless bickering, no insulting each other's interests, and they genuinely enjoyed spending time with each other. I enjoyed spending time with them, and it was just perfect. Unfortunately the man and I weren't entirely compatible, so I haven't really seen much of them since we broke up.

I just feel too different from my family. My internship is over this week, and I'm going home for the weekend before moving back up for my last year of college. I have no desire to live in my hometown, partially because there aren't many decent jobs in my field within reasonable commuting distance. Most of the places I'm looking at are at least a 3 hours drive from ""home"" in the Midwest, but my dream locations are up north in Canada or out on the west coast (Seattle area, mainly). 

I feel like I've gotten minimal support over the years. I was always told to keep my grades up and stuff, which they really didn't need to tell me twice, but it always seemed like ""ok, cool, you did this thing. Now what else do you have for us?"" They seemed unnecessarily strict and overbearing with me, while my brother has been coddled to no end. He's the golden child that can do no wrong. I tried playing basketball and running track in junior high, but they only came to about 1/2 of my games and two of my meets, and not because they were busy doing other stuff. They encouraged me to do marching band, but never came to a single competition. They've been to every single basketball game, half the basketball PRACTICES, and every golf match my brother has ever had for the past 8 years. My first car was a used hand me down my mom drove for a bit, my my brother recently got a brand new Camaro for his sweet 16. Other stupid things too, like I haven't had a birthday cake since I was 8 but my brother has always had a homemade cake EVERY YEAR. Every little thing he does is praised and celebrated, and every time he gets in trouble in school it isn't his fault. Nothing is ever his fault. His grades are mediocre and it's the teachers' fault for sucking, but I got screamed at for not working hard enough when I got a single B. 

The real kicker for me was being told that I wouldn't get any help paying for college because ""we don't believe in free handouts"" but mom just said she wants to get her first job to help pay for my brother's college education. Never mind that he'll have a hard time getting to school with such mediocre grades and test, and surviving college will be even harder with his lack of drive. 

I just hate it every time I go ""home."" I'm sick of the religion and politics lectures, listening to my mom whine about her non-existent job search, watching my dad eat and drink himself to death, and forget about seeing my brother because he's off doing whatever it is the popular kids do. I don't even want to go ""home"" this weekend, but I need to arrange some stuff for school. I'm working on donating a lot of the crap I've amassed over the years so I don't have as much work to do when I'm completely moved out this time next year. I don't live on campus this year, so I won't get kicked out during breaks, so maybe I just won't go ""home."""

Reddit, I don't want to break it off but...",[deleted],self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/1l49qp/ldr_is_failing_age_difference_is_showing_reddit_i/,"Two weeks ago, after years of wanting to move to New York City, I finally did.


My girlfriend is extremely supportive and insisted that I go because she has been able to experience living abroad while I'd never lived outside of my home state. She's doing an internship and finishing her doctorate back home while I'm living in NYC, a good time to do so because she'll be extremely busy with work/school. The hope is that she'll move here at the end of her internship/degree, but she's not keen on the city at all. We've been together six months as of yesterday-- and shit hit the fan last night while we were Skyping. I'm subletting an apartment while I job hunt, but the sublet is up on October 1. I started mentioning last night that I need to find something more permanent, maybe signing a year-long lease in December when rent is cheaper and I have a job lined up. She became upset and said that I wasn't considering her in my longterm plans. I really hadn't meant any harm by what I said... I DO need a place to live and can't necessarily wait to find out what she's doing because the apartment market here is extremely competitive. I fully admit that I understand why she would feel that way based on what I said.


This morning I woke up to text messages from her explaining how upset she is, how she doesn't know if she can be in this anymore, how she has a lot think about. She said she feels like I'm not considering her, like I wouldn't move somewhere for her and won't make sacrifices for our relationship. The fact is though that I've been here two weeks after saving and working for years to get to this point so, yes, I am hesitant to give up this dream that I just achieved. At the same time I totally understand where she's coming from and how it could look this way.


We've been together for six months which, admittedly, is not a very long time. But she's the first woman I've seriously discussed marriage and kids with. I could see this being a very longterm relationship. She's the first woman who has really loved me unconditionally and I've seen amazing growth in my life with her support. My life has been great with her in it. We get along well, have similar drive and expectations. I love spoiling her and really try to be a good boyfriend to her. We're both very much on the same page about a lot of things, though perhaps not everything. This has such great potential and I love her, which makes all of this very difficult for her and for me. When I think about things though, I do question where my head is. I'm mostly scared about her moving here for me. I don't WANT her to move somewhere that she doesn't want to be and doesn't like. I know it's selfish, but it puts a LOT of pressure on the relationship and me. I want to be with her, absolutely, but I feel like her moving here is very final. I feel like it's an expectation of a ring and a wedding in the not distant enough future. This city wouldn't be a great place for her but it feels like home to me and I've already had tremendous job opportunities in my short job search.


I really don't know what to do here. I love this woman and we have a fantastic relationship, but part of me also realizes that geographically we're on different pages and chronologically (because she's a few years older) we're at different points in life. I want to work through it, but I don't know if it's the intelligent thing to do or not.


We talked a bit last night and basically the ball is in my court. I don't want her to move here when I'm really not sure that I'm ready for this serious of a relationship-- but I realize why she needs that commitment to move here. I'm leaning towards breaking it off, but I just can't imagine it. I'm not unhappy, it's a great relationship... it's just our age difference and being at vastly different points in life. I'm not ready for a ring and an apartment together and a wedding. I still feel like a 14 year old kid inside and I'm trying to figure life out. I feel like life has just begun for me in a new city and here I am about to settle down.

I just came here to write it out, but if you have some brutally honest, well-rounded advice from your experiences, I'd greatly appreciate it.

TL;DR: I moved away from my girlfriend who is a few years older than I am. She's talking about moving here. I freaked out because I realize it's a massive jump in our relationship. I'm not ready for it, she is. I'm feeling like we're headed in different directions in life due to our age difference."
1l45j5,5,2013-08-26,"need advice, desperately.",annievalentine,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1l45j5/need_advice_desperately/,"I am an 18 year old Londoner who has lost hope. When I started secondary school I was a gifted pupil with 'straight As on my horizon, I wanted to be a vet and as the school I chose was publicized as a Science Specialist school - I had made my choice. The first year &amp; a half went well, I was excelling in all my classes &amp; had a solid social circle, &amp; I met my best friend who to this day means the world to me. At the end of the 2nd year, it went a tad rocky - I had befriended one of the 'naughty' girls in my year &amp; started social smoking &amp; drinking (not excessively) - I was still getting my grades. My 3rd year everything went wrong - me &amp; my best friend had befriended these 2 other girls who were into bunking (truanting) &amp; we loved the thrill of it - we started missing school on a regular basis, staying out past midnight on school days (we were 13) &amp; just generally fucking up. My Mum &amp; Dad went awol when this started to happen - I had to climb from my 2nd story window if I wanted to go out, I was constantly 'grounded' &amp; when I did manage to sneak out - I wouldn't return for 3 days until they had calmed down. At this point I started stealing from my parents too - from cash, alcohol &amp; cigarettes to money out of their banks. At this stage I had also started smoking cannabis, but only occasionally &amp; it was always recreational. My parents cut all pocket money &amp; I resorted to shoplifting - this ceased when I was arrested (moderately). My home life was so unbearable at this point - I had made my parents resent me &amp; I was a thief, they couldn't even leave their wallets around their OWN home. The only thing I had which was solid was my social life, I had a best friend, a solid &amp; vast friendship group - I've always been social so this aspect of my life meant so much to me. One day I was out with my friends &amp; I kissed a boy who was at least 8 years older than me, this got out in my school &amp; I was briefly despised. It was my best-friend who had told people as she wanted me to 'learn from my mistakes' - looking back I agree with her. When aware that everyone knew, I felt lost. I felt that my parents hated me &amp; so did the world - I had no-one. This particular night my parents had gone out to dinner, it was rare for my Dad to go out apart from shopping &amp; to the doctors as he has chronic bronchitis and COPD. That night I took 10 packets of paracetemol, 5 of ibuprofen &amp; 3 of aspirin. I went straight to sleep &amp; woke up with the feeling I had been stabbed in the stomach. My dad being such an observant man had noticed I had put one of the medicine packets back in the cabinet the wrong way &amp; burst into my room asking if I had taken anything, even though I was denying it he could see by my body language &amp; that I was constantly retching that I had. He instantly woke up my Mum &amp; called an ambulance. I was in Hospital for 4 nights &amp; 3 days, luckily they pumped my stomach in time &amp; their was no permanent damage apart from a weaker liver than the average. My dad saved my life. My social life returned back to normal - if not better. But week by week I was becoming more of a delinquent. My grades were dropping, I was barely in school &amp; I started smoking cannabis quite a few times a week, even alone. My parents started expecting my behaviour rather than getting so angry when I had done anything wrong. By the age of 14 I didn't have a curfew &amp; could basically do what I pleased. I have always been a Daddy's girl, even though I love my Mum no less. I was gifted with the wittiest most insightful man as a Dad, &amp; he was always the parent I had felt most comfortable opening up to. I am naturally clever, so I was still getting A's in English as all you need to be is articulate, but all my other subjects I had dropped down to border-line average as I wasn't in any lessons to acquire any of the knowledge I needed. My Brother stayed on the right route, getting top grades in all his GCSEs and Alevels, getting a internship at credit suisse &amp; going to the top uni for economics in London. Everything my Dad wanted for him, he was so proud. I was/am the complete opposite. The last year of secondary school I still had the same attitude - I had no work ethic nor motivation, even though every year I said would be a 'clean slate' . I was smoking weed daily at this point. During my Mock exams I tried MDMA (extasy) for the first time &amp; loved it - I was so happy like you wouldn't believe. I never got addicted nor took it excessively. I managed to scrape 5 C's in my GCSE's, even though I was predicted 10 A's when I had first started the school. I was actually surprised at the results - as in the last 3 years of school I probably only attended 1 &amp; a half overall. This was enough for me to be allowed to start my A-levels. I wanted a fresh start so I went to college rather than staying at the 6th form at my school- this was a horrible horrible mistake. When I was in lessons I did well, but I was rarely in them. My dad would scream &amp; scream at me in the mornings to get out of bed - I would scream the worst abuse imaginable to him &amp; lock myself in. I was addicted to cannabis &amp; when I was in college I was too paranoid that I almost always went home nearly as soon as I got there. The teachers there liked me, my attendance was 17% but I was doing better than a lot of the other students around me (it was a pretty shitty college). One night 3 days before my exams begun I was in central London with all of my friends just basically getting pissed &amp; meeting people. This night was the first night I took cocaine. I lost my friends that night &amp; I also lost my phone. I came home at 7am crying my eyes out just wanting to have a conversation with my Dad ( he was always up all night and asleep during the day because he was so ill ). I found my Dad sat down at the kitchen table slumped across it. He had had a heart attack &amp; died. The next few hours were a blur. I slept through the mortuary picking up his body, but I had to be interviewed by the police. At the time I had a boyfriend, who I cared for a lot, but he was a coke-head. As much as he helped me, I got into cocaine far more than I should have. I went into deep deep depression and filmed myself on my laptop daily just crying &amp; conversing with myself. I felt so guilty &amp; I still do. As much as I knew that he knew I loved him I couldn't help but constantly think about how I could have made his life so much better, how I could have made him happier. I didn't attend my exams, understandably &amp; that whole summer was a combination of drugs, alcohol &amp; depression. My Mum is also very reserved so she dealt with it herself, so I had to aswell. My friends being 16 year olds didn't know how to handle it - personally I think they could have done a lot more - but I detached myself from everything - refusing to talk about it unless I was drunk &amp; then I just exploded in a fit of tears. It didn't get better with time as everyone had promised. All I wanted/want to do is to make my Dad proud of me &amp; become as successful as he wanted me to be, as I wanted to be &amp; what I'm capable to be. I enrolled back at my old school the following year adamant I was going to be a changed person. The first month I was excelling, I felt comfortable &amp; was doing well in my classes. I was still massively depressed &amp; would commonly go home sit in my room with the lights off &amp; watch video's of soldiers being reunited with their daughters on Youtube &amp; just cry over them (I don't know why). I began to not turn up to a lot of my classes, the weed was a trigger as it made me so unmotivated, paranoid &amp; even more depressed. I was kicked out at Christmas because of my attendance. Since then I enrolled to private tutoring but as my Mum was always at work during the day - I lied about going. I never went. I lied to my friends, I lied to everyone. My best friend managed to fix up, she's going to university this September &amp; I am so proud of her. One day in January I made the rash decision that I wanted to move out of London in September &amp; have a clean slate - I chose liverpool (5 hour drive away). I love the idea of being whoever I want to be &amp; starting making new foundations. My house is just a constant reminder of that awful night. I want to get my A-levels &amp; go to university like I've always planned to do. Moving out is so soon &amp; I am so worried I will go into a vortex of depression, have no friends &amp; hate college &amp; the city. I can't go back now as I've paid for the accommodation &amp; I feel like I will be a laughing stock if I once again fuck up. I just got back from a festival with my friends, &amp; me &amp; my best friend had a massive drunken argument. 'You are only moving away because I'm going to University' 'You will never change' 'No-one really likes you' 'You've changed' 'You haven't been my bestfriend for years now' 'I hate you' 'You're a slag' 'I can't wait to get rid of you' were a few of the things she said to me. We made up that night but I can't let go. I have only tried to kill myself once after my Dad had died - but I walked into A&amp;E as I realised how selfish it was - It would destroy my Mum &amp; she deserves so much better. Killing yourself is so selfish towards your loved ones. These past few months I have been constantly having more suicidal thoughts &amp; I think I am near the brink. I know this feeling too well. I am either going to end up running away abroad &amp; killing myself, moving to Liverpool and eventually killing myself, or killing myself before I move. But I can't. I feel one day I will just do it &amp; I don't want to but It's the only way out. Maybe I can never change. I understand there are people out there who have lost their whole families tragically, who have to walk miles for food or suffer from a terrible illness but I can't help but feel like this. I have read a few of the other posts, I am close with my Mum again now after my Dad passed, I love my friends dearly &amp; have a great social life. But my life is dead-end, I am so so so useless &amp; all I do is fret about 'who I used to be' &amp; 'who I am now'. Since my Dad died, I agree I have changed but I couldn't help it. He was my world &amp; now I feel I have nothing going for me &amp; never will. I'm not religious so even if I DID turn things around (impossible) I know he died knowing I was a fuck up, &amp; couldn't see that I had changed. This kills me.

1l3gjq,0,2013-08-25,21 [m] My last major chance at finding a girl begins in less than 10 hours. Really worried.,[deleted],dating_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1l3gjq/21_m_my_last_major_chance_at_finding_a_girl/,"Tomorrow I start my senior year of college. To me this is my last major chance to find a girl. Most likely never any other time in my life will I be surrounded by this many girls my own age in one place. I have never had a girlfriend before or done anything with a girl besides hold hands. I just turned 21. The most I have done was go on 3 separate dates, but never got a second. In the past, talking to girls has always made me nervous when I liked them or when I went on those dates. My last date went well but she just texted me the next morning saying ""lets just be friends."" I actually was't nervous at all. I gotten past that now and feel really confident now. 

I just don't know what to do. I just don't want to make this another wasted 4 years like high school where I made no progress. Yes, I know you could say that gaining confidence in myself is progress, which I agree, but I really want to be able to use that confidence. I am basically clueless with how to pick up women and I think with the way it is now, I will remain single for the rest of my life. I just want to change this so much. Kinda tired of people saying it will just happen someday or focus on career and school. Someday could be 10 years from now. I don't want to be 31 to be my first relationship. I have been focusing on school all of high school and 3 years of college. Right now I have a paid internship so my career plans are good right now. 

I have tried online dating and that is not for me. I just want to at least make some progress so that I have some experience under my belt, because I never had that trial and error period most people have in high school. All of my friends have either a bf or gf making me the only one alone. My friend keeps saying that there are gonna be a few hundred new freshman this fall and that I should try my luck with them. I am kinda skeptical on that because they are gonna be 18 and I'm 21. They would probably think I'm to old for them despite 3 year difference or frown upon my lack of experience with girls.  

Any advice on how to maybe improve this semester and make my last year of college better? I have looked into clubs but the ones that interest me only really have guys in them. My classes this fall are going to be only guys except my math class again due to my major. I have no problem talking to girls but I am gonna see tons of them but will look creepy if I were just to randomly approach them. 

TL;DL Never had a gf before. Senior year of college starts tomorrow and I really would like to finally get some dating experience. Need help other than just saying clubs or don't worry about it. I would rather try to be active rather than passive. "

The last one ditched me because she got a boyfriend and it didn't work out between me and her bf best friend, so we couldn't double date and she hasn't talked to me since. The one before that ended up becoming a drug addict and I had to call 911 on her when I found her beaten up by her dealer.

So, with strange circumstances causing the end of all my friendship, why can't I ever make a real friend!? Im starting to believe they don't exist, that everyone is just self-centered and lives life alone. All I want is someone to hang out with, watch tv, play video games, go hiking or watch a baseball game with.  

No one has texted me in weeks. I go out to parties and see all my acquaintances and they drunkenly hug me and proclaim to strangers how awesome I am and how I am their best friend but then never want to hang with me. This summer I invited everyone I knew to various concerts and day trips and NO ONE could ever go. Not once! And then the same people I kept inviting out talk in front of me about their plans to go to see my favorite bands and weekend trips, but never think to include me. 

I don't get what I am doing wrong!! If I am beautiful and popular, then why am I all alone tonight, why don't I have someone a girlfriend who wants to gossip and watch tv, why has the past 4 guys I gave my number to never texted me?! I don't see what I could be doing wrong when people go out of there way to compliment me on my social skills and like-ability but then no one wants to do anything with me ever. 

I'm so lonely."

I am a senior undergraduate student who will be completing a major in Electrical Engineering in about a year.

Right now, I have yet to decide whether to continue on to graduate school as soon as I graduate or to get a 12-18 month internship to get work experience before returning to school. Which of these options would be preferable, money not being an issue? I should add that I have no internship experience, but have a decent GPA (3.7-ish) and have worked as a TA for 4 courses at my university.

My desired field is in computer architecture and hardware design.

Thanks!"

I am currently a Junior in College and I started my major a bit late and I know it's a bit too late to start Extracurriculars but I was wondering if I should bother with an Internship as a IT or should I just take the semester off to focus on school/learn a new language so I can get an actual Software Engineering Internship. I don't really know that many languages (working on C++ and Python) and it's really hard to find an internship for that. Should I still go for it? I'm currently residing in NYC if that helps.
1l7d38,4,2013-08-27,Me[22M] with my [23F] 4.5 months together. Everything's great except the issue of jealousy,concernedpanic,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1l7d38/me22m_with_my_23f_45_months_together_everythings/,"So I've been dating this girl for about 4.5 months and everything is absolutely amazing except just ONE issue.

To give some background info(info I think could be relevant):

I come from a middle class background, but my dad's hit it big and we've come into a good amount of money. I have a very strained relationship with my parents since my dad was abusive physically and verbally very frequently during my childhood and my mother has turned into a very bitter and over emotional woman over the years. Over all we're pretty dysfunctional. 

As for my girlfriend, she comes from a very traditional Taiwanese family  and they're all vegetarian. Apparently they think its best for her to not date until around 27 or so for cultural reasons of their own. She has two older brothers and her parents probably don't want to lose their little girl to a guy just yet is my guess. She has lead a pretty sheltered life, but she's really kind and considerate of others. Sort of quiet, but funny and cute in the right crowds.

In regards to the relationship, we almost everything in common. Music, food, general likes and dislikes, and though she comes from a very conservative background, she's actually been very open to learning when it comes to sexual matters. We're not hitting home runs yet, but everything else is on the table. She's saving herself for when she's 100% sure or marriage and I respect that. I've got a bit more to love (could lose a few pounds about 190lb) and she's a mix of slim and toned. We both don't have any problems with how we are physically. It's unfortunate, but because her parents don't really approve of us dating and she doesn't have her own car anymore at the moment, we only get to see each other a few times a week at school for limited periods of time and once a week we'll get one day with a few hours to ourselves to do bigger things like go on a date at places we like or spending the day just laying in bed together.  

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So with all that being said, I could say its safe to say I'm serious about this girl and I'd put a ring on it when the time comes, but right now we're still learning about each other and we both plan on dating for awhile before going to the next big step. However, a close female friend of mine who has the same classes as I do (same major in college) has been bothering my girlfriend. 

This close female friend of mine and I did hang out around 1-2 times a week since we both loved the same kind of food and just got along really well in general. Before my girl and I went official, she almost put the whole thing to a stop because she was jealous and thought I was spending a lot of time with the female friend and thought I wasn't serious about her. I talked to her for a good 40 minutes and she realized I was 100% serious when I had roses sent to her on Valentines day and gave her a private piano concert in the performance hall. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So ever since then, she's been getting upset about my close female friend about every 1-2 weeks and it's been really damaging our relationship. I've been completely honest with her about where I am and who I'm with, hoping that the transparency will help. Lies obviously would just make it worse. 

I know that in any relationship there are compromises and problems that need to be dealt with. Considering how awesome everything else is, I still consider myself the luckiest guy in the world. I've been trying to do my part by not eating lunch and hanging out with my close female friend anymore and spending less time with her. Still, it's not enough it seems. Apparently the bad impression of this female friends all started about 3 months ago when I told my girlfriend that my female friend made a joke about me needing to watch out cause my girlfriend seemed like the jealous type. This close female friend of mine is American, but she has a ton of Asian friends so Asian jokes and their stereotypes come very naturally. Granted, it was distasteful, but it was an honest mistake and I just now found out that this was the other half of the big problem and it wasn't purely just jealousy. I've asked her to talk to my female friend to work out the misunderstanding that she was trying to insult her and it was really just a bad joke that she should apologize for, but not something my girlfriend should get that mad about if my friend is genuinely really sorry. She's also been doing her part to avoid me a bit more and keeping her distance physically. In general, she feels really bad for causing any tension.

Unfortunately, to make matters worse, the female friend and I got the same internship at the same company without even knowing it until we actually both got it. So we'll be having classes together AND working together all this semester.

Ideas, thoughts, advice? We all know the ones that don't end well. Any jealousy success stories out there? "

I broke up with my girlfriend last week, am in more debt than I can handle and feel completely overwhelmed by my internship this summer. To make it worse, I live with my sister and her husband. Her husband is a nice guy but gives me a lot of shit for things. I can handle it just fine when I'm not in the middle of a depressive episode, but when I am it just feels like I'm being kicked while I'm down.  It doesn't sound that bad but waking up this morning to see I somehow over-drafted my bank account and am completely broke was enough to knock me down. It feels like something is just sucking the light out of me slowly this morning and I know it's only just begun.

I wasn't a particularly good student and graduated with a 2.33 GPA and did not get any internships.  Hindsight is everything and I wish I had devoted much more time to school.  However, here I am today with a degree and what I feel is nothing to show for it.  I like programming, but I feel like I am not nearly skilled enough to land a job anywhere.  My lack of confidence on top of many ""entry level"" jobs requiring skill in languages and tools I have never heard of, let alone used, make applying to jobs rather difficult.  I know the worst the employer can say is no, but I would rather save myself the embarrassment of not knowing something simple in an interview.  I have applied for several tech sales jobs and had some interviews but I don't really like people all that much and I get incredibly nervous.  I am also really shy so you can imagine what those interviews and follow-ups were like.  I have considered sysadmin stuff but again I don't have the certs/skills for that and I don't like being on call 24/7.  As far as jobs go I guess I'd like to sit and write code mostly.  I enjoy doing tech support kinds of things to an extent.  I don't really want to spend another couple of years honing my skills to where they should already be.  Another thing is I'm not sure where to search for jobs now that I am out of school.  I have been using LinkedIn and Dice and Monster etc., but half the listings seem to be third party recruiters, who I am wary of.  Am I looking in the right place?  Can I still get a job writing code soon?  If not, can I get some other job besides sales or something where I have to talk to customers all day?  I am really concerned that I am paying back all these loans with an income that can't pay them at the moment.  I know I should have done a lot of things sooner/at all.  Any advice would be great.

**TL;DR  I got a degree and now feel like I don't know anything.  Not being a great student, what are my options?**

EDIT: Thank you everyone for your replies.  You have really told me some things I needed to hear.  It has definitely let me know some things about myself that I didn't realize and I will actively work on changing them for the better and hopefully get a job soon!"

My stepmother is an alcoholic, and a very mean and controlling one as well. I have been staying with her until my apartment is ready for a while (apartment will be ready in two weeks), and two weeks ago she blew up (not directly at me, but then it became direct), and threw me out of the house. LUCKILY my bf and her partner moved into a new house and had the space for me. However, dealing with all of the chaos has been pretty constant. Lots of anxiety all the time.

Thanks to being in talk therapy for a year and lexapro for 9 months (I have been off of it for a month now), I am totally surviving. Normally, I would just shut down in situations like this- severe constant panic attacks, nausea and vomiting 24/7, etc. It's not easy, but for the first time in a long time, I feel like I am in control of my anxiety and not the other way around.

Seeking help was The Best thing I ever did for myself. I just want to tell anyone out there that struggles with anxiety that it can get better! I'll be honest- I don't think the anxiety will ever completely go away- but I think that's just part of life. But I can totally live with it as long as I keep it in check. 
I've still got a ways to go on this journey, but I've also made great progress.

So no matter how foreign or scary or weird or whatever you may think about going to see a therapist, you should at least try it. 
If money is an issue- I have no health insurance- I found a place near my work that uses interns that are just about to graduate. I saw a psych every 3 months for med checks, and this was all on a sliding scale, so while costly, I could afford it (and I don't make too much money). 

I think I'm rambling at this point (it's been a long day), but I just wanted to share my story in hope that maybe someone will benefit from it in some way. I know exactly what it's like to be you."

1l5pkg,2,2013-08-26,Not sure if I should tell my new nanny family about the circumstances under which I lost my job with my previous family.,[deleted],Nannies,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nannies/comments/1l5pkg/not_sure_if_i_should_tell_my_new_nanny_family/,"For a little over two months this summer, I was a full-time nanny to a very wealthy family with three children, ages 4, 5 and 8. The mom is a SAHM but her husband works a lot and travels frequently for work, and she is very busy in general maintaining the household, so they hired me for the summer (I'm starting my last year of grad school next week and couldn't give them the amount of help they would've needed during the school year). Things were a bit rocky at first. I had the two little ones all day every day during June and the oldest daughter only after she got out of school, and she was extremely close to their previous nanny, so it took a while for her to warm up to me. The mom is also pretty neurotic. The middle child was in a serious accident two years ago in which she almost lost her left eye, so I get her insistence on safety. But she and her husband are also not American (French and Australian, respectively), and I think they get pretty freaked out by what they see on the news here and think there's someone waiting on every corner to snatch your kid. I get that too, but for a while I felt like I couldn't do anything totally right by her and like she was breathing down my neck all the time.

After about a month, once we were all pretty used to each other, it just clicked and the whole month of July went perfectly. The mom and I worked as a team and the kids and I did something fun every day, whether it was a trip to the museum or just swimming in their pool. They are gorgeous, kind, funny, well-behaved children, and I love them to pieces. I was already starting to dread the end of August when I wouldn't get to see them everyday any more, but they wanted me to stay in their lives and visit after I left and I fully intended to.

On the morning of August 6, I got to work and the mom came out into the driveway as I got out of my car. I said hello and asked how she was doing, and she said not good and that we needed to talk. She said a friend of hers had called her that morning and told her she saw me leave the kids in the car at a coffee shop on the main street in our town the week before while I went in to get a coffee, and asked if this was true. I did not deny it, and explained that, yes, I had parked directly in front of the huge window of the coffee shop (where the distance between the car and the window is a foot-wide sidewalk), locked the doors, left the windows barely cracked open, brought the keys with me, and was in and out in two minutes tops, and that I've done this maybe two or three times on the way to the park. All three kids were there and they were buckled. It wasn't very hot out either. I apologized if this was a problem, but she said this was a major problem and basically told me I was fired.

I was totally stunned and apologized profusely, pretty much begging her to forgive me and swearing it would never happen again. I really thought I had taken the right precautions, and maybe I should have known better considering that she is very serious about safety, but my parents would leave my sister and I in the car with the doors locked for a few minutes when we were kids sometimes, and we were always fine. I told her all this and started crying and saying how much I love the kids, and how I'd never intentionally put them in harm's way and I'm always very careful with them. She said that the whole family loved me and that I was like part of the family, and they wouldn't even try to replace me, and they still want me to be in the kids' lives, and she'd help me find a new job...but I couldn't come back to work. This went on for about 15 minutes until she finally said she'd ""think about it"" and call me in a few days. I had to say goodbye to the kids (we were all crying) and hand over my key to the house.

I was completely devastated and ashamed. I even typed up an extremely heartfelt two-page letter and put it in their mailbox a few hours later, reiterating over and over again how sorry I am and how it would never, ever happen again if they decided to forgive me and give me another chance. Two days later, she called me and, after thanking me for the letter, said they had not changed their minds. 

I was really depressed and felt very guilty for about a week, and I still miss the kids so badly it hurts. And while I do regret making a choice I should have known she would have been unhappy with, I now feel that I was treated really poorly for someone who was ""part of the family"" and ""irreplaceable."" She could have totally berated me, but I really think the appropriate reaction would have been, ""We are extremely disappointed and if this ever happens again, you will be fired."" And it wouldn't have! I was so, so careful with those kids. I have flawless criminal and driving records, am CPR/first aid certified, watched them like a hawk everywhere we went, had pool safety training as a camp counselor, and went over a safety plan with the kids in case, God forbid, we ever got separated in public. And honestly, I didn't even think what I did was wrong. As I said, my parents (who were in no way negligent) did that with my sister and I, and it was in the middle of the day on the main street in the safest (read: richest) town in our state. I've also racked my brain for all the things that could have happened, and I've come up with: a) someone would smash the window open and snatch the kids; b) someone would pry the (locked) door open and snatch the kids; or c) some person who was drunk/high off their ass in the middle of the day would swerve off into the parking lot and smash into the car (which could just as easily happen on the road). Maybe I'm missing some scenarios, and I know anything can happen anywhere, but all of them seem extremely unlikely given the time and location.

Pretty much everyone I've talked to thinks she completely overreacted, and some even said they would basically tell her to go screw herself if they were me and she asked them to come back (though that is now a moot point). When I was interviewing for part-time nanny jobs for the school year a couple weeks ago, I even shared the story with parents I interviewed with who asked about my recent experience. Every parent I told the story to, which I did so as objectively as possible, said it was absolutely not a fireable offense as far as they were concerned, and several even admitted to leaving their kids locked in the car for a few minutes from time to time. Knowing that the popular opinion is not that I am a negligent monster, and that I would have laid down in front of a truck for those kids and still would, has helped me move past the guilt and chalk it up to a learning experience. I would do anything to go back and never do it, though, because I adore those kids and miss them so much. :(

I recently signed on for the school year for a part-time position for a family with three sons, although I will only be caring for the two youngest, who are 5 and 8 (their oldest is a high school senior). Having learned what kind of parents to avoid, these people seem like a great fit. They're very laid back, I'm getting paid more money per hour for less kids, and neither are SAH, so there won't be any breathing-down-the-neck factor. The mom even got me a paid internship with her company. It's basically an awesome gig and I'm excited to start. 

In our interview, they didn't ask me about my most recent experience. Had they, I would have told them no problem, but I didn't volunteer the information. As I get closer to my start date, I'm starting to feel worried and unsure as to whether I should disclose the information. I don't know if it would build trust or make them second guess their decision.

Have any of you been fired from a nanny job, and if so, what did you do about your next family? Does it do more harm than good to tell them what happened, especially if you didn't deserve to be fired, or is it better to just lay it all out on the table? (And on a less-important note, how did you cope with not being with the kids anymore? I miss them to death, and even though their mom said I could visit, I don't think I ever could after feeling so betrayed by her.)

**TL;DR: I was fired recently from a nanny job, and while it was because of a bad judgment call on my part, I truly believe I was treated like shit and didn't deserve to lose my job. I'm starting with a new family soon and they don't know about it. Should I tell them or not?**"

What should I do?",[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1l5p7q/ive_had_two_internships_neither_of_which_taught/,"The first internship was two years ago, where I made a sort of internal CMS tool using rudimentary php, mysql (and html/javascript). The one I'm in now I am to make a multithreaded daemon server to take in user info and put it in a mysql database (can't think to put this in a more concise manner) except I'm stuck, the devs are all in China and are in crunch time so they can't answer my questions regardless, and my last day is this Wednesday. Oh and for most of the internship I was actually a de facto free translator betweenthe Virginia branch and the China branch.

I have a 3.0 gpa in applied math and am going into my 5th year, but with some extraordinarily bad grades in some core cs classes (along with every other class I was taking at the time). Grades got better, but I feel as if I'm entering my final year completely unprepared to apply for any job, let alone actually work in one. Both internships basically resulted in me googling/SO ing all the questions and copying snippets of code online. I 'm not giving up though, I have a relatively easy quarter coming up, and I plan to make the most of it. Do you guys think it'd be better to pile up some more cs classes, or do you think it'd be better to try starting a personal project?"

1l5iko,18,2013-08-26,"Long distance relationship problems, he says he doesn't want to do it.",14041,whatsbotheringyou,https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsbotheringyou/comments/1l5iko/long_distance_relationship_problems_he_says_he/,"Ok... This is kind of long story but I think it will help me feel better just getting it out. Thanks for listening.

I am a 24 year old female and he is 23 and just starting a two year grad program 1,000 miles away. We met a year ago and started dating exclusively shortly afterward. He knew he would be moving away 9 months after we met, and told me from the beginning he does not ever want to be in a long distance relationship. I was fine with this because I figured we would just deal with it later if it is still an issue. I put the thought of him leaving out of my mind so I could enjoy the time we did have.
 
We fell in love, I've met his family and I love them and they like me too, we have had a really good relationship-- I really do think he is someone I could marry. We have talked about marriage, and he's said that he thinks we could get married if we spend a couple years together (in the same city) and things are still great.

This is not my first serious relationship, and I know what I want out of a relationship, and though we do have some communication problems, I KNOW that this is something I want to be in. 

I graduated from college a year ago, and during that time I have applied for jobs in my field in my town and had no luck. I started applying for work in the city he is going to grad school a few months ago, but I had no luck there either. Two weeks ago, I got a job offer in my area (finally!) and I took it. It is a really great job, and it would be best for my career to keep for a couple years at least.

I don't have the money to move to where he is, or I would have gone with him. I have to buy a used car and have the money to move before I can go. I think it will take me about 9 months to save up enough to move there, and at that time he will be (hopefully) going abroad for an internship, or maybe somewhere else in the US.

We have spent 3 months apart so far, and we have seen each other 2 times. The last time was a month ago, I stayed with him and his family for a week just before he moved to where the school is. It was a really wonderful visit. He was very loving and we were equally excited to be with each other. Everything he did and said made me think that he would be ok with doing long distance for a while until i can afford to move down there. He has had his moments this summer where he gets really overwhelmed with the thought of not knowing how long we will be apart and having an open ended LDR (this was before i got that job). 

Last night we were talking on the phone and I could tell he had something on his mind and asked him what was bothering him. We talked for about 2 hours and he said that he doesn't think LDRs work, he's been in two of them before, and this one has a 1 year minimum and that is too much for him. 

And the way he talked about this upset me the most. He basically said that he's reduced this relationship to numbers and he doesn't see any way it can work. I feel that I am up to the challenge, and I realize how tough it will be, but I love him dearly and am determined to make it work. He said he didn't see how his feelings about me were relevant to the situation, either, when I asked how he felt about me and losing me and all that stuff. 

He is a very mathematical and logical person, and isn't as emotional as I am. The conversation ended up with us deciding to ""take a break"" for 3 months and then reevaluate how long it will take for me to move there, and how we feel about that. I think breaks are kind of stupid- usually they prolong a breakup that is already going to happen. The only reason I agreed to that is because the alternative is to break up. Which he was pretty much asking for us to do.

I had the last word in our conversation, it wasnt angry or anything. I think it struck a cord, because he called back and said he was sorry that this conversation went poorly and asked that we not do the break that night, and asked if we could talk today and figure this out. He was showing some emotion at this point. I agreed to that. 

I KNOW that it's probably a bad idea to try to talk someone out of a breakup. If someone doesn't want to be in a relationship with me, I usually let them go. But this is a case of the circumstances of our lives getting in the way, and the fact that we are so damn compatible and great together and we love each other shouldn't be taken lightly by either of us, i think. I think it's worth us fighting for. He is putting it all on me, i feel. I could save up just enough to go down there and try to wing it, but I want to be responsible and not piss off my family by just following my heart with no regard for the responsible thing to do. I told my boyfriend i would leave this great job to be with him, but I am really conflicted about that too. I am choosing him over my career. I would happily do this, though, if it meant we would be together from here on out.

This is also bothering me: I have never lived farther than a 50 mile radius of where I grew up and i really DO want to leave and see the world. If I am with him I will have the chance to do that. He wants to travel and he will have the means to do so after school.

We are about to talk on the phone again. I hope it goes well. I don't want to lose him, but if that's what needs to happen, so be it. Wish me luck. Thank you.

**TL;DR Our relationship is victim of poor timing. He doesn't want to be in a LDR and I am doing all I can to move there but it will be months before that happens.**

The day went pretty late today, and I can't imagine getting out any earlier tomorrow because I will probably have the same number of patients but much more to do because it's the last day so they need to be passed to the next team.

I apologize. I was looking forward to it, but I don't think it's possible. Could we try for Saturday? I will get my schedule figured out Wednesday and can confirm then.

Again, so sorry.

Aug 19, 2013 – 11:33pm

no worries -- thanks for letting me know

let's plan for saturday. let me know when you know for sure, and we'll set up time and place

Aug 22, 2013 – 11:13pm

Hi, So I'm really sorry to do this, but my life as an intern has taken a turn for the worst. This rotation is going to be a tough one. It already has been. I don't get a day off until Wednesday, which means I will not be able to make our Saturday date. I'm very sorry.

This is not a ploy to get out of seeing you. I would genuinely like to meet you and for us to keep trying to make that happen. However, I completely acknowledge that this is an unfair situation for you. I'm sorry that my schedule is so busy and that I don't even really have control over it.

If you are free Wednesday and would like to try to meet then, that would be wonderful. But if you're feeling put off by all the scheduling snafus, which you deserve to be (I'm upset with myself you doing this to you), then you have an ""out."" I would totally understand.

Otherwise, how have you been doing? How's the week finishing up for you?

For me, this has been the toughest past 4 days of my short time as a doctor. My last 2 days at Children's were packed. I all of a sudden had a lot of complicated kids to take care of, and then I also had to get them all ""summarized"" and ""signed out"" to the next team that would be taking care of them when the rotations switch. Handoffs in medicine are tough. Obviously you can't be with your patients all the time and have to handoff their care, but things can so easily be lost or miscommunicated. I think Children's had a pretty nice system in place, though.

Oh man, yesterday was my first day on inpatient medicine at . Basically I will be taking care of adults who are admitted to the hospital for whatever reason (GI bleeding, intractable vomiting, renal failure, etc). It was such a shock: taking over as caregiver for a group of patients that I don't know, the different computer system, not knowing how the smallest things worked, the higher patient load, the higher responsibility. There was crying. In front of other doctors. It was the most stressful day I've ever had since starting medical school. Today was slightly better, only because my team had a break and didn't have to admit any new patients to the hospital. I know that only way to get through this month will be to accept the onslaught and just roll with it - see previously mentioned ""blorft"" (which I spelled wrong the first time). Each day will get a little easier...breathe.

OK. Off to bed to end this exhausted streak. It would be great to hear from you about what you've been up to!

Aug 23, 2013 – 2:38pm

sorry to hear that it's been rough. i've felt that stressed before, and it's a terrible feeling to know that you can't control any of it. having dated a resident before, i know that there will be some tough times...but it gets better :)

i've been well. this has been a relatively light week. a lot of people at take vacation in august, and so it seems like half of my team is out. but a few things have been keeping me busy, and i'd like to get them closed out before i take off for . i'm working from home today -- just one more meeting (teleconference) before the weekend

anywho, no worries about tomorrow (sat). let's just plan to hang out on wed

Thank you for understanding. I have hope that it does get better. It is already.

When on Wednesday would work for you? I've got all day :)

Sure. Where do you live? Where should we meet? At what time?Sent from the OkCupid app

Aug 26, 2013 – 7:56pm

hm, how about 

7 pm?

Aug 26, 2013 – 9:03pm

Annnnnnd, just like that, my day off is in jeopardy.

When an intern on this service takes a day off, the senior covers for them. The old senior had approved Wednesday, but the seniors just switched and the new one will not be able to cover for me. We will try to bargain some more tomorrow, but I'm not hopeful it can be resolved. I have to get a day off eventually.... My next chance is Friday.

I'm sorry this keeps happening. This is super frustrating that I can't maintain control over my schedule. It makes me feel guilty for not being able to keep commitments.

I'll let you know what gets figured out tomorrow. If I ever get a day off, at 7 would work for me. Sent from the OkCupid app

Aug 26, 2013 – 10:52pm

if i didn't know any better, i'd think that you really don't like me. haha just kidding

no worries -- let me know about wed. if you can't make it, we can tentatively plan for fri. i take off on sat though for colombia and i'll be gone until sept 8

Aug 27, 2013 – 10:29pm

Have fun in Colombia if I don't see you before then :)

I'm sorry I keep canceling. You're welcome to give up on me; I've pretty much given up on myself at this point.

I have to work Wednesday. I don't have a day off scheduled. They tentatively offered Thursday, which interns usually are not allowed to take off - so I'm not confident that will happen.

I've commented on a few things here before, but for the sake of introduction, I am a MAAB genderqueer person who generally presents a bit more on the feminine side. I am married, currently a theology student (hoping to go on for  a PhD in religious studies) and am an intern at a church. It's my week to preach this Sunday, and for a few reasons I intend to reveal to the church in my sermon that I identify myself as genderqueer (though a few members and some of the leadership already know). One of these reasons is that I think it could open some fruitful conversations with some of the congregants. Another is that I would like to be able to dress how I want at work without always having to explain myself, so I guess I'm trying to do the explaining in one fell swoop... Anyway, could use some hugs and support. I am not afraid for my job, as the church is definitely a more progressive one. But the church also holds a diverse set of viewpoints, and I would be a little conceited to assume that everyone will receive well what I have to say. So, I'm set on doing this, but I'm a bit scared. I've got my sermon written, its pretty personal and I think it will be a good one, but I hope it doesn't fall flat on Sunday morning. Anyway, not looking for advice necessarily, just would like to know that some of you wonderful people are cheering for me.

1l9zx9,0,2013-08-28,[Spoilers] What do you think of my revision of the show (8 seasons too).,[deleted],Dexter,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dexter/comments/1l9zx9/spoilers_what_do_you_think_of_my_revision_of_the/,"So I saw that a lot of people thought the show couldn`t sustain itself past a couple seasons or with a lot of the characters or plotlines. The only major characters that I removed were Quinn, Travis, and Lumen. I fused Hannah and Lila together. Tell me what you think of my 8 seasons.


**Season One:** Exactly the same except the final scenes aren't Brian going to kill Debra but saying goodbye to Dexter. He steals Dexter's boat and flees the city.

**Season Two:** With the ITK on the lose the FBI is sent to Miami including Lundy. Meanwhile Dexter can't kill because of all the heat in the city including Doakes and begins losing his mind. About 10 minutes every episode is dedicated to Brian's escape from the FBI and Dexter wonders about if it's going to be him one day. Dexter goes to addiction rehab and meets Lila (well a Lila + Hannah hybrid with a dash of Bond girl added in) but they do not fuck yet. Towards episode 10 Dexter breaks and sloppilly kills an innocent (but he's still a douchebag) due to pent up Dark Passenger. That man is Ramon Prado. Miguel is introduced in episode 11. Brian is shot and in critical condition by FBI agents in the season finale. Dexter devastated by this and fucks Lila (a one time thing).

**Season Three:** Ghost Harry isn't introduced. With the FBI gone Dexter begins to spurge himself with killing (he bought a new boat between seasons) only regular gangbangers no prolific serial killers.  Miguel and Doakes are complete rivals to eachother and Miguel begins reaching out to Dexter due to Doake's hatred of him and they become friends. Lila witnesses one murder so Dexter continues the affair with Lila but Rita doesn't find out. Dexter's gravesite is discovered. The FBI returns. Seeking guidance from this Dexter organizes a visit with Brian who's in prison but not fully recovered. Dexter realizes that he will become like Brian and tries to become a normal family man so he cuts off his affair with Lila. Lila becomes upset and threatens Dexter, Rita, Debra, and Miguel. Doakes snooping discovers Lila and Dexter arguing about their lives. Dexter captures Doakes puts him in the cabin with Lila's help. Lila believes that if she helps Dexter he'll lover and frames/kills Doakes. Dexter is devastated by this and Lila flees the country. Dexter doesn't pursue her but proposes to Rita. Miguel kills a man who he believes killed his brother in the finale.

**Season Four:** Miguel turns to Dexter for help after the murder due to dna and evidence and Dexter decides to help. After the complete shame of having Doakes be the bay harbor butcher Mathews is forced to do an overhaul of Miami Metro. LaGUerta is demoted. A new lt. is added, Mike Anderson is the new Sgt. The new Lt. is extremely quirky he's similar to Dexter in that he doesn't relate to humanity well but he's not a killer more like Sherlock  (Benedict Cumberbatch) but a lot more disciplined. LaGuerta shaken up by Doakes begins investigating Dexter in secret. Dex + Miguel become a serial killing team and genuinly become friends. At the wedding Miguel is the best man. Harrison is born. Lundy returns ep 8ish to talk about Trinity. Miguel and Dexter start to grow a rift. But In the season finale Miguel is bludgeoned to death by Trinity.

**Season Five:** Dexter is devasted by the death of his best friend and Sherlock gives Lundy help with his Trinity theory out of respect. This plays out a lot like Season Four actually did except Masuka is the one who bangs Trinity's daughter because Quinn doesn't exist and everyone has to deal with Miguel's murder. After he finds out about her evil he is devestated but Sherlock lets him get an intern to keep him relaxed ... Louis. Brian is given the electric chair and Dexter attends the  execution in episode 11 because he lost Miguel without saying goodbye he doesn't want to lose his brother. The finale is the same pretty much and Rita is still killed post humously by Trinity. 

**Season Six:** Losing his best friend, mentor, wife, and brother so close in succession hits Dexter hard. Dexter slopilly kills a man and DeBra sees. Similar to season seven but the Skyrim guy is the turning point where Debra doesn't hate dexter anymore. This season becomes LaGuerta vs Dexter and a smaller copycat killer (Louis with a better actor and motivation) plotline. Sherlock becomes increasingly upset that his department lost Trinity and is losing solved numbers that he takes his vacation but uses it to track down trinity for himself. Jonah kills his mother but instead of Dexter coming it's Sherlock who finds out Dexter was hanging with Trinity. LaGuerta is shot by DeBra in the finale.

**Season Seven:** Sherlock creates a special task force of officers he trusts to gather evidence against Dexter. Debra quits Miami Metro and becomes more and more unstable and starts killing people that Dexter has to clean up. Louis is revealed to know of Dexter's secrets due to witnessing him murder his abusive ex boyfriend in s3 and is in love with Dexter. Dexer kills Sirko's lover. They have a season long arc where Dexter realizes the only person who accepted his killing was Lila. Louis also confesses his love for Dexter but is scoffed at. Sirko and Dexter become friends sort of due to him being betrayed by Novikov (who isn't convieniently killed and doesn't kill Sirko). Louis gives all the extra info that was needed to Sherlock after being rejected by Dexter. Louis gloats to Batista that his friend Dexter is going to jail. In the finale Sherlock has enough evidence and does a complete raid of Dexter but only the kids and their babysitter are there. Debra found out through Batista leaking it and warns Dexter before committing suicide. Sirko and Dexter flee the country leaving everything behind. Dexter contacts Lila and they meet up in Argentina. Louis is arrested by Sherlock because he did extra detective work and found out about him being the copycat killer but knew that he knew who the real one was.

**Season Eight:** 8 years have passed. The killing 3 live under new aliases. Dexter is haunted by what his life has caused him to lose. He is a simple fisherman now but he does occassionally kill. Sirko does security and Lila takes care of Miguel Dexters 5 year old son. One day Batista tracks down Dexter in Argentina. Batista had become the foster father of Dexter's kids and needs apparently Astor and Cody and Harrison have psychopathic tendencies. Dexter tells him to bring them to Argentina so they can be with him but Batista refuses. Suddenly Sherlock comes in with a gun and hired thugs. He quit his job due to his obsessive need to close the case on Dexter because of all the havok he's reaced on him and his department he knew Batista would be the one to lead him to Dex. Sherlock shoots at Dexter and his place killing Miguel. Dexter flees across the continent and Sherlock follows him with his goons. Lila, Sirko and Batista all die by over the season. Sherlock is gunned down in Mexico. Dexter sneaks into the US while Sherlock follows to see his kids. Dexter kills all three of them so they don't become a cancerous monster like he had become and patiently waits for the police to capture him in the final scene. His eyes are different."

I'm a prospective transfer student to SJSU as a computer science major and was hoping you could help with a few questions. Will be moving to San Jose soon, mainly on the strength of SJSU's rep in the tech community and it's affordability. My plan is to attend a local community college, become a resident and get in-state tuition, then transfer to SJSU comp-sci program. 

-I've heard that computer science/software-engineering/computer engineering majors are heavily impacted and everything from class selection/offerings to graduation-time(supposedly takes 5-6 years instead of 4) have been affected. Factual or budget-cuts fear-mongering?  

-Are you able to get in the classes you need to graduate on time?

-I've heard good things about the career center and the recruitment/employment opportunities, especially for CS &amp; Engineering students. Can you tell me a little bit more about this? Are you able to get paid internships with reputable tech firms/companies/startups?

-DeAnza is on a quarter system, but SJCC(and SJSU) are on a semester system, so I would assume SJCC would have a smoother transfer. Also, it's much closer to downtown. So I'm leaning towards SJCC; but I've also have also heard that DeAnza has a superior academic ""rep"" and higher transfer rates to UCs. I'm only interested in SJSU tho, so whichever cc that would make for the quickest and smoothest transfer. Thoughts?

-Any other useful info re: transferring/CS&amp;SE majors ?


Thanks and it's good to know there are Breaking Bad fans at SJSU. Watch parties what :) #Heisenberg"

Unfortunately for me I make many purchases even when I don't have the right funding to support it. I currently have 2 open CC accounts. One with interest rising by the month, and another freshly opened with 12 month no finance charges. Both as a cumulative totaling $3063.93 (as of August 28, 2013). I am currently working as an systems/network administrator intern. So pay isn't the greatest, $500 biweekly plus 10% billable hours. At the end of a month, I would come out to ~$1000-$1375. I have as a monthly payment to help pay some roommates $160 which covers rent, food, utilities and cell phone. Travel expenses going to and coming from work comes out to around $80-$100 per month. So I have $ Approximately $740-$1115 to spend/pay off CC. I am guilty of purchasing unnecessary things such as new cell phones when they are released, new laptop, new camera lenses. I am currently 21 years old and I checked my Credit Score and it was 746 which I heard was okay, but I fear that it will get lower and lower if I only make the minimum payments every time. I received my first CC at age 18 which was a major mistake because I maxed it out within a few months and NEVER paid it in full. I guess what I am asking is, what is a reasonable amount to pay off each credit card and still have money for various activities with friends and family?"

You shake the recruiters hand, thank them from bringing you in and engage in some small talk, mostly about the weather. Now it’s time to get down to business: “Why don’t you begin by walking me through your resume.”

It’s critical that you take no more than two minutes to deliver your answer so as to avoid boring the interviewer and losing their attention and interest. Focus on the key selling points and give your answer a defined structure. The following list of things to check off in the following order is what we recommend from experience and consulting numerous recruiters:

Discuss where you went to school, what you majored in and why you choose your major
In order of oldest to newest, discuss briefly your work experience. Mention what skills you were able to develop and make sure that you only talk about the ones most pertinent to the job you’re interviewing for
Discuss briefly how you became interested in the industry you’re trying to break into and tie it back to why you’re interested in the job you’re interviewing for; show genuine interest
Briefly talking about your extracurricular involvement to come across as a more well rounded individual
Here’s a sample answer that we believe is a good example of how you can generally structure your answer:

“Originally, I’m from Toronto but I decided to move out to Boston after getting accepted into MIT. MIT is well known and has a lot of reputable profs who’re tops in their respective fields and so I felt it was the best fit for me. I chose to major in economics because I found the analytical and quantitative aspects really stimulating. I naturally enjoy following business news and seeing how the state of the economy shapes the business landscape, so majoring in economics was an easy choice for me.

During my junior summer, I had an internship with X Economic Consulting and I really enjoyed it. The position entailed that I do a lot of research, discuss findings with my superiors and perform certain analyses for reports that I’d be tasked with writing. I learned a lot and developed my analytical, writing and communication skills immensely.

But it was mainly the researching and writing aspect that I loved. And given my active interest in what’s happening in the business world and the economy, I decided that I want to pursue a career in economic reporting, so I’m here today to try make that dream a reality. Besides all that, in my free time, I like to play soccer, watch movies, read a lot of biographies and travel as often as I can.”"

On top of that it seems they have really odd questions that seem really old (from the practice tests I've taken and such).  What do you guys think?

I'll definitely have a higher GPA after Christmas break but I worry that there won't be as many opportunities.
1l9i1x,4,2013-08-28,I think I’m attracted to someone I’ve never actually met. What should I do?,[deleted],gay,https://www.reddit.com/r/gay/comments/1l9i1x/i_think_im_attracted_to_someone_ive_never/,"Hello! I am a 20 year old gay male, and I have a bit of a problem that I thought I’d ask advice about here.

First of all, a little background about me: My parents divorced when I was 9. My dad got custody of me, married a very religious woman and I spent most of my youth in fundamentalist Christianity. My mom went the opposite route and became a very liberal lesbian. When I was 18 I left home and the church and moved in with my mom, and now I’m a college student. I’ve spent the last two years trying to come to terms with my sexuality and who I am as a person in general. I’m not “out” yet, but I know that my mom would be very supportive of me if I came out (my dad not so much, but I don’t live with him anymore so I’m not too worried about his opinion). This isn’t really relevant to the story, but it does give a little info about me as a person. I mainly wanted to emphasize that I have no previous dating/relationship experience and that I come from a different background, so I don’t really know what I should do in this situation.

Anyways, over the summer I participated in a state-wide internship in which several people from different areas of the state worked in their local governments. At the beginning of the internship all the interns attended an introductory workshop at the headquarters of the organization that was sponsoring the program. So while I was there, I noticed this guy who was quite attractive. I didn’t really think much about it other than “he’s cute”. So the session ended, everyone went back home to begin their internships, and I forgot about him.

At the end of the internship, the organization held a “closing banquet” where interns could share stories about their experiences and talk with the organization leaders about it. It was there that I noticed him again. He talked a little bit about the projects he worked on over the summer. So the banquet ended, and I didn’t stay around for very long. That was a decision I immediately regretted. All night I kept thinking about that person, and how I should have gone up to him and said hi or something. I don’t know why, but I couldn’t get him out of my mind. I don’t think I had ever actually spoken to him, and it’s almost like… I was attracted to him. “No,” I told myself, “You don’t even know if he’s gay! And he lives nearly 400 miles away!” Yet I couldn’t quit thinking about him.

So, the days went by, and despite the growing distance between the banquet and the present day, he would still pop up in my mind from time to time. I wondered about who he was as a person. The organization that hosted the internship provided all the interns with a book that included information about each intern. I looked him up. It listed some general information, like where he went to school and what his hobbies were. I really wished I could stop thinking about him. I felt like a creep feeling this way about someone I didn’t know, and I had more important stuff to worry about.

Two weeks later, and I still find myself wondering about him. Finally, my curiosity got the best of me and I actually *googled his name*. It made me feel terribly creepy, but I had to make myself quit thinking about it, and making myself see how unrealistic it would be for me to “meet” him  seemed like the best way for me to get over him. So, I find his Facebook profile. It was interesting to see that we share a lot of the same views. Then I discover something I wasn’t expecting to find out: He *is* gay!

So now I’m asking what I should do next. How can I get over him? What should I do to make myself feel better? Should I *shudder* send him a friend request or a message, and try to talk to him? If so, what should it say? I know that would probably be creepy, especially since the banquet was two weeks ago. I’m also very shy and don’t want to do that, but I don’t know… Another part of me thinks that I’ve never humiliated myself in that way before and there are 400 miles between us, so what is there to lose? It’s not like I’d ever have to see him again if I didn’t want to. I’d really appreciate serious advice from people who may be able to help. Thanks for reading! :)

1l8yky,1,2013-08-28,What do I do?,[deleted],SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1l8yky/what_do_i_do/,"Hi,

I’ve never really talked to anyone about this but I felt like it would be good.  People say that about writing your down your goals right? Supposedly it helps;  hopefully it will help with this issue as well. I figure the most appropriate way to start this is with some backstory. I’ve been throwing back some gin so bear with me. 
I’ve never really been happy. If happiness was as easy as distracting or entertaining myself than I doubt I’d even be posting here, but apparently it’s not. Like many others I have been the type of person that pushes off their goals. If I can accomplish goal “x” by time ”y” then I will be finally happy. It’s easy to take comfort in the premise that when you’re young you have an infinite amount of time ahead of you to rectify the mistakes of your past. Obviously life doesn’t work this way. 

I’ve never been a great student. Throughout high school I maintained (if my memory serves me correctly) around a 3.0 average gpa, and planned on improving this once I reached college. Like most college bound high school students and I suppose people in general, I spent a lot of time thinking about what I wanted my future to look like.  After copious amounts of research, conversations with people in the medical field and even messaging the author of my favorite blog about being a surgeon (he even sent me a signed copy of his book, still have the damn thing) I had set my sights on becoming surgeon. 

With no sports or academic scholarships available for the level of mediocrity I brought to the table, I began attending community college. Of course just anticipating that you would try harder isn’t a viable replacement for actual hard work and my gpa reflected that.  At this point I realized I lacked the resolve required for medical school and redirected my ambitions. Like many other young students in college I began experimenting with drugs, and saw great utility within psychedelics.  I became enamored  with the writings and works of Shulgin and decided that my life’s work should be within a field of research that reflected that interest. In high school I realized I had a knack for chemistry, and coupled with this new found interest I was set. 

It was around this time that I transferred to my local state university seeking a degree in biochemistry. Even though I was spending a great deal of time studying and actually enjoying the classes I had the opportunity to take my gpa still remained around 3.0. Hardly good enough to pursue my masters and not even close enough to pursue my back up plan of going into pharmacy I sank into deep depression. 

I mean looking back it has been clear that I’ve always been depressed. I always told myself that I would be happy once I accomplished what I set out to accomplish. That once I was successful I would have no reason to feel unhappy. This mind state led me to almost complete apathy,  and I ended up failing a class that they would not allow me to take again (because they stopped offering it). This failing grade (in a fucking elective for Christ’s sake, it was always the electives I did poorly in) was the last nail in the coffin and I ended up graduating with a gpa less than 3.0. Which is the necessary gpa for attending grad school, at least in the schools I have researched. So here I am, still working at the same shitty job that I had in college, hiding in the back from embarrassment when people I used to know wander in. Watching my largely successful group of friends move on to great jobs, while I just wake up every morning thinking about ending it. 

In my mind, it would be better to die now than to grow old and accomplish nothing; which is my biggest fear. It seems that nothing would be shameful than that. It has been impossible for me to get a job in my field, as my lack of internships and work experience renders me useless as an employee apparently. So what do I do? Honestly I’ve thought about killing myself every day I wake up, and every night when I go to sleep for the last year. I’m not religious, but the thought of what happens afterwards terrifies me. So I really don’t know what to do. 

Thanks for reading this,

Signed  - Someone who appreciates it.

1l8wp5,5,2013-08-28,"Me [25/M] with my girlfriend [24/F] 3 years, not currently what I want in a wife, but says she'll change",PlanAndExecute,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1l8wp5/me_25m_with_my_girlfriend_24f_3_years_not/,"My girlfriend and I started dating in a city in the northeast US, where I was a new grad student at a university, and she was a graduating senior at a neighboring university.


At first, I wasn't really looking for a long term relationship, but after dating a few months I found that I really liked this girl a lot, and she had a lot going for herself (i.e. her own friends, work, hobbies, school, etc.) which is always a good thing.



After about 1.5 years I graduated from my program.  Before I graduated I knew I was going to be moving to Texas to start my PhD work with a new research group.  We discussed this, and at the time I did not see this as a reason to break up, as I would be happy doing the long distance thing.  However, after a lot of compromise on my part, she moved with me to California the summer after graduation for an internship and onto Texas in the following fall.  We have now been living together for about 15 months.



Since we moved in together, and especially since we've moved to TX, she has changed a lot, and I seriously doubt the future of our relationship.  She has put on weight, stays in away from friends more, and doesn't seem to have much desire to do anything outside of work to improve herself.


I am a highly motivated goal-driven person, and when we first started dating she seemed to fit right in with that philosophy.  For example, I would make a goal that I want pass a certain professional licensing exam this year, or win a certain amount of research grant money over 12 months, or add 15 lbs of muscle and do 60 consecutive pull-ups within the next 12 months, then go out and do everything I can to achieve those goals, with the idea that each of our individual completed goals adds value to our relationship.


She used to support this kind of philosophy in me, and even focus on a few goals herself.  However, now I find that she just wants to ""cuddle"" on the couch, watch movies, and not really go out.


She says she still has some life goals, like going back to school for grad work and getting fit, but hasn't really taken any initiative to get started on them.


It's frustrating for me because I compromised a lot to live with her because I thought she would support the married lifestyle that I want.  Now that we are living together I can see that this is not currently the case.  When I try to continue staying busy with setting and going after my goals, she gets upset because I'm not paying attention to her.  But paying attention to her just means sitting around and being unproductive, which ""cramps my style""


We've talked about this, and she says that she's just at a point in her life where she's not in a position to pursue any major goals, but I feel this is just an excuse to be immature and irresponsible.  She says that by the time we'd be married (we've talked about doing so when I graduate from my current program) she'll change back to how she used to be.


However, I don't know if I can trust her.  I don't want to spend another three years of my mid-twenties in a frustrating miserable relationship just to have her not change back (or get worse) after marriage.  Then again, I know from experience that she was who I wanted to marry at one point, and she sacrifice a lot to move across the country with me, so I'd feel bad breaking it off over a few months of being frustrated and miserable.


My parents have been married 40 years now, and they've told me how they were entire years in their marriage that were awful, but they were happy they stayed the course.  This would suggest that perhaps this may be a short-term problem; however, I feel that my time in my mid-twenties is so valuable that I don't want to take the risk that it might not get better.


So basically I would like advice on whether to continue the relationship, ride out the current miserableness and hope for the best, or cut my losses.

**tl;dr**: Ride it out and hope for the best, or cut my losses?"
1l8q1u,17,2013-08-28,I have no idea where else to post about helping me figure out what my personal issue is. More info inside!,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1l8q1u/i_have_no_idea_where_else_to_post_about_helping/,"I'll try to keep this short. I am a 20 years old male who is just confused where to take the next step.

For as long as I can remember (Probably only since 7th grade probably) all I have ever wanted was to be in a relationship with a girl where we both genuinely had mutual interest. The following years were filled with a big transformation period that still continues today. I went through depression in result to how I was treated socially and ptsd from cancer, a severe panic disorder related to developing a neurological disorder that induces hallucinations, and significant weight loss done through exercise and diet. 

I changed schools halfway through highschool and had the best two years of my life socially and then college began. Today, I am doing extremely well. I'm on to my third internship and working towards a career I am very passionate about. I also have many hobbies that I am devote a significant amount of time to and by the time I reach out of school I should be receiving a decent income from it with so much room for progress.

Now backing up a bit. For several months I have been putting in research about improving myself socially and working towards developing a relationship with a girl. 

Here are some things I here all the time

Work on yourself. Get a job, do something you are passionate about. Get hobbies, do special activities, begin working out, eat healthy, etc. According to so many people if I do all of these things I will magically be glowing of confidence. I am no where near this stage apparently.

I have the Job, I have the hobbies, I have the passion, I am active and healthy, I dress nice, but bottom down I hate myself. Even if I have a ""good day"" at night time I get depressed and start thinking about how life would be if I were dating. Now from what I read, my happiness and my issues will not change whatsoever if I were in a relationship or not. I believe this. Although, I can't help but think back to any issue or sad phase I had in the past 7 or 8 years all had one underlying issue. I was alone, jealous, and always wanted to feel what it is like to be in a relationship. I've gone by all this time actually creating issues so I can cover up this deep issue that eats me up inside. I wish I could tell someone in real life that I simply wish I was in one. Just to discuss it. But it is extremely embarrassing. This desire causes such an impact on my life. When I am alone, or especially when I am hanging out with friends. My desire intensifies and I just cannot be around other people especially couples. It hurts too much? 

I realize that I am rambling but Ill bring it all back together in one question. 

TL:DR - I have been working on myself physically and my future is looking really good career wise. What is the next step of this process that is supposed to lead me to a more confident and less insecure being which can lead to a successful and healthy relationship? 

I feel too embarrassed to re-read this post so I apologize for the disorganization and any typos I may have made. 

Thank you


**THE MORNING AFTER**


**Edit/Update**: Hello everyone! I thank you for all of your responses and taking me seriously as I expected quite harsh and negative responses. What's above this edit, this desperation, is how I get at night when I am alone and sometimes overcomes moments when I have serious deadlines and this hinders my progress. Right now I just woke up and feel much better as I do every day, so I am my ""normal"" self now.  This is probably my biggest issue (maybe cognitive behavioral therapy might work?) that has been progressing. These feelings come to me almost like a werewolf.


Now to actually clear up some things and actually get some real progress going here! So, all the issues I have previously posted such as depression, anxiety, ptsd, cancer, etc. Those things have all been gone for quite some time. I am over these things and I have even devoted &amp; developing my career to helping people whether  you have autism or cancer. I also want to say that I definitely do not come off as desperate with anyone. If anything I try my hardest to show lack of interest in that way. Even then, I barely have had any opportunities to even do this last thing. I am pretty isolated with 60-80 hour weeks dedicated to school work, performing, and internships. (more on this below) 


I have come a long way from where I was a few years ago and I am MUCH more confident than I was. This summer I got a great job and was in an entirely new environment. I was basically Raffi for children with cancer and was a great experience. From day one I decided I would act like a better me and it worked great. People who didn't know me thought of me differently as an outgoing happy person. During this time at work I developed some close relationships and if it weren't for the location (I traveled with the children but by car it is $20+ on tolls round trip) and having an inappropriate work relationship around kids I could have easily developed my first serious relationship with someone I was very much interested in. She lived in another state, was starting and leaving for college right after work so I didn't pursue anything.


I believe that I first need more experience creating friends (male AND female) before I can move forward. So far since spring I have been pushing myself slowly to speak more with people. Also, this week I decided to try to text and keep up with people instead of waiting for them to talk to me. This is a terrible habit and I have probably lost some very good friends do to this... along with jealousy of their social/financial life. This is mainly a thing of the past though. 

Yesterday, I decided to go to school and help out my major's club promote for Freshman orientation. My results were surprising. I was out there, trying to reel people in, had conversations, joked around with some people simply based on their last name, ran into some people I had helped out before they auditioned into the program, gave tours, and even a friend said ""Did I just witness you guys becoming best friends?!"". This last one was obviously not happening as the guy I was speaking to just looked away and felt uncomfortable. We did have a lot of mutual interest on a similar topic and I pushed myself to be over excited and enthusiastic talking about it to have more value in a conversation. I even gave the females there hugs and kisses for hellos and goodbyes. Something I would have NEVER had initiated. After yesterday and this summer, I see that I am improving. 

Now that you guys can see the real me hopefully you can see I am not extremely desperate at least on the surface. I am actually a genuinely happy person who feels it is time for me to experience this in my life. I have already moved past so much and I am doing so well right now. 

I would also like to bring back something someone said. Paraphrasing, apparently you guys think I would start a relationship simply for the desire to be in one. This is definitely not the case. I have actually denied several opportunities in the past because I was actually not interested. More so because they were extremely desperate (more like psycho) where one even told me she loved me the first night and the other would almost be in tears and waiting on the floor at the bottom of the stairs if I had gone upstairs to get water. This was something I learned from ruining what might have been a really good relationship. I had tried to end a relationship because I realized it was high school and it would most likely not have been successful. It wasn't that I was interested but I just wanted to hold out our friendship rather than causing a sudden end. Either way, this just ended up on her not speaking to me again. 

Now back to what we were speaking about. Several people mentioned what can I give to a girl in a relationship? This I do not know. Maybe I am a little confused? If it is what I think it is then I can't really offer much. I am very focused on myself right now but I am willing to make some sacrifices. My life revolves around music and being a musician. I am also an avid concert/rave goer. These events keep me sane throughout the school year. I also love parks? I can take her there. All of my male friends are all slowly becoming very experienced in building cars and hopefully eventually racing them. Maybe I can bring her to hang out with them and go to car meets? I dunno. Honestly, If shes not into music or exercise and dieting there's not much I can do on my part. Although, I am more than willing to take part in her interests and hobbies. If she has needs I would like to work on fulfilling them. In all honesty I have no Idea what I am talking about.

Now for my LAST issue I will speak about. Conversations. Once we have spoken about our mutual interests it becomes a real struggle to maintain the conversation. It becomes an interview and I try to feed off what they say but It is quite challenging and does not end successful more often than not. I try using jokes and whatnot. Although, it often seems as if the other person is not trying either. This is improving though and I assume can only be achieved through practice. Maybe I should be looking at my social life as an instrument and I'm preparing for performing a huge concert? haha.

So what would be my next step guys? School returns next week and things could be a fresh start. I think I have already made an impression on a few people who I saw as an outgoing person who has fun while I was trying to reel people into our booth. Should I be just approaching anyone and everyone? Lets say I did, how would I turn this into a developing friendship. I have tried this during concerts trying to create friends by the bar so I can make friends with similar musical interests. I just end up coming off as gay asking or giving people my number so they don't keep in touch or I never receive a text/call. Should I be approaching girls if I simply find them attractive? 

Again, What should be my next step towards the grand prize? 

Thank you and I apologize for how desperate sounding I was last night. I really need to fix that.

1l8p84,3,2013-08-28,How to cope with isolation and steps to take care of myself?,[deleted],BPD,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/1l8p84/how_to_cope_with_isolation_and_steps_to_take_care/," Im in DBT therapy, for the past two years and three different therapists, but have not seen any improvements, and in fact have continued to lose friends over the years. 

I dont hear from friends who have moved away unless i contact them first. I have no more friends from college, and graduated a few months ago. Some of my closest friends ive lost due to BPD... jealousies, rage, feeling betrayed, pushing them away, etc. I miss them dearly but they want nothing to do with me.

 I would write crazy emails to one guy in particular who had been a close friend, telling him how i hate him but that i miss our friendship and how come he became a jerk to me and sorry that i treated him badly because of it. This went on for a year. Finally he recently apologized and told me never email him again, that we will never, ever be friends again.

I live alone, dont have a career, and have a crappy cashier job with customers who treat me like crap. Dont have any friends to hang out with or talk to, dont hear from friends at all, dont know where i can make new friends. 

Having a difficult time staying focused on finding a career and improving my talents and skills for this. Feel increasingly distressed when i do not hear back from potential employers, or am rejected. 

Drinking too much, which makes the depression worse. Feeling more and more like suicide is a reasonable answer, and it has been a ""safety net"" for the past 10 years, thinking if it gets too unbearable to be alone, rageful and dysphoric, that there is a way out.

But i dont want to be a failure, and i miss my friends so much. I dont have any close family, because they are often invalidating toward me, and had been very abusive and neglectful to me growing up.

 I dont know what to do, so mostly i just cry, go to my cashier job, and work on artwork and go to therapy once a week. I'll be starting DBT group therapy soon.

I cant afford to pay my bills or support myself, so my parents send me money and pay my rent, but they have run out of money and i still dont have a career. I never hear from anyone from school, and teachers who had promised me internships never followed through.

I have one friend from school who is married, but is into crazy girls, so i'll visit him maybe once every two weeks for a couple hours or work on projects with him. He has a soft spot for the crazy, and i think he likes the ""protective"" role. His wife doesnt seem to like me, even though i tried to be friendly...or as much as i could muster anyone. Im in a bad place right now.


What are some things i can do to take care of myself and get out of this? "
1l8mlt,12,2013-08-28,So I came out to my parents a week ago...,[deleted],lgbt,https://www.reddit.com/r/lgbt/comments/1l8mlt/so_i_came_out_to_my_parents_a_week_ago/,"...and I have been disowned. I've been a Reddit and r/lgbt lurker for a long time and I finally decided to join and post my story, because I feel I can get some support here. Sorry for the long post, but I'm lost and I need plenty of advice. 

I come from a traditional Hispanic family. I grew up hearing all sorts of anti-gay jokes, comments, insults, what have you, while at the same time knowing I was gay. So basically, I grew up not in denial, but rather in shame of who I was. I've struggled with deep self-hate all of my life. I am now entering my last year of college, and have finally begun to try and accept/like myself. My first step was coming clean. I told two of my closest friends and they were extremely supportive. This summer, I subleased my apt and moved back home because I was broke from the school year (I quit my job to focus on school) and began an unpaid internship. So my parents were helping me out. This year though, my younger brother went off to the east coast for college (I'm from Cali) and my parents went with him to get him settled in. The night before they left, my parents drove me to a friends place so I could crash there for a week while they were away (I had my job, but no driver's license, so I needed to get rides from them, and from another intern for that week). I decided that the car ride was the best time to tell them, because I knew they weren't going to take it well, and I didn't want to get my brother involved (he knows and is extremely supportive). And that they would then have a week of time sans moi to process it. Well it did not go over well. My mother started sobbing and saying that it was a punishment from God and that it was the worst thing I could ever do to her, among other things. My dad was grilling me about how I knew, if my former girlfriend was just all a lie, etc etc. Basically they dropped me off at my friends house bemoaning my sexuality. They were being very offensive and I got extremely angry and hurt and I told them not to talk to me at all. They left the next day, Aug 18, and around this past Thursday I tried getting in touch with them again. No answers from either of them. Not to call/text. I was worried but let it be. I kept trying over the next couple days, and yesterday, I finally got a text back from my mother, and it was my college essay where I had talked about her emotional, physical, and verbal abuse growing up. I did not know she had that, and she was furious over it as well, and she attached a nasty message to it saying hurtful things ending it with how I have basically killed her and how I am a shame to the family and I was not worth the effort she put in raising me. I was not to talk to them anymore, basically. So now I'm crashing my own subleased apt for the time being. But the clincher is that since my internship is unpaid, they were going to front me the 1500 I need to move into my new apt Aug 31, and I was going to pay them back when I got my financial aid in September from my school (I get my schooling paid for in grants and loans cause we're low-income). I've like $300 to my name, and no other family I can rely on/trust. I don't know what to do. Im about to quit my internship and try to find a real job, and sell the furniture I have in my apt to see if I can make it, but I don't think I will. I now feel alone, and unloved and unworthy, and I know it gets better and so on and so forth, but right now I'm at a loss. Have any of you ever been in a situation like this? If so, what did you do, who did you turn to? Are there resources? I don't even know where to start. And how did you guys who were rejected by your parents deal with it? Any advice on how to deal with any of this, I would greatly appreciate it. Thanks r/lgbt! "
1l8k2a,3,2013-08-27,My Story,Rexomnis,NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/1l8k2a/my_story/,"Hey guys! I'm new to this sub, but here's my story:

I'm an ex-WoW player and I have a very dark history of fapping. Being around the computer by yourself for eight hours a day, fapping comes with the territory. I was severely depressed and angry at myself all through high school. 2010, sophomore year in college, living in my fraternity house, I dropped all my classes and just played video games and ""partied."" Wasted about $8000 of my parents money. Also, I was into the worst kinds of porn (that are nonviolent). Darkest time of my life. 

God, somehow, led me out of the valley. I fell in ""love"" with the first girl I ever dated after about two weeks. No sex of any kind, the farthest we got was she slept in my bed topless and me in boxers. I told her how much I liked her and it all went down from there. She said she didn't want to be with me because *she couldn't be with someone that wasn't going anywhere.* That was the single most motivating event of my life. After she broke up with me, I was motivated enough to enlist in the Air National Guard.

In Basic Military Training, you share a bedroom and bathroom with 50 guys. No time for fap. After those 8.5 weeks of nofap and working out everyday, I felt like a superhero. I got a girlfriend and got back into college. I'm 3 semesters from graduating, same girlfriend, and applying for internships and MBA programs. Three years ago, I figured I'd have killed myself by now.

tl;dr Heartbreak can be the best motivation"

1l8eif,90,2013-08-27,The Tale of Ham-Engineer,[deleted],fatpeoplestories,https://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/1l8eif/the_tale_of_hamengineer/,"Gather around anorexic sluts as I divulge with y'all the tale of my unfortunate encounter with this girl who shall be dubbed henceforth as ""Ham-Engineer."" I go to a prestigious, mainly-engineering university...as in, almost all of our buildings are dedicated to engineering, and our population is only 30% girls. This will be important for future stories...

While she did not have small moons orbiting around her perimeter, she had quite the belly. She took care of herself horribly; she wore very ill-fitting and unnecessarily tight clothing that displayed her c^u^u^u^u^u^u^r^v^e^s. She on top had horrendous hygiene...as in she wouldn't shower for days. She always had horrendously frizzy hair (dat anti-frizz shampoo yo, try it!) and a super greasy complexion. If she had a half decent personality I really wouldn't care about her appearance, but unfortunately she displayed all of the symptoms perfectly of what doctors call ""HamBeetus"".

She was your typical, wishful thinking, arrogant nerd, who always tried to show everyone how ""smart"" she was and how she would get a job at a Fortune 500 company when she graduated (GPA: &lt; 2.5 WUT...also, everyone is an engineer at a top-notch school, everyone who got in is smart, would you like a cookie or 10?). Cool, whatever, I could even handle that, I'm used to that mentality. Anywho, here's where the fatlogic comes about.

She had the usual self-entitlement most hamplanets have, thinking her milkshake brings all the boys to the yard, unnecessarily slutty behavior, yadda yadda. She would come home from class and make these 3-5 course meals EVERYDAY and would never, ever clean up after herself, and I mean EVER. I swear dishes would be left in the sink for weeks before she would lift her finger to clean it, or one of us in the apartment would get so sick of not being able to *see* our sink we would do it. You can imagine in our kitchen things got gross real quick. And surprise surprise, she had this ""hands off"" philosophy when it came to cleanliness in her own bedroom and bathroom...it was pretty gross you guys.

Now here's the story on how Ham-Engineer enlightened me on fat logic and how I apparently know nuthin' about fitness after playing competitive tennis throughout middle school and high school:

&gt; Be me, bowdownpeasants, engineering student, 20/5'4''/ ~115 lb. Petite, but thanks to my Puertorican mama I have some humble curves.

&gt; Had been living off campus in a pretty sweet apartment with the bestie, but she got an internship far away for the following semester.

&gt; Instead of looking for a new roommate, I moved on campus to the actually pretty nice student apartments with 3 random roommates.

&gt; Be ChillIndian, 21/5'6''/130 lb,  as the name foretells super chill and fun to hang out with.

&gt; Be PsychoBitch, 21/5'4''/120 lb, she's not very important to the story and I have a bunch of stories about her perhaps more appropriate for another subreddit.

&gt; Don't be Ham-Engineer, also engineering student, 20/5'3''/200 lb and growing...

&gt; Be me in the living room, doing dat statics homework, jamming out to some tunes.

&gt; Be Ham-Engineer, wearing work out clothing two sizes too small, carrying a huge tub of power into the kitchen.

&gt; Me, trying to be polite: So, where are you coming from?

&gt; Ham-Engineer: Oh, I just got back from the gym, I'm trying to lose some weight and get in shape!

&gt; Me, slightly more perky now: That's great Ham-Engineer! What exercise regime are you following?

&gt;Ham-Engineer: I just go on the elliptical for 15 minutes, I don't want to lose my curvalicious body, my boyfriend likes some meat on mah bones.

&gt; Guys, I couldn't make this up if I tried.

&gt; Me: Oh...well what's that you have?

&gt; Ham-Engineer: I just got some yummy chocolate protein powder, now that I'm exercising so much I gotta get in shape ^teehee!

&gt; I had no face. 

&gt; I have friends who religiously drink protein shakes to bulk up, but they're swole as fuck, and are at the gym 2-3 hours a day (your typical college meatheads)

&gt; Me: Uhhh, Ham-Engineer, do you really think it's best to be loading up on protein powder when you just started working out? Maybe when you see a little weight loss it would be a better idea to do it then.

&gt; Ham-Engineer: No bowdownpeasants if I don't get protein my muscles won't recover properly and I'll hurt myself, anyone who has taken a basic health class knows that!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 

&gt; She then proceeded to put three scoops in milk with half a pint of vanilla ice cream to make a milkshake.

&gt; Afterwards she heats up 7 frozen mozzarella sticks as a quick, after workout snack.

&gt; She's not going to make it guys

TL;DR: Ham-Engineer gives me a ""lesson"" on proper fitness by basically walking on an elliptical for 15 minutes and ingesting calorie dense protein powder.

Welp, that was my little nugget of Ham-Engineer's fat logic. I have more stories to tell, but try not to raise your blood sugar levels too much in anticipation, shawty's gotta full course load so I'll try and write when I can."

I told him to mention my name in the cover letter and there's a chance he might get in but only after several interviews. 

However, I was thinking it over and I realized, I probably shouldn't work with a friend. What if something happens to our friendship because of work? What if he's under-qualified and I recommended him? He didn't even read the job description and wrote a bunch of random stuff in the cover letter as to why he wanted the job.

At my college, they have an internship program for 12 credits that lasts either from Spring to Summer, or Summer to Fall. In the program, you do the internship over the summer and during ONE semester of the school year, while being considered a full time student (the 12 credits + 1 online course). 

Due to missing one semester at school (internship rather than classes), this will greatly implicate my living arrangements for the remainder of this school year. I have a lease that lasts for the next two semesters. It also complicates living arrangements for next year, as I will be left with my final semester without a housing lease.

My questions are...

How long do internships generally last?
Would I be okay to find an internship without participating in the school program?
Can I find an internship that is from June - late August? (so I don't miss a semester)

I understand internships are very important for finding a job after graduation, so I really want to make it happen. However, I don't know that it will be worth missing a semester of school for it (even though I am getting credits).

I've been depressed for a long time... Recently, I thought things were starting to change.  Although my depression is getting worse,  I am starting to get treatment, I have a great internship.... But now I'm losing everything.

Today checked my tuition costs-- $4300 by October 11th. I thought it was going to be a $1000 cheaper but one month sooner, so that didn't stress me out too much. Then I got an email from my landlord-- my lease is up month earlier than I thought, in November. I still live with my dad. He's planning to move an hour further away from school by car (I already commute 3+ hours a day by bus) and I simply cannot afford the time to take the bus or the cash for a car. I can't live there anymore, and he is refusing to stay in city.

So now, I'm losing all the money I worked so hard to gain (no way to reduce my tuition, I've got to take 15 credits and do well to 1. Stay in uni and 2. Get fin aid back), and I'm losing my house again.  

When depression gets hard, I lose the ability to focus on anything... Right now I'm at work, in the bathroom, just trying to collect my self for the next 4 hours.  How am I supposed to focus right now?  My world is falling apart.  I need to get a second job and maybe a third.  I've got to start getting a GPA in the high 3's if I want to have a chance at going into medicine.  All of this pressure and uncertainty... How do I deal with it?

I recently graduated from a top 5 school.

First month:

-I was hired under the impression that I would have a senior staff member guiding me, as well as to complete the job duties listed

-Boss promised me health benefits as soon as I started, but there were no bylaws or contract or anything. Boss told me it wasn't important, and I didn't want to bother my boss, so I didn't ask any questions.

-I was told only to work on high paying clients, and that I would work on other clients later (our clients pay monthly)


Second-Third Month:
-Boss left his for a few weeks, and left his &lt;5 person company, to go on vacation. Nobody left in charge. No structure on what to do.

-I brought up insurance again, and boss said to not bother about it because boss had other things to do.

-Kept on saying that I should not be asking so many questions, because of my education. My education has nothing to do with not having a password or information for something.

-Was somewhat made fun of because I like and do ""nerdy"" things

Fourth Month:

-I started to feel uncomfortable with the tasks I had to do, nearly none were the ones I was originally hired for.

-I asked about health insurance, bylaws and contracts again, and was told I was crossing a line for continually asking for it.

-I was told not to work on low paying clients, never having worked on them, and just focus on those that paid us the most. This made me feel very uncomfortable, because we offer a monthly service to them promising that we would do certain things for them, and that wasn't getting done. I was the only person doing the job for a company that paraded itself like a giant firm.

-I was told to tell clients that we had finished certain tasks for them, when that was never the case

-Boss wanted me to ask clients to pay us more money, on top of the monthly payment.

-I gave my two weeks notice when boss would still not give health insurance, bylaws, etc. I stated my reasons were not having a senior employee helping me, which was implied in the job posting, and that I only worked on one kind of client type, which was also the opposite of what was told in the beginning.


Yesterday:

-My friend called pretending to be asking for a reference, and my boss said that I was young, immature, took 6 sick days, and that my quality of work was low. This is defaming me, because I worked from home during the 6 ""sick"" days (which I only stayed at home because he didn't want to get sick so he said explicitly not to come in), and I was always trying to be professional and my boss was the one that wanted to be friends with me. I worked as hard as I could, but I was the only one doing the work that our clients hired us to do, and with ~20 clients, what was I supposed to do by myself? I asked for help, I asked for maybe an intern, but I kept on getting shot down because ""don't complain, this is such a chill job"". My boss also said that I ""just left"", when in reality I gave a two week notice, but told me to leave right away.


I wish I could sue, but the fees aren't worth it. I quit wanted to get rid of this poisonous job, but my boss keeps on asking my former coworkers what I am doing. But what do I do if I want to find another fulltime job? Leave it off my damn resume? I mean, I would love to, but if they do a background check, I would have to tell them that yeah, I had a job relevant to this field? Like FUCK. I just hate this shitty situation so much. The thing is, it's not even just me feeling this way at this small company. The other employees (not doing work directly for our clients) are secretly looking for other work as well, I just got the shittiest end of the stick because I quit first. I had to quit without another job, just because I couldn't handle not having any structure, being asked to do random tasks at odd hours at the night (with no overtime, because no policies or anything), and being told I wasn't doing enough work when I was doing all the damn work, and I was told off for needed to go see a doctor BEFORE WORK for an emergency procedure (causing me to not even be late for work at all).

UGH. What do I do now? Like, god damn it all."

Aiming for a Comp-Sci degree at SJSU and was hoping to get an idea of which community college in the area would be the best to transfer from into SJSU.

-DeAnza seems to be the consensus ""best"" CC in the area. Highest UC transfer rate and superior student support and resources. But it's heavily impacted and it's very hard to get into classes for popular fields like computer science. Also, it's on the quarter system calendar.

SJCC: operates on the semester system just like SJSU, so classes might transfer over easier. Located centrally, easy to get via public transit.

Which CC would you recommend for a smooth transfer to SJSU as well opportunities like internships &amp; jobs? I guess I'm leaning towards SJCC because it'll be very close to where I live as opposed to DeAnza which is close to a 1 hour bus commute(one way) away. But if the opportunities are lopsided in favor of DeAnza, then I'd be ok with going there too

Thanks."

I ripped this next bit from my pcpartpicker listing:

After using my laptop for three years in college, I wanted to upgrade to something that had more storage and the ability to run all of my games at the highest settings. I'm a Computer Graphics Tech student so I use Maya, Photoshop, After Effects, and other suites frequently. Having this available when the lab is full is really nice, as well as heavy gaming. I had a paid internship so I saved a little chunk off to the side to build this computer. I changed the components many times and it still ended up pretty close to the budget that I set. This was my first time building a computer so I did a lot of research and got advice from some friends who had built their own. So far I'm extremely pleased at the performance that my machine has given me.

Thoughts on each part:

CPU: Works great. Haven't overclocked yet but might just a tad in the future. I was going to get ivy bridge but there was a combo on Newegg that made going LGA1150 $80 cheaper. Way faster than my i7 Q 720 in my laptop.

CPU Cooler: Works great. Didn't really want to go up to water cooling because I probably won't need it. The TPC-612 is basically a Hyper 212 Evo sized version of the TPC-812 so it doesn't take up as much space.

Mobo: Was going to go with MSI but the combo made going with ASRock the better option. It's been great so far and everything was easy to install to it. The only thing that's a bit odd is that extra fan plugs are just about right in the middle of the board so if you want a clean look and want more fans that might be a nuisance.

RAM: Works like a charm. OC'd it to 1866 with the presets in the UEFI settings. It's also blue. Very blue.

GPU: Was going to get a 660 TI before the 700 series was announced. I'm very glad that I stepped up to the 770. I can play just about everything on ultra settings on a 1080p monitor @ 60 fps. Turned down a few filters in Metro 2033 but everything looks beautiful. The GeForce experience app that you can download makes it easy to get the most out of your graphic configuration with games that are recognized. It also renders video previews in After Effects much faster. Not quite full speed with uncompressed 4k but it's awesome with everything else.

Case: Sexy. Cable routing is very easy and workable. Very solid build too. The airflow is pretty good and the compartment at the bottom is a nice feature. Just about everything is modular too so you can take off the front panels with your fingers or change position of the hard drive bays. I turned them 90 degrees so that the fans face in rather than sideways (how it was shipped.) The fans are also very nice and the white LEDs add a nice touch.

SSD: Fast as hell. Boots to desktop in about 8 seconds.

HDD: Really fast. Loads my games very quickly and runs CS6 great.

PSU: It does its job. I know it's a bit overkill for this system but I got it during a pretty good promotion which made it cheaper than the 750W.

Disk Drive: It installed Windows. I think I burned a CD on it once.

OS: Windows 8 isn't that bad. I put on StartIsBack and it's just like your cozy old Win7. I like the way it organized the explorer and it's also a lot faster.

Monitors: Yes, I bought two Acers for $2. A friend's company IT guy was upgrading to new monitors so they were basically giving the old ones away. 1080p &amp; 60Hz. Can't complain.

Other peripherals were ones I previously owned.

The building process went very smoothly as I watched several how-to videos and read guides beforehand. I'm very happy with this build and I'm proud of my new work/(but mostly)play rig. I ran 3DMark but I forgot what the score was. It was at least 9100 or something but haven't really tried to stress out the capabilities of it fully just yet. The original color scheme for the innards was going to be black and blue, but ended up black and gold (except for the RAM anyway.) It still works though. heh.

This site was very helpful in guiding me on what parts to get and how to balance a build out. So yeah, that's it. Thanks for looking!"
1lcrbg,5,2013-08-29,Good lipsticks for work?,MukLukDuck,MakeupAddiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/MakeupAddiction/comments/1lcrbg/good_lipsticks_for_work/,"Hi /r/makeupaddiction! /r/beauty had some awesome recommendations, but they also suggested I post my question here. So here goes:

I'm starting an internship next week at a non-profit in DC. Dress code is business casual. I usually don't wear much makeup because I like to sleep in late, but I figure for this internship I should try to look fairly presentable. I've got most of my (fairly neutral, natural) makeup look figured out, but I'm stuck on lip color. I hate hate hate most, if not all, lip glosses because I don't like my lips to be super shiny and definitely not sticky or shimmery, although I'm open to ones that don't fall into those three categories :) I'm mainly looking for something that will look good with a fairly natural beauty look, isn't super expensive, and will look normal on my abnormally large lips. Can y'all help?? I'm open to color recommendations and/or brands if you can think of anything! For context, I have dark brown curly hair, age 21, fair to medium skin (erring on the side of fair) with I think yellow undertones?, grayish green eyes. Thank you for any help you can offer!"

With the nature of the technology and the appearance of a new RC crash video popping up online from time to time, we have spent the last 3 years focused on the safety of our systems, which inspires a big part of the Tech's job.

Some of the Tech Intern's responsibilities include:

 - Performing system checks before all flights
 - Programming/fine-tuning flight controls and modifying the system for specific shoot requirements
 - Working with other techs to develop new technology using our resources (our current tech just finished the final touches on his own custom system that will be premiered on a set next week).
 - Working with us on high profile productions and learning the workflow necessary to safely fly a multirotor in high stress environments.

Applicant must be extremely fluent with RC technology, knowledgable of the industry and have a working knowledge of engineering and electronics. Needs to be able to work well and think quickly under pressure.

Ideal candidate has an engineering background:

- ability to write code (not exactly write a new flight controller but could program an arduino)
- soldering is a must, from power distribution cabling to header pins on a circuit board or replacing discrete components (within reason)
- familiarity with setting up flight controllers, motors, escs, batteries, etc
- troubleshooting and ability to learn new systems quickly

This is a paid internship position, depending on the depth of your experience.

Should I hide my gpa and add my highschool info?

Does the formatting look to much like a template?

My work experience descriptions could use a redo but I am having a difficult time thinking of anything I achieved there.

Should I shorten the technical skills section?

Any other criticism is welcome!

I bring you once more another little translation. I have been following theses series for quite some time now, and I have got to say, it is written in the most beautiful way boxing can be written. It is poetic, elegant, classy, all of it. They come from Gerardo Pereyra, also called ""El Profe"" (The Teacher), who is Lucas Matthysse's strength and fitness trainer. He tells the tales of Lucas Matthysse's experience in Indio, California. 

So first, I would like to acknowledge him, and thank him (all credit goes to Gerardo Pereyra, writer of the article. Thank you, Gerardo). If it receives many upvotes and shit, I'll definitely translate some more, I'm on vacation, and I'm starting an internship soon, so I got some free time.

Perhaps many followers that were anxiously waiting my words on the sparring session with Tim Bradley may feel a bit empty with this new journal entry. I will try my best to take you out of your misery/boredom. 

We started our gym session in a chain gym called ""24 hour fitness sport"", whose accomodations were checked thoroughly the previous day. 

After an aerobic warm up that consisted of flexibility and mobility, we started our training on strength with medicine balls (heavy balls that ""bounce"", combined with other exercises. We agreed with Lucas on the objectives and details of these exercises, those spheres must bounce against a large wall made out of wood. 

http://campeonesenelring.com.ar/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/DSC07773.jpg

When Lucas started working vigorously, said wall attracts a lot of attention, due to the constant noise of the bouncing. In a gym as big as this one, and surrounded by all the team, it was inevitable that we attracted some curious people. Witnessing the violent impacts - and unkown to some - the questions began to rain on Marcos. He, too, looked surprise. ""Ohhh Maathyssssss!"" ""Yes, great fighter!"", said one of them. Then some pictures were taken, and hurried hands seeking to shake them with Lucas. 

http://campeonesenelring.com.ar/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/DSC07741.jpg

On the way back, one more time, the filming lens belonging to Showtime came upon our existance. It seems that their objective was an interview with Lucas and their intent, to film some sort of ""goodbye"", that should be ""acted"" by our team. In that moment, and without losing my friendliness, my simpathy easily dissappeared in me, losing all trails. 

http://campeonesenelring.com.ar/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/DSC08056.jpg

Lunch and then a break. The afternoon session is programmed and called ""hands"". We came back to the precincts led by ""Tono"" Diaz, Joel Diaz's brother, and trainer of Tim Bradley, and the surprise was immediate. The accomodations, of whom were highly spoken of, seemed, well, small. There were many, many boxers training, and with kids aged around 7, in addition to the fans, sympathizers, and a great amount of cameras and mobile phones eager to take many images of Lucas.

In the middle of all of this clutter, the protagonist begins his warm up and enters the ring, the one that ""Tono"" Diaz reserved for him. He looks a bit uncomfortable, yet indifferent. Again, one thousand eyes, made out of flashes, began to aim at him. With ""Cuty"" (head trainer of Lucas), we decided that we could not continue like this. And one mire time, I was in charge of telling the people that we did not wish to be filmed. Only professional photographers, and only pictures would be ok.  

I was never disrespectful, but thinking of Lucas' comfort, my sympathy had one more time, escaped from my mind. 

On other news:

It seems that Diego Chaves is definitely making a comeback on December.

Jesus Cuellar (the guy that beat Marrero) will make his first defense in 2014, against Ponce de Leon or Johnny Gonzalez in Argentina. 

Marcos Maidana is travelling to Oxnard next week, along with his little brother, Fabian ""El Chinito"" Maidana, who will seek to make his pro debut.

Thank you all. If you have any questions regarding Lucas Matthysse, Marcos Maidana, Jesus Cuellar, or any other argentinean fighter, let me know."

Questions|Answers
:--|:--
[How long was the development of the game?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1l98rg/im_the_creative_director_for_shelter_the/cbx20yu?context=5)|I think my first source of inspiration was an old german childrens show called ""Fablernas värld (in swedish)"" ([Link to www.youtube.com](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfrkKqu7OVs)) But of course the mood and setting of Watership Down. ""Where the Wild Things Are"" has also been an inspiration. We also watched a lot of nature documentaries during development (an honorably mention to David Attenborough). When it comes to games we played a lot of games with a much slower pace that focused on non-combat. Journey, Proteus, Dear Esther, for example.
[Were there other kinds of animals that you thought about using for the game? Why badgers?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1l98rg/im_the_creative_director_for_shelter_the/cbx20yu?context=5)|We started developing the game in January this year. So we've been working on it for about eight months.  I talked a bit about why we chose badgers here: [Link to www.reddit.com](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1l98rg/im_the_creative_director_for_shelter_the/cbwzmhr)
[I was really curious why you chose badgers, but the link you gave me doesn't seem to answer that. Could you check again that it's right?  EDIT: I found the right link! Link to www.reddit.com.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1l98rg/im_the_creative_director_for_shelter_the/cbx36ua?context=5)|Thank you for your question! Sorry for giving you the wrong link. I've PM'd you with a Shelter Steam code.
[1.Rails or open world?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1l98rg/im_the_creative_director_for_shelter_the/cbwyfdo?context=5)|The game is level based, so it has a rather linear progression. Although each area is quite large so there's a lot of exploration beside the main track.
[2.Can you please tell me average time needed to complete a game?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1l98rg/im_the_creative_director_for_shelter_the/cbwyfdo?context=5)|The play time depends a lot on what kind of player you are. It's takes about 1,5 - 2 hours to run through it. But as I sad there's a lot of exploration, so if you want to experience everything it can take much longer. It also depends on how well you're taking care of your cubs.
[No saves?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1l98rg/im_the_creative_director_for_shelter_the/cbwyfdo?context=5)|The game automatically save your progress after each area.
[Thank you. Right now I'm playing your game and get a deep pleasure from the process.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1l98rg/im_the_creative_director_for_shelter_the/cbx1vg5?context=5)|Thank you for you questions! I've PM'd you a steam code you can give away to a friend.
[How did you go about recording the badger sounds/calls?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1l98rg/im_the_creative_director_for_shelter_the/cbwzmaf?context=5)|Our Sound Designer studied how badgers sound and communicate with each other, and then cut, pitched and mixed different kind of animals to make them sound like real badgers. I'm not sure, but I don't think we have any sounds from an actual badger in the game.
[I love how you allow the player to become immersed in the world by hearing only the ambient forest sounds and intermittent squeaking of the badger cubs and only use actual music for certain instances.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1l98rg/im_the_creative_director_for_shelter_the/cbx2lef?context=5)|Thank you very much! I'm glad you liked it.
 |I've PM'd you a Steam Code.
[What made you decide to go small? What are the things that you learned in the big companies that a small indie guy doesn't know?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1l98rg/im_the_creative_director_for_shelter_the/cbwzmhr?context=5)|I personally wanted to try to have a much broader responsibility. As an indie you to have to make everything by your self most of the time (as I sad in my post: everything from marketing to planning your own work). You also have a much larger creative freedom. There's also a much broader scope on your own development. As an example, I was a Level Designer for Just Cause 2 and Fable III, and responsible for 4-5 levels over the course of several years (especially for Just Cause 2). I continued working as a Level Designer when developing Pid, where I created the foundation for all 124 level by my self during the first year.
 |I think a really useful thing I learned as a AAA-developer was to time box my own work. Overrating how long certain aspects of development take can really break the game (as well as yourself). I've also learned to develop my tasks to a specific standard, and then move on to the next. Instead of taking to much time to develop incredible detail. If you finish everything in before your deadline, you can always go back to the places where you want to add aditional polish. Time is a truly importaint resource that I think some indies (generally) tend to under estimate.

 |Thank you for you questions! I've PM'd you a steam code.
[Which artist do you think inspired for the visual aspects of the game?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1l98rg/im_the_creative_director_for_shelter_the/cbx0kac?context=5)|We're artistically inspired by many different artists. The patterns largest inspiration was old japanese art. Everything from paper craft to old heraldry.
 |The color palette largest inspiration was water color.

[Did you have a team before the leap?  Fow how long did you think about going indie?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1l98rg/im_the_creative_director_for_shelter_the/cbwzqky?context=5)|My leap from AAA to indie wasn't a truly active one. I actually moved from Lionhead back to Stockholm for personal reasons, and got an proposition from Might &amp; Delight which I couldn't refuse soon after that. Although I'd thought about it for several years before that, but just waited for the right moment. I was really lucky that M&amp;D had a stable economy before I started, cause I'm not sure if I would have skipped a really nice job, with a decent salary to create indie games without having an income. For me it would've been a too long leap, but I truly admire people who does it.

[The game looks excellent, I plan on buying it ASAP.  I hope it's a huge success on Steam for you guys.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1l98rg/im_the_creative_director_for_shelter_the/cbwzz2m?context=5)|Hi! Thank you very much! I hope you'll like it!
[My question:  Why did you guys choose badgers?  What was your second choice/runner up?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1l98rg/im_the_creative_director_for_shelter_the/cbwzz2m?context=5)|The only thing we were sure of in the early concept development was that we didn't want to create a player avatar that resembled other games, as well as we wanted an animal that was kind of low and fat, as it made the animation work much easier. I think our first prototype was an animal that more resembled a pig then a badger. Although we wanted it to feel more wild then domestic, so I gave the suggestion to make them badgers. Personally badgers have always been close to my heart. I remember when I was 7-9 years old my old elementary teacher gave all the children in my class a post card with an animal after each years graduation. Every year each children got a post card with a different animal, everyone except me who got a badger every year. This wasn't the reason we chosed badgers, but since it fit our profile so well we went with it.
[Bonus question:  What game are you guys developing next?  Anything in the works?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1l98rg/im_the_creative_director_for_shelter_the/cbwzz2m?context=5)|I've also gained a lot of grey hair lately, so it fits me pretty well :)
[Are you using Unity?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1l98rg/im_the_creative_director_for_shelter_the/cbwykat?context=5)|Yes! It's 100% made in Unity. Just as our previous game Pid.
 |Thank you for you questions! I've PM'd you a steam code.
[Since you have experience from major games, do you feel the pacing of creating your own has changed how you approach game development?  Working with a major developer with a tight schedule got shit done but you probably sacrificed a lot of 'what could have been' within the game to keep the progress moving. What is one of those biggest what could have beens or some type of system you always wanted to see fleshed out?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1l98rg/im_the_creative_director_for_shelter_the/cbx3kgu?context=5)|I don't know if the pacing has changed, as you're still very bound to create something within set boundaries as an indie (economical, tight deadlines, etc). Although my understanding and admoration for different roles in game development has changed a lot. Both because you'll work much closer to all the different disciplines, but also because your own responsebility becomes much broader. I answered to something similar here: [Link to www.reddit.com](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1l98rg/im_the_creative_director_for_shelter_the/cbwzmhr)
[I mean I'm sure creatively you have even more say and more ability to mold what the end vision is, but do you find that working with an almost abstract idea can confine your play ability and how you see the world around you in the game?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1l98rg/im_the_creative_director_for_shelter_the/cbx3kgu?context=5)|Your questions are very deep, but I'll try to answer them as good as I can. Please respond if you want to follow up or clarify something.  Our creative process almost always start by defining boundaries within we want to work. Initially they are dependent on how the team looks like. For example during Pid we only had one artist, so we knew that if we wanted to fulfill our vision we had to simplify the graphics in some way. Which ended up us removing all textures in the game (hence the quite unique look). We did something similar in Shelter, but decided to go the other way and remove all lighting. Decisions like these created a tight frame that we had to work within. We couldn't create gameplay that involved real-time shadows in Shelter for example (except for the bird, which is a texture). Or gameplay that involved textures in Pid.  There's always things in a game you create that you want to polish or flesh out more if you had the time. I worked as a Level Designer for my mayor releases, so the process looks a bit different compared to system designers for example. As a Level Designer the last thing you do on a level is decorating, which you do when everything else is finished, and you can continue to do it forever.
[I bought the game for a friend because it ""looked cute"" and ""badgers are the best"" and have some questions! Why a game about badgers? What inspired you all to make the game?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1l98rg/im_the_creative_director_for_shelter_the/cbx0phh?context=5)|I've answer to why we chose to make it about badgers here: [Link to www.reddit.com](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1l98rg/im_the_creative_director_for_shelter_the/cbwzz2m)
 |I think our main source of inspiration was that we wanted to create something completely different. Both something anyone in the studio hasn't worked on before, but also a game that most players hasn't experienced. We were also very axious to try to create a (somewhat) non-combat oriented and emotional titel. As Pid was very focused on game mechanics, we wanted to create something that touched more ""softer"" variables like exploration and adventuring.
 |Thank you for your question! I've PM'd you a Steam Code so you can experience the game yourself.
[How much time did you _actually_ spend in the forest while making this game? :\)  (Judging by Link to www.youtube.com at least a few hours?\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1l98rg/im_the_creative_director_for_shelter_the/cbx2ogs?context=5)|Being borned and raised in central Stockholm, I'm actually not much of a nature-guy myself. But we had to take a few hours walk while filming that dev diary. But that's about it, I'm afraid. Although we did watch a lot of documentaries about the wild.
[Hey Johannes, the game looks really cool I can't wait to play it. I have two questions, my first is about the art style, I get a very story book/ popup book feel from Shelter, is that what you guys were going for? Also I love the idea of a survival game where you are trying to keep yourself and others alive, was that the idea from the beginning or did you add the children later in development?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1l98rg/im_the_creative_director_for_shelter_the/cbx1zke?context=5)|I wrote an answer regarding the art-style here: [Link to www.reddit.com](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1l98rg/im_the_creative_director_for_shelter_the/cbx0kac)
 |The original design for the game was an adventure, but we added the children really early. Probably within the first weeks of designing. I think that was really necessary since we base most of the mechanics in the game around the children. If we added them later we would probably have to redesign a lot of things.
[I just finished playing through the game and loved it! I have just one question: is there only one ending?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1l98rg/im_the_creative_director_for_shelter_the/cbx2vpr?context=5)|Thank you! I'm happy you liked it. The game focuses a lot on only one journey, so there's only one real ending. Although it can change a bit depending on how you managed you cubs.
 |Did you see the clip after the credits? :)
[Yes! I loved it! I managed to make it out with three on my first playthrough.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1l98rg/im_the_creative_director_for_shelter_the/cbx4d86?context=5)|Thank you! I've PM'd you a steam code you can give away to a friend.
[Hej!  How has your experience as an indie developer been since leaving a AAA company? Is having more control over your projects worth having a team of only seven people?  Do you think you would ever go back to AAA development?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1l98rg/im_the_creative_director_for_shelter_the/cbx184g?context=5)|Hej!
 |I answered to something similar here: [Link to www.reddit.com](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1l98rg/im_the_creative_director_for_shelter_the/cbwzmhr)
 |I think there's a tight balance between good and bad things when comparing indie development to AAA. It's worth it since I've learned A LOT that I don't think I'd learned if I still worked with AAA. But it would probably be the other way around as well. Just as I can't say that it's better to work with indie, or the other way around.
 |If I know myself I will probably go back to AAA one day, then back to Indie, then back to AAA again, back and forth forever :)
[Is there any possibility to download/buy the main menu song?

They created all the music in both Shelter and Pid, and we're really proud to be working with them. We're currently discussing how we want to distribute the music, but unfortunatly we haven't made a decission yet. My best bet is to like Retro Family on facebook and keep an eye open for any news. It shouldn't take too long hopefully. Here's a link:[Link to www.facebook.com](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Retro-Family/217644004933997)

[What do you find is the biggest obstacle for releasing a game like this, where you can't really appeal to the type gamers?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1l98rg/im_the_creative_director_for_shelter_the/cbx0vyz?context=5)|When creating a niche game like Shelter we've always knew it wouldn't appeal to everyone. I'm not sure I see it as an obstacle, as it's more interesting to create niche titles then trying to satisfy everyone. Although when taking into account that a majority of gamers might not be interested in the game, you have to create it with a very tight budget to match the (possible) low income. Which of course effects the final product. I'm afraid I don't have any real experience with it, but I can understand the problem. I think that game and game culture still is in a very young state. Especially gamers. But the medium age of a gamer is constantly growing, so hopefully we will see a future soon where ""everyone"" play games, just as ""everyone"" watches movies or listen to music. This will also create a market for a much wider array of different use for games. I believe that there's a bright future for serious games (Research games, educational games, rehabilitating games, etc). But we're unfortunately not there yet. I think what your father does is admirable, and hopefully something that we will see much more of in the future.
[My dad is an artist who has worked on video games, and recently is working on a game made possible by a grant from the gates foundation, and it's about researching how video games can help people learn, and researching the relationship between video games and adult success. But he doesn't think the game will do very well because they can't find trained, skilled, committed workers to do the things they need. Most of the workers all have other jobs, and try and get unpaid interns and college students to do most of the work, which is great experience for them, but the game suffers because of it. Have you experienced anything like that?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1l98rg/im_the_creative_director_for_shelter_the/cbx0vyz?context=5)|Hi! Yes we actually got a review from buckys5thquarter.com ([Link to www.buckys5thquarter.com](http://www.buckys5thquarter.com/2013/8/26/4658592/shelter-badgers-video-game-review)) which was really great!

[Do you find it easier or harder to work on a game with a simpler, low poly aesthetic? And did you find Unity to be an accommodating engine for what you were trying to do?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1l98rg/im_the_creative_director_for_shelter_the/cbx43aj?context=5)|The simplicity and low poly aesthetic doesn't really change the development from a designers perspective. Although it helps since it takes a much shorter amount of time for our artists to create and modify our assets, which also speeds up the design production and can make iterations really short. Although working on a game that didn't have lighting (baked or real-time), as well as dialogue, HUD, man made structures (as easy recognisable landmarks) or quest system, made it really difficult to create a good player guidance. Which is a really important part of Level Designing. I think Unity is a great tool for game development. Specielly for smaller studios that can't realy on in-house tools. I can totally recommend it!
 |Thank you for you questions! I've PM'd you a steam code.
[I am a bit confused by your game concept, kinda like the endless forest?  I ask in all honesty, what is the appeal (designed appeal\) of your game? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1l98rg/im_the_creative_director_for_shelter_the/cbx0vl2?context=5)|I think Shelter differs quite a bit from The Endless Forest. It's a level based single player adventure with it's own designed narative. Where The Endless Forest is purely multiplayer and draws much of its appeal from the player community. The setting might seem a bit similar, but gameplay wise I think they are two completely different games.
[How hard was it to leave the big companies and start making indie games?

Unfortunately I can't give you a straight answer right now other than that we're definitely discussing it. I think we have to see how Shelters reception will be, and then decide whether we port it to other platforms.
 |I've PM'd you a Steam Code. Hope you have a PC or a Mac so your can try it out any ways.
[Any chance of the game ever getting a multiplayer update? Maybe one team is trying to defend the cubs and another team is trying to catch them.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1l98rg/im_the_creative_director_for_shelter_the/cbx2ykl?context=5)|The game needs a lot of rework if we want to create a multiplayer mode, so I'm afraid it's not in the pipeline at the moment. We want to focus on creating smaller games, but releasing them more frequent. And creating a single player game with a multiplayer mode is unfortunatly too much work for our small team at the moment. Although we have losely talked that we might want to create some kind of sequel in the future if people like Shelter, which might include (or focus on) multiplayer. So stay tuned and fingers crossed!

[You ARE including ""The Badger Song"" as the easter egg somewhere, right?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1l98rg/im_the_creative_director_for_shelter_the/cbx0lvr?context=5)|Of course. Just as there are sharks in Just Cause. But unfortunately, no ones gonna find it.
[Working with such a diverse gallery of professionals as you do on the videogames industry, what can you say that is your most cherised memory of what you learnt by working with them?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1l98rg/im_the_creative_director_for_shelter_the/cbx01f9?context=5)|Having worked quite a while now I have more cherised memories then I can remember. One in particular is an argument/discussion I had with one of the game designers at Avalanche while developing Just Cause 2. I wanted Rico (the main character) to be able to move while shooting with the minigun, but the designer thought it would be to over powered. I was designing a level that focused a lot on the minigun. Hence my strong oppinion. We had a long discussion about it and in the end he drew seniority on my, so I had to back off. That discussion, even if it was really minor, will haunt me for the rest of my life. I still believe I was right :) Another moment I cherish was sitting next to Peter Molyneux on a Lionhead christmas dinner, but instead of talking about games (which would be the most natural topic, i guess) we discussed family issues, and the lack of time we had to play games now days. He is a really great and lovable guy.
[What were the bigget challenges outside of actual game production as an AAA gone rogue? Marketing, social media, licensing, etc.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1l98rg/im_the_creative_director_for_shelter_the/cbx0l1y?context=5)|I think our biggest challenge unfortunately has been an economical one. I believe we have a really good relationship with the press and our fans through social medias. But we're still very dependent on reaching out to a large market and people buying our product. Having a much lower wage than average (AAA) game developers is manageable, but the stress of not knowing if the studio survives the coming year is really hard to deal with. This is of course from a personal perspective.
[How do you stay creative and come up with fresh ideas?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1l98rg/im_the_creative_director_for_shelter_the/cbxi1a6?context=5)|I think a good way to stay creative is to broaden your inspirational sources. I believe that it can be hurtful for a medium as a whole if everyone's just looking for inspiration within their own medium. When creating games I rather be inspired by other things than just games. Like books, music and film. Everyday scenarios can also be a source of inspiration, as well as political views and philosophical ideas.

We're not discussing additional content at the office right now, but if people want it we'll certainly consider it.

After a dismal semester before the start of summer, it was exactly what I needed. I landed a fantastic internship that both helped me cement my love and appreciation for the Sys Admin occupation as well as improving my personal confidence

I met two of the greatest people, one who happened to be my boss and another gorgeous and extremely kind 40 year old woman (fellow co-worker) who I would marry in a heart beat if I could. My boss treated me like a human being, wanted to hang out outside of work, and generally made me feel like I was a friend more than just a subordinate. He also taught me a lot about networks, databases, and how to basically keep a multinational company running. The 40 year old, who has one of the best personalities I have come across, had some great life inspiring conversations with me. She really helped me work through a weird phase in my life. I feel much more confident, happy, and ready to take on whatever life throws at me. I'm only 23, but my god what I wouldn't do to be with her or at least a woman like her.

In addition, I finally had a chance to work on my fitness and health by taking daily bike rides. Sometimes as far as 25 to 30 miles a day! That may not seem high to some people, but compared to what I was doing it feels like a major step up for me. I look and feel 100x better. 

This Friday marks the end of my internship, and effectively my summer. I honestly can't think of a better way to have spent these past 3 months. Some like taking trips, some like lounging around, but this summer was perfect to me. I'm legitimately depressed it has to come to an end. 

Such is life though, I just hope I keep this personal momentum going and I stay in touch with the two people I mentioned above. They are great people and I need those positive influences in my life. 

Thanks for reading!

1lbaem,5,2013-08-29,Advice Request: HR - How do I know when my chances are shot and when should I give up on a city?,[deleted],advertising,https://www.reddit.com/r/advertising/comments/1lbaem/advice_request_hr_how_do_i_know_when_my_chances/,"So I've just finished an internship at a big agency. I interned in Account Management and of the account interns only a few of us were graduated and looking for jobs. nearing the end of the internship I was talking with the other and they had mentioned getting interviews with different departments and stuff. I contacted HR, but they told me that since my supervisor hadn't submitted a summer eval, they couldn't do anything. Understandable.

I had tried to keep in contact with the HR and see what I could do about ful time positions after the internship, but mostly I was just ignored. They told me that they wouldn't know about open positions until October when they do their budget analysis, but I learned that the other graduated acct interns had already been offered full time positions which flustered me a bit more than I already was. Even still I tried to politely inquire about my position and status in the hiring pool - nothing. I attributed it to just busy schedules, but Im thinking its probably otherwise..

It's now been a few weeks after the end of the internship and I havent heard anything at all. I did hear though that an intern at a complete other agency in the city was offered a full time position at my agency which is really just salt on the wound.

I think its quite obvious the agency isn't interested in me at all, but If that's the case would they just tell me so?? I've been applying for full time positions at any other agency I can as well, but I know it's nearly impossible getting an offer without a contact... and the few contacts I have in this city, I feel maybe i've been a bit too desperate and they've probably blacklisted me as well.

Am I just being too paranoid/melodramatic? Can anyone who knows the hiring process be able to shed some possible light onto my situation? I would really appreciate it. seriously please just be as honest as you can, because I'm sick of this sugarcoated bullcrap and would really just like to know wtf is going on right now..."
1lb6ft,3,2013-08-29,"High School Junior, Feeling Like I've Run Out of Time (Sorry for long post)",[deleted],careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1lb6ft/high_school_junior_feeling_like_ive_run_out_of/,"**Things I feel are important have been bolded. If you don't feel like reading this wall of text, those and the tl;dr should explain enough**

**I've basically blown the past two years of high school.** (Barely skating by my first year, and then eventually having to drop all but 2 classes second semester last year due to failing grades and absence. The classes were German and Drama.) My first year they wouldn't put me in any electives I wanted, since they were all full, so I couldn't learn more about what I wanted to do then. **Last year, I took and engineering course, an introductory psychology course, and a theatre course**(having been involved in extracurricular drama the year before). 

I am not an actor in theatre. I do the lights for the shows. I joined it on a whim due to a friend's suggestion Freshman year and was running the crew by the end of it. I continued running it last year, though this year I am not in a leadership position as I could not attend the leadership workshops throughout the summer due to prior obligations. **(Given my ability and interest for lighting design, it could be something I do as a career though I'm not sure if I could live off of that kind of pay. Unless I made it big I wouldn't make much.)**

I had always been interested in being an engineer but the teacher and our many conflicts swayed me away from it. **(I would consider taking the class again, though I won't have the option to until college and I don't know if I want to spend that kind of money on a maybe)**I ended up dropping this class for the sake of my mental health, but, as I dropped it after the deadline to drop classes, I received a failing grade. As this class was for dual credit(high school and college through the local community college), **the failing grade put me on academic suspension with said community college.**

Having found a newfound attitude towards schoolwork and my future, I've now begun working at this really hard. I'm retaking all of my failed courses through an online program and that's occupying a majority of my free time. I am now taking three advanced placement classes, all of which I'm confident I will pass. **These classes are also for dual credit, but given the aforementioned academic suspension, I don't believe I'm getting that out of them.** They are still AP classes, so that counts for something, right? AP Psych **(having now pursued psychology, I am more and more interested in psychiatry, though I don't feel that it's engaging enough to do for the rest of my life)**, AP US History, and AP Environmental Sciences. 

I've volunteered at a ymca summer camp for the past three years now as dishroom staff, and now that I'm old enough I plan on working there as a counselor for several more years if my time allows the summer to work there. Last year, I was chosen as a ymca volunteer of the year for my leadership efforts and initiative taken in the kitchen and dishroom.

I've found through working in my school's drama department and the summer camp that **I love working under stress.** Whether that stress is ""The show opens in five minutes and one of the light bulbs above the stage burnt out,"" ""a kid has shit his pants three times in a day,"" ""I'm getting screamed at 24/7 by the guy the school hired to help organize shows because he's never satisfied with anything I ever do until I've done it over 12 times,"" or ""the camp board is visiting camp today, dinner starts in 5 minutes, and none of the food has been put into serving bowls yet and if 500 people worth of food isn't ready in 10 minutes we might not get the donations we need this summer."" (Obviously using just examples I've had from my limited work experience, having not had a ""real job""), I just always perform really well under the stress and handle it very well. **I'd love to work in a high stress job(like higher level business or behind-the-scenes politics**, not like dangerous stress such as bomb squad or something). 

**The Bottom Line: I feel that I have wasted too much of my time in high school to actually develop enough interests to really know what I want to do, and the things I have considered would make good career choices aren't likely options for someone who wasted a load of time in high school. In addition, given my academic record, I doubt it will be very easy to get into college, and I feel that I don't have enough time to remedy what I've already done. Community College doesn't really seem like a likely option either, given that I am on academic suspension with my local one. Lastly, I feel that I'm too late to apply or even qualify for any internships that would send in the direction of a career I want to do.**

Final Possible Thoughts List (in descending order of current desirability):

* Politics (more behind the scenes work, not like the president or anything)

* Higher Level Business(perhaps in finances or business strategy or legal for a corporation)

* Psychiatry

* Theatre Tech(though could possibly put skills to work for movie sets, or large stadiums if pursued).

*tl;dr Turned around high school fuck-up that works great under stress, has strong natural leadership qualities, and is generally charismatic wants to know how to fix what he's broken in time to get into college and hopefully move on to higher level business or politics.  ^A ^job ^in ^the ^meantime ^to ^actually ^have ^an ^income ^for ^gas ^money ^and ^savings ^would ^be ^nice ^too, ^any ^ideas ^on ^that?*

Edit- I realize a lot of my aspirations are quite unlikely goals, but I feel that the unlikelyhood stems from the past two years of my academic career, rather than my knowledge or ability. If it's not too late, I think these are things I could achieve. The only question is, is it too late?"
1laso1,4,2013-08-28,Old School WJFK R&amp;F listeners; The Halloween Goddess seeks your help!,TheHalloweenGoddess,ronandfez,https://www.reddit.com/r/ronandfez/comments/1laso1/old_school_wjfk_rf_listeners_the_halloween/,"I hope some of you remember me ;)
I was a big participant on R&amp;F during the WJFK years. I first started listening to R&amp;F during the night hours on WNEW. I am native NYer from Manhattan and I was raised up there and North Jersey. I currently live in a small town called Culpeper, VA. When the R&amp;F show moved to Fairfax, VA, I was able to be a part of the show in my own small way. I worked in a specialty costume store not terribly far from the station and I helped the show with anything costume related. I created the Elfish outfit he wore on stage at Dave and Busters as he performed Elvis songs. I was pretty involved, mostly behind the scenes, with staff and other listeners. Made friends with a lot of the guys and interns. R&amp;F were always tremendous to me and many nights, unbeknownst to many of the other listeners, I was sitting right there in studio quietly next to Ron. I was not particularly a mike-whore at the time and many times I just wanted to watch the magic that was the R&amp;F show LIVE and in-person. The guys were always incredibly gracious to me. I was there for Turducken Thanksgivings and became friends with Kathleen from the Bronx, Bri Bri, Crazy Jen and Perrynoid. Over time I also got involved with The Hideout and became the 'official' photographer for J-Dubs and El Jefe's antics on late night.

I dropped off the face of the earth shortly after R&amp;F moved back to NY and left terrestrial for XM. Every bit of my life and attention had to be re-focused. I got the Big Casino. Cancer. And then it got worse! 

January 2005. Routine medical exam reveals a small growth on my thyroid. My doctor orders a series of tests. Each test takes about a month. By the final test on May 27 reveals thyroid cancer. By May 31, the left half of my thyroid is removed. I was informed that my life would return to normal with the exception of many follow up medical tests and procedures. LOL YEAH RIGHT!!!!

JUNE 2005;  One month after my cancer diagnosis, my spouse George of 13 years informs me that he didn’t want to be with a sick person, and I quote 'I didn't sign up for this'.  I was stunned. He could no longer take me being sick all the time. (Aside from the cancer I had a chronic KNEE condition, not really sick, per se) He moved out to the coast of NC and I was left with my three sons, mortgage and facing the cancer situation alone. 
Oh and just leave it to me to get the cancer that makes you fat!!! I had never been so huge in my life! My max weight pregnant with massive babies was only 175 when I was in my twenties. I ballooned to 236 pounds by the end of 2005.
Feeling my worst, looking terrible, puffy and tight and being sick as a dog from all the other things low thyroid does to a person. Despite all this...I meet a man named Mike. A really, really good man. We met in an amazing way which is another long story for another time. He gave me the hope and positivity I needed to fight the cancer and recover. We lived 75 miles apart and started a commuting relationship between Culpeper, VA and Springfield, VA. Holy hell the traffic we battled to see each other!!!
Because I had become a single mom of 3 teenagers I could not keep my varied-hour retail job that I had maintained while married to George. I needed to make serious money and get good health insurance due to my cancer. I changed jobs and landed an awesome gig at Lockheed Martin by early 2006.
Lockheed Martin Job goes along well. Day to day I battle the issues related to the cancer. Still struggling with serious hormonal imbalances due to the fact I was not producing adequate hormones with half a thyroid. To make matters worse, my chronic knee issue flared up, my left knee cartilage collapsed in early 2008.  Bleeding bone against bone. I needed a replacement knee but the cancer issue took priority over the leg. I was trying to deal with horrible chronic pain in my joints in conjunction with the cancer. I got a brilliant new endocrinologist and I needed my entire thyroid removed. Surgery was scheduled and in October 2008 the healthy remaining half of my thyroid is removed.
Except that isn't exactly the case. Turns out after the surgery and only revealed in pathology the right half was a Petri dish of new cancer growths. One of which was in my lymph nodes. I need further radiation to kill even individual cells that are cancerous. This radiation causes me to be radioactive, quarantined from family, sick and I lose a lot of my hair. Not bald but alopecia style in patches. The radiation causes a temporary tumor under my tongue and I lose my sense of taste throughout the holiday season that year. Water tastes like saltwater; everything is off, wrong and terrible. I am puffy and tight like Jerry Lewis was a few years back. The end of 2008 sucked and early 2009 wasn't much better.

I was living in a vicious cycle. I couldn’t lose weight unless my leg works, feeling lethargic from cancer, hormones keeping me fat, pain from joints becomes unbearable and I become wheelchair bound. Now I’m rolling my ass into work at Lockheed Martin! Then I finally get the insurance OK for knee replacement. Surgery was scheduled for October 2009.

Two weeks before my knee surgery, The Great Recession hits Northern Virginia and Lockheed Martin has major layoffs and I lose my job. Everyone tries to cheer me up by telling me that I can just recover, focus on my healing and find a new job. Hard to focus on getting better when to keep up my COBRA insurance it took up all of my unemployment earnings! I couldn’t pay my bills or buy groceries. Shit was getting really bad!!

I had my knee replacement surgery. It was like a miracle. I have had a lifetime of chronic pain, arthritis, medications and multiple knee surgeries in a bid to PUT OFF getting the replacement because I was too young at the time and I would outlive my knees and have to have additional surgeries. But this replacement....was a dream come true. I was up and walking within hours and I left the hospital on my third day. I told all physical therapists to fuck off and I did my OWN healing regimen. 

By December 2009...6 weeks after my surgery I made a 3 mile round trip mountain hike. Then the thyroid treatment new synthroid kicks in and with proper meds and NO DIETARY CHANGES my excess weight just starts to come off. Physically I was starting to feel stronger. I WAS DECLARED THYROID CANCER FREE JANUARY 2010.

January 15th, 2010 I posted a long update to R&amp;F.net message board, updating my new Cancer Free status. Little did I know that within 30 days of that posting the CANCER WAS BACK!!!!


Two weeks after my cancer all-clear, on Valentine's Day 2010 my wonderful boyfriend Mike proposes to me. We set the date for 10-10-10! I now have 8 months to plan a wedding!!! The future looks so bright now!!!

You didn’t think things would be THAT easy, did you?

MARCH 2010: I have an unusually heavy period. I go to a GYN who ultrasounds and finds a large tumor in my uterus. Probably benign.  Doc wants an ablation and D&amp;C to clean things up in there. Sure, why not? I schedule a cleanup and tumor removal which is a minor surgery but still needs anesthesia. I’m down for a few days and sore.

APRIL 2010: The D&amp;C reveals I have endometrial cancer. It takes a few weeks to find a surgeon and set the plan of action. I’m almost out of money to continue paying for COBRA insurance. Cancer again! FUCK!!

MAY 29th, 2010: Total hysterectomy, including ovaries. I've been rendered a female eunuch before I'm to be married to the man I love that stood beside me through it all. Great. I really deserved that irony.
Now remember...during this entire ordeal...I’M STILL UNEMPLOYED LOOKING FOR A JOB!! Oh wait...AND I'm trying to plan a wedding AND trying to get my mortgage modified before foreclosure since I’ve had issues paying all the bills.....how the FUCK can I get a job and do any of these things if I keep having fucking SURGERIES and CANCERS damnit!!!

JUNE 2010; I can only secure a shit retail position at a big box office supply store I'll call Paperclips. This motherfucking job was so terrible that after 8 weeks I had to go to my doctor for depression meds! Even my Doc knew something was wrong because I'm not a depressive and never needed anything to help cope during the cancer!! But I needed meds to cope with that shithole.

JULY 2010; I was running a register at work at Paperclips about 2 weeks into the job and as I lifted a printer at the checkout counter, my intestines fell out of my abdomen and into my cavity. Right in front of a customer I had to push my guts back into place with a squishing sound. I could not move, so I used the counter as a way to hold my intestines in by pressing against it as hard as I could as I smiled and pretended nothing was wrong! After the customer left I quietly asked to take a break, went into the back room, got duct tape and taped my stomach tight to keep the hernia closed and my lower bowel in place. I was so broke I couldn't lose the hours by going home early!!!

AUGUST 2010; Finally got my Dr. to fix my hernia, which he did and used lots of mesh to pull my guts together. I have had over 25 surgeries to date, about 7 or so on my abdomen.

SEPT 2010; OH YEA...I forgot, I'm supposed to be getting married! PLAN WHOLE WEDDING IN 3 WEEKS!!! 

OCT 2010; We marry outdoors on the cheap, only family attend, a lovely, peaceful day.BAM....Walk down the aisle swollen from surgeries but I did it! Relief!! Drive around the mountains of NC and VA for 5 days in a perfect honeymoon. Can I PLEASE move on with my life now!!!!!

NOV 2010; Wells Fargo refuses to modify my mortgage after stringing me along for months. I have to be out in 30 days. Hubby loses his job!! Must use next week to find a new house and employ my husband!! I had to file bankruptcy. Game over.

DEC 2010; We find a beat up, old, damaged repo home in a rural, wooded area and close on it with the help of family member to co-sign the loan.  We see the potential in everything and we have ideas about fixing up and beautifying this place. My dream of having an animal rescue here because it is secluded! But at the moment…in 13 degree weather we need to pack and haul boxes!! It was freezing my hands hurt moving boxes in the cold!!

JAN 2011; Took a whole month making tiny loads with a pickup truck but I finally removed my life of 13 years from my former home to the new, secluded, repo home. The failure I felt at losing my house was colossal. I was pretty depressed then, it was hard to stay positive. I decided to really throw myself into this house and not focus on the past but damn it was hard letting go. My youngest son gets a 16 year old girlfriend named Kia. She is a good girl with a terrible mother issues, just constant fighting all the time. She has had a very tough upbringing and household and yet you can see she looked to me as a parental figure. She seemed smart and witty and I really liked her.

FEB 2011; If I don't get the fuck out of the job I'm in, I'm going to kill myself. PAPERCLIPS is the worst retail hell I have ever had to endure. I have GOT to find another gig!!

MARCH 2011;  HOLY SHIT!! I landed a fucking dream job!!! I'm talking BOOYAH!!! I become the executive assistant to Senator Colgan's son, Chuck Colgan Jr. I get a nice office, mahogany desk, laptop and I am to assist him in the grand reopening of the Manassas Airport Freedom Museum dedicated to the fallen soldiers of Fauquier (and local) counties of all wars . I work with a curator and I start to process artifacts from 1900 onward pertaining to war paraphernalia. I am so happy and focused on the grand reopening of the museum May 6th.

APRIL 2011; FINALLY got some paydays and life was not hand to mouth for the first month in forever!! I got to breathe a bit! The future looked bright!!!
MAY 3, 2011; CRASH!! 3 Days before museum dedication, my boss has a heart attack. It doesn't kill him but it puts him down for the count. Takes early retirement to recover....JOB ENDS ABRUPTLY!!

HOLY SHIT....... WTF did I do to deserve this!!!!! So now I was back to being unemployed. This time with no unemployment from the govt. I couldn’t fix up the shithole we bought because IT was a repo and without dough I'm not getting very far in repairs. My house is still in boxes and wires sticking out of the walls. We are living on plywood painted brown to imitate a floor, no carpet or hardwood yet. Just living like shit being broke. Back to the internet to find a job!

JUNE 2011; UNEMPLOYED, Job hunting online, unpacking boxes from the move. Minor construction in house must begin in a variety of rooms. Painting walls, etc. I sell off many possessions on Craigslist to try to generate funds.

JULY 2011; Spend hours walking around new property picking up broken glass and trash. Cans everywhere, glass bottles. WTF did these people do???? Begin to really daydream about turning this place into an animal rescue!!

AUG 2011; Just filling a dumpster with yard trash and gutting rotten sheetrock from the house. My son's girlfriend Kia and her mother get into a huge blowout and her Mom threw her out. She was 16 and had no other family and no place to go, so I took her in. Kia comes to live with me. I become her Foster Mother.

SEPT 2011;  I finally land another shit retail job at a place we'll call ANIMALCO. What a fucking DUMP and UGH they treat the animals like SHIT!!!! At least the management. My co-workers were very caring and sweet people who truly loved animals. But the corporate side….yuk.

OCT 2011; Drove to visit my Grandma in NC. Just a nice, relaxing weekend. We had an amazing day out with my cool Grandma. Went to the movies, out to a restaurant then we watched a concert in the street. We got home to her house and the phone rang. Her Dr just informed her she had stage 4 liver cancer. Out of the FUCKING BLUE!! We rally together and vow to research all options!! I start to drive frequently from VA to NC to be with her. Every 4 days I was making a 6 hour one way trip. Every dime I had went to gas to drive it!! My new Manager at ANIMALCO starts to threaten me with my job over the time I request to spend with my grandmother. I was only an employee for 4 weeks so I can see their point but damn he was a dick about things.

NOV 2011; My grandmother passes away. The most important person in my world from my birth is gone and I'm a fucking train wreck. Six weeks!! From the day we found out to her being gone! My best friend on the planet, gone so fast. My boss threatened to fire me if I did not report back for my shift causing me to come back to VA and not be at her bedside. 24 hours later she died. I hate him with every fiber of my being. And I hate myself for being so broke and job scared that I put up with his monstrous behavior but I now live in fear of losing the place we have now. So I was afraid to up and quit because unemployment ran out.

1laoap,3,2013-08-28,"Girlfriend [22F] breaks up with me [25M] after ~8 months relationship, making decision on her own.",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1laoap/girlfriend_22f_breaks_up_with_me_25m_after_8/,"Will try to be as unbiased as possible, just by telling facts.

Me and my ex-girlfriend started dating about 8 months ago. We were both busy with our studies in uni and were living about 2 hours away from each other, so only managed to see each other every 2 weeks or so. Normally I wouldn't go for a (semi-)long distance thing, but this time a rather interesting coincidence of meeting for the first time in a city we both had internships in resulted in quite a beautiful relationship, which seemed to go smoothly for the first few months. We confessed our feelings to each other at some point, and were very happy together.

She's always been very hard-working and committed to her studies, ranking in top few percent of the students in a leading university. That's why at first she struggled to find balance between her studies, friends, time for herself and this new relationship. In fact, it was her first serious relationship — somehow I was the first person she developed feelings for. I've had a few relationships in the past, so considered myself more experienced than her. Unfortunately, this experience didn't prevent a rather sad outcome.

A few months into relationship, I caught her lying about some minor thing, after me specifically asking her to be truthful and admitting I had trust issues as the facts were indicating the opposite. 'You can trust me', she said. Yet a few hours later she confessed she was lying, apologizing and explaining it by major stress before exams and her brain not able to think adequately. I understood it was a minor slip and was willing to forgive, however, it still made me feel really upset at the time, since I value mutual trust very high as it's a basis for any healthy relationship. I didn't start an argument straight away as I didn't want to cause her any emotional pressure before her exams. Instead I wrote her a letter which reached her after her exams, explaining why I was upset and also making a hypothesis on why she had to lie to me. I suspected her not to have feelings for me, and asked her to be truthful to herself in the first place. It became clear later on that I was correct and this lie was a consequence of her concealing her doubts about this relationship.

As she told me afterwards, a few weeks before the breakup she started having doubts in her head whether she wants to be with me or not. Her intuition began telling her that I'm not a right man for her. She couldn't explain me any other reasons apart from this gut feeling, which caused her feelings to decrease. Unfortunately, she decided not to tell me about it until the very last moment, because of being stressed preparing for her exams and not wanting additional emotional pressure. This may seem rather selfish and hypocritical, yet it is understandable — she just had such priorities and didn't want to compromise on her exams.

So after her exams, she told me about these doubts and that her feelings had changed. It totally devastated me as I became rather attached to her emotionally over the past few months. I couldn't think adequately and didn't propose not to make hasty decisions, to spend some time in mutual effort, trying to understand what was behind her intuition. So this is how it ended. We exchanged a couple of emails the following day, in my last message I accepted her choice and thanked for all the happy times we had. A couple of weeks later she wrote me a letter, saying that she did have feelings at some point but 'sadly people change and feelings change and there's nothing anyone can do about this'. She also said that she was very grateful to me for everything, that it was one of the hardest decisions she ever made, wishing good luck with everything, blah blah. I haven't responded to that letter yet as it didn't specifically require any response. She's also abroad at the moment doing some internship for about a month.

There could have been various reasons behind her gut feeling. What upsets me now is the fact that she made the decision herself, rather firmly, without even a possibility to try and overcome the issue together. This seems utterly immature to me. I believe that long term relationship means some commitment, which requires people to attempt to overcome the difficulties, rather than giving up on their own. Dumping someone out of nowhere just seems very irresponsible and betraying other person. Some mutual effort on trying to resolve this would have made the end more natural and easier to deal with. She argued that once the feelings are lost, there's nothing anyone can do. I think (yet haven't told her) that this is quite superficial: what we had was infatuation, and of course it decreases over time. Deeper feelings (i.e. love) have to be worked on, and it requires commitment, trust, mutual respect and effort.

I understand it was stupid of me to expect the same level of commitment and maturity from a person with her experience. However, it doesn't make it easier emotionally. My question is: shall I cut all contact, or shall I write her a letter, possibly in a couple of months, with my point of view over the whole relationship, saying basically what I've written here?

Actually, writing this helps already. Thanks, reddit.

**tl;dr**: Girlfriend dumped me saying she's lost her feelings, made this decision on her own. I think it's not fair to do so in a serious relationship, as some mutual effort is absolutely necessary to try to overcome the difficulty. Am I making sense?"

You can try a subreddit search if you’re trying to decide between two specific majors; for example, here is a post about Electrical vs Mechanical
http://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/1layzs/mechanical_vs_electrical_engineering/

This topic is beaten to death though. A simple search will have many different posts and you can try reading through the descriptions.

Here’s a lovely one by KyleGG.

See what you think you could foresee yourself doing for the rest of your life.


**Should I buy this book that’s needed for this class?**

Maybe. First of all check a website like abebooks for the international edition of the book; this will usually be way cheaper than buying the book in your university bookstore.

For me, a rule of thumb is if the book looks like something I would read after I take the class and it is less than $10, I just buy it.

Otherwise, I would recommend going to the first day of class and seeing if the professor says you need it or not.

**Should I take notes with a laptop/tablet?**

I personally recommend against it. 
It’s very easy to get distracted on a laptop, and a tablet is often a bit difficult to use efficiently.
Pen+notebook has worked for the past hundred years, so why change that?

However, it’s all personal preference, if you must use electronics though, download and open your professors slides and turn off the WiFi while in class.

**Help! I studied for 30 hours for this test and got a 30%. What do I do?**

First, relax and breathe. 

Okay. first you should try to find out the average. If the average for the class is 20%, then you did fine! 
If not, then you should relax and reevaluate your study habits. The most important thing is not pulling all-nighters and getting at least 8-9 hours of sleep the night before a test.
You can also take a look at my study tips post right here (not posted yet).

It’s okay, you can do better on the next test!


**Should I get a double major in &lt;Engineering Discipline&gt; and &lt;Other Engineering Discipline&gt;?**

If they’re disjoint majors like Chemical Engineering and Computer Engineering then I really advise against it. It’s going to be very difficult to get good grades in both of them, and even if you can do it, your college experience is going to suffer tremendously.

If they’re related majors like Electrical Engineering and Computer Engineering, then you can, but it is often wholly unnecessary. I would recommend looking into getting a masters in the second field rather than cramming everything into undergrad.

**When should I apply for internships?**

Yesterday.

**How do I get an internship/co-op?**

If you have classmates or know upperclassmen at certain companies, you can ask them to pass your resume on. Same thing applies to your parents or your friends’ parents.

Keep active with your school’s career fairs and job board (most schools have one). Talk to recruiters at these events and make sure your resume is in as many places as possible.

Finally, you can also apply on the company’s website, but keep in mind that, although possible, this is much more difficult than the other methods.

**How do I get an internship if my GPA is bad?**

Experience is worth more than GPA. Apply anyways!

GPA only really matters in the HR step, which is getting the initial interview. Having internal referrals and/or strong recommendations will help you get the interview as well.
Once you get the technical interview, it’s your turn to shine. Blow them out of the water with your knowledge and skills and most importantly, be personable. Actually, being personable is 80% of it. Because the primary goal of an interview is to figure out if they like you and would be willing to work with you, whether or not you’re technically adept is only the secondary goal.

That said, work on your GPA! Put some extra effort into your classes and you can take a look at my study tips below.

**Should I focus on side projects and stop caring about GPA?**

Don’t get me wrong, GPA is still important. Academics should still be your top priority.
However, No. You should still care about GPA. Projects are a supplement. Would you ever buy a mouse+keyboard if you don’t even own a computer? Same logic applies. Work hard on your grades, don’t be worried if they’re not perfect; work hard on your projects, but if you have homework or a midterm creeping up, the project can wait until Saturday :). 

**How does my resume look?**

Quite honestly, just take out personal information such as name and address and post it.
Here are some basic tips though:

1. Use a nice simple font. Please *don’t* use Comic Sans or Times New Roman. I personally am a big fan of Calibri and Roboto.
2. No long paragraphs. Use concise bullet points. If they want more information, they can ask you at the interview.
3. No spleling misatkes. 
4. No bright colors. You’re an engineer not a graphic designer, and color is very hard to pull off properly. Avoid it.
5. Stick to one page. You’re a student, you don’t have 20 years of work experience. 
6. No pictures, No personal information. 
7. Use PDF format and title it ‘FirstLast_Resume.pdf’. If you have to put it into an online form or they request it in .doc, that is when you do that. 
8. If you speak multiple languages and want it on your resume, don’t put English. For example on my resume I only put Chinese, Spanish.

**Should I learn &lt;SKILL&gt;?**

Yeah! If you want to, then go for it. 

**Is a MS worth it for me?**

You should make a new post with your details (goals, major, current status) because these should be handled on a case by case basis.

**Should I get a minor in &lt;Engineering discipline&gt;?**

It’s not necessary, but if you think it’ll help you to then go for it. Personally, I think that you’d be better off taking the classes that you think would be helpful and interesting rather than locking into a curriculum for a certain minor.

**Should I get a minor in &lt;Liberal Arts&gt;?**

Honestly in my opinion, it doesn't really make you a more ‘well-rounded person’. You get that by talking to people and socializing, not by taking certain classes. I personally recommend taking what topics you’re interested in(ie. Early Colonialism or Epistemology) rather than locking yourself into a curriculum.

**Can you recommend me a project to do?**

As I am a Computer Engineer, I can only recommend things within my scope. Hopefully others can add some ideas to this.

*Computer Science:*

Open Source: Try joining an open source project. Join the IRC, download the code, read it, look at the buglist, try to fix code, figure out why it doesn’t work, ask questions.

Android Apps: Make a simple android app. Maybe a live wallpaper? Maybe a game? Maybe you need a work-out scheduler and you don’t like the interface of the current apps out there? Go make something

*Electrical Engineering:*

Arduino: Arduino is a Microcontroller unit, basically you can program it to do stuff and you can hook wires and connect it to other things such as screens, LEDs, anything really. There are tons of cool arduino projects. Just google ‘cool arduino projects’.

FPGA: Field programmable gate arrays are slightly more advanced, but there are tons of awesome things you can do with them. I personally have a DE0-Nano device because it’s relatively inexpensive and a good toy to have as a student.

**Should I join a club?**

Yes! Check your school for engineering organizations.

If you’re interested in programming and/or electronics, I personally like IEEE and ACM.
There are tons of clubs for all people of engineering such as AiCHE, SWE, NSBE, ASCE, EWB and more! These will hook you up with networking, social events and tons of like-minded people.

If you’re not so much interested in these, check out other organizations such as the sports clubs, interest clubs, or even a frat. Nobody says you’re only allowed to join one.

As a recent graduate from the University of Wisconsin - Whitewater, I have a strong background in politics and sales.  

In 2008 I graduated from a small rural community school in Wisconsin and began my studies at UW - Whitewater.  As I majored in political science, I quickly got involved in the area and began helping with some political campaigns.  The first campaign was for a small representative located in the Milwaukee area.  It was a five man team and we won the seat to which we were competing.  While I was working on this campaign I was also simultaneously working for both a political marking firm and a lieutenant gubernatorial candidate.  By the end of all this the Presidential campaigns were firing up and I promptly took a position assisting the Chief of Staff for one of these campaigns, the name of which I shall leave out since this is reddit.  Unfortunately the only successful campaign I was a part of was the former in Milwaukee.  Much was learned from all though and the experience gained was above and beyond what was expected.  

During my years in college I also worked for a telecommunications agency which sold U.S. Cellular phones.  The footprint of this company was Wisconsin and Illinois boasting roughly 10 different locations.  My time there was very valuable as great customer service was extremely important.  For this company I was the top part-time salesman, company wide.  

At the moment I am still located in Wisconsin and would have no issue relocating.  

Below is a pasted copy of my resume with names and affiliations censored out.  If you would like a true copy, feel free to message me directly.

1leyjr,115,2013-08-30,"I have three female roommates, my girlfriend is feeling really insecure, what can I do to make her feel better?",throwawayaccount1349,AskMen,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/1leyjr/i_have_three_female_roommates_my_girlfriend_is/,"My girlfriend and I have been dating for a year now. I am going into my junior year of college and she is going to her senior year. I was tired of dorming so I ended up getting an apartment off campus, and she remained in the dorms. I had friends on campus but they already had living arrangements so I ended up randoming roommates.

A few days ago my girlfriend and her parents came to help me move my stuff in to my apartment, to find out my three other roommates are hot girls. And to make matters worse, they were also flirty with me while my girlfriend and her parents were there. My girlfriend has been insecure since we started dating since I am her first boyfriend. This has shot her insecurity through the roof and I don’t blame her either, I wouldn’t be okay if my girlfriend was living with three other guys. Since we started dating I have gone out of my way to make my girlfriend feel better not hanging out with a girl alone, telling her if I am going out etc. 

My roommates so far have not really made any advances towards me. They have invited me to go out to some parties with them which I declined. The only thing I have done with them is watch T.V with them time to time and cook with them. However, they go out of their way to be overtly sexual/flirty whenever my girlfriend is around. I have asked them to stop but they say it’s funny and they are just teasing. h I can tell my girlfriend is really hurt over the situation, she has tried to put on a poker face but I can see right through it. I don’t want her to be depressed or insecure, what can I do to make her more at ease. I can’t just switch roommates, I have already signed a 1 year lease, and unless my roommates do something illegal I am stuck. 

**Edit 1** I can't just ignore my roommates they have been really kind to me. One of them has a car, how I get groceries, one of them likes to bake food for all of us. They have taught me basic stuff like laundry/cooking. We have a roommate schedule where we do chores/clean up together.  Ignoring my roommates won't work. 

**Edit 2** Okay I am not sure how many of you guys have lived with roommates but you become dependent on each other. I asked here what I can do to make my girlfriend feel better, even if my roommates were to stop the flirting. My girlfriend would still not be okay with me being with 3 other girls. 

**Edit 3** Okay you guys are putting too much emphasis on the joking. Here is the type of crap they say. Roommates here I am having sex with girlfriend.  Roommate 1: ""he never fucks me like that."" Roommate 2, ""When will it be my turn."" Or another example is when I am talking to my girlfriend, they will start making moaning noises. Recently they have cut down on the joking, (they still do the moaning when I am on the phone) but my girl friend is still uncomfortable with the entire situation.


**Edit 4** A part which I want to get across is my girlfriend doesn't do a good job handling any of the attention I get from my roommates. For example, Roommate 1: you look handsome in that shirt
Gf: he doesn't give a shit on what you think. I am not saying she is deserving of the teasing but her calling them whores and what not isn't the best response. The first day when we were moving in she and her mom were talking in Polish and kept using the word roommate while looking angrily at my roommates. None of em can speak Polish but they know nothing positive was being said about them. My roommates have been nothing but kind to me, I would really like it if my girlfriend got along with them because I would like to room with them next year. One of their dad's has offered me an internship in his company for the following summer. 

**Edit 5** I enjoy the attention my roommates give me, especially when we all go out together shopping or to an event on campus.  But I want to make things work with my girlfriend. Even if one of them were to come onto me I would turn them down. 

**Edit 6** I have talked to roommates they have dialed their shit down but girlfriend now almost tries to provoke them. Example, Gf: want to watch vampire diaries Me: yeah sure thats fine Roommate: hey can i watch with you guys, I have all of Season 5 on Amazon Prime. Gf: not interested in vampire diaries anymore lets watch something on Netflix... alone . You see the type of shit she pulls. I can't blame my roommates for being trying to get back at her. My girlfriend has always been bitchy towards other girls. Now regards to defending her. I do when we are in public, but when we are alone I tell her she needs to cut that shit out. I also want it to be clear that I don't want to be in a relationship with any of my roommates. I don't see them having some secret agenda either( I could be wrong), I don't see them trying to seduce me A). they are much hotter than me. B). They can get a hotter guy that does nice shit for them. I really think my girlfriend has been the reason for 80% of our problems.


**TL;DR I move into new apartment with three roommates all girls and my gf becomes jealous/insecure**

Right now I'm looking at my college's ""experience"" website where jobs and internships are posted and a good amount of them are either unpaid (although some have the potential to turn into paid), have a higher expected student status (junior or senior), or require a skill I don't have (such as web programming for one internship.)

While I could apply for some, there are a few things that worry me.

* I only have five months of Python experience and about 2-3 weeks of C# experience under my belt. I'm studying more C# every day and will soon take C++ classes, so that experience will keep growing.
* I have no side projects I've been working on (or contributions to open source projects yet, as I don't feel I'm experienced enough for those) and as such my github is empty.
* Because of my lack of technical skill and projects, I don't have much to put on my resume to make it stand out.

What should be my next steps? Should I work on improving my resume and just apply and see what happens? Continue studying? Also I was wondering if I should look at other internship search places besides just my school's. Thank you in advance for reading this."
1lemut,9,2013-08-30,ONE MILESTONE DOWN!!,beermethestrength,InfertilityBabies,https://www.reddit.com/r/InfertilityBabies/comments/1lemut/one_milestone_down/,"We had our early pregnancy scan today with our RE, and I was shocked to actually see the heartbeat! So shocked in fact, that I immediately burst into tears. The very kind intern grabbed a kleenex for me while the RE continued to look around. Everything looks perfect so far - I'm at 6 weeks 5 days, and the ultrasound reflected that. That puts our due date at 4/20 (haha, won't forget that date). 

I just called the OB, who is super popular and apparently difficult to get in with, and left a message for a new patient visit. Fingers crossed I hear back by Tuesday. And we scheduled one last visit with the RE for next Friday. Of course I'm still scared, but I can relax a little bit. And I can actually hang that photo on the fridge this time, and not crumple it up and throw it away like I did last October. 

So now we're faced with the dilemma - do we tell the family yet? I'm thinking no, because when I miscarried last year my family was not helpful at all. Plus my mother-in-law is psycho and will call me every fucking day to ask how I'm doing, and I can't take that stress right now. 

I just texted my hubby about feeling like we shouldn't tell, and he agrees, so I guess that settles that. :)"

- Gonna celebrate my 21st Birthday this weekend! And even though it's not a big party or anything, it's not gonna be as forever alone as I thought either (you know, those posts where FAs post a lonely picture of a lone slice of cake and stuff...)! Nope! I'm going out with one of my closest friend, a lunch buffet with my parents and another one of my good friend has already contacted me even though she was overseas. Made me real happy. 

- So far school is going well...it's still too early to say though

- I lost like 1 kg....I'M PLATEAUING ...WHY CANT I GET DOWN TO 50kg???!!

- Lots of life changes coming my way. My dad was supposed to retire this year...but it seems like a new opportunity has popped up. I've also started creating and compiling a portfolio of my writings (am aiming for an editorial internship next year or so).

- I've made a commitment to dress better and have subscribed to /r/femalefashionadvice! 

Anyway, thanks for the gold and for always cheering me on! Life's been pretty good to me recently. 

And now I can feel upbeat in DA GOLD LOUNGE, SUCKAS!

1le37a,344,2013-08-30,Dormitory Space,bloodandsnow,pettyrevenge,https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/1le37a/dormitory_space/,"**So, a few buddies recently asked me about a particular incident that went down during my undergrad years. I promised to write out the entire saga for them, and figured I might as well let ya'll come along for the ride. Sorry for the length! Unless you like that sort of thing, in which case I'm *not* sorry.**

So, college life - often the first foray into the real word. All the kiddies in their late teens and early twenties embarking on the exciting adventure of additional education, hoping to snag that sweet degree that hopefully delivers you from flipping burgers. For many people, it's the first time they are forced to do things such as live with other people who are not forced to, generally speaking, love or even like them.

Obviously, this leads to a lot of issues for most people when they first get started. They have to learn about things like sharing, the concepts of privacy and personal space and those 'if you take my food/booze again, I'll cut you' conversations. After a year or so of this people usually either flake out, finish their associates and call it quits or keep moving on with a 4 year degree. At this point, they've also grown a little. Hopefully.

Welcome to my story, at which point I'm on the home stretch of my Bachelors, doing a double major in psych and sociology. I've always had to share at home, and I'm normally a fairly mellow person. A little mess? Normal and fine. I just need enough floor clear so I don't break my neck navigating it in the dark. Sharing stuff? We can share certain things, but anything else you just don't touch unless it's offered to you. Parties? Cool with me. I don't mind hanging out in the library to study, but once it hits 3 am and the library has kicked us it needs to end for the night. I have an 8 am core requirement class three days a week where a bad grade would mean staying an extra semester, plus an internship the other two days of the week where I need to pay attention so as not to fuck up the running case studies. You keep me up all night and by god you'll be waking up early, too.

But that is just setting the scene. Fast forward to my very last semester as an undergrad: my previous roomie has graduated, resulting in the new girl we shall call Jessica. She, a 2nd year who spends a lot of her time going out and isn't all that dedicated to school. Her parents paid for her tuition, calls to remind her about assignment due dates, even comes by every weekend to buy her groceries and do her laundry for her. (She either didn't want to, or couldn't be bothered to walk one flight down to the dorm's laundry facilities.) As she spent most of her time partying but kept it to the various frats and sororities, I didn't mind. She was an adult and it was her life, she could do with it what she wanted. 

We saw each other for only a few hours a day tops, as our schedules and priorities were vastly different. I noticed a few things off as time went by, but I was also busy as hell. I didn't have any to spare on tracking her down about missing food or the other typical petty roommate infractions. I had *two* majors for which I also had massive final projects to finish. The little time I was not spending in class, studying, interning or working on said projects I split between frantic meals with my boyfriend and some sleep.

Now, most majors require at least a few papers to be written. Any psych or socio major will tell you that there is a *lot* of printing you need to do, due to the sheer amount of papers you're forced to write. Now, double it. You might as well write off a significant portion of the rain forest the second you apply for FAFSA, for the sheer amount of paper you're going to use. 

My own university's tuition included library printer credits: what I vaguely recall as being something like 400 pages a semester. Black and white pages equaled a single page, color pages would eat up 5 pages of your quota. Once you ran out, you could either pay a ridiculous amount to buy more (it would have been something like 40 cents per black and white page) or rely on your own equipment. I already knew from experience this would only last me through half the semester, unless I rationed it very carefully and used every damn trick in the book to save the pages I could. Get permission to email drafts instead of turning in hard copies? Check. Print on both the front and back sides wherever I could, as that *also* only counted as a single page? Double check. Make sure my handy dell printer also had a fresh ink cartridge in it, expensive as they were, just in case I didn't have time to hit the library (or ran out of pages entirely) before class? Triple check.

So it's the final week of the semester and everyone, even Jessica I see, is scrambling to get their work done. I'm typing away madly on my laptop, putting final touches on a paper so I can save it and print it off before my morning class. Just as I hit the save button though, I get an urgent phone call from the Professor - one of her other interns, aka The Idiot has somehow messed up badly. Can I please please please make my way over to the Psych building to help her, hopefully salvaging the lost data from the various USB backups I've made?

As my name gets to go on this paper if it gets published, which I very much want/need as a boost for getting into grad school of choice, I obviously say ""Fuck, I'll be right over"". I gather my stuff and run out, figuring I can print my own paper once I return. Jessica is on her side of the room, looking at a facebook post about a rave to celebrate the end of the semester being held that weekend. I wave to her as I'm shoveling my stuff into a bag and putting on my sneakers, grab my keys and then I'm gone. 

So, after an all-nighter replacing every lost data entry point by hand and re-running the SPSS protocols, I'm dead tired and very glad I finished my paper earlier that day. I've only got about about an hour to get back and print the damn thing before my 8 am class starts, and would not have had time to polish it to the degree it needed otherwise. I aint mad, tho. My work is done. I'm going to graduate with honors, with an amazing recommendation letter from my professor and I have a department party that night with a bunch of other overly stressed psych and soc students to look forward to. I've made it through four years of hell, I just need to get through these last few hours in one piece. One little problem.

I get back, quietly boot my computer up as Jessica is still asleep, and plug in the printer with its precious supply of ink. My dell blinks the red light of doom: error. No ink. Replace cartridge and try again. ""The Hell,"" I say. I've been careful - I'd run out of my library quota later in the semester than usual, a single cartridge should not already be gone. That's when I see them, tucked in her backpack: several stapled reports apparently for her classes and the dozens of full color fliers, matching the image *still on her own computer's screen* telling everyone to come to the House Alpha-Zeta-Zeta End Of Year Rave, BYOB. An icon in her task bar, showing 'printer disconnected'. *My* printer, devoid of the ink I needed for a paper now due in forty minutes. 

I'm not ashamed to say I didn't react very well. As she had no issue stealing from me and putting my grades and degree at risk, my opinion was that turnabout was fair play. I took every single final paper and report from her backpack and hid them under her desk. I turned her alarm clock setting to pm, so she could sleep in. Then, I sat my butt at her desk where she always left her computer on and permanently logged on to her school account. I opened my projects via usb and routed the print job to the library: where I could pick up the finished product and hopefully only be a few minutes late to class. Printed, of course, off of her quota as she'd already more than helped herself to mine.

Since print jobs were also given a confirmation number, staff would rarely ask for your ID if you already had that - it was college, friends picked up papers for one another. No other reason for you to have the number unless they gave it to you, right? Along with this number, you were also informed just how many pages were left on your account. Guess how many pages she'd used during the semester. Almost none: she'd just been too lazy to walk down to the library and pick anything up, so she'd been using my printer and ink instead. 

I resolved then and there she would pay. I didn't have time for much, so I acted off my first impulse. If parties were so important, she was going to need a lot more fliers. Say, just enough copies to finish off what was left of her quota. (I rationalized that since the color printers had their own assigned machines and could still spit out six to ten pages every minute, the ten it'd take to print them all wouldn't be grievously impeding anyone else.) Let her scramble like I had been forced to do. 

And then, I fled. In the end, I managed to get into the library early enough to get my finished prints and deliver them on time. The gods must have been smiling down upon me, because I even had time to catch my breath afterwards. Our Professor had stopped to pick up donuts and coffee for us and was a little late. I slogged through the morning and got back to the dorms in time to nap, pack the majority of my stuff into the Boyfriend's truck and finally let loose at the department party that night. 

As for Jessica, she apparently overslept but *did* manage to successfully beg off turning her work in late, in exchange for a loss of points. Unfortunately, she'd spent so much time out drinking and dancing she was already on the verge of failing. This pushed her grades over that final edge. Jessica would *not* be getting her Associates degree that semester like she thought she would. 

**tldr: don't touch my stapler.**

1ldzeh,1,2013-08-30,"[19M] Situation becoming more awkward with [20F], not sure what next move should be",[deleted],dating_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1ldzeh/19m_situation_becoming_more_awkward_with_20f_not/,"I'm a late bloomer in dating. In the past year, I've gone from admiring girls from afar, to actually doing something about it and trying to get to know them better.  Several months ago, there was a girl on campus [21F] I found cute.  A mutual friend found out and introduced us, as well as accidentally informing one of her best friends [20F] of the situation.

As time went on, I was losing interest with [21F] because she kept rescheduling last minute whenever I wanted to hang out with her.  Through another series of events, I started hanging out with [20F] more and more, to the point that I developed feelings for her.  Eventually, I was only interested in [20F].

When classes ended, I realized [20F] and I would be in different places during the summer (her in our hometown and I on campus).  That and her close friendship with [21F] deterred me from asking her out.  Regardless, I did maintain contact with her during the break.  I texted her a few times.  There was a mixed response.  I was always the initiator of the text conversations, but she was very responsive and we would go back and forth for hours.  I would get a few flirts off:
Her: ""Thanks for those kind words, can you tell that I'm smiling right now? :)""
Me: ""Yep, but it isn't the same without the actual smile.""
Her: ""Haha don't play with my heart like that!""

However fun it was though, I was getting tired of being the initiator.  So I stopped for my own sake.  A little down the road, the mutual friend from before told me that [20F] had texted him asking if the thing with me chasing [21F] was still going on.  My friend told me that he clarified to her that it was not going on.  And with that, I became curious again about her again.

I texted her again.  Eventually, she personally asked me about my situation with [21F], so I personally responded about how I wasn't interested anymore.  She then asked me about this ""new girl"" that I liked and how I thought ""this girl"" felt about me.  I told her that I could not figure ""this girl"" out but that confession was the right decision.  The conversation had an extremely ambiguous moment before the ""good night""s were sent:
Me: ""Well I guess I'll just have to wait till I see her again ;)""
Her: ""Hrmm some memories are like wine ... the greater the wait the better the taste :)""

I took it to be a green light.  When I returned to my hometown, I tried calling her up.  She didn't respond and texted back asking what was up.  I asked if she wanted to catch up over lunch before classes started.  She gave me strange response: ""You mean in x days, x &gt; 9?"" (classes were to start in 12 days)  I was confused and clarified that I was talking about meeting up in our hometown.  She gave me an excuse saying that her schedule was erratic in the city due to her internship.  At this point, I was disappointed, so I dropped it and told her to just contact me if she wanted to hang out on campus later.

Back on campus, I was invited to her birthday party by one of her friends.  During her birthday, she seemed to be really quiet, and I did not feel the right vibe, so I just gave her my present, enjoyed myself at the festivities, and left it at that.  She messaged me later to thank me for the present, finding it very cute.  However, I was so deterred by what I saw as negative body language during the party, that I did not do anything further.

A few days later, I got a text from her:
Her: ""Heyy what classes are you taking?""
I jumped the gun and dropped my doubts, responding to the question and asking if she knew of an interesting course to add.  Her response was not as exciting:
Her: ""Oops, I think I blast texted my previous message by accident!  Cool, um.. -insert class name here-""

I was angry that I had such bad luck to get a blast text from her, but more so disappointed, and did not continue the conversation.  The very day I had this texting conversation with her, I ran into her a little later while walking with a friend, and we had an extremely awkward exchange of ""hi""s.  

At this point, I am extremely confused.  The whole situation has roughed up my self esteem.  I would like a clear answer, but I am afraid of being too invasive and pushing her away any more.  Although I'd like to talk to her in person, the ""internship excuse"" situation from before makes me feel like she does not want to be alone with me.  Although I could talk to her about this over text, I feel that it would not be the best medium, and would only cause more awkwardness.  I am not sure what to do, I want closure but I don't want to scare her out of my life.

tldr; Many ambiguous/awkward events and mixed signals with [20F].  Was I fooling myself the whole time?  What should I do now?"

1ldqpz,4,2013-08-30,Help me,[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1ldqpz/help_me/,"My boyfriend, H, (25) and I (23) have been together on and off for about 7 years. I love him very much, and he was very much still a part of my heart, even when I dated other people.

We gave living together a go last year, and it blew up spectacularly, days before my birthday. I ended up paying rent on an apartment I no longer lived in, but he did. 

We were apart for about 6 months, wherein I was very self-hating, and had a lot of ill-advised sexual relationships. I slept with an ex (screwing him up, which I feel terrible about); I slept with H; I slept with old friends; I slept with guys I met at Supercuts and places like that.

H told me, around Christmas, that he still loved me. We started dating around January. He told me he wanted to marry me once he was financially stable and I was out of school.

We moved in together, on a year lease, in June. And now we are fighting the same way we did last year. We have these great, wonderful days, weeks, then something blows up.

I feel like every time I try and tell him he's hurt my feelings, it turns into a fight. Even when he admits he's wrong, he acts like I was wrong for even bringing it up. 
He has rules about what I can ask him, when I can wake him up, how he wants ""alone time"" despite not having seen each other for essentially days.

He works nights and has class in the mornings. Usually he is asleep between 12 and 8 pm. I am not really allowed to wake him up during that time if I want to hang out or do something. I understand. I don't do that anymore.

But tonight, we went to dinner, and it was fun! We decided not to go to a movie after, as he'd had a long day doing intern work for school. We were gonna go home and watch Aliens 2. I stopped to get Rock of Ages at Redbox, because I really wanted to see it. I told him no less than 3 times that I was only gonna watch RoA until he was ready to watch Aliens. That I, in fact, WANTED him to come out when he was done resting. He verbally agreed.

We got home at 7:30. At 11, I decided to go to bed. He had not come out. He was semi awake when I came in, and I sarcastically thanked him for not coming out. He apologized, but (and he says he absolutely did NOT say ""but""; I say he did) he'd thought I would come wake him up when I was ready.

I told him I did not feel I was allowed to wake him up. We then fought.

We have made rules, that we both agreed to, about fighting. This is because we are both bad arguers. We do not communicate well when angry. In this case, I attempted to invoke our ""Calm down"" rule. If one person says calmly and patiently, ""calm down"" to the other, the other must immediately comply. This does not mean stop or shut up, just stop yelling or being as agitated.

Calm down made him angrier. Every time I attempted calm down, because he was going ballistic, and I was speaking in a normal tone, he would blow up more.

Eventually, we got to a point where he was absolutely red with rage. He was trying to leave the apartment, like he does when he is angry. This...

I'll admit, this, him leaving in anger in any context, puts me into an animal-hind-brain state of fear. This is how him breaking up with me last year happened. I don't want him to leave me. I want to fix us. I want him to stay and hug me and work things out.

So I was crying and begging him to not leave. He hates begging, but I really just can't help it. He says it's my way of CONTROLLING him. I don't understand his view of controlling, I really don't.

He told me to stop. I did not. He told me to stop, complete with mocking baby voice, mocking my gestures and mannerisms. He told me to stop crying, and if I kept crying he'd ""freak out.""

I cry when frustrated and scared. A lot. 

He said stop, I kept crying, and yes, begging him not to leave tonight... He punched my room fan. Blew it away. Shards of fan around the room, the bent stand on the ground with the motor still chugging, scraping up the floor.

I sat down, terrified. Speechless.

The moral of the story for him was that if he says stop, I stop everything immediately (although he mockingly gave in and told me I could keep crying).
I agreed, repeatedly.

But when I tried to get him to agree to the same terms when I say calm down, he kept screaming that I missed the point. 

Then he left, to get a new fan.
He blames me for HIM breaking it, and he's probably going to claim the new fan as his, despite his destruction of MY fan that I paid for.

Plus, I sent him a sarcastic text after he left, and now I'm afraid he won't come back tonight at all. My animal brain is tearing at me to call him, ask him if he's coming back, even though I know that he'd hate that. I have to be somewhere at 9 am tomorrow, and I can't sleep until he's back.

tl;dr - I don't know what I'm asking for; maybe keys to a magic kingdom, or a reset button for tonight."
1lddna,2,2013-08-29,"I have feelings for a friend and I'm not sure what to do about it. Long story, details inside.",[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1lddna/i_have_feelings_for_a_friend_and_im_not_sure_what/,"Alright so this whole thing has played out over four years, almost five. Bear with me please.


Junior year of high school I met this girl, lets call her Megan. We became friends right away and had what most people would classify as a ""thing"" over the summer before she called it off right as senior year was about to start. I may have been a bit of a rebound to her as she had just been broken up with about a month prior before we started to have our little fling. It didn't help that this was my first anything with a girl and, looking back, I acted clingy.


Things got more complicated when she started to date one of our good mutual friends, lets call him Dave, about 4-5 months after that. I was pretty sad about the whole thing until I met this one girl who was actually a very close friend of Megan's, let's call her Sara. Basically, everybody was happy. I got over Megan and enjoyed my time with Sara and Megan was happy with Dave.


Fast forward four or five months, again at the end of summer, Sara dumps me. Now this time I am completely fucking heartbroken over this, it's been two years since this has happened and I still get angry thinking about it sometimes. She left me for another guy who I had trusted her to hang out with (whole other story in itself) and we have only talked sparingly throughout these two years. Remember, Megan and Sara are very close.


Later that year (freshman year of college) Megan broke up with Dave after them dating for over year. Dave is also heartbroken. Megan and I start getting a little closer again after this happens. Nothing physical, we just got back to talking like we did before.



A year goes by of really nothing, were all just friends. Then, earlier this year (end of sophomore year of college) Megan and I are drunk at a friends party and start talking about the good times we had. We almost ended up making out (literally did nothing though) but decided against it because we didn't want to upset Dave if he found out.


I had noticed I had feelings again for Megan a little before that but they come and go so I didn't think much of them. For example, we tell each other everything and while I was talking to her about my girl problems one night something sparked inside of me and I remembered thinking ""What are you worried about Sara for? You've got a great girl right here."" And I noticed that I tend to gravitate towards Megan when our friends meet up, that she is the one I enjoy talking to the most, and I always want to talk to her when I'm drunk.


Fast forward till now and all four of us are at the same university. Yes, all four as in Megan, Dave, Sara, and I. I had just transferred literally this year. I hung out with Megan my first night here and we talked for a long while (we hadn't seen each other in 3 months because of an internship) and those feelings rekindled inside of me again. I really wanted to kiss her that night, especially after she had brought up the times we had years ago. But I know that I can't, Dave would be upset if we did, and I'm not sure if Megan even likes me that way. I honestly have no idea how Sara would react, but she is still dating the guy she dumped me for so I don't really care either way.


What do I do? Tell Megan and potentially ruin our great friendship again (let alone potentially both our friendships with Dave if she felt the same way)? Not say anything and try to meet someone new? After all new university, new people. I'm not sure, sorry this is so long. So many moving parts. But I saw Megan again today and had a hard time not thinking about wanting to be with her again.


edit: It might seem like I still have feelings for my ex if I still get angry about what happened. I don't trust her though and she has a lot of growing up to do. I'd like to say that I would choose not to date her again if I had the choice. Megan, on the other hand, is mature and honest."
1ldar8,1,2013-08-29,My whole life is about to revolve around an awful full-time job. I'm so scared and sad. Someone please listen.,[deleted],SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1ldar8/my_whole_life_is_about_to_revolve_around_an_awful/,"To give you guys some background, I'm a 20-year-old with a slew of anxiety/depression/sensory-based issues. To put it as simply as I can, I'm a nervous wreck who is constantly paranoid, constantly afraid, constantly sad, and constantly afraid of change. It's clear and evident that I have some (or multiple) forms of mental illness, but my mother is too ignorant to admit it, and my older, manipulative brother keeps guilt tripping me about getting help.

Anyway, it's been a year since I was last working. I worked at a small-scale retail environment, and I hated everything about it. At first, I was working six-day weeks, closing the store, then opening it up the next morning. I spent every waking moment of my life worrying and thinking about the job, being afraid, crying in the middle of the night, etc. I convinced my supervisor to let me work weekends only, and although it was much better, I was still a nervous wreck. Even when I was familiar with the job, I was extremely neurotic, scared and sad. I would constantly rush things and get sidetracked. I eventually quit after some family drama, and in that one year, a ton has happened. My family split apart (numerous deaths), my family became poor (barely any food in the house), my brother forced me to sell my mobile phone to ""help out"", pocketing the money for himself. Because of that, I haven't been able to communicate with my friends/family, go out, or even look for jobs.

So, here I am. I have an interview soon, for a similar job, and I am so flustered, sad and anxious. I heard about the interview several days before, and I've spent each day pacing around my room crying, panicking, fidgeting, and not talking to my mother/brother. The two of them think that I'm ""too used"" to being in my room all the time, and that this is going to be a ""good thing"" for me. They think that working another horrible job is going to make me happier and solve all of my mental issues. They think I'm sad when I'm on the computer, browsing Reddit, listening to music, but I'm actually very content. I'm happy. I'm even happy/funny around my brother/mother when this work stuff is out of the question. I've been told ""things will get better"", but they won't. Last year when I got the first job I was told that, and look where I am, now.

Anyway, my whole life is going to consist of walking to work, working, walking home, and being scared/nervous about working. I never thought it would be like this. There are people my age with fancy internships, and people that are traveling the world, and I'm scared shitless over a retail job. This is really the end. I can't see any way out of it. This is no way to live.

The worst part? They just think it's me being lazy. I keep trying to tell them how I feel, but I can't articulate myself. I just end up stuttering, stammering and throwing a little baby tantrum. They'll never know. &gt;_&lt;"

1lhc2e,4,2013-08-31,What's Behind the Painted Window?,[deleted],nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1lhc2e/whats_behind_the_painted_window/,"I have to believe this will end well. It’s the only thing currently keeping me alive: hope and a merciful captor. I can’t imagine how my parents are coping with my disappearance. They always loved me with the utmost intensity after my older sister went missing. I can’t believe it’s now happened to me. 

She was taken a few years back after we moved to our formerly new house. She complained about strange noises under the floorboards of her walk in wardrobe. My parents investigated but, of course, found nothing. They dismissed it as the paranoid fantasy of a teenage girl who missed her friends and hated moving to this new house. 

I found her two days ago. Her shock-stricken face was peeled back in an endless scream as it hung in the fake, painted window of a Paris apartment. I was walking by the open market one Saturday morning when I glanced upwards, my eyes following a startled flock of pigeons. And there she was, hanging there, arms raised above her head. My knees buckled under the weight of my grief, the old sense of loss suddenly renewed.

I went back to my first floor flat in Paris and that was when I started receiving the weird phone calls. I was busy writing a report for Le Monde, the French newspaper I was acting as the American intern for, when the phone rang. I picked it up without hesitating, thinking it was my boss.

“I’ll get this done as soon as possible, don’t worry Monsieur le Directeur.”

All I heard was breathing, constant and monotonous. 

“Umm,” I tried again, “this is Terry speaking, how can I help you?”

Still all I heard was breathing.

“I think you may have the wrong number.” I said, repeating the message in French incase they didn’t understand me. I hung up soon afterwards.

I thought nothing of it. I’d gotten wrong number calls before. The next night was stranger though. I’d submitted my article that day and went for a walk. I passed the painted window again, but this time, I didn’t see my sister. I chocked it up to some suppressed memory of buried sadness. But I couldn’t shake the feeling that something bad was going to happen. As a precaution, I checked my walking closet, remembering this was what my sister was worried about in the days before she went missing. Nothing abnormal was there. That was when the phone rang again.

“Hello, Terry speaking, how can I help y….”

“Did you like my artwork?” A male voice interrupted.

“I’m sorry?”

“My artwork,” he repeated, “you collapsed in front of it yesterday. I can only assume that you were in awe of it to give such a reaction.”

“I’m not sure what you’re talking about.” I weakly replied.

The voice on the other end suddenly took on a sharper tone.

“Oh come on you little bitch. You loved it didn’t you, seeing your sister in the window? I knew you would. I did it for you Terry, I did it for you!”

“What is this? How do you know about my sister? How do you know my name?”

“I know a lot about you, and I know about miss little complainer because I killed her! Listen here Terry, I won’t have my art ignored like some high school grade work from an amateur. You will appreciate…”

I hung up. I was so frightened by this call that I found the corner of my room and crumpled into it while tightly holding on to my stuffed bear. Tears began to stream down my face. I had a hard time sleeping that night, but I eventually succumb to the gentle call of sleep.

I woke up the next morning still shaken by the previous night. I called in sick to the paper and called my friend Victor from the opposite apartment. He worked at the boulangerie across from Le Monde headquarters where I worked. We hit it off on my first visit and he’d become a good friend. He came over since he was also taking the day off. I explained what had been happening and he suggested I get the phone line tapped if it happened again.

The phone rang. Victor was still there so I felt safe to pick it up.

“It.” The voice said.

“I’m sorry?” I replied.

“You didn’t let me finish my sentence last time. I wanted to say, ‘You will appreciate it!’ and yes, you will be sorry, very sorry if you ever hang up on me again.”

I gulped hard, and felt a bead of sweat begin to trickle down the side of my face. I signaled Victor to call the police. I stayed on the line with the voice and heard my friend explain to the police what was going on. I assumed them to be more than cooperating because Victor gave me a thumbs up. They tapped my phone line.

“Oh one more thing, if your friend ever gets in the way of my work again, I’ll pay him a visit, one which he won’t like.” 

The voice hung up. A few seconds passed when the phone rang again, making me jump.
“Hello? Mademoiselle? We tried tapping your phone line,” the French officer said, “but this man hung up before we could identify the origin of the call. We will stay tapped and listening in for the time being.”

“Merci beaucoup,” I thanked him, “please help me. I think this is the same man who murdered my sister. He admitted as much to me last night.”

“Did he say anything else to you mademoiselle? Last night I mean.”

“Yes, he said that he hung my sister in the frame of the fake window on la Rue du Meurtrier. But how is that possible? It isn’t a real one is it?” I was almost crying.

“This is very troubling miss, we’ll have a look into it. Now, I have to ask you to be very brave for us. We need to you pick up all the phone calls you get so we can trace this line. Can you do this?”

“I’ll try.”

“Good, now don’t worry, we will look into this, this window appearance. Have a good rest of the day if you can. Stay with company and don’t worry yourself into doing anything rash. We will go to this house straight away.”

The officer hung up as I was about to add in the threat the voice made towards Victor. And then it hit me, how did the voice know I had a friend over? I could actually think of a number of reasons. He could have stalked my dates with Victor, he could have a telescope peering through my windows or he could have bugged my apartment with a hearing device. I didn’t dare think of any of them at the time. Only now do I have time to reflect on them.

Victor went home a few hours later even after I begged him to stay. I understood though. He had his parents to think about in their last days. I tried to take my mind off things by watching a movie. I chose Dances With Wolves because it was a long film and it absorbed me every time I watched it. 

I fell asleep during the last minutes and awoke to a fuzzy television screen filled with static. The phone rang again. I bounded over to the handset with surprising energy and placed the receiver to my ear.

“Wake up sleepy dead head!” He chuckled at his own terrible sense of humor. “Enjoy the movie? I know I did. It was a bit long though. And yes, I can hear everything in your three room apartment.”

“What do you want?” I yelled down the line, “why did you kill my sister?”

“She hung up on me after I told her not to. So I came to your house in West County Pennsylvania and dragged her into her closet. There I ripped out her eyes with a spoon, I gutted her with a letter opener, I cut off her ears and nose with a blunt pair of scissors and finally broke her neck with my own hands.”

“Shut up you liar! I was there the night of her disappearance, we all were. None of us heard anything!”

“I took her down to my room. There was a door under the carpet in her closet. Check yours. I think you’ll find one there too. Yes, I lived under your house for years before my so-called family sold it to you. After all, it was once mine. Of course, they’d left me down there for so long, it probably didn’t cross their minds to take me with them.”

“I wish you’d starved down there.” I shouted at him, “no wonder your parents abandoned you in the dark.”

Feeling sure the police had traced the call by now and were on their way to arresting this psychopath, I hung up. The lights went off. I was left in the dark.

Why the fuck did I hang up?

He burst out my closet and grabbed me. He dragged me kicking and screaming through the trapdoor under the carpet in the third room of my apartment. 

He bound my hands and feet to pull me through the sewer system of Paris. We came out under la Rue du Meurtrier. It seems fitting that he lives on the Street of Murders. He took me up to his apartment, the one with the fake window. I was too exhausted to cry out anymore. 

I never heard from Victor or the police again. He keeps me in the window and I’m ever looking out over Paris, the personification of hope and freedom. Staring at liberty and letting his victims write letters, is his way of tormenting those he takes. I’ve seen him bring back many girls now. He kills them in front of me each time. I don’t know why he keeps me alive. I’m too weak to kill myself but I wish he’d taken me those years ago, instead of my sister.

I have to believe this will end well. It’s the only thing currently keeping me alive: hope and a merciful captor. I can’t imagine how my parents are coping with my disappearance. I hope they find this man, and kill him.

They said that they're willing to provide outstanding references to anywhere I pursue next, just a slight problem for me is due to specific circumstances, while I would like to I am unable to go back to school right now, and am going to need to look for a source of income.

I'm looking for some advice as to the best thing for me to do to find a job in London, while I don't need a huge amount of money I do need a small income which will enable me to begin to save. I realise my age counts against me, and I did however manage to royally fuck up my education so that is something which is also going to count against me, but hopefully I'm able to compensate for that by producing, stable, good quality work.

If you're looking for a little bit of information about me, I can use Java, Scala, Groovy, Python, Ruby, D and more, and I can pickup a language to a decent level in around a week, I have experience with Django, Play! and web.py, and am able to pickup a new library with ease.

1lgyyt,4,2013-08-31,My Parental Altercation and Why You Shouldn't Smoke Joints in The Basement.,JointsInTheBasement,trees,https://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/1lgyyt/my_parental_altercation_and_why_you_shouldnt/,"I am 17 (turning 18 tomorrow) and have finally been caught by my parents for smoking cannabis.  The first time I smoked I was 15, I liked it but it just didn't come up again. When I turned 16 I began to smoke maybe once every 3 months, then it became more often as my friends did and we went to concerts, went camping, had a blast while responsibly enjoying pot. 

Most recently with my own bowl, stash, and lighters I began to smoke my bowl 2 or 3 times a week when my parents were sleeping or out for a few hours. I did the same yesterday and it all went great, then an hour later while high I decided that since I hadn't smoked a joint in a long time I would roll one and smoke it in my basement by the Bilco door that lead outside as usual. 

I finished up, went upstairs, disposed of the end of the joint, and began to put my pot away. As I was doing this my parents arrived at home, I wasn't worried and I sat down at my computer. However, I didn't have time to Febreeze and joints smell fowl. 

The first thing my mother says when she comes to my room is ""It smells like pot, does it smell like pot?!"" her and my father both smelled my room and I denied hoping for the best. Once they left my room I hopped in the shower as I hadn't showered since the day before. When I got out my parents wen't downstairs and the smell was undeniable. 

My father asked what I had been doing and I replied, ""Smoking cannabis"" and my father remarked ""Alone in the basement like an alcoholic"". That hurt, along with the comments on how much of an asshole I am and how he thought I was smarter than this. 

I tried explaining to them that it isn't a dangerous drug and that I will be able to balance my top of the line grades while maintaining the habit. I work extremely hard in school and maintain a steady payed internship at a local programming company. I am far from stupid yet upon the realization that I smoke pot I am instantly in the eyes of my parents a dumb pothead. I attempt to say that it doesn't make you stupid and that it is decriminalized in our state so their isn't any large penalties for doing it. Yet my attempt to discuss it with my parents only leads to them getting angry because ""I am trying to be smart"" and am ""arguing with them"" despite my calm mannered statement of facts. 

So, this morning my dad asks if I will be smoking any pot and I reply telling him of course not. He asks how much I have, I state 7 grams, and he asks for it. I get the Tupperware from my closet and hand him it with 7 grams, a bowl, matches, and a lighter. I wish they would listen to me and realize how harmless it is but alas, it is there house, there rules.

TL;DR: Been smoking bowls, smoked a joint instead in the basement, admitted to it after parents smelled it, parents won't listen to any of my reasoning, confiscate pot.  "
1lgyg0,41,2013-08-31,"I can't tell if my (28f) husband (34M) is cheating; fits all obvious ""warning"" signs but something in me still believes him!",Sadpanda85,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1lgyg0/i_cant_tell_if_my_28f_husband_34m_is_cheating/,"**Backstory**
Husband wanted  sudden divorce a few weeks ago; took me by shock. Not even a week after an intern asks him out and gives her phone number. Says he's married. Declines; I believe him. Intern tweets about him during this, specifically ""about to be full-on inappropriate."" 

Says boss tells him to lock his phone for work; gives me the PIN. No big. He changes it. His behavior radically changes. Becomes possessive over phone. Will not let me touch it. Will not unlock in my presence. He makes sure to turn his phone away when I'm near. I value my own phone privacy, but he used to leave it unlocked downstairs far away from him until this point. 

We have a fight. Picks at me for son's bathing routine. I go downstairs to talk more. His back is to me. Texting someone long texts. Immediately shuts off display and says he's talking to ""Jim Bob"" the co-worker. I mention that he has ""Jim Bob"" saved in phone. This is an unsaved number. Say's it's ""Aunt Lora."" In five years, I've never heard of him talking to her ONCE. He's mentioned her only once or twice. He will NOT show me the text. Realizing his mistake, he says it's ""Jim Bob"" on an air-card type device, texting from a laptop. Person texts him again later; he becomes emotional over text. 99% sure an emotional text is not coming from a male coworker.

More ""classic"" cheating signs that on their own could be innocent, but together looks pretty damn suspicious: Losing weight and exercising to an extreme, which is great but given other drastic changes and adopting new grooming habits or the first time in our whole relationship. Taking a toothbrush, toothpaste, and floss with him everywhere. Dressing nicer. Spending more time on his hair. Wearing clothing items that the intern actually mentioned in his tweets. 

Drop-off in physical intimacy.  I get things are rocky, but we had sex a week before he wanted the sudden divorce. Now he won't even properly kiss me. He says he needs time. He said after being together five years, he regretted having sex with me ""so soon."" He said it screwed with him. Extreme remarks.

I tell him these things. A serious email to which I expect a serious reply. To communicate he isn't cheating on me, he says ""I'm (His name here)!"" So, he's most likely a cheater AND a narcissist. This is a day after we talked about communicating.

**And last night:**
He always calls me after work when he night shifts. This night he was staying at a friends because he travels over 90 miles a day for work. Texts me he's off; won't call. Texts me he's going to bed. No answers. After he promised to call (trust comes from small things). Later admitted he was selfish. Last time he texted and wouldn't call, he got super drunk an hour away from the house and drove home.

Said he went to bed before 10. When he goes to bed early, he gets up early. About six. He had a late night he's lying about. Your sleep patterns don't dramatically change. Said he overslept for work until 8:25 because he was on a couch and it was ""hot in the room.""

Come morning. Said he shouldn't be on the phone driving. That's his BS excuse for not calling the night before. Of all nights he's called me, he chooses this night to rethink his driving safety? When he's staying at a friend's house for the night?

Said phone died. That he woke at 8:25 and that he plugged it in. Said it took about five mins and Apple icon appeared. Given our issues, asked him to send me a screenshot of his presumably very low battery. Was agitated, but said he would send. At 8:40 he told me his phone was at 30%. Why am I supposed to believe his phone had charged to 30% between 8:25 and 8:40?

Cue new lie to cover crazy story. But before that, he actually said he saw a ""missed call"" from me at 8:02 AM. You know you don't see missed calls while phone is off or dead. Doesn't show ""missed"" when you turned it back on, but he tried to tell me it did. Phone never went straight to VM.

Cover another lie, he says maybe it wasn't dead. I asked why he'd need to charge it if it wasn't, and said after he plugged it in that he saw an Apple icon then fine. He said this morning he hit the top button and it didn't respond (what are the odds) so he assumed it was dead.

**TL;DR** Husband chronically lies about small things in the past. After knowing a woman asked him out, he totally changed grooming patterns, guarded his phone carefully, and spiraled out of controls with lies I mostly caught him in. He explains every bit of it away, and somehow part of me still believes him. 

So, /r/relationships, what do you think? I really want to believe him, but he's not doing anything to earn my trust. People who tell the truth usually have simple stories and simple explanations. He's seemed to have complex stories to cover lie after lie. 

**EDIT** Okay, so I tried to keep things short (this was already wall of text) but we had resolved to try to work things out. His biggest issue is that he wasn't in love with me anymore. That's what he told me. Tonight he actually let me see his phone and I had the first inkling to look at what he's told his mom. Bam. She has secretly arranged for him to meet a lawyer, and he's said things like ""I""ll go on Wednesday and she'll think I'm at work"" or ""She almost caught me before."" 

He's swearing up and down to me that he's going along with it to keep his mother docile. She keeps calling."

1lggjj,46,2013-08-31,"My [F22] Ex [M22] didn't cheat on me, but what he did wasn't a whole lot better in my opinion",sur_pris_ed,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1lggjj/my_f22_ex_m22_didnt_cheat_on_me_but_what_he_did/,"My [F22] ex [M22] and I had been in a committed relationship for four months up until a week ago. we met through a club that I had just joined and was super excited about because it was something I had really wanted to do and he was an exec member. I thought the relationship was going great. Part of it was LD as we are university students and he went home for July and August, but it was only about 2hrs and I drove up to see him every other weekend plus we texted every day. He was very sweet, constantly telling me how important to him I was and how great he thought this relationship was and how compatible we were. I got along great with his family and friends, they all loved me.


Cue one week before breakup. I went up to see him for the weekend and we were at a soccer tournament when I meet a friend of his [F18]. She seemed nice enough but she did things that seemed a little odd to me. She would be super sweet hugging and running up to him if I wasn't standing right beside him and was a little bit away, but the moment I was near him she basically avoided all eye contact. Everytime he got up to play, she would get her camera out and take like 30 pictures of him, just him. I mentioned this all to him and he was like, ""ya she's got a bit of a crush"". I'm pretty laid back plus he typically has a lot of friends who were girls and flirty with him. He's a very flirty person, not just with women but with everyone, so I shrugged it off.


The week before the breakup she posted on his facebook wall about 3 times a day. Typically about how she was spending the day with him and how happy that made her. This annoyed me but I didn't confront him because I have lots of guy friends I hang out one on one with because of the program I'm in (Mechanical Engineering), and I didn't want to be a hypocrite. I figured she was just one of those girls who posts when they go to the bathroom on facebook and he was just looking for someone to hang out with while at home. Also this whole week he was calling me hun and love and baby and we were talking like normal, so I never thought anything was wrong. 


He came down to our university town last saturday for a club thing. He texted me that he was there on saturday and said he wanted to see me, promptly breaking up with me when I got to his house. I got ""this relationship is perfect for me, exactly what I wanted, but the timing is wrong, I'm not ready to be committed to someone."" I felt shell shocked, I thought everything was great between us. I drove over to my best friends to cry. 


She made me remember some reasons why we weren't really compatible. I'm doing an internship right now at a prestigious company where I make very good money and graduating the year after and going to go do my masters. I'm the kind of person that always has direction in my life. He failed out of second year university a year ago, took a year off to find himself while working a 15hr per week minimum wage part time job, and was supposed to go back to school this year next week, but has decided he needs another year off and wants to do this job again. This had concerned a very small part of me but I didn't consider it a deal breaker because I figured he would get his butt in gear this year and get a better job. I didn't think that he would break up with me because he wanted to continue this care free lifestyle.


24hrs later when I went to remove the facebook ""in a relationship"", I noticed posts on his wall both the day we broke up and the day after. The fresh out of high school 18 year old had posted all over his facebook about the wonderful night she spent with him and how much she enjoyed their date...the night he broke up with me.  I deleted everything I had from him and blocked him. NC lasted a week until there was something for the club we are in that we needed to do together. Mutual friends tell me she still continues to post about wonderful days and nights they have together all over his fb wall.


Yesterday when he came back to university town perminantly, we had a sit down conversation to trade stuff back and everything, but mostly to talk because we are in the same club and we had something to sort out. After finishing what we needed to do, we talked about the breakup. I explained that yes the breakup hurt and I was surprised because I liked our relationship, but I had deleted him off everything because his new fling had gone nuts over his wall and I felt very hurt by it. He basically said how it was all her, he told her to tone it down but she hadn't, and he realized how bad it made him look.....no I'm sorry I rubbed it in your face or I realize that it was inconsiderate to your feelings to do so. All about him. He also admitted to them sleeping together the night we broke up. But he says he didn't cheat on me because he cared so much about me. We left it at that because we still need to interact again. He asked me if I would be ok to see her if she came to visit him and I said absolutely not. 


I'm confused and kind of feel slapped in the face. I don't feel like what he did was a whole lot better than cheating, jumping ship that night. I realize he's not the right person for me, and that conversation made it even more clear, but overall I just feel embarrassed and disrespected.I don't know how to explain it to our mutual friends without trash talking him, because I don't feel what he did was better than cheating. Am I wrong about the morality of his actions?


tldr; Boyfriend jumped ship and dated/slept with another girl the night we broke up. She then proceeded to post about it all over facebook and he let her. I feel disrespected.

1lg4g7,6,2013-08-31,Majorly embarrassing moment overcome!,Jalinja,socialanxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/1lg4g7/majorly_embarrassing_moment_overcome/,"I am 15 years old, and over the last two or three years I have been developing social anxiety. A few months ago I told my parents that I needed help. They both pushed me to see a doctor, which I eventually decided to do. It was not a pleasant experience for someone with social anxiety, as I was talking to somebody one on one, and it definitely didn't help that the doctor was nearly as awkward as I was. The doctor wanted me to go to therapy instead of medicine, but I convinced him that just the thought of going to a therapist would keep me awake at night. I was then prescribed with medication.

The medication seemed to do nothing. It was very sad to me, as I thought that I was going to continue to live with social anxiety.

The one month check-in appointment with my doctor might just have been the peak of my anxiety. I was in tears begging my dad to not make me go, knowing that my social anxiety was as bad as ever, and that I would have to tell my doctor to his face that he was wrong, and should have prescribed a higher dosage of medicine (at least that's the way I was looking at it). 

To make matters worse, when I entered my doctor's office, there was a beautiful intern at the table. Being an awkward teenager, talking to pretty girls isn't my greatest skill. Instead of just sitting back and taking notes, she was the one asking the questions. I simply couldn't handle telling the truth, and ended up telling her and the doctor that everything was perfect with the medicine.

I cried myself to sleep many times in the following week, my parents being oblivious, and me being too anxious to tell them anything. Fortunately for me, I had a few shots due, and ended up at the hospital again. Even more fortune was in store for me, as the awkward doctor who I talked (typed?) about earlier was on vacation. 

The doctor I had instead was a friend of my dad, and was good at keeping a steady conversation going. He asked about my anxiety (meaning I didn't even need to bring it up) and I told him that I thought I needed a higher dose. He doubled my dose with no further questions.

The new dose has made me feel much more comfortable in all social situations, and it has made me a happier person overall. The only time I felt anxious at all was before the first day of soccer practice, but it still felt more controlled, perhaps even normal.

At long last, the title event- Alright, so you already know that I play soccer. The embarrassing moment came in the middle of a game, when I was throwing in a ball. Last year in soccer I was nervous about throw-ins, but the medication rid me of that. Anyways, all of the parents on the sidelines, the players on the field and benches, and the coaches were looking at me. I was sweating from all of the running, and I often wiped the sweat off my forehead with my palm, causing them to be even sweatier than the rest of my body. I pulled the ball back over my head and threw my arms forward over my head, but the ball slipped out, flying backwards into the crowd of parents. The entire area erupted into laughter. Where I usually would have buried my face in my hands, trying to avoid all eye contact, I joined the laughter. This is how I know my medicine is working. Thanks for reading! For all of you suffering from social anxiety, just see a doctor! It will change your life.

Thanks for your time.",[deleted],whatsbotheringyou,https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsbotheringyou/comments/1lg0nt/im_a_tad_bit_drunk_while_writing_so_im_sorry_for/,"I don't really know where to start, but I'll try. I've always been told that by my closest friends that I have problems showing my emotions. I typically just bottle them up until one day, the bottle breaks.

A year ago, I was broken up by a girl I honestly wanted to propose to (but being in college, I never had the finances to). I didn't really know what to do, so I drank profusely. It numbed the pain enough to where I could function with others. I met girls but for the most part a few just led me on, except for one. I knew I wasn't something she deserved. So I cleaned myself up, I stopped smoking (but its still a habit that comes back every month or so) and cut back on the drinking. When I finally found myself to be something worth her time, I told her how I felt. But she was studying abroad the next semester and didn't want to start a serious relationship (in fact, she didn't want one to drag her down while she was abroad).

Fast forward to the summer, I lost my internship due to Congress not making a budget and had to move home. I love my parents, but being home had always reminded me of what I lost. I was never able to find a job in my hometown so I was always lonely. I began spending more time with my father because of it. My father and I really bonded, but he began telling me things I didn't need to know. He would comment on how, as soon as I graduate he was most likely going to divorce my mother. I have no idea how to handle that (or even how to talk to a friend about it).

So school finally starts and I go back to school. I see all these people I hadn't seen in months and it was exciting, but one thing started to bother me: I was a third wheel. A majority of my friends are in relationships with each other and then you just have me. But a few of my friends got a new roommate. She's nice and we both kind of hit it off, but I'm afraid to really try dating her. The last year has been rough on me emotionally. I've been used and don't really know how to handle anything.

So there are a lot of my problems, I didn't go into too much detail (I've been drinking for about 10 hours by now and its hard to type)."

He has a genuine interesting in helping as many people as possible reach there potential and life coaching his the medium he has chosen. 


Tony Robbins are one of the mentors he's chosen to learn from and this November he will be attending his event and has a free ticket. He offered it to me because he feels I will greatly benefit from it and I think I will also, what does the rest of reddit think? 


I am 20 years old and I have a few interest that I would like to follow, ultimatly with whatever I do I'd like to be an entrepreneur. 


I love photography so I would love to set up an online blog to express my opinions and show my work, I'd like to profit from it one day. 


I had an internship as a stock broker and learned a ton about the stock market and have used it/using it as a way to get extra income. 


I want to one day invest in small bussiness as a partial owner for residual income and even get involved in real estate. Maybe with a few wholesale deals and working up to flips then eventually rental properties that I then hire a property manager to manage. 


I also would like to become a United states Marine  for a few reasons but mainly because I feel it's something I want to experience. The lifestyle and adventure mixed with the opportunity to improve and prepare for everything else I want to do. 

The Marines won't let me join till March earliest so I have some time, I've been feeling in a rut. 

After a lengthy talk with my best friend he told me that it's mainly because I feel I'm not working towards my purpose. We spent some time trying to discover it and eventually concluded like him that what I spent most of my time on was learning new subject matter and helping those around me improve and live out there dreams. 

Now I'm considering and really resonating with the idea that my purpose is to help as much people as possible to improve themselves and life up to there expectations of themselves.  

As side investments to generate income I'd still love to do all the things listed above and the Marines would be a great way to explore and experience things in a way only military people have. 

So anyway that's where I am, don't know if this is the right place to post but..

Based on what I've said do you think Tony could help me? Should I forget some things and focus on others? I just want some opinions 

Tl:DR feed back on Tony Robbins effectiveness to help figure our ones true purpose in life. "

I know I should be volunteering and looking for internships but I don't have the energy. I can hardly get out of bed to go to classes...I am doing well in school and I had a job I loved up until a few days ago when I quit due to an argument with a manager. In addition to worrying about graduating and finding a job I have to worry about money... I hate depending on my parents because we never got along and my boyfriend agreed to pay more than half of rent but he can't afford it all and I wouldn't want him to pay too much anyway. So basically I'm back in a depressed mood, leading to lack of motivation and fatigue, leading to more stress because I'm useless, leading to more depression :/ I hate that I can't handle the usual things that go with life even though I have been on antidepressants for 4 years..."

Better get your VAX-inations,Nekkidbear,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/1lfpvf/the_lusers_are_running_the_asylum_better_get_your/,"The story about moving the phones in a call center reminded me of one of my earliest jobs in IT. In the early 90's I was (theoretically) a work-study student in the telecom department for my local community college campus. Mostly it meant I got paid to do my homework or play Minesweeper on the boss's cool new Windows NT system! I remember watching my supervisor (an ex navy man) troubleshoot our old PBX and try to keep it working. Even then, if parts went bad, we had to find a reseller for boards because they weren't making new parts for that model.

 Most of my time however was spent pulling cables for new phone setups, tracing the circuits to document the wiring, and logging the day's tickets in the logbook. I loved it because it was one of my first real jobs and I was getting some valuable experience. We were a satellite campus so it was my boss, me, and another intern.

The other intern worked days and I worked evenings. He was known for slacking off, and doing things 'whenever'. I never met the guy except in passing, but between hearing the supervisor's grumbles and trying to make heads or tails out of the tickets he worked on, I knew this guy was not the best tech in the world. I might not have been good either, but I worked hard and tried my best.

My supervisor and I were the newcomers to the team, the other intern had been there long before us. When we came on there were a bazillion outstanding tickets (the majority of which were quick to fix) and none of them completed. The few that were completed were just randomly tossed in helter-skelter without any indication of logging and there was no documentation just 'fixed' or 'completed'. My supervisor set up a logging and filing system and stated whipping the office into shape.

Being a community college, the big 'thing' in the department was setting up for registration. The school had a VAX system to manage their student database. For registration this involved a frankenstein network of used DEC terminals (for the uninitiated think of a CRT monitor with a NIC and a keyboard port)  connected via flat, silver 8-conductor cables to a hub/bridge, which in turn were networked back to the VAX via BNC cables and co-ax. Every semester/quarter we would have to set this network up for a couple of weeks in the atrium, and then dismantle it once registration was over.

Prior to his arrival, when they would dismantle this monstrosity, they just threw all of the ribbon cables in a box, and put the coax in another. The next year they would take weeks setting it back up as they tried to find, test and or remake the cables they needed for the setup. Sometimes they would use a 20-ft cable for a 5 foot run between the terminal and the router/bridge, pooling the extra yardage on the floor by the user's feet. Other times they would stretch a 10 foot cable completely taut for a 12-foot run. After my first or second semester, my supervisor started standardizing the layout.

Instead of having random cables of oddly varying lengths, we cut and made cables to the correct length (with slack) for each run and harnessed them together properly with zip ties. Then we marked which terminal each end went to and designated the hub end from the terminal end. He made maps of the layout, too. These changes cut setup time from 1-2 weeks to a couple of days.

Things went swimmingly for a few semesters. Setting up registration was fast and relatively painless, issues were actually getting tracked and followed up on, and faculty didn't have to wait for their phone/VAX installs. Then it happened. My supervisor left for greener pastures.

The new supervisor had been the tech for both campuses before he was promoted to head of IT. (The guy who left things in such an undocumented mess before I came on.) Suddenly all my tickets dried up. When I came in for the evenings, there were no after hours installs or for me to do, no tickets to log. There were clearly work orders getting filled out, but nothing was in my inbox, but glancing at the other two guys boxes, they had tickets that had been open for weeks, and some were things I could handle. However there was a standing rule about not 'stealing' work from another technician. Another day my coffee cup got 'accidentally' knocked into the trash can. (When I left the previous day it had been on the shelf the 'good' supervisor let me use, and it happened to be above the trash can. The next day the shelf was clear and all my paperwork and things were in the trash.)

I hung on for a few more weeks. They ordered name plaques for the new technician and 'his' intern, but not for me. When they were installed, I put my name on a piece of paper and taped it in the third spot. When i came in the next day, it had been torn down. I finally got the message and submitted my resignation.

I'm not sure how far downhill things went after I left. I kept attending a few more semesters, working at the local grocery store, and I noticed around registration time that they weren't using the pre-measured harnesses I helped make. They had cut the zip ties and were just stringing them along the tables willy nilly again. Oh, well...

**tl; dr--** You load 16 tons and what do you get? Another day older and deeper in debt. St. Peter don't you call me 'cause I can't go! I owe my soul to the company store...
