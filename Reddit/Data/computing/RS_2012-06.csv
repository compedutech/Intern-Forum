I got a Masters in CS with a near-perfect GPA from a good school, did an internship that evolved into a dev role, and eventually got hired at what I considered my dream job.

The ""dream job"" eventually started getting tedious and I found it difficult to concentrate, so I mixed things up. I left things on a great note and I took a year off and traveled the world with my girlfriend.

Now I'm back, and I have a wide-open door to go back to the old job, but it feels so much like a step backwards and I'm not sure I want to. Despite that, I don't really see any other job postings that seem more appealing. I have an entrepreneurial bent and would love to do my own thing, but I'm in some kind of a post-trip funk and it seems irresponsible to work on a startup full-time with no real traction after such a long time out of the workforce. I've been on such a set career path for my whole life that it feels really weird being home and at this kind of crossroads. I feel like it's an important turning point and that if I could really get passionate about something and apply myself right now it would shape the rest of my life.

Has anyone experienced something similar? How would you go about making this decision/kicking your butt into gear?"

I have been doing very good in school, and in interviews I feel that I have held my own. So reddit, what do you think I can do to finally land that first internship, or even land a job? Any tips on ways to present myself more positively?

I feel like I cannot be the only one who has this problem. Engineering in my mind was a great career choice because a) i enjoy it, b) it pays well, and c) at the time when i applied, it seemed like there were engineering jobs everywhere. Now, I cannot seem to find anything.

On top of that, where would you recommend me to go to find a solid internship listing that has a subsection for electrical and computer engineers (though not programming - this is not my expertise in any way except for VHDL hardware logic programming)?"

I tried contacting her for about a week but I didn't hear back from her so I assumed she was busy getting ready for her summer internship (moving, meeting her roommates, etc.) but last night she sent me a text message saying that she wanted to talk to me and this morning she called and told me that after a ton of tests the doctors found out that the stomach pain was caused by leukemia. 

We talked for a little while and she said she's already started chemotherapy (yesterday, in fact) and that she's just so afraid of what's going to happen. She already can't participate in her internship, might not be back in the fall, and just so many things that she was looking forward to.

Hey Reddit, I’m struggling with a job hunt and I’m looking for feedback/guidance/direction/a sounding board.

I’m in my mid-early 30s, married for 8 years to a wonderful woman who is a little older than me.  We have a 14 month old daughter – the absolute light of my life –and we just found out that my wife is pregnant with our second.  We would love for this to be an exciting time, but our financial/employment situation is making our future tremendously scary, to say the least.

I have always had trouble with employment.  I have a college degree, but it’s in the impractical field of film studies.  While I’m in California, I have no desire to work in film production.  I have a family to provide for, and film work is nothing if not intermittent.  Aside from an internship in a film production office more than a decade ago, I haven’t really worked in the film industry at all.

After college, I spent a couple of years – great years – working for an international resort company.  I designed and built theatrical sets and was de-facto stage manager for their nightly stage shows.  I left this company after 9/11 when I decided that I wanted to be closer to home.  I found a job in southern California working at another resort theater, first as a stage hand, then eventually as their technical director.  My stage manager connected me with a friend of hers who had a video production company (think wedding videos and such) and I was able to work part time with him.  The money wasn’t great, but I added a little more to my resume.  In that time, my wife (then girlfriend) and I started dating long distance.  She was a high school teacher and had tenure, so after two years with this particular theater at something like $10/hr, it made sense for me to relocate to where she was.  I was still in SoCal, but too far away to keep working for the theater or production house.  Before I moved, I asked video production owner-guy if they would have a full-time position for me because the theater schedule was just about the exact opposite of my wife’s (at this point, upgraded to fiancé) schedule.  He made an effort to create a position for me, but things took too long to fall in to place, so like I said, I ended up relocating.  No hard feelings.  Shortly after relocating, my wife and I got married.

Over the next two years, I worked for a “marketing” company, but really my time was spent in a warehouse issuing credits for damaged office furniture.  After a year and a half of this, I got an internship, and commuted an hour one-way three times a week to catalogue tapes for a small production company that had connections to the music scene in Long Beach. (the band Sublime, the Ziggens, etc.)  They asked me to edit a few things for them, and I told them that if I was editing, I needed to get paid.  So they wrote me a check for $13/hr.  At this point, I had a bit of a crisis and panicked, because how is a man supposed to support a family in SoCal at $13/hr? (My wife and I still had not had kids yet, but we knew we wanted to, and I was working towards becoming a provider.)

I called my dad, who has had a great deal of success in the insurance/financial services.  I lived many hours away, and we talked about me getting my insurance license and going to work with him in a sort of mentorship relationship.  My wife did not want to do this, as she would lose her tenure.  My argument was that if I was to ever become the provider for our family, we needed to take steps that would put me into that position.  I got my insurance license, and we made the move to a place I’ll just call “the coast.”

About 8 months after we got to the coast, my dad bailed.  He was having trouble with the company we worked for and got a great job in a somewhat similar industry, and there was no room to bring me along.  I wasn’t too bothered, because I picked up his entire book of business and was hoping to nurture that into more sales (read:income).  At the same time, I was also working part time for my church.  They had installed this $75,000 video system and really didn’t know what to do with it, so they paid me about $25,000/yr to design the weekly presentations on it, to keep the campus’ network running, and just be an all-around tech guru.  During this time, I also really built up my photoshop, design and visual presentation skills.  I redesigned the church’s logo and built a sort of brand identity for them.  If it weren’t for the money from my church job, I don’t know how we would have made it.  It supplemented the irregular and inconsistent commissions I was getting.  I wasn’t really cut out for insurance sales.  I have major “call reluctance.”  Who wants to get a call from their insurance guy?  Who wakes up in the morning and says “I want to buy life insurance today?”  So the insurance side of my income stagnated, and there was no room for advancement at my church.

At the same time, my wife was really struggling as well.  We’re now in 2007-8-9, and she had lost her tenure when she changed school districts.  Each year, she would get laid off because she was the most recent hire.  She’s a fantastic teacher – the best, really – so her references were often able to get her hired on in another nearby district.  Still, the job hoping took its toll on our peace of mind and our income.

Two years ago, we found out my wife was pregnant with our first.  While income was not great, we had insurance and we were supporting ourselves.  I still wasn’t making enough to support us all, and my wife couldn’t realistically teach and be a mom at the same time.  She puts so much energy into her teaching job – it’s easily 60 hours/week if not more.

After my daughter was born, my dad had gone back to work for a business owned and operated by our extended family.  This business was located in “the desert,” and was on its last legs due to some health problems my uncle was having.  Dad was trying to keep the business running, and wanted my help.  I put on my negotiating hat and got a large enough salary that I could support my family and we could buy a house.  Due to the lower cost of living in “the desert,” we could finally reach our goals of owning a home and having my wife stay home to be a mom for our infant daughter.

Unfortunately, this family business was doomed before dad even got here.  I won’t get into it, but I got to watch the bank seize all of the company’s assets and destroy my grandparents’ legacy.  This was all due to stuff that had been set in motion a few years back.  Dad and I still saw value in the intangible assets of the company, so we took the customer list and a few of the strongest employees and started a leaner, meaner company.  For six months now, this new company has hobbled along.  We haven’t received any outside funding, and it’s expensive to start a company, especially in California.  We’re working on an SBA loan, but the banks aren’t exactly eager to lend these days.  There has been multiple times where I didn’t know if I was going to get a paycheck, or it’s been delayed by a few days.   

And that’s where I am today.  I’ve got a new house payment, a wife who works too hard to do what she’s always done and still be a mom at the same time, and a job that pays decent money when it pays, but I don’t know if I’m going to see a paycheck next week.  I’m applying for work all over right now, because I’m tired of being afraid of my own ability to pay all of our bills on time.  I want decent income, and I want stability.

Most of the jobs I’m looking at are either entry level and pay about $25,000/yr, or they are specialist positions that require years of experience in a specific field.  So reddit, where should a guy like me go?  I’m a jack-of-all-trades, master of none.  I can do basic graphic design, I have an eye for marketing and presentation.  My experience in theater and time with my church has taught me the importance of precision timing in live production. I’ve been the network admin for three different small business networks.  I think my strategy should be to market myself to a small/medium organization that needs a little bit of all those things, but doesn’t need to hire a specialist in any one field. Am I on the right track?  And if so, how do I find an organization like that?  It’s not like careerbuilder.com turns up something when I search for design/marketing/presentation/IT guru.

**tl;dr:** I’ve have had a series of jobs, but no career.  At a point where I need “career” income.  Where do I go looking for a career with my unique set of skills?"

Few days ago, when I asked the local branch president to see if I could avoid paying administrative fee (since i do administration) so i can go for an internship, he said no, and brushed me off.  I got offended so i wrote mail titled ""Objection."" Since I don't have much money (poor student on a scholarship in foreign country) this means i will miss a good opportunity...
Response from the guy wasn't nice, so i told him what i think and left them to their own misery. I was there twice a week, for 8 months.
What are your experiences?

Realized that copying entire email correspondence is futile, here is selected stuff from hate mail i am proud of:
Point is that there is no wish to act, and act you can. Hiding behind regulations and bashing my morals won't change that.
In that spirit there can be no respect from me to you. Respect is reserved for people that earn it. Only fool gives it for granted.
And you are responsible, and you should take it seriously. 
Ah, about coming to LCs. I would rather take my testicles out with a pocket knife than loosing my youth there.
There will be no further discussion on this topic from my side, since I didn't expect or got any kind of honest response.
I hope you burn in fires of Kazad Dum (just kidding)

Anybody else looking?,ChrisloriousHD,columbusclassifieds,https://www.reddit.com/r/columbusclassifieds/comments/ufo1k/still_never_got_an_apartment_situation_settled/," A friend and I have been trying to get an apartment for a couple months now and because we are younger (I'm 19 and he's 18) we haven’t been able to find anywhere that will take us without a cosigner. This is based upon our lack of credit scores and rental history (cause you know, we can really control that….).

 At this point I am open to finding somebody who has the credit that would like to get the townhouse with us in Worthington that we were looking at (with utilities and 3 people it should be about $270 a month per person). I'm also willing to move in with somebody who is looking for a roommate, either both of us or just me, I'm just ready to be on my own again.

 I have good credit (for my age, 647) and a steady 40 hour a week job. I am an intern IT at a programming company. I am attending classes at Strayer University online and I have a steady girlfriend that I have been dating for 14 months. I grew up in a Christian home. I’m allergic to dogs and cats but I wouldn’t mind having either, I am cool with coping xD. I love dogs and cats both. I normally sit at my computer or play Xbox. I’m a calm mature person. I keep my areas clean and I help keep shared areas clean.

   I’ve been looking for a while. I moved here to attend classes at DeVry a year ago (literally a year today actually, oddly enough). I was placed into an apartment through them. The first apartment I was in I had to deal with druggy drunk roommates and I couldn’t handle it. I had them move me to a different apartment. In the second apartment, I had a thief for a roommate and ended up losing 1.5k worth of items, including a laptop. I got out of there, broke the lease (payed it through) and moved in with my cousins. I’ve been living there for 5 months now. I need to move badly, I don’t enjoy living with them because I feel like I’m intruding as they are raising a family.

   A big thing I'm looking for really though is a roommate that I can connect with. Somebody that has some similar likes. I've been lacking real social interaction due to what happened with the other roommates and such. I don't party so I don't really meet people that often. I like to play video games a decent amount, I personally own a Super Nintendo, Nintendo 64, Nintendo Wii, Xbox 360, and PS3. I like music of all sorts. I have a powerful PC and 2 large screens for monitors, one being a 3DTV. I like bowling and playing basketball and such. I want somebody who will not only be a roommate, but be a friend."

I'm 22 F and have felt relatively happy with my identity up until a year ago.  I was in an internship in 2011 and roomed with two bisexual girls who spent most of the time trying to convince me that I was bisexual.  They were of the opinion that ""nobody is every just straight or just gay"" and really liked to announce their bisexuality.  It really grated on my nerves, but made me think that maybe I needed to consider that.  Of course, I eventually blew it off because I determined that my doubts were just from their pressure.

Now, though...  Well, I was snuggling with my boyfriend and we were just talking about random stuff when he mentioned well... to be as discrete as I can, 'hanging out' with another girl (as in me, him, and the girl together) and wanted to know if I was okay with that.  I was kind of surprised to find myself not opposed to the idea and shortly after started crying out of confusion.  (I'd like to note that my boyfriend is completely supportive and isn't trying to force me either way; he suggested I talk with others rather than just keeping it to myself)

I know for certain that I am attracted to males but now I'm beginning to think that I am attracted to females as well.  I wasn't raised in a particularly strict or homophobic family and I'm all for freedom of sexuality, so I don't feel ashamed or wrong feeling this way...  But it is a little confusing at 22 to suddenly realize I might be interested in the same gender.

I'm not really sure what I'm looking for here other than to just talk through it with people to help me sort myself out.  I have felt a little more... comfortable?  with myself after having that 'epiphany', but as I said, I'm pretty confused.

Anybody feel like just talking about stuff?  I don't really have any direction for this (probably because I'm pretty confused), but talking about it with people helps me more than just trying to think through it.

Thanks, everyone.  :)"

&gt;  Some things I didn't know...
&gt;Things to remember in November  
&gt;
&gt;      After going to both Harvard Business School and Harvard Law &gt;School simultaneously, he passed the Michigan bar, but never worked &gt;as an attorney.
&gt;·       As a venture-capitalist, Romney's first major business deal &gt;involved investing in a start-up office supply company with one store &gt;in Massachusetts that sold office supplies.
&gt;That company, called Staples, now has over 2,000 stores and &gt;employs over 90,000 people.
&gt;·       Romney or his company BainCapital (using what became known &gt;as the ""Bain Way"") would go on to perform the same kinds of business &gt;miracles again and again, with companies like Domino's, Sealy, &gt;Brookstone, Weather Channel, Burger King, Warner Music Group, &gt;Dollarama, Home Depot Supply,
&gt;and many others.
&gt;Got your calculators handy? Let's recap.
&gt;       Volunteer campaign worker for his dad's gubernatorial campaign &gt;1 year.
&gt;·       Unpaid intern in Governor's office 8 years.
&gt;·       Mormon missionary in Paris 2 years.
&gt;·       Unpaid bishop and state president for his church 10 years.
&gt;Took no salary as president of the Salt Lake Olympics 3 years.
&gt;·       No salary as MA governor 4 years.
&gt;Gave his ENTIRE INHERITANCE to charity.
&gt;·       That's a grand total of 28 years of unpaid service to his &gt;country, his community and his church. Why? Because that's the kind &gt;of man Mitt Romney is.
&gt; 
&gt;And He’ll show you his:
&gt;1)     Un-doctored Birth Certificate!
&gt;2)    College transcripts!
&gt;3)    Law degree!
&gt;4)    Un-doctored Draft notice!  Un-doctored Social Security card, &gt;and what state it's registered in!
&gt;Isn’t it time for a REAL CHANGE?
&gt; 
&gt;    A brighter HOPE for America?
&gt; 
&gt;     No more downing the opposition?

Last year I almost gave up.  At the start of this year I got new docs and meds and really gave it my all to get better. 

It's been 6 months since I started recovering from those 9 years.  I'm working 2 internships, I was offered a full time job off of LinkedIn, I leave my room and socialize, I am trying to date, I am stable and faithful with my meds.  I still have to patch up my relationship with my dad and living with my mom sucks (divorced, he blamed it on me) and have drug abuse under control.

What prompted me to post is that I am returning from a 3 week vacation in Guatemala (where my mom is from) and I feel different.  The last time I was in that country was when I was 14 years old, before all the mental anguish and shit, and 12 years have passed!  My cousins are married or getting married, having babies, building homes for their families.  I was both embarrassed/sad that I didn't have similar accomplishments to talk about with them, but they were very happy to see me and took care of me/showed me around and I was even able to confide in one close cousin.  I climbed a volcano, partook in a cacao ceremony with a shamanic healer, visited family in the mayan kaqchikel highlands, and got laid (whoo! dry spell over), to name a few things I did during my vacation.

I want to say thanks to Puddles, Cat226, Logiz, erics, and the other mibbit users who encouraged me to stay off drugs during my trip, to take fewer books and focus on the experience instead, and for being open and honest about their lives.  It's made a huge difference to have this subreddit community available to reflect and learn from others.  And to those who are struggling every minute of every day, there is hope for you.

uewj4,2,2012-05-31,Help! My mother won't move out!,feel_so_trapped,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/uewj4/help_my_mother_wont_move_out/,"Hey Reddit,

I am a 19 year old female living in a city away from home for the summer for a summer internship. I found a nice sublet (with strangers who I don't know really) close to my workplace in a relatively nice neighborhood. However, the thing is, the city I am working in is known for a relatively high crime rate.

My mother came to help me move in earlier this week and I have been sleeping on an air mattress, so that she can take the bed. I didn't expect her to stay for that long, but now she refuses to leave. Her reasoning is that:

* I am a female.
* I am young and I don't know how to live alone, despite me living in college alone for the past 3 years.
* The city is dangerous.
* The building doesn't have a good lock system (which is true, all of the doors are simply passcoded and the door to my room doesn't have a lock that I can lock from the outside.)
* I don't know my roommates or anyone in the city.
* She is paying for the apartment.

But my mother is driving me crazy. We don't have an amiable relationship and she is always paranoid and gossipy. Most of all, she treats me like I am 10 years old (including reinstating an 8pm curfew because of the city's ""crime"") and not letting me progress as an adult at all (other than going to work).

What can I do, if anything?

**edit:**
To answer some more comments:

* I am not financially dependent or remotely close to that yet. I still have debt and a full year of college left.
* There are people living in my family's house, so no worries there.
* One thing I forgot to add: I have had the talk with her that I want to be independent multiple times. She often guilts me by telling me how much I owe her for paying for university and how if I want her to leave so badly, she'll leave forever and I can say goodbye to my family because I am ungrateful.

I've done undergrad research, worked at lockheed martin CWEP program for a year, and I'm currently working as a research assistant. 

Earlier in my college career I had a lot of stress trying to figure out whether I wanted to go into industry or grad school immediately. I also had trouble figuring out how to get concrete skills to get ""in the door"" for internships. I wish I had an upper classman to bounce ideas off of back then. So I thought I would put myself out there as a resource if anyone is feeling ""lost""

I posted something earlier today, but I remained distant and vague in my explanation.

My girlfriend of eight months broke up with me a little bit more than a week ago. I know eight months isn’t a very long time and in the grand scheme of things, it’s quite trivial. But I’ve dated girls for more than a year and I’ve never felt this torn apart. She told me she no longer loved me. I saw this coming and I tried as hard as I could to keep our relationship together—and honestly I think that’s probably what tore us apart… I’ll explain.

We had a really good relationship. We were interested in the same things: action movies (Resident Evil, Avengers, etc.), videogames (Zelda of course!), Indian food (every Thursday), fitness, television shows (Burn Notice, White Collar, and Alias), and a lot more. I tried to help her with her school work as much as I could and she did cute things for me too, such as cooking me crepes or French toast in the morning. You and I both know the list of the good things could go on indefinitely--I’m in love with her.

However, there were issues like every relationship. We both had two majorly conflicting character traits.

I have an “anxiety disorder,” which is likely inherited from my father who tried to commit suicide a few years back, so I get extremely paranoid about whether the person I’m dating truly loves me. My paranoia and anxiety is also probably the result of my flawed family life. My mother was an alcoholic and my dad had an affair. He had two children with another women (a stripper actually), and he abused me childhood naivety; namely, he said that this situation was normal and that I shouldn’t tell my mother. For two years I knew about my dad’s affair while I watched my mother’s heart be slowly ripped into pieces as she wondered why my dad was becoming more distant by the day. She eventually found it and it wasn’t from my mouth. I regret that every day. Anyway…

Unfortunately, my paranoia was exacerbated by one of her quirks, specifically her distant and unaffectionate attitude. That is, she never gave me any sort of affection, which she said was the result of her depression and self-confidence issues that I will not go into for the sake of her privacy. I always said love you first. I cuddled with her. I kissed her and held her. And she never reciprocated; she never showed affection in return. She told me she didn’t like that I was affectionate because she didn’t like being touched by anyone (which is odd because for the first month and a half she was extremely affectionate).

Our two quirks collided obviously. Every day I became more and more paranoid. But I loved her, so I tried to conceal my paranoia as best as I could. In fact, it was the first time in my life that I could actually sort of contain it. I loved her and she hated my paranoia, so I tried so desperately hard to not be paranoid. Even though we had our issues and she still told me that she wanted to be with me. She said that if she couldn’t be in a relationship with me, then she wasn’t meant for anyone. She wanted to marry me and she actually designed our floor plans for our house one day. This was two weeks before our break up.

reddit, I no longer have passion or motivation to do anything anymore. I have an internship starting in 5 days at a Fortune 20 company and I need my motivation back. I’m going down the wrong road at this point. I don’t care about anything and I can’t be around anyone without being on the verge of breaking down and crying. I’m probably overly sensitive, but I’ve never felt this way about anyone. Maybe someone could share some advice.

ugv3h,2,2012-06-02,I've put my education at risk and I want to fix it. Can r/AskReddit help me improve my future?,BrewerHimself,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ugv3h/ive_put_my_education_at_risk_and_i_want_to_fix_it/,"Hello there, r/AskReddit! I’ve landed myself in a tight spot and I’m looking for some advice. I’ll start with a little bit of background on myself.

I spent two years studying abroad in Canada (I’m American) and I had no success. I partied too much and made excuses for my poor grades. I have a similar history with high school, but I’m ready to get serious about my future.

I recently moved back in with my mom in Florida. She moved here from North Carolina a little over a year ago and I haven’t spent much time here so I don’t have any friends. I’m working a full-time retail sales job right now that is satisfying, but not totally fulfilling. I’ve been strongly considering taking a year off from school and using this year to become a better programmer, but I’ve realized that I don’t want to be *just* a programmer. I want to be an algorist. I want to work on hard problems that require a deep understanding of algorithms and data structures, as well as discrete and combinatorial mathematics. I could study these things on my own, but it seems that most reputable employers who are looking to fill such roles are interested in a degree, which I don’t have.

Going back to school is still an option, but I’m concerned about the situation I’ve put myself in. Based on my high school and collegiate records, no university in their right mind would accept me and -- to be completely honest -- I don’t blame them.

Community college is one possible solution. I could go for two years and then transfer to a university. The problem with this is that the CC here in Jax is really lacking in the areas that I want to study (computer science and discrete mathematics). They offer basic math courses (through elementary differential equations) and no computer science courses -- only introductory programming courses. I’ve been programming for a number of years now and, while I have much to learn, I certainly have no business in an introductory course.

Furthermore, I’m looking for internships during my college experience and getting one as a community college student would be very hard. This leaves only the summer between my Junior and Senior years. I’d like to think that, with hard work, I could have a decent chance at finding an internship for my Sophomore-Junior summer.

With that said, I have some questions for you, r/AskReddit:

* With such a sad record of failures and laziness, how can I avoid a community college and get into a university? The selection for classes is greater at a university and will allow me to get started on courses related to my major much earlier than I could at a CC.
* What is the best way to work while going to school full-time? Should I search for a part-time retail job making minimum wage, try freelancing, or something else?
* How can I find the time to study enough to get good grades, work enough to make a decent living, and still be able to work on my personal projects?

I'm off to bed for now. I have work in the morning, but I'll be sure to check this thread and respond to as many questions and comments as possible before I leave for work."

ugtbh,4,2012-06-02,IAMA College StudENT Who Unfortunately Has To Stop Smoking Trees. My Story of StudENT To Student Along With Questions I Propose To Anyone,FalloutForever,trees,https://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/ugtbh/iama_college_student_who_unfortunately_has_to/,"My Story, (I have been trying to write this IAMA for awhile now so hopefully someone will read it)

To start, I am afflicted with depression as well as a high level of social anxiety so writing this has me really feeling vulnerable because I do not know how people will react to (if even read) this IAMA. 

So I am a college Sophomore that is studying engineering. I began smoking trees about a month into school after experimenting with alcohol/ tobacco (Cigars mostly). I found that trees really helped me deal with my social anxiety and depression better then any other medication I have taken.

Because trees allows me to be more outgoing and less self conscious I gained many friends and friENTs in my first year of college. I will without a doubt say that my first year of college has been the best year of my life so far because of the many positive experiences I have had with and without trees.

There is much more I want to say but I feel as if people will not be interested in my somewhat boring life so I will move on to why I need to stop the thing that brings me great joy and relief.

For me to get a job at a well-respected, high paying engineering firm I will without a doubt take drug tests. I could of had an internship this summer at a very respected, multi-billion dollar company except that I would have had to take a hair folical test. I was told that I had been accepted for the position because of cancellations of others and I would be able to work at the company over the summer. Unfortunately I had done large amounts of research into the company and confirmed they do hair tests so I was had to decline the offer. When I finished the phone call I immediately thought I had missed a golden opportunity to start my career of on the right foot. I still feel this way.

So for the sake of my potential career as an engineer (which I don't really want to be but it is the only job with substantial income that I don't resent) I am stopping my trees smoking this Sunday.

If it were not for drug testing, I feel I would be a productive member of society while also smoking trees. I mean, I do very well in school, 3.5 GPA, I follow every state and federal law with exception to speed limits and marijuana prohibition, I try to help those around me when possible. Why is it that I cannot smoke an herb that provides me relief from my (in my point of view) very unimportant, un-special life.

Me stopping this Sunday will provide a sufficient amount of time for the THC to leave my hair folicas due to the fact I will have about a year before I have to take the hair test. (I have high metabolism, I take niacin, I get buzz cuts every 2 months ect...) But me stopping this Sunday will take something I love completely out of my life.

Since I have to stop smoking, I am going to try and become a major advocate for the legalization for marijuana. I feel that I am insignificant in this political world where pharmaceutical companies spend millions lobbying to keep marijuana illegal. A world where politicians can lose their credibility for trying to pass pro-marijuana legislation. A world where money has absolute power and the individual has little to none. I want the world to change, not just for marijuana, but for everyone. A world where the logical/ right thing to do is implemented over a company wanting to increase its profits by denying rights to millions

I was a sophomore college studENT, now I am a college student with the will to try and change at least one aspect of the world. I know that I am small in this world, but even small things can make an impact.

Questions:

1. How should I go about my pro-marijuana activism

2. What do you think of my story and viewpoints

3. Is there anyone else in my situation or one close to it

4. Feel free to comment on any part of my story, I will comment back. :-)

       (I am open to any response to this, I just hope some reads this because trees are an important part of my life and I would like feedback on my situation) 

Thank You In Advance,

I am just ending my senior year of college, and it is supposed to be one of the happiest times of my life, but today that all changed.

 I have been with this guy for almost a year. It was a relationship unlike any I have ever had before. We clicked immediately. He told me he loved me before we even started officially dating. From the day we met (at an internship) we spent all of our time together until the summer ended and we went back to our individual colleges which are 3 hours apart.

Everything the past few months has been great. We had a little scare because he is going to grad school and he almost ended up across the country. But, by some stroke of luck he got into his dream school which by coincidence was only half an hour away from the place where I had accepted a job offer.

Since then we have been counting the days until we would be living near each other. We see each other about every other weekend, and for Memorial Day, we spent the long weekend together. We had an amazing weekend, a vacation on the beach and I left on Tuesday feeling like the luckiest girl in the world.

Wednesday he says that he is worried about graduation and wants to spend a lot of time with his friends and starts mentioning needing some space. Everything since Wednesday has been an awful rollercoaster of emotion culminating in him breaking up with me today.

I just feel like this is so sudden and abrupt, which is why I am struggling to deal with this. He had already purchased a train ticket for my graduation (One week from now). I had plans with his parents to drive down for his graduation. He bought me a day to make and bottle our own wine in Napa in July for my birthday. We bought concert tickets this past weekend for a concert in late July. All of these things seem to indicate he had no intention of breaking up with me and I am devastated. 

Reddit, where do I go from here?? How do I deal with this?? Everything I thought about my future, where I was going to live, how I was going to make friends, even my plans for graduation and the month break between school and work are destroyed.

TL;DR Boyfriend broke up with me with no warning 1 week before college graduation and 2 weeks before we would be living near each other. How do I deal with this shock?"

I swear I've spent too much of my life thinking about it!! :-) It's so interesting to see how it gets reported on and discussed, especially when you think about how little JPMorgan has actually said.  In the meantime, lots of reporters try to get access to people who might know something more. I think Bloomberg had an interesting piece today for one: ""JPMorgan’s Iksil Said To Take Big Risks Long Before Loss"".  Re: Sovereign CDS Pricing widget. I often wonder that too! I mean, I know a lot about the data, but what meaning to derive from CDS in the current environment? Especially sovereign CDS, because there are a lot of banks out there who will buy CDS mitigate counterparty risk exposure to those sovereigns, pushing the spreads wider and wider.
[What's the Eurozone endgame? Despite all the apocalyptic talk, markets have had a fair amount of time to prepare e.g. the Greek's triggering CDS payments was the non event of the century.  The Sovereign CDS Pricing on the right hand side of the blog is looking fairly dire but I've always wondered what the best way to read them is. Any guidance?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uflwl/iama_reporter_on_the_financial_times_alphaville/c4uy440?context=5)|The thing that fascinates me most is what this says about what regulators are up to with all that CDS data that they have access to. The fact that anyone could have seen market distortions and large volumes building up... and they have access to legal entity level info, so the concentration in the hands of one market player would have been quite visible.  I guess when I look at CDS spreads, I tend to look at them more relative to each other, and relative to their own time series, plus net notional and activity data. In isolation, they aren't that revealing, imo.
[A lot of financial market journalism seems to be driven by exploiting peer networks to provide an explanation of market moves. Currently there is a lot of leaning on the work of economists and analysts to do the quantitative sifting through data. It seems like the Alphaville team is also starting to back up the stories by doing their own quantitative analysis. Do you see this continuing? How important is a background in maths, economics and statistical analysis becoming for a journalist over having a large number of contacts? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uflwl/iama_reporter_on_the_financial_times_alphaville/c4uy6fc?context=5)|I consider myself something of a data addict, and I think this influenced their decision to hire me. At least, I'm very much encouraged to do my own analysis. The thing about doing your own work with the data, or even lots of your own non-quantitative research (e.g. understanding a complicated legal case), is that it can take a lot of time. If you have a deadline, like newspaper journalists often do, it could be more challenging to pull off. That said, I'm sure it would be encouraged if agreed to in advance. Everyone likes having something unique. Alphaville is more flexible time-wise, which I really appreciate.  For myself, there's also this scary element to it because who do you have to check your work if you're on your own? Usually I try to call someone who's an expert in the area to talk them through what I did to see if they think I missed something. It can really be nerve-wrecking though to put yourself out there so much!  As for a economics/stats/maths background, I think it helps if you have a history of reading other people's analysis and critiquing it. We have a lot of research thrown at us and it's important to question it, especially if you are saying that you agree/disagree with the thrust of it rather than just passing it on for others to decide on themselves.
[Izzy - Citi would argue that the differential yields on EZ sovereign debt in part reflects a contingent FX rate i.e. how the asset will appreciate/depreciate in the event of a eurozone break up.

As to how much time they take.. it really depends on how inspired or passionate i am about the subject :) Sometimes I can just sit down and write a stream of consciousness and it turns out to make some sort of sense (or not, others will argue!), other times it takes a good week or so to research the idea and to bring it together.

[One last one, will Alphaville ever be behind a pay wall?

Indeed, I'm not sure it would work in its current form behind a paywall.  Thanks for reading us mjpbol.
 |There are absolutely no plans for Alphaville to go behind the pay wall. In fact, the trend, if anything, has been the reverse. It used to be that our newsletters were for FT-subscribers or Cut-subscribers who paid a small fee (that was less than the full FT fee). We reversed that a couple of months ago and now you just have to be registered to get those. Registering is free.
 |In the future, it may well be the case that Alphaville requires registration to read posts. And again, registration is free, and it then allows you to get things like the newsletters. The upside for us of registration is that we get to stay free while having a better proposition for advertisers because they know a bit more about what type of people read Alphaville.
 |So, in short, one day there might be a trade off where if readers want to continue to visit us (and we very, very much hope they do) we might need a minimal amount of input about who they are.

Didn't go into being a journo to smooth feathers really. Actually it's very rare that I personally get flak because someone in the market didn't want the story out there (that's more what PRs do). Since it takes two views to make a market, it's more that they want their point of view across as well.
[One question I had was how do you come up with the majority of your stories?  Do you tend to sit down and discuss/think of most of them yourselves, or are they driven by tips from market participants?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uflwl/iama_reporter_on_the_financial_times_alphaville/c4uy6l1?context=5)|As to where we dig up all this stuff. For me it's about 80% starts with just seeing something and digging in and asking around about it. That other 20% does tend to come from tip-offs, but these can often be pretty brief by necessity. So you then go back to the 80%. Looking back, on some of the fave stories I've done/broken on AV, the Finnish collateral stuff, ELA, all the Greek PSI ding-dong - these tended to start with initial tips and then grew from there.
[On the same note, if you're writing something controversial/that people would rather not see picked up in the MSM, do you get much flak from market participants? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uflwl/iama_reporter_on_the_financial_times_alphaville/c4uy6l1?context=5)|Joseph

 |Actually this might be a good opp for me to exorcise a little bit of macro tourism that's been bugging me...
 |OK, it's really important to remember that Iceland, the sovereign, never defaulted in 08. They're back selling dollar bonds now and everything. (You sometimes see the argument for Grexit citing Iceland as a great precedent. Nope.)
 |Iceland did decide that some its banks' liabilities were just too much to take on to the sovereign balance sheet, which is fair enough. But you also have to remember that Iceland also kept up talks on eg. Icesave.
 |The other thing... they got capital controls right, which made the devaluation of the currency a lot easier to manage. (Joseph)

 |But, just speaking for myself (it's Joseph here), the funny thing is - there really is no career structure on AV. It's too new. (Even though Paul started this way back in 2006...)

 |Ehwatay, thanks for this question.  Historically Alphaville has often functioned as a springboard to another job on the paper.  And hey, nothing wrong with that.  But the site continues to mature, and more than at any point since I joined, the team is comprised of bloggers who really want to keep blogging for as long as we can get away with it.  Writing for a blog and reporting for a paper are very different, and the people whose bylines you see on Alphaville these days have a strong preference for the former.  -- Cardiff.

Seriously though, there's lots of stuff behind the FT.com paywall that is hugely popular with City readers (I see the figures.) Higher-ups here accept that Alphaville relies on being a  member of the wider (free) financial blogosphere for its style and tone. And it's also acknowledged that we drive plenty of readers to the main site. That said, there is pressure on us to be more profitable -- and i suspect that will lead to us introducing compulsory registration at some stage. But we will remain free.  (Murphy)

Don't ever get them to plan a surprise birthday party.  Sure, there must be contingency plans by now. That's what bureaucracies do. Make plans and file 'em away. But a secret, unified plan (which the Germans wouldn't leak)? It's not even clear that one end of the Troika knows what the other is doing or what the drivers for Grexit are.  But being bureaucracies, you've got to remember how much inertia is simply built in to the Troika's programme by now, two years on from starting it all.

Of course, the job you're describing -- a kind of fiscal and monetary policy Grand Poobah -- doesn't exist.  But if I had to choose an economist whose outlook and views probably closest mirror my own, it would be Karl Smith (of Modeled Behavior fame).  This is fodder for a longer conversation and I don't agree with him on everything, but I'd want someone who not only would favour more stimulative policy now, but who also understands collateral effects both in financial markets and in households.  That's Karl, and he also was first to write about the household formation and durables depreciation trends that I'm keeping an eye on.  And I'm mostly on board with Karl's longer-term structural views as well -- on immigration, especially (which, yes, I view as a huge fiscal issue), but also his generally liberal-tarian outlook.  
[Given the horrifying performance from many schools of economics in predicting the crisis (not to mention the often ridiculous prescriptions they still have the temerity to toss off as if they made sense, not least in America but particularly in Europe\), it's perhaps unsurprising that alternative schools are seeing the light of day even in academia for the first time in a while.

There's about a half-dozen economists and strategists doing great work on this (Singh, Pozsar, James Sweeney, Perry Merhling, a few others), or you can read any of AV's posts on the matter.

I had a number of different jobs at Markit. The first one I did was CDS Portfolio Compression, which meant I had a lot of banks as clients. It was very high pressure.
 |Then I was in the Credit Data team, and then finally in a kind of hybrid role. In the last role, I got to work with new colleagues from Wall Street on Demand (that Markit acquired) as well as the economists, who I'd never worked with before. Also, I started speaking to journalists about the dataset... which ultimately led me to Alphaville.
 |I knew zero about how journalism works before I started at the FT. It's been interesting learning about it! Alphaville is great in that you have a lot of flexibility to pursue topics that interest you.

I remember when Jim Cramer was taken to task by Jon Stewart on the Daily Show for some of the advice he'd given. Part of his response was that ""it's entertainment"". Worth keeping that one in mind... Ideally, imo, reporting is a mix of examining short term and long term trends. But there are a lot of people who are in jobs with deadlines and they have to write something or they won't get paid. That's the reality. (Lisa) Also, when I was in analyst training (at a bank in Canary Wharf, for an internship), the guy teaching us said, ""whenever you pick up the FT, remember that newspapers don't sell if the front page has 'Markets Calm! Everything Fine'"". (Lisa)

I am an undergrad pursuing a degree in computer engineering at Grand Valley State University in Michigan.  I have done well so far, with a 3.9 GPA, and am fluent in English and Spanish and learning a few other languages, but even with any relevant qualifications, I am still worried about finding a career in the industry.

I have obtained a job at an electrical engineering design and manufacturing company nearby, where I  have been successfully employed as an embedded software engineer, and I am also being taught practical electrical engineering concepts as they apply to the projects I work on.  The job is amazing but I view it more as a stepping-stone to a long-term career.

Essentially, it is my dream to work at either Google, Intel, or Apple (me and everyone else, I know).  I applied for an internship at Google (on the Google Translate team) last year but was denied based on what I perceive as a lack of experience, as I am just now entering my Junior year and did not have the aforementioned job at the time.

My questions are as follows: 

-Does anyone here work at Google, Apple or Intel? If so, what advice can you give me to aid my in my pursuit of my dream job?

-What other companies offer desirable employment for computer engineers?

-Where is the biggest demand for CEs in the U.S. or Spanish-speaking countries?

-How difficult is it finding a job as a computer engineer in the U.S. with all the overseas programming jobs?

-Have you ever had the need to speak another language (Spanish?) on the job? I feel bilingualism is one of my most prized qualifications.

-On a daily basis, what do you computer engineers out there do? What does a typical day (if that exists) look like?

-What general tips can you give me as I finish my last few years as an undergraduate student looking for a career?

Thanks and sorry for the wall of text."

uhwo8,1,2012-06-02,I've put my education at risk and I want to fix it. Can r/AskReddit help me improve my future?,BrewerHimself,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/uhwo8/ive_put_my_education_at_risk_and_i_want_to_fix_it/,"Hello there, r/AskReddit! I’ve landed myself in a tight spot and I’m looking for some advice. I’ll start with a little bit of background on myself.

I spent two years studying abroad in Canada (I’m American) and I had no success. I partied too much and made excuses for my poor grades. I have a similar history with high school, but I’m ready to get serious about my future.

I recently moved back in with my mom in Florida. She moved here from North Carolina a little over a year ago and I haven’t spent much time here so I don’t have any friends. I’m working a full-time retail sales job right now that is satisfying, but not totally fulfilling. I’ve been strongly considering taking a year off from school and using this year to become a better programmer, but I’ve realized that I don’t want to be just a programmer. I want to be an algorist. I want to work on hard problems that require a deep understanding of algorithms and data structures, as well as discrete and combinatorial mathematics. I could study these things on my own, but it seems that most reputable employers who are looking to fill such roles are interested in a degree, which I don’t have.

Going back to school is still an option, but I’m concerned about the situation I’ve put myself in. Based on my high school and collegiate records, no university in their right mind would accept me and -- to be completely honest -- I don’t blame them.

Community college is one possible solution. I could go for two years and then transfer to a university. The problem with this is that the CC here in Jax is really lacking in the areas that I want to study (computer science and discrete mathematics). They offer basic math courses (through elementary differential equations) and no computer science courses -- only introductory programming courses. I’ve been programming for a number of years now and, while I have much to learn, I certainly have no business in an introductory course.
Furthermore, I’m looking for internships during my college experience and getting one as a community college student would be very hard. This leaves only the summer between my Junior and Senior years. I’d like to think that, with hard work, I could have a decent chance at finding an internship for my Sophomore-Junior summer.

With that said, I have some questions for you, r/AskReddit:

* With such a sad record of failures and laziness, how can I avoid a community college and get into a university? The selection for classes is greater at a university and will allow me to get started on courses related to my major much earlier than I could at a CC.
* What is the best way to work while going to school full-time? Should I search for a part-time retail job making minimum wage, try freelancing, or something else?
* How can I find the time to study enough to get good grades, work enough to make a decent living, and still be able to work on my personal projects?

I'm off to bed for now. I have work in the morning, but I'll be sure to check this thread and respond to as many questions and comments as possible before I leave for work."
uhvym,1189,2012-06-02,Don't Turn off the Webcam,0450AZ001,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/uhvym/dont_turn_off_the_webcam/,"Linh and I met in 2008. She was from a very small town in Washington with a population of less than five hundred. I was working my way through college as an event bartender in Portland. Linh’s cousin was getting married in Portland, and as fate would have it, the wedding reception was held at an upscale hotel on the Columbia River where I frequently tended to small wine and beer bars. I noticed her immediately, as I often notice women that I quickly convince myself are too beautiful to ever date someone like me. Eventually as the night went on, she made her way over to my bar and ordered a white wine. We talked for a while about Portland. I sweated profusely as I tend to do around girls like her. She would be spending the next two days in the city, and I took a few moments telling her about the most interesting sights to see and things to do in town. 

“Wow, you should just be my personal tour guide” she said, grabbing my arm and smiling. This happened to me so infrequently that I really had no idea how to react, so I just mumbled “Sure, what time?” and laughed nervously to hedge in the event that she was joking. “How about 10:30 tomorrow morning” she replied.

And so started my relationship with Linh. She was infectious, with a personality that was so innocent and warm. I immediately fell in love with her. There were a few issues that we would have to work through. She was still in Washington and I was finishing school in Oregon. Linh was Vietnamese with a very traditional father who would never approve of her having a white boyfriend. She lived alone in a house with her father as her mother had passed away several years earlier, so going to Yarrow Point to visit her was out of the question. She would come to see me every three weeks under the guise of a prestigious internship program. 

Being in a long distance relationship, we spoke on the phone and texted constantly. When high speed internet finally came to her small town in Washington, I surprised her with a webcam for her computer so we could have an even better means of long distance communication. In the back of my mind, I was always looking for ways to be with her as even after two years of dating I was paranoid a girl as beautiful as her would eventually find somebody better to share her life with. 

In 2010, Linh’s father passed away suddenly in his sleep from a heart attack. He was everything to her, and she was heartbroken. When she returned from Florida where the funeral was held and her father buried, she was all alone in the house where she had lost both of her parents. With Linh’s father deceased, she was open to finally allowing me to come to Washington to see her, which we planned on doing in a few weeks after my college finals.

One night during our usual bedtime conversation, Linh mentioned to me that her father had been acting strangely in the days leading up to his death. She explained that he had taken to checking up on her multiple times throughout the day and night, and scattering religious artifacts throughout the house. This behavior, she said, was highly uncharacteristic of him. Vietnamese culture and religion was something foreign to me, and at various points Linh had mentioned things like this that I normally wrote off as just being a little silly. She explained to me that being in the house alone without her Dad was emotional and may be playing tricks on her. She hated the feeling of being so alone. She told me that being able to see me on her webcam was the closest thing she had to family, and asked that I promise to never turn off the webcam. She meant the world to me, so I was happy to oblige.

A few days passed and it was now the Tuesday before the weekend when I would finally come to see her in Washington. We spent our bedtime webcam session excitedly talking about our plans and I dozed off with my head on the kitchen table in mid conversation. It had been a long day. When I woke up, I saw Linh sleeping on my screen and stumbled off to bed. 

At 3:00am, my cell phone begin to ring. Disoriented, I rolled over, took a look at the clock and knew it could only be her. She took great pleasure in waking me up in the middle of the night to let me know that she had just gotten a drink of water, or had an amusing dream. Anyone else would have gotten an earful from me, but her flirtatious giggle made me feel lucky to have my much needed sleep interrupted.

""I had a nightmare"" Linh gasped. ""...You danced in front of my friends"". She burst into laughter. 

""What are you doing up so late honey? You've got to work in the morning?"" I said.

""I was thirsty, and went downstairs to get a drink of water.""

""Great, well we really should go back to sleep, tomorrow is a big day"".

""Allllright"" she conceded, ""Hey by the way, don't forg----""

After a few crackles and a brief burst of static, the call disconnected. I hated Linh's phone, she had an old flip phone that dropped calls with no rhyme or reason at least three times a day. I held down the #1 on my own phone, my speed dial for Linh. No ring, straight to voicemail. 

I tried to call several more times, and each time it again went straight to voicemail. 

I was exhausted, and though I loved Linh to death, to be honest I just wanted to go back to sleep. My eyelids hung heavy.

A little annoyed, I decided to walk out to my kitchen for a quick drink of water. The two glasses of wine that I drank before bed had left me with a little bit of dry mouth. As I rinsed the glass and went to place it in the dishwasher, out of the corner of my eye I saw movement on the glow of the laptop perched on my dining room table. 

It was the webcam. Two fluffy brown paws were making a swimming motion directly in front of her camera. As I got closer I saw a close up of two grinning faces. One of that silly dog of hers, and the other of my giggling girlfriend, who knew that eventually after being unable to make phone contact I would wander out to the webcam to say goodnight. I wouldn't put it past her to turn the phone off on purpose to elaborately stage this scene. Me, standing in my underwear at 3am on a work night, half asleep staring at a girl and a puppy on a webcam. 

I waved goodnight, and she kissed the lens of the webcam and pulled away.

I froze.

I wiped my eyes and looked again.

There.

It's... standing in the corner of the room. It’s...

Staring at her. 

Wrinkled. Angry, twisted mouth. 

Hateful eyes. 

What the fuck. 

HATEFUL eyes. 

It’s watching her.

-------------------


Two hours later, I woke on the dining room floor. I had a ringing in my ears and a knot on the back of my head. I immediately knew what had happened. It wasn't the first time. Sudden, extreme stress has given me panic attacks and black outs a few times before. I had never felt such fear when what had happened came rushing back and I nearly had a second panic attack when my thoughts turned to Linh. I loved her more than anything in the world. It took me several moments to summon the courage the look in the direction of my laptop. When I finally did, the screensaver had long since turned on. I looked away from the screen as I flicked the touchpad with my shaking finger. It took me another two minutes to open my eyes. 

Linh laid sleeping in her bed. She looked so peaceful. Sleeping on her side, facing towards the webcam. As frightened and confused as I was, relief at her safety gave me a sense of comfort as I desperately tried to process what had happened. Maybe the wine had hit me harder than I thought. Maybe I slipped and fell on the slick tile floor, and it all had been a nightmare.

I stared at her. I loved her. Maybe more than even I realized. So peaceful and beautiful as she slept.

The light of her television danced across her room and illuminated the bed.
As I watched on, her hand began to move. 

Slowly. 

Unnaturally. 

She was sleeping but her fingers crawled across the bed slowly until they reached something. It was her cell phone. 

Her hand moved like a spider, fingers popping in several directions across the keys.

What the hell?

BZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ

My phone was vibrating.

""New Message: DON'T...""

BZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ

""New Message: TURN...""

BZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ

""New Message: OFF""

BZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ

""New Message: THE""

BZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ

""New Message: WEB""

BZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ

""New Message: CAM""

Complete terror set in as the messages came across the screen of my cell phone.

""New Message: DON'T...""

""New Message: TURN...""

""New Message: OFF""

""New Message: THE""

""New Message: WEB""

""New Message: CAM""

As I glanced back to my laptop, horror overcame me as slowly a shadow crept across the floor. Something was crossing in front of the television. Moving closer to Linh.

I told myself it was just her dog, right? The color drained out of my face when I noticed the puppy sleeping in the far corner of the room.

I picked up my phone and dialed Linh. I didn’t know what I would tell her, but I knew she needed to get out of there immediately and never go back. Dammit straight to voicemail! THAT STUPID OLD PHONE OF HERS.

The full shadow now hung completely over Linh.

Her hand jerked, flipping open her cell phone.

My phone was ringing.

I answered, “LINH! LINH CAN YOU HEAR ME YOU NEED TO…""

A burst of loud static forced my phone reflexively away from my ear.

On the webcam I saw Linh’s lips begin to move. Her eyes were shut, but she was speaking.

I heard her voice come across the phone, but something wasn’t right. She was speaking, but a second, deeper voice echoed hers in perfect unison.

“DON’T TURN OFF THE WEBCAM…. AGRAMON WOULD LIKE TO SEE YOU. DON’T TURN OFF THE WEBCAM. AGRAMON IS READY FOR YOU NOW”

“Who? What? What does he want?” I yelled in desperation.

“HE WANTS TO EAT YOUR SKIN”. 

The line disconnected.

The shadow across Linh’s bed changed directions.

It started moving away from the bed… and towards her laptop… towards the webcam.

As the shadow moved closer small streams of gray liquid rolled towards the lens.

The images coming across my monitor began to shake violently.

It was almost here. I could now see the top of it’s head. It was CRAWLING towards me. Wet strings of silver and black hair hanging over it’s face. I remembered those hateful eyes and I lost control of my bladder as it slowly begin to tilt it’s head up. 

And then I did it. 

In panic I slammed my laptop shut and threw it against the hard tile floor before collapsing to the ground.

I wished for a panic attack to take my consciousness and end this nightmare, but it didn’t come.

I crawled to the panel of switches a few feet up on the wall and turned on every light that I could. I noticed the bottle of wine still open on the kitchen counter and drank most of it down in a single swallow. I reached up and pulled open my apartment door, and stumbled across the threshold, extending half of my body into the common hallway so I wouldn’t feel so alone. A pathetic coward sprawled out on the concrete. 

My phone began to ring.

I crawled to it. Linh’s name was flashing on the caller ID. I held it in my hand, paralyzed by fear.

And then the ringing stopped.

I took another mouthful of wine and mustered the courage to call back. It went straight to voicemail. And then again and again as I tried to call.

Eventually the shock and drowsiness from the wine got the better of me, and I passed out on the floor after making a few more attempts.

When I awoke several hours later, despite the broken laptop and empty bottle, I wanted to believe that it was all some sort of horrible nightmare.

Out of the corner of my eye I saw blue flashing light on my cell phone.

“You Have One New Voicemail”

My hand trembled as I dialed my voicemail and entered my passcode.

The message was time stamped, and was from the missed call I had from Linh before passing out.

Her voice. She was in tears and frightened as though I had never heard her before.

“You promised. Why…….why did you….turn off the web …webcam… “

“His… his tongue … burns “

With a crackle the message ended. 

-----

Two years have passed since that night. I never tried to contact Linh again. I never called her work to see if she came in the following morning. I never made it to Yarrow Point in Washington where she lived. She was my soul mate, and I let this happen. I was probably right on the night we met when I told myself I wasn’t man enough for her.

The only reason I am telling this story today, under the cowardly vale of anonymity, is because my drug and alcohol counselor thinks it would be good for me. So here it is. I made the decision to let the love of my life face an unimaginable nightmare to spare myself, and the worst part is that I may not even regret it.  

Now if you will excuse me, I think I need another drink.

ul023,67,2012-06-04,Alone...Right?,DeadlyToken,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/ul023/aloneright/,"This weekend I was completely alone, everyone was out of the house and my mother trusted me enough to not burn down the house (but i think she still slightly relied upon the interns here who came for morning and nightly chores...). I woke up on Saturday and being me, immediately logged into Reddit. I checked out a few posts, then went downstairs and grabbed a bowl of cereal. 

The dogs were quiet... which was very odd but I didn't pay attention to it at the time. They're always barking and yapping at random cats moving about the yard. (I live on a farm with 103 horses, 8 dogs, 40 cattle, 50 cats, and 7 donkeys, quiet is rare.) Soon enough, I started watching TheAmazingAtheist. Behind me, I heard my door open and close. I whipped around and looked behind me. Nobody there, I yelled ""Hello?"" like any girl in a horror movie. No answer. I scolded myself for that, who did I expect? The boogyman? Maybe Nosleep was getting to me, i remember thinking.
 
 I forgot about it within about 10 minutes. So I started talking to friends on facebook, the usual chatter that you'd expect about summer. When I got up to get a glass of water, the guitars started strumming. I froze. The strumming sped up and I cautiously turned the corner into the living room where they were kept. The guitars looked untouched, and undisturbed. I tried to laugh it off as hearing things. For the next hour I felt uneasy. 

My mother called me, and I was relieved, I started walking to my room but I had my foot on the first step when my brother's prized baseball came rolling down the steps... it was in a case, in his wardrobe in his room... And he hasn't been here for a week.  I tried my best to make myself believe that my sister, Katie, had been playing with it... but I couldn't believe it. Nosleep has taught me to try and rationalize out first, then believe. 

About 10ish, I made myself supper, watched a movie, then went to take a shower. As i was stepping in, I felt this unbearable feeling of being watched, and subconsciously pulled my towel tighter around myself. Yes, I keep the towel on until I am in the shower and the windows are fogged since we still don't have blinds in the bathroom. I did my routine, and was halfway through the Proactive facewash treatment when... In the mirror i saw someone. I turned, but of course there wasn''t anyone there. I quickly dried my face and left. After a few hours of Alesana and talking to friend, I passed out. 

The next morning, I woke up to find a slice on my leg from my knee to my ankle. Red and puffy, it screamed in protest when I brushed it against the mattress. I hobbled to the bathroom, and let my dogs out on the way. I came out, and I immediately heard this whispering and giggling. Stupidly, I called out ""hello?"" and the sounds stopped. Being easily freaked, I wrapped up my leg, and grabbed my laptop. F7u12 is where I was for awhile, but decided to come here. 

At around noon, I heard this ear splitting scream, my hands flew up to cover my ears and I curled into the fetal position. I remember screaming ""Stop it!"" Silence. The dogs were barking and whimpering, and I was in hysterics, so I asked my mom if someone could come home, she said I could go do chores instead. So I went across the road to check water, and was greeted by this ticking sound, like the old bike my sister rides. I sped up the pace and came back home. I strummed my guitar, did a few scales, retuned, but it didn't help me relax. I went back on Facebook to see if anyone was willing to come over, or at least talk to me... before someone blew behind my ear. I flipped my laptop and it crashed to the ground, then I started crying.

For the remainder of the evening, I sat in the living room with 3 white candles, my dogs, and a movie playing at full blast. I may be paranoid... but when I woke up this morning there was a note beside me saying, ""Sweet dreams""... Nobody came in until noon today, and everyone denies being home last night."
ukt2x,1,2012-06-04,"Just graduated with what I think a great resume, but I have no idea what to do.",[deleted],sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/ukt2x/just_graduated_with_what_i_think_a_great_resume/,"Hey guys, let me start off saying I'm asking for advice. If this is the wrong place, please don't read further and tell me where to go.

I moved this part from bottom to the top of my post: I learned a lot in college. But even after everything I learned, there was no one person who could tell me how to get started or the type of jobs in the field. No one in my family does computers and my advisers are to far removed or worked in the military.

First some background:

I graduated in early may from the University of Tampa with a degree in Management Information Systems. I graduated with a 3.72 overall gpa and a near perfect gpa in MIS (I got all A's and only one AB). I received 2012 Outstanding Graduate in my major, and two of the most difficult teachers in the program that everyone hates told me I was one of the best students they ever had. I did this with minimal work and I don't feel like I learned anything/very smart. I read this subreddit and just feel overwhelmed and have no clue what you guys are talking about majority of the time.  My coursework focused heavily on Information Design (mostly Object Oriented), IS Security, SAP and sql databases. I had two internships, one which I'd say is B.S. and one where I did system admin duties in a lab...by myself...working with no-one.

I moved back to new york (where my family lives) when I graduated. I'm looking for jobs in both Tampa, and NYC/Long Island. I only applied to two places, my old internship where they said I did everything perfect (funding got cut for my program) and another place in tampa. I don't think there's a position available for me at my old job despite really fitting in well there. I put my resume online at monster and dice 4 business days ago. I've been getting about 3 calls/emails a day from places in NYC, all for system admin jobs from recruiters. 

My problem?

All of them have asked about my Linux knowledge and what I would say my strongest skills are for the position. I don't know shit about either! I don't know how to answer these questions. I'm never nervous about interviews/phone calls so I tell them the straight up truth about what I've done. I worked only with an old outdated windows 2003 and fedora 7. I got asked about my home setup.. I don't have a home setup. I have a 1k gaming asus laptop (I don't even game). I don't know how to get even started or practice. My major had nothing to do with this and when I look it up I just feel so overwhelmed (I guess partially thanks to my panic...). I got a call today and scheduled a interview for Wednesday. At the end of the phone call the recruiter told me the position was actually mostly tech support with some sysadmin duties for 17-23 a hour. I got that much with my internship in Tampa. I'm going to call back and say I'm not interested (esp. for tech support). 

my questions:
Should I be looking for a IT job in a different position and not sys admin? 
What kind of starting pay should I be looking for in NYC?
Am I wrong to be panicked about my skills?
How do I improve my skills? I'm a excellent learner, which is why I got through school so easily by doing bare minimum. 

Believe me, I researched before I came here, and it only made me more confused than ever. I wasn't panicked. Now I am. I need some personal advice...

Other notes:
I have Information Systems Analyst (ISA) cert, and I'm on the verge of passing CISSP (maybe 3 months more studying). If I studied for the SAP TERP10 I could pass, I don't like SAP though. No other certs.
I have a security clearance.
My programming skills suck.
Example of my resume with some stuff X'd out: https://docs.google.com/open?id=0ByffL1FF50iYOWQzejhHb1JxR1E

I know this is kind of a mess, but hopefully I got my situation across. If I got confusing anywhere please tell me. If any professionals in the industry can help me I'd seriously may fall in love with you.  Thank you so much."

I feel good on a computer and i have done some very very light programming in the past in visual basic. I have a great mind for 3D and I think outside of the box. I am currently in a Intern as a ME and I like it, but I don't see myself doing this kind of work for 25 years. I was wondering what is a typical day-job in the shoes of a programmer/architect/analyst/lead/project manager/whatever relates to CS. I would like to have a global view of the jobs i could have if i switch to CS.

uk7xw,2,2012-06-04,"Do you think IT professionals should have a code of ethics/professional responsibility such as doctors and lawyers do?
",non-confidential,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/uk7xw/do_you_think_it_professionals_should_have_a_code/,"It starts with me. I was once a IT assistant (internship). I worked in at least two organizations where the technology was up-to-date but the people were not very tech savvy. They were competent enough to handle day to day software but knew very little about Windows or how networks work. They didn't need to. 

It started with the recruitment of a new director of sales. He knew very little about computers in general. Much of his work on computers revolved around analyzing reports and using email. On this particular day, he was overseas and he emailed me directly requesting the web address for our web mail access portal. I reply back with it. Soon after he asks me what the username and password should be. I tell him what his username would be and that the password would be whatever he uses to log on to his computer. He replies back thanking me and saying it was still the default password we assigned to him. 

I think I was tempted then but I held back. Later when I got home I accessed his email via Tor. I was being extra-careful and ensured that I was in the same country as he was. I proceeded to read hundreds of emails. I was hooked on the information. Much of it was boring sales blabber. But so much of it was also discussions about employees, their problems and executive decisions. I stayed up quite late into the night and the next morning I woke up knowing much more than anyone else did! 

I was hooked. In the next few weeks and months, I would try different ways to access other peoples mailboxes. I started with testing the default password in those who I thought were least likely to have changed it. It worked and I felt like an addict who just received his fix. I read about personal problems. Letters to their loved ones. Company gossip and speculations. I knew about their personal problems, financial problems, relationship issues, company issues. Hell, I even knew their flights, banks, and passport details! 

When I had gone through much of them. I went a step further and used my administrator privileges to directly access the other mailboxes. This unfortunately had to be done during work, so I had to be extra cautious. By then, the thrill of getting caught was part of the entertainment. 

After a while I realized how addicted I was to it. Everyday I would read their emails after work and every morning I'd know a little bit more about them. Until one day, I woke up and realized what I was doing was wrong! I stopped. I fought my urges to read their emails and for the most part succeeded but knowing access was easy, I then proceeded to find an excuse and do a company wide change of password. This happened as planned and slowly I started to lose my urges. 

Did I tell anybody about what I had read? No, thankfully not. My interest in it was not to make it public but rather knowing about their lives gave me, I suppose, a sense of superiority. Do I regret doing it? Perhaps, but I cannot say if I would not do it again. In the same way, I cannot say that if it had come to a situation where divulging this information would have saved my ass, then I might have. 

I am sorry if that went on for a bit. But it is what leads me to my question. The amount of information that an IT professional is privy to is astounding. While a lot of this is covered by company confidentiality agreements etc. what I do with the personal information of the employees in their emails is not. Considering the amount of people who are socially active at work via various methods, one can quite literally know them better than their loved ones do. 

Would I have adhered to code of professional responsibility? Yes, I would like to think so. It would have been etched into my memory by teachers from day one. I would have respected the code and feared the repercussions of my actions. 

But, heh, who knows .....

My problem is, is that he wants me to go bed at the same time as him (10pm) and I usually stay up until around 2am. During the time he is sleeping I do everything I can to please him. I use headphones, I turn my computer screen away from his bed and try to make no sound at all. 

He just now asked me to leave our room because the light of my laptop on half brightness angled away from him is making it so he cannot sleep. I feel like I am doing all I can to accommodate him, but he is asking too much. I feel like it is my room too and I should be able to quietly browse facebook/reddit in my bed before I go to sleep as long as I am my computer is on mute and I am not making any noise.

ujkw9,357,2012-06-03,IAmA Radio/Water Tower Climber. Saw the interest on the front page today and thought I'd do an AMA as everyone was blown away by it,RDProgrammer,IAmA,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ujkw9/iama_radiowater_tower_climber_saw_the_interest_on/,"My family owns a Wireless Internet Service in rural America and we rent tower space from the companies that own large radio towers, from smaller towers, from cities' water towers, and other random towers (we have ~55 broadcast sites). Our antennas are between 100' and 450' off the ground and I've done higher climbs relative to where that guy from the [""scariest video in the name of science""](http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/uijtx/the_scariest_video_you_have_ever_watched_in_the/) guy got off the elevator (And really, above 50' or so you're dead if you fall anyway).

Even better some of our antennas are on water towers that have no ladder, so you just have to scurry up the existing metal work where ever you can. (Yeah, this REALLY sucks).

As said in [the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCYZZPwJr_c), and argued in many responses to other places I've seen that posted, I do free-climb often (When there is not a way to be clipped in in a way that will not make me get exhausted quickly. Also, clipping in requires you to stop what you are doing, which when getting in a rhythm as you climb, is very distracting. With many designs of towers the ladders' rungs are not evenly spaced, but follow a pattern, one that you must count out in your head to make sure your feet are going to be in the right place at the right time.), but I also clip in when working if there isn't a safe platform to stand on.

Craziest thing I've seen: the tower in the pics below has a buzzard's nest about 100' up on a walkway that is about 3 feet wide and has had a chick in it each of the last 3 years. [Here is is empty.
](http://i.imgur.com/NnP1Nh.jpg) Other than that, I've been on towers and found where lightning has hit them and just blown the tops apart (mostly on water towers), have seen women sunbathing in their backyards in various states of dress (but I was at least 300' away and couldn't seem much), and had a cop order me down off the tower thinking I was up there to vandalize.

Close Calls: I've gotten my safety harness caught up in rigging before and been stuck for a while until I could get out, nearly had heatstroke on a tower, had the mount-point I was clipped into bend and make me nearly fall, and dropped a screw driver a few hundred feet onto the roof of my jeep (still has a big dent).

Best part of the job: it's always something new and rarely boring (except for driving long distances). Some of the set ups are really interesting and have evolved over the years: we have a tower that has something like 35 runs of ethernet cable going to the top (it's grown with the business), the electrical box that houses all our equipment for that tower looks nuts. That and our solar powered systems that are out in the middle of nowhere; building those are fun, imagine hauling a ~100lb battery up a tower just like that guy in the video had his tool bag (while also hauling the tool bag).

Worst part: The heat and the cold. Where I am the summers get to 110 F and 100% humidity and the winters get to 0 degrees and windy. I'd rather climb in heat than cold though, as your hands REALLY hurt after a climb in the cold, the metal of the ladder sucks any trace of heat out of them.

Is it scary anymore? Almost never, there are moments when you realize that one slip and it's all over, but its also a rush and I'm an Adrenaline Junkie (been skydiving, have a motorcycle, etc). I also get a lot of laughs out of people who I show pictures to and just get a ""nope, nope, nope, nope, NOOOOOOPE!."" My GF also lost her damned mind when I climbed a remote tower we had just had installed to install our antennas. the ""tower"" was a 70' telephone pole (about 20"" wide at base, 8"" or so at the top). I had to drive long bolts into it as I climbed to ""build"" the ""ladder"" and then sit at the top and rope components up to myself (the weight caused the pole to shake as much as 3' to either side according to my GF). That was some squirrely shit and I'll admit I'm glad I haven't had to climb it again since.


[Here is my verification](http://i.imgur.com/2PpFR.jpg) (see first picture for same face)


...and some pics from when I was up them in the past:

[Here's what I normally climb wearing](http://i.imgur.com/69nGa.jpg) it has multiple different attachments for safety gear for different types of towers.

If y'all have any questions, ask away.

EDIT: imgur links, screw photobucket

IDK If I'm allowed to do this, but throw me some upvotes, I'm constantly annoyed by how many people think tower climbing is some sort of crazy job that only nutcases would do (seriously been denied a college internship because the recruiter thought I was ""too wild"" for their company).

EDIT AGAIN: excuse all my shitty spelling in the response. apparently my FF spell checker broke and I didn't realize it."
umzgk,2,2012-06-05,What the hell is my friend's deal? Narcissism? Entitlement? Douche-baggery?,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/umzgk/what_the_hell_is_my_friends_deal_narcissism/,"I'm 23 now, I first met my friend (well call him ""M"") M &amp; my current group of friends when I was 19. When I first met this dude I thought he was amazing. He claimed to have received his chemical engineering degree in 3 years while battling pancreatic cancer that had occurred while he was away at school. He also loves smoking weed as much as I do, and at that point in my life I blamed the marijuana on my laziness instead of taking a much deeper look at myself. 

I was just coming back from University at the time, after failing out due to partying, playing WoW and never going to class. I was in-between friend groups at the time, leaving my high school friend group finally as they took the plunge into harder drugs that I'm glad I stopped while I was ahead. I say this so that you can understand the allure that M had to me, as solid proof to me at the time that you can party AND get your work done. What a motivation &amp; confidence booster!

Turns out that the degree doesn't exist and he dropped out of school when his high school Gf dumped him and he was too sad to attend classes (f**kin pussy). One of my friend's moms met up with M's Mom in the town supermarket and she mentioned his degree. M's mom looked at my buddie's Mom dumbfounded and was like, what degree? I guess that explains that in all of the years of our friendship I have NEVER been invited into his house or formally introduced to his family despite hanging out together just about every day. 

As far as the Pancreatic Cancer goes, he had some minor procedure done and he must have told his ex they also found cancer to try and get her to feel awful. He told all of us it was cancer and rode this lie for a good 3 years until we started unraveling everything. At this point, we've started to make strides on calling him out on everything, except for the degree &amp; this. The degree is obvious, I just don't feel like arguing about it. As far as the Cancer, our bro's agree that we'd almost rather not know if it's real or not and still want to give him the benefit of the doubt due to the severity of the potential circumstance, despite never seeing any proof of this. He appears to be in perfect health, never watching his diet &amp; doing what he pleases. 

I'll write more about it below, but M has a ""charm"" about him that I've never witnessed before. It's almost creepy looking back on it how people bend to his will &amp; how incredible he seems off the bat. I felt great thinking this guy was my best friend, and I get this charisma and charm to myself &amp; I can learn and grow my confidence further. Also, keep in mind I have never had a father figure so I take what I can get in those areas to supplement. 

I remember one day he bragged about how charismatic he is and how he has a habit of splitting up groups of friends. At the time I was sure that there were other circumstances and didn't think much of it. I had introduced him to a best friend of mine, a kid that I've known the longest but didn't see as often due to our schedules. He and M hit it off and I thought it was great, until I started not seeing any of them often &amp; knowing they were just hanging out together without me.

I didn't want to look like a jealous asshole, especially amongst bro's - but one day it finally upset me enough and I cracked. I confided in M on a car ride and said that I felt like I was loosing my friendship with one of my best friends. He assured me that it was all in my head and that my other friend had mentioned nothing of the sort. 

M ended up pissing off this kid a few months down the line (more on this to come as it's relevant) and I finally re-connected with my best friend. I told him that I had had that conversation with M about how I felt that I was losing a very good friend. To my surprise, my friend said that he had had the exact same conversation with M about me, and that M said that I had never once mentioned it to him. 

At that point it was clear that he was making an effort FOR WHATEVER FUCKING REASON to try and de-rail my friendship. I still don't understand why, and try not to dwell on it simply because I feel like it's utter stupidity. We're 20 something years old, this isn't high school and certainly the last thing I'd want to deal with when spending my time with dudes.  

As for how he pissed my best friend off (who is normally extremely easy going) - we have a mutual female friend who is extremely over weight. One of the kindest girls I know, but due to her weight she acts out overly promiscuous and my friend likes to keep it in line as he is essentially like a brother to her. It was a topic that was discussed many times that if someone ever legitimately wanted to date her that they need only ask, if they truly were into her. You need to keep our ravenous dudes on a leash when she's hungry for some dick and the booze is flowing.

From my best friend's exact words to me were ""M looked me in the eyes and said ""Our friendship is more important that just fooling around for easy sex"" .""

As it turns out, because women have huge ass mouths, is that they'd get drunk and go screw around. I guess it only happened 3 times, but M's excuse was ""oh I was drunk"". Yeah? 3 times? My friend FLIPPED the fuck out, and this girl's older brothers (huge scary italian dudes) were about to kick the shit out of my best friend because this girls at home crying her eyes out saying that my friend is really mad at her. Obviously she isn't going to say ""I fucked this dude and here's the real situation"".

Sparing the rant, this is what pissed me off the most. I tried to take M out and talk to him about this. I told him that this kid is getting flack from this girls brothers due to HIS actions. He goes, ""oh, they're mad at him? Oh well, at least I'm ok."" - he then proceeded to laugh it off like a fucking joke. Meanwhile he'll be texting my friend saying he's so sorry, and that he's crying his eyes out and that he's sorry for being a shitty friend. 

Fast forward to this week, everyone's back from school including her. When we get together and he manages to come around he has her giving him back massages and shit, since this girl is still head over heels for him. She keeps begging my friend to let them fuck again, even though M is seeing another girl. He still pulls this shit, and I guarantee none of the girls he's had since have any idea about this shit. He has absolutely no problem straight up using this girl infront of all our friends &amp; her group of friends.  

It's only as I've smartened up and stopped putting this kid on a pedestal that all this shit added up. You think you fucking know a guy man, and then you find out everything about him is total bullshit he made up to feed his ego.

I can't fuckin stand him and I still see him at least once a week. Anytime someone calls him on his shit he makes up some ridiculous bullshit, its mostly entertaining at this point and none of my other friends feel like upsetting an otherwise good time to argue with this idiot, but everyone is well aware. He never gets invited out, so if he finds out what's going on he'll usually just end up inviting himself through someone else who may also happen to be going and isn't in our immediate group of friends.

Just last week we were at a pool party with a new group of girls. He doesn't even have shame anymore, he's sitting in front of 3 of our friends talking to this one girls dad about how he's going for his second degree and is being contracted by the department of defense for chemical weapons development and blah blah.

THE WORST FUCKIN PART is that people eat it up. He comes off so charasmatic, always has girls all over him even though I bust my ass at the gym and he doesn't do shit. After bullshitting this chicks dad all I could hear the other rents present talking about was how awesome that new guy that came over is. Makes me so fuckin mad.

The thing is, he IS smart. If he actually did anything with himself maybe he could achieve something. He still swears he has a degree, yet he's working at KOHLS. His Mom works at KOHLS, let's take a guess on who got their 23 year old son a job? If you have a Chemical Engineering degree, where's your fucking internship somewhere? Oh, he also switches the title of his degree from Chemical Engineering to Organic Chemistry depending on the situation, and I'm positive he thinks that I just don't care enough to remember. 


The only great thing that's come of this is for me really. For years I was so certain that this kid was for real that I adapted the qualities that I liked in myself. I worked my ass off for a year and a half to get accepted back into school full-time, while working full-time. I just finished this semester with a full course load and received A's in all of them. I'm pretty stoked - and I still party and enjoy myself quite a bit. All in moderation. My confidence has never been higher, and for this entire experience I'm actually grateful. Losing someone you're close to always blows, but I've learned way to many valuable lessons here.

TL;DR - Close friend lied about having a degree &amp; possibly pancreatic cancer. Uses his ridiculous charisma to carry himself through life while lying left and right, and it works. "
umuxk,3,2012-06-05,[For Hire] Jr. System/Network Admin,box_of_corruption,austinjobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/austinjobs/comments/umuxk/for_hire_jr_systemnetwork_admin/,"I am an amateur System/Network Admin, looking to expand my abilities by getting a job in the System/Network Admin field. I have been repairing and building computers since I was 12 (first one I took  apart was a DIGITAL x386 EMM running Windows 3.1). I built and repaired over 300 computers for my friends/schoolmates/family while going to middle school and high school. In middle school my friends and I created a ""company"" (it was never incorporated), building and repairing computers for all of our friends and their families. We successfully ran that business for about 4 years till I moved away to Dallas. In Dallas, my dad needed a Linux (SuSE) Admin for his new business. So I learned how to administer a Linux Server (using CLI, didn't even touch a GUI until 5 years later), setup and maintain a webmail, IMAP, and SMTP server. Configured our local DNS using BIND command line. Even designed and maintained my dad's website and webstore. After I graduated from high school, I moved to Austin and took some time to find myself while still keeping up with my skills by occasionally helping friends out when their computers broke and keeping current on technological trends. After 3 years of staying in Austin, I moved to Killeen, TX and worked for a man who was repairing computers out of his house. He tried to convert me to Christianity, so I left that job. I started working for Acer Computers, and during my 10 months of employment there I personally repaired ~3000 desktops, laptops, servers, and projectors. The only reason I left that job was because I was moving back to Austin, and traveling 120+ miles a day for $10 an hour is not economically efficient. So, I got a job at Apple Computer doing tech support over the phone. In my 5+ years at Apple, I have assisted thousands of customers (~300 a month for 66 months) in repairing issues with their computers. My primary experience at Apple has been network and email client troubleshooting. Although, I have had plenty of experience with basic desktop/laptop troubleshooting and educational facility support as well.

Now you are probably wondering why I took the time to detail my experience to you. I don't want to be at my job anymore (it was just supposed to be a temporary placement till I got a better one). I have applied to 30+ internal positions in the past 2 years (positions that I know, realistically, I qualify for and I know I would be able to excel at). The only time I have had an interview, I was turned down for someone that I was told is more well rounded and that I am not far along enough in my career (the position was for in-house computer repair). 

So, I'm done. I am looking for a new job, preferably in the SA/NA area. What I would really like is an apprenticeship or a paid internship, learning how to do SA/NA work. I am the kind of person that as long as I'm doing what I love (building, maintaining, and repairing computers), I don't really care what I am making (within reason) and I am willing to stay right where I am. I am known for keeping good records of my case history and as a no-nonsense worker. If there is work to do, I do not slack off. If there is no work to do, I find work to do. Being unproductive when someone is paying me to be productive infuriates me to no end. I just want to do what I love, so that I don't have to hate my job and get depressed just walking in the door. It would be nice if the largest stressor in my life was not my job.

Also, I need some nerd refrences, such as, ""Dear [Insert Test Subject Name Here]"" This essay is written for the incoming freshman class of a special educational program. By special I mean a rigorous and hard one, made for the smart.

  Dear [Insert Test Subject Name Here],    
   Congratulations on making what could quite possibly be the most important decision you will have to face in life. Your decision to join the Utica Center for Mathematics, Science, and Technology will not let you down. Here at UCMST, or MST as it is usually called, you will learn to make all your work MST quality work, collaborate with other students, and have many a fun time. MST may seem like a big challenge, and it is, but I know anyone who passed the entrance exam is capable of performing to the best of their abilities and will go far in school and in life in general. MST will be the best four years of your life.
    
   To start off, homework in chemistry will either put you ahead or behind. We have these things called Web Assigns, which are our homework problems that are online. We have to print them out, show our work, and submit the answers online. A word of advice, do not procrastinate, and complete your homework at least two days early, because you get .5% percent extra credit for each question you answer early. Here is where collaboration comes in handy. If you and your friends start early, you can come into school early, and help each other figure out how to solve questions they may not get. Be warned! DO NOT just tell each other the answers and have them copy the work. This is called cheating. If you copy, you also will not remember how to do the problems as well, so when it comes to test time, you will not perform as well as you would if you tried it yourself.
    	
   This next subject varies greatly from student to student, C++. Either you will love C++ as I did, or you can’t stand it and wish it over. To me, C++ is a third language, a puzzle, and a potential future career. I love puzzles as you may, so in C++ when you have to figure out ways to make your program compute something, return a value, or do anything, I found it exciting and invigorating. I loved trying to find what the simplest and most concise way to the end product would be. A C++ program may look like the code in the image below. C++ coding is a way of innovative problem solving to get a solution for a problem that may be as simple as finding prime numbers, or as complex as program that renders terrain, uses coded in physics, and a GUI engine, or in other words, a video game. Whether you like C++ or not, it will be a major help for your junior year when you take AP Java. Java is a coding language very similar to C++. The bottom line is whether you are intimidated by C++, love it, or are appalled by it, take your time when learning it, and try to understand what each thing in a program does. It can help you through the course.
    
   So far, we have covered chemistry and C++. You may think next would be advice to math, but almost everyone understood math, so I do not think there is much to advise you on. Instead, this will be about what opportunities, both in high school and out, MST can provide for you. As a requirement for our junior year at this fabulous establishment, each student has to get an internship. This means that you can get hands on experience in a career field you may find intriguing. Do not worry if you do not like the internship, you just escaped wasting part of your college life on this. Now, as for the more distant future, MST can put you well ahead of others. You will have a better high school education, and more knowledge then the competition. You will be smart, well informed, committed to what you do, and more. These are all key things for your life out of school, which MST conveniently provides. You may ask, “Why are you telling me this? I thought this was a survival guide.” Well, here is the connection. Pay attention, do your work, and find what interests you. If you do not do these things here at MST, you will not be as committed, as smart, as informed, as educated, or as capable as you could be. What you do now pays off in the future. So, try your hardest, do your homework, and most importantly, have a passion for learning. With these things, you will surely excel in school and in life.
    	
At this point, you may not know what you should take out of this. Let me help you out there. At MST, you need to try your hardest on everything, do your work, find what you like doing, stick to it, collaborate on ideas (not answers), and more. With MST comes many late nights, lots of trips to the pop machines, and stress, but MST also comes with an excelling education, many great people to become friends with, pie,  fun activities, random food bribes (basically lots of free treats such as doughnuts, cake, and more), Pi day, pie, fun clubs, afterschool events (such as lock-ins and tournaments), and more pie! MST is an unforgettable experience you will NEVER regret going through. As a sophomore this year, I can personally say you will survive school and I wish you the best of luck in your educational endeavors. 
    
Live Long and Prosper

I could be wrong since I haven't been browsing this sub much lately, but a search gave me nothing. Here are my questions:

1. I will only be 20 throughout the summer even though I'm going into my senior year (my birthday is super late). I was wondering if you guys can shed some light on the social aspect of interning and how not being legal drinking age here in the US might affect my experience outside of work with other interns as well as the trip that I've heard many people take (to Florida, etc.). I'm a little worried that a lot of socializing and whatnot might be done out at bars where I wouldn't be able to attend and I don't want to end up as an outcast (for lack of a better term) because I can't go out with everyone.

2. On a different topic, I'm also looking for others' experiences with their job offers after the internship. Did you try and get an offer in a different city than where you interned? This is an important question for me so I'm wondering how the whole transferring process has worked out for others since, if I plan on sticking with my company, seeking an offer for a different city is something I've been thinking about. This doesn't seem like something that is often allowed, but I thought I'd ask for everyone's input.

Sorry if this is a little unorganized I don't have time to look over it before I post. Hopefully by the time I check again we'll have some good discussion and I hope none of this is the same questions this sub gets all the time. Thanks!"

my sister (the main ""offender"") is 24, married to the ward mission leader, two kids, has a master's in early childhood education, a primary teacher... basically the epitome of the perfect mormon wife.

i know that what she does, she does out of love and genuine concern for my ""eternal soul"".  after all, i can't make it to the celestial kingdom without an eternal companion.  i know this because i used to believe the same thing.  but this past week she did something that for some reason has really gotten under my skin:  she set me up with a complete stranger (to her as well as me) for no other reason than the fact that we both live in the same city.

basically, she met a girl who lives in my same city (and who she described as ""very attractive"") and gave her my phone number, telling her to give me a call.  i don't know much about the exchange other than that.  what i do know is that i got a call from this girl - who just finished her first year of law school at BYU and is working an internship with the DA here - offering me a ride to church.

i've *never* been more uncomfortable on a phone call.  luckily, i was out of town on sunday, so i was able to at least delay said fellowshipping effort, but i have a very difficult time saying ""no"" to people - especially people i don't know, so i agreed to ride with her next week (though i had forgotten that i'm going to be out of town again, so there'll be another awkward phone convo where i delay again).

so here's my dilemma:  i don't know what this girl's expectations are - i'm not opposed to going on a date with her, but i *really* don't want to be a reactivation project.  i don't know exactly what my sister told her, either.

my sister at this point knows i'm ""not that into the church"".  she knows that i smoke - or at least her husband does, and i'd be seriously surprised if he'd kept that secret from her.  my father knows i drink, and he found my condoms a while back while helping me clean my old car for sale.  even if he hasn't shared these things with my sister, there are other signs.  i rarely attend church when i'm visiting her or my parents.  i didn't stand in the circle during her sons' baby blessings, and when my best friend since childhood got married last month, i waited outside the temple.  i've never had a formal ""i don't believe"" talk with any of my family, but they know i'm not the wide-eyed RM i once was.

i'm actually really upset about this.  i don't like confrontation.  i love my sister to death, and i don't want to do anything to alienate her from me.  at the same time, i can't handle her attempts to save me - especially not if it involves pimping me out to random strangers.  any advice (on either problem - how to talk to my sister, or how to approach interaction with this new girl) would be greatly appreciated."

Today is my first day at my summer internship, and my assigned project is to review the current data/information storage system (a local drive) and see what are possible alternatives (dedicated server, cloud system) and compare these alternatives with the current system. I am extremely uninformed about this topic, and if anyone can point me in a direction where I can get some information (preferably an online source), I would really appreciate it.

I am interning at a small law firm with 5 employees. The size of the business, the costs, and the efficacy are the biggest concerns.

Thanks Techsupport."

[What It takes to be a Journalist according to Fox News?  Is fox news a legitimate news channel?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ukv42/i_worked_at_fox_news_no_im_not_the_mole_amaa/c4w93ug?context=5)|""FNC is always looking for talented individuals who can wear many different hats"" (writer, editor, etc..)  Fox is legit. You may not always agree with how they present their news, but they know their audience well.  
[I feel like ""they know their audience well"", is not a good thing for a news channel...what i mean is they shouldnt care about their audience.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ukv42/i_worked_at_fox_news_no_im_not_the_mole_amaa/c4wberr?context=5)|News is a product that needs to be sold. You need people to watch your channel to make money. You need to know your audience so you can tailor your broadcast to what they're interested in or they won't watch and you won't make money. 
[No no no no no!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ukv42/i_worked_at_fox_news_no_im_not_the_mole_amaa/c4wbo54?context=5)|Capitalism controls everything. Papers and stations are shutting down everyday. Why? Nobody buys them or watches them anymore. Without money, the business doesn't exist. Ideally, there would be no bias in news. While Clinton was in office CNN became known as the Clinton News Network...
[The news is not a freaking ""product""! That's like if your apartment building was on fire somebody knocked on your door and said ""hey I got a product to sell you it's information regarding your apartment… Do you want to buy it?""](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ukv42/i_worked_at_fox_news_no_im_not_the_mole_amaa/c4wbo54?context=5)|It happens. it's the nature of the beast. if you don't get it or understand this you're either an idealistic journalism student or just completely ignorant of the way the business works.
[In theory The news should be valuable and TRUTHFUL reporting about what's really going on in the world… It shouldn't be propaganda that is ""tailored"" massaged and perverted to make the target audience feel better about themselves.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ukv42/i_worked_at_fox_news_no_im_not_the_mole_amaa/c4wbo54?context=5)|Ok, so if that's true how to wire services like the Associated Press make money because their wires tend to be fair and balanced and free of bias? Because it's a subscription service that other outlets pay to use.
[Good Lord! When even the journalists have been so corrupted by the corporate mindset it's no wonder the modern state of journalism is what it is.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ukv42/i_worked_at_fox_news_no_im_not_the_mole_amaa/c4wbo54?context=5)|I can't stress enough that I believe a hundred percent to be well informed, you can't trust one news source. Read several and draw your own conclusions. 
[Do you believe this is how the news *should* be done, or are you just ""reporting"" on how it's done?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ukv42/i_worked_at_fox_news_no_im_not_the_mole_amaa/c4wdft7?context=5)|Definitely not how it should be done. 
[Why does the Fox News Channel have so many commercials for""erectile dysfunction""drugs like Viagra and Levitra? I mean, it seems like every other commercial is for male impotence treatment.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ukv42/i_worked_at_fox_news_no_im_not_the_mole_amaa/c4w9az3?context=5)|The audience is conservative (old rich white dudes). 
[What are your personal political views? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ukv42/i_worked_at_fox_news_no_im_not_the_mole_amaa/c4w95yv?context=5)|Ok, I'll just come out an admit it... In college I was conservative. It took moving to NYC and working at Fox before I re-examined some of my viewpoints. I would say I'm unaffiliated with any party, but if I must choose, I would consider myself liberal. 
[Did your time at Fox News inform your transition from conservative to liberal? If so, how?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ukv42/i_worked_at_fox_news_no_im_not_the_mole_amaa/c4w9rrs?context=5)|I sort of answered this a little further down. The short version is, I got tired of drinking the kool-aid. 
[How did fox effect your political views and how did your views effect your working for fox. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ukv42/i_worked_at_fox_news_no_im_not_the_mole_amaa/c4wey5e?context=5)|I considered myself conservative when I started working there. After awhile, I started looking at things differently. I no longer agreed with certain ideals that I had before. There were a couple of WTF moments. Remember all the controversy Fox caused over the new Muppets movie? There were instances like that. 
[What was this muppet controversy?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ukv42/i_worked_at_fox_news_no_im_not_the_mole_amaa/c4wobu7?context=5)|[This](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/01/30/muppets-diss-fox-news-in-response-anti-oil_n_1241199.html)
[Is everyone at fox news republican? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ukv42/i_worked_at_fox_news_no_im_not_the_mole_amaa/c4wa0hh?context=5)|Very few of them were actually republican. 
[How do writers go against their political beliefs for a pay check? don't they know there is an unfortunate numbers of americans that believe everything fox tells them and vote biased off this info. i could sell lies all day if it was making me rich i guess, but i would feel like an asshole doing it.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ukv42/i_worked_at_fox_news_no_im_not_the_mole_amaa/c4waqtn?context=5)|I kinda compared this to working on a septic tank in a comment below. And sadly, there is no getting rich from it, and I did feel like an asshole. 
[Current journalism under-grad at Mizzou here, I have three questions for you. What advice would you give to a young person entering you're field of work in the next year? second, given the bias in news programs now-a-days and 24 hour news channel's constant need for material, do you think the role of verification still exists in modern day journalism? And lastly where do you see the future of the industry going? Thanks!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ukv42/i_worked_at_fox_news_no_im_not_the_mole_amaa/c4wap1j?context=5)|Advice -- it's never too late to change your major. I ""retired"" from the business and am back in school getting a second degree in something totally unrelated. But if you insist on being a journalist, make sure you have a portfolio or tape of your work you've done at school or as part of an internship. I can't stress the importance of an internship enough. Don't have your heart set on one particular job. Expand your skills set so you can be a jack of all trades. You may want to be a reporter, but you might have to work as an assignment desk editor for a while. Don't turn down any chances to learn something new. When I started, although I was working primarily with a paper, I was going out with the local tv news crew learning how to shoot and edit video. That progressed to me being called to shoot a story if we were lacking photogs or reporters for whatever reason. I made myself a great tape that way. If you write, keep EVERYTHING.
 |The role of verification still exists to some degree, but it's a little loose. You may read or hear the words ""We're getting reports of suchandsuch.."" That's news talk for ""This might be going on but we don't have any concrete proof. We'll let you know for sure when we find out, but we wanted to let you know in case it is true so we can later say we brought it to your attention first.""
 |I was a little burnt out and jaded, so my view on the future of the business is bleak. That's another reason why I left it all behind. Shady things go on sometimes. People are being laid off left and right, more people are turning to the web for news so advertisers are leaving tv and print which leads to budget cuts. The business is changing, but it's always going to exist in some shape or form. 
[If so few of the employees were true conservatives, how did they reconcile their beliefs with the ""slant"" Fox news has?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ukv42/i_worked_at_fox_news_no_im_not_the_mole_amaa/c4wabx4?context=5)|It's like working on a busted septic tank.. you just hold your breath, wade through the shit, and get your work done. Just about every show has a production meeting. During the meeting stories would be pitched and how each segment would be presented would be discussed. Often there were eye rolls and audible sighs, but we knew what was expected of us and we just did it.
[Also, how did the employees view the reputation of fox news (i.e. its a punchline for half the country\)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ukv42/i_worked_at_fox_news_no_im_not_the_mole_amaa/c4wabx4?context=5)|It varies. Many employees were proud to work there. Fox is the number one news source and has been since it started. We have the numbers and the ratings, and in this business that's all that matters. Others were self deprecating and joined in on the jokes, and some were ashamed of themselves and the work they were doing.
[I find that many people involved with journalism tend to give it a sacred quality of sorts. They tend to think that the country is ""owed"" solid journalism, and that a good journalism serves an important function in any free society.  Were there still people like that at Fox, or does everyone's idealism die out after a time? Did anyone ever fight the direction a story was going to take?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ukv42/i_worked_at_fox_news_no_im_not_the_mole_amaa/c4wand7?context=5)|Absolutely there were people who thought their jobs were ""sacred."" You'd think they were curing cancer or something, and these were the people who were the worst to work for and with. Amazing how we could fit so many people into the newsroom with all the egos taking up a lot of free space.  Many people lost their idealism. Myself included. At some point a lot of us had some eye opening experience that made us look around and think ""this is total bullshit.""
[This is interesting. Where/who did the 'angles' come from? Are the producers ever keyed in to the GOP's official talking points of the day?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ukv42/i_worked_at_fox_news_no_im_not_the_mole_amaa/c4wf68p?context=5)|We know everybody's talking points. Usually before a politician (Republican or Democrat) was going to make an announcement or give a speech, we had a good idea what was going to be said. You'll hear intros to that kind of story kinda like this ""The president is expected to talk about his plan for job creation today...""
[*We have the numbers and the ratings, and in this business that's all that matters.*  Ah, the old argumentum popularum. Did it ever occur to you that journalists at actual news organizations (not the propaganda mill you worked at\) take legitimate pride in their work and don't have to compromise their beliefs or ethics just to keep their jobs?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ukv42/i_worked_at_fox_news_no_im_not_the_mole_amaa/c4wb6yu?context=5)|Name a valid actual news organization. 
[What was your eye opening experience?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ukv42/i_worked_at_fox_news_no_im_not_the_mole_amaa/c4whkuh?context=5)|Mine came when somebody very close to me was killed in Iraq. He had about a month to go before he came home. He left behind a young son who would really never get to know how awesome his dad was. I was in the editing room working on a package about how everything was just peachy keen in job related news when I got the call. 
[New York Times. L.A. Times. NBC News. ABC News. CBS News. Reuters. AP. Financial Times. Le Monde. Der Spiegel. Newsweek. Wall Street Journal (except the opinion page\). Shall I go on?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ukv42/i_worked_at_fox_news_no_im_not_the_mole_amaa/c4wbcuy?context=5)|Bless your heart. Did you know Wall Street Journal is part of the News Corp family. Fox is News Corp. NY Times, ABC, NBC and reuters have been racked with scandals throughout the years. We weren't allowed to use Reuters sources for quite some time because of the erroneous reporting (and this was before I started at Fox and was working local gigs). I would consider AP to be the most reliable of all the ones you've listed. 
[I think you missed the point about the network fabricating a story.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ukv42/i_worked_at_fox_news_no_im_not_the_mole_amaa/c4wjl1j?context=5)|I was asked about a specific incident, and I answered regarding that incident. I can tell you with a hundred percent certainty, we've never created a scene to make a story. 
[Did you know any of the TV hosts? is Glenn Beck as annoying in real life as he is on TV?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ukv42/i_worked_at_fox_news_no_im_not_the_mole_amaa/c4w9aoh?context=5)|I know many of them even though I didn't work exclusively on their shows. I can't speak for Glenn Beck, but funnily enough a couple of the nicest guys were Hannity and Huckabee. 
[Have you met O'Reilly? He seems like one of the more laid back and humorous personalities, considering his various Daily Show/SNL appearances. But then again, the ""we'll do it live!"" video would show otherwise.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ukv42/i_worked_at_fox_news_no_im_not_the_mole_amaa/c4wd24g?context=5)|I've met him several times, and I plead the 5th. 
[Hannity? Nice? Huh. He always seemed like an arrogant little prick to me.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ukv42/i_worked_at_fox_news_no_im_not_the_mole_amaa/c4weipx?context=5)|Keep in mind this is tv, like any other tv, on camera personas can be totally different than off camera. 
[In what particular ways are you not the mole?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ukv42/i_worked_at_fox_news_no_im_not_the_mole_amaa/c4w97m0?context=5)|My name is not Joe and I've never set foot in the Gawker HQ. I've never sold anyone information about any of my former employers, nor do I have plans to do so. Plus, I'm too lazy to write a book.
[So you aren't going to tell us about sub par bathrooms? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ukv42/i_worked_at_fox_news_no_im_not_the_mole_amaa/c4wape9?context=5)|He used the bathroom on the floor where all the offices of the talent were located. The ones in the newsroom were actually much better!
[Did they ask you to sign a gag order or anything along those lines when you quit? I saw Outfoxed too, and I think a couple of the people that spoke in it had to. I can't recall if this was because they got fired, or just because they left the company. I just found it interesting.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ukv42/i_worked_at_fox_news_no_im_not_the_mole_amaa/c4wa1sb?context=5)|On my last day, I had an exit interview with HR. I had to hand in my ID badge (which also served as a key card), and I remember signing something confirming that I was leaving on my on free will, that I met with HR and they explained to me termination of benefits and things like that. I don't remember signing a non-disclosure agreement. It's possible that I may have, but I left on good terms and my permanent record there says I'm allowed to be re-hired.
 |I know a couple of people that were asked to go that had to sign forms. I also know a man who was part of the Outfoxed documentary. He used to hang out in one of the nearby bars that was frequented by employees. He would try to get us to talk to him about what was going on because he wanted to write a book. Fox knew all about that. We weren't allowed to talk to him, and I don't think anybody ever had a fuck to give for his book anyway. 
[You were not allowed to talk to him? That's illegal.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ukv42/i_worked_at_fox_news_no_im_not_the_mole_amaa/c4whrmk?context=5)|We never got a memo saying ""Don't take to the creepy guy at the pub or you'll be fired."" We werent allowed to talk about the company when money was involved. The guy didn't have enough of his own stories, so he would try to get us to talk, so he could finish his book and sell it. It wasn't exactly a secret, what he was doing either. 
[That is also illegal.  Surprising you didn't know that.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ukv42/i_worked_at_fox_news_no_im_not_the_mole_amaa/c4wjms1?context=5)|I've worked for many companies who didn't allow employees to ""sell"" information. I didn't think it was a big deal, and I never felt my rights were violated, and I don't care enough to sue.
[Why did you reconsider your political beliefs? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ukv42/i_worked_at_fox_news_no_im_not_the_mole_amaa/c4w9e6j?context=5)|Well, there were lots of little reasons... I'll just say I got tired of drinking the kool-aid.
 |You know the old saying that if you knew what went into sausage and how it was made, you'd never want sausage again? I made a lot of sausage during my time there. 
[Can you give us some examples of the sausage-making that turned you off?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ukv42/i_worked_at_fox_news_no_im_not_the_mole_amaa/c4w9k6p?context=5)|Well... When the economy started to tank while Bush was in office and all the other news channels were talking about how we were going into a recession and it might be another great depression, we had to show things were not-so-bad. For example, when the housing market bubble burst and foreclosures were happening left and right, I wrote a story that went a little something like, ""Housing prices are at an all time low and it's a good time to buy!"" When the market tanked- ""Cheap stocks to buy now!"" and countless stories about why we needed to invade Iraq. 
[If your story didn't approach the situation from the angle they wanted to frame it in would it get cut, or edited or what? What would they say if you tried to do a story in an angle they didn't like?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ukv42/i_worked_at_fox_news_no_im_not_the_mole_amaa/c4weibf?context=5)|It would usually just get edited ( a little re-wording here and there). Stories would only be cut as a time management issue, if we were running over time, we'd slide the story into another show or broadcast hour. 
[Do you ever feel embarrassed to tell people where you worked?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ukv42/i_worked_at_fox_news_no_im_not_the_mole_amaa/c4wcpxs?context=5)|Ha!Ha! This is an awesome question. Yes. At home (in the south), if people asked where I worked I told them because I knew they'd be impressed (bless their hearts). In NYC, when somebody asked what I did for a living I would say ""Oh, I work in journalism."" That would usually end the conversation. If they pressed me and asked where I would say Fox, and 9 times out of 10 they assumed I meant the Fox 5 (a local channel), and I would let them assume because a lot of New Yorkers enjoyed watching the Fox 5 morning program. They would ask me a lot about Ernie Anastos, and I would say he was awesome and fun to work with although I had never laid eyes on him in my life. 
[How is fox not a valid oranization ? Hollaback just cause you don't agree with their opinons don't attack the guy. And if you really wanna get into a flame war allmost all major news orgs are slanted. He is just telling his story, get off his ass.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ukv42/i_worked_at_fox_news_no_im_not_the_mole_amaa/c4wc8n4?context=5)|Thanks for that, and you're right. Nearly all media have a slant. Let's say the stock market is crashing..again.. Fox uses this story to tell you why it's the perfect time to buy stock (because the prices are all so cheap!) They're right. The prices are cheap. I've used this phrase before, Fox is telling the same story **with their version of the truth**. MSNBC, CNN, Headline News consistently lose to Fox in the ratings. Why? Because their audiences are mostly liberal and the liberal viewers are split among three networks. Somebody should wise up and start another conservative news outlet to finally give Fox some competition and maybe, just maybe, dethrone them.
 |(I use the big three networks as examples because those are the most I'm familiar with)
[How does it feel, working for the corporation that canceled Firefly?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ukv42/i_worked_at_fox_news_no_im_not_the_mole_amaa/c4wdcqs?context=5)|It's also the corporation that brought you the Simpsons and Futurama. 
[It cancelled Firefly, Arrested Development and Futurama.  Unforgivable crimes.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ukv42/i_worked_at_fox_news_no_im_not_the_mole_amaa/c4wkxbw?context=5)|It's making Arrested Development into a movie!
[Hourly? That sucks. Is that normal for TV journalists?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ukv42/i_worked_at_fox_news_no_im_not_the_mole_amaa/c4way6g?context=5)|Depends on the position. The production assistant position was hourly. When I became a writer, I was given the option of being salaried or hourly. I chose to remain an hourly employee because I could make more money annually with all the overtime. This check was clearly from a slow news week. 
[I once saw a facebook post from fox news linking to an article on their site about all of the Christian persecution is the middle east, with a couple jabs about it happening in america.  The next post linked to a story about ""bizarre weather,"" going on all over america, but the storms didn't even really seem all that wild. Tornados in the bible belt, hurricane in the gulf, thunder storms in cali....  To me, it seemed calculated and hugely manipulative. Do you this level of manipulation is something Fox News is capable of pulling off intentionally? Or am I just being paranoid? Would they really use scare tactics like this?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ukv42/i_worked_at_fox_news_no_im_not_the_mole_amaa/c4wcvyd?context=5)|They don't have to do much manipulating. Most of Fox News viewers and readers are conservative, live in the bible belt, and are crazy religious. They throw the bait, and the fish come to the surface.  The Fox Nation site, on the other hand, well... that's an entirely different beast. It was just starting when I was leaving. That's...that's.... there are no words for what it is. It scares me. 
[Please tell us more about the Fox Nation site! I want to know how they come up with the bullshit they put on there! A conservative fellow told me he read a story that some democrats flew a flag with Obama's face on it, he said he knew it was true because there was a picture... I said pictures can lie, there's such a thing as photoshop. He said, Fox Nation would never do that... But would they?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ukv42/i_worked_at_fox_news_no_im_not_the_mole_amaa/c4wewkj?context=5)|I have no words. I can't speak with any certainty but I believe it was created by the web department. I'm not sure what the role of it is or should be except to piss people off. I can't even begin to guess what goes on behind the scene. 
[What's your current line of work? If you left the newsmedia industry, are you ever going to go back?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ukv42/i_worked_at_fox_news_no_im_not_the_mole_amaa/c4wc7y6?context=5)|I'm working in a business related field in an entry level position. I've returned to school to get a second degree so I can advance.
[With all the (perhaps appropriate\) disdain for Fox News among most young people, are you worried that it will actually be a hindrance on your resume?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ukv42/i_worked_at_fox_news_no_im_not_the_mole_amaa/c4wc7y6?context=5)|Not worried at all. There have been times when I applied for jobs (like my current one) and worried that the hiring manager wouldn't believe I worked at a major news organization and now am applying for grunt work. The mole said he couldn't get a job because of Fox. I know plenty of people that now work for ABC, NBC, CNN, MSNBC, and Headline news who got their start at Fox.
[What exactly made you ""stop drinking the kool aid""? Expanding: what issues, circumstances, or events led you to examine your beliefs and shift your social values away from conservatism?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ukv42/i_worked_at_fox_news_no_im_not_the_mole_amaa/c4wc7y6?context=5)|I used this example earlier about how when the economy started to tank and the housing market burst, I had to write a story that went something like, ""Housing prices are at an all time low! We'll tell you why is a good time to buy!"" It **was** true, though, home prices were indeed at an all time low because of all the foreclosures and newly homeless people. It started as little things like that, but later there were stories about which I had to write an ""alternate view"" that I thought were just ridiculous.
[Are there any more upcoming Obama attack ads or stories that you know about?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ukv42/i_worked_at_fox_news_no_im_not_the_mole_amaa/c4w9gpr?context=5)|I don't work there anymore. But it is an election year, so.....
 |I will say this, I honestly don't believe Fox considered it to be an attack ad when they aired it. They put a bunch of stats and silly graphics to scary music to present their version of the truth. 
[Where do you get your news from now?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ukv42/i_worked_at_fox_news_no_im_not_the_mole_amaa/c4waohc?context=5)|Mostly online from pulse, fark.com, drudge, or google news. I don't watch a lot of network/cable news. Not even local news.
[What do you think of the scandals in Britain and do you believe it may effect Fox News](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ukv42/i_worked_at_fox_news_no_im_not_the_mole_amaa/c4waohc?context=5)|When I first heard the news, I just kind of chuckled to myself. No, I don't think Fox will feel the consequences of it unless there's some sort of take over, but I'm sure there are plans in place to keep Fox News going if Murdoch was ousted.
[Do you feel you did the right thing working there?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ukv42/i_worked_at_fox_news_no_im_not_the_mole_amaa/c4wdjb1?context=5)|Do I feel I did the right thing by working there? I'm not sure what this means. Did I feel I had a message to spread? No. I applied for a job at Fox because it was my goal, as a young, naive journalist, to work for a major network one day. At the time, I was a fan of Fox News. It was relatively new and different then than it is now. I had no ulterior motive for working there.
[Do you feel you should have left sooner?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ukv42/i_worked_at_fox_news_no_im_not_the_mole_amaa/c4wdjb1?context=5)|I worked with a lot of good people who had no control over the content that was aired. If they didn't like it, why didn't they leave? Well, news jobs are difficult to come by, even at that level. Most people felt stuck, but they still came to work everyday and did their assigned duties to the best of their abilities.
[How do you sleep at night knowing the strife and misinformation your actions have spread?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ukv42/i_worked_at_fox_news_no_im_not_the_mole_amaa/c4wdjb1?context=5)|I'm not doing this to bash my former employer, and I won't. Did I agree with everything? No. Does anybody agree with everything at their place of work? No. Office politics is everywhere.
[How long were you struggling with the decision to leave before you finally decided enough was enough?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ukv42/i_worked_at_fox_news_no_im_not_the_mole_amaa/c4wdjb1?context=5)|I left because my ideals, priorities, and goals changed. Do I wish I had left sooner? There were times I considered quitting because I felt I was overlooked for a promotion and for other office bullshit. I think I left when the time was finally right for me.
[Well, regardless of what you think, your work definitely helped to set the limits on conversation in many families and helped to bring this country to the brink we're at now. I'd suggest you do a bit more consideration of this fact.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ukv42/i_worked_at_fox_news_no_im_not_the_mole_amaa/c4wjjz5?context=5)|I was just a cog in the machine, my friend. I didn't do anything to *force* people to think one way or the other.
[So in essence you're the guy who goes to a business (as a contractor or permanent employee\) and outlines what is worth their money and what isn't?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ukv42/i_worked_at_fox_news_no_im_not_the_mole_amaa/c4wjjz5?context=5)|Not really, there are many careers in financing. I just watch where money goes and decide which risks/investments the company should take. 
[Thank you for doing this AMA because bias in media is always a hotly debated subject and as a man that cannot stand either side, yet due to some of my beliefs I am categorized as more conservative, I would like to ask you: As a journalist, what source would you recommend as the most unbiased and best way to get news, also was there anything that you did while working for Fox News that you actually enjoyed?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ukv42/i_worked_at_fox_news_no_im_not_the_mole_amaa/c4wfkq3?context=5)|The Associated Press is a good source. Usually, it's just straight reporting. I also like NPR, and as Bellika pointed out its good to go to several sources and draw your on conclusions.
[Tl/dr: best unbiased news source and did you do anything you enjoyed?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ukv42/i_worked_at_fox_news_no_im_not_the_mole_amaa/c4wfkq3?context=5)|I like most of the people I worked wirh. Also it was fun working on entertainment segments. I got to meet a lot of celebrities. 
[Thanks for the info, and also please don't hate all those that are conservative just because of what you experienced, unlike people from Fox News most of us with conservative views do not act like asses and are reasonable people.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ukv42/i_worked_at_fox_news_no_im_not_the_mole_amaa/c4wn9hj?context=5)|I don't hate anybody, really.. except for maybe assholes.
[From your time working in the field, do you believe that Fox News operates on a much different level internally than CNN or MSNBC, or is it just a different audience?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ukv42/i_worked_at_fox_news_no_im_not_the_mole_amaa/c4wbsvt?context=5)|They're all very similar in structure. There's a president and VP of content followed by executive producers, senior producers, associate producers, writers, bookers, researchers, editors and assistants. How information is delivered and the audience are the main differences. 
[Can you elaborate on those differences a bit more?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ukv42/i_worked_at_fox_news_no_im_not_the_mole_amaa/c4wc62m?context=5)|[This](http://www.theoutdoorstrader.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=104406&amp;d=1338315595) is the best example I have ever seen.
[I remember watching a documentary in school about Fox News that showed how reporters in certain circumstances were instructed by a memo from high-up to frame a particular story in a certain way - often anti-Democratic/liberal - so as to directly cater to the Republican side of the matter.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ukv42/i_worked_at_fox_news_no_im_not_the_mole_amaa/c4w9nkw?context=5)|We are not *instructed* to be anti-anything by anyone. However, we cater to the audience. The audience isn't watching CNN or MSNBC, why? Because they don't like how those other channels present news, so we presented news in a different manner.
[Yes, Outfoxed was the one.  So if it was just catering to the audience there must have been some ""I can't believe I'm writing this"" moments on the production side?  I can imagine that would be frustrating.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ukv42/i_worked_at_fox_news_no_im_not_the_mole_amaa/c4w9svt?context=5)|Yep. See my ""sausage making"" comment below in response to a question from KatyRPishere and Catesby.
[ ... so we presented news in a different manner.  As a *journalist*, doesn't this kinda sound weird to you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ukv42/i_worked_at_fox_news_no_im_not_the_mole_amaa/c4walai?context=5)|Journalism is just a different kind of story telling. There are two sides to every story. We told the other side. 
[If presented the opportunity, would you return to Fox?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ukv42/i_worked_at_fox_news_no_im_not_the_mole_amaa/c4wbca2?context=5)|I had the opportunity. I didn't. 
[Would you agree that Comedy Central is currently the best place to go for news? Colbert/stewart.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ukv42/i_worked_at_fox_news_no_im_not_the_mole_amaa/c4wefti?context=5)|I really enjoy the Daily Show and Colbert Report. I had the honor of meeting Colbert several times. He's awesome and the people that work with him are super talented. I told him I wanted a job. He asked if I was any good and told me to send a resume. I didn't. I regret that decision. 
[How did you get a job there/internship there? Also, is Bill O'Reilly a nice guy off camera?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ukv42/i_worked_at_fox_news_no_im_not_the_mole_amaa/c4we16w?context=5)|I got the job there by applying via foxnews.com At the bottom of the page they have a listing of current openings. I didn't know anyone there, and applied on a whim. I had an impressive resume for somebody still relatively new to the business. I went through a few rounds of phone interviews and had to take a current events test before I was made an offer. Writers/producers were required at the time to take a writing test.
[What about my second question?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ukv42/i_worked_at_fox_news_no_im_not_the_mole_amaa/c4wehbm?context=5)|Silence speaks volumes, am I right?
[Have you seen the movie ""Network"", and if you have, what is your opinion on it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ukv42/i_worked_at_fox_news_no_im_not_the_mole_amaa/c4wdjty?context=5)|We actually watched it in my Intro to Broadcasting class. I don't know anyone who's killed himself over ratings, but working in news can be a soul crushing experience.
[Do you think Journalism is still a career worth pursuing? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ukv42/i_worked_at_fox_news_no_im_not_the_mole_amaa/c4we76l?context=5)|Not really, but I'm a little bitter and jaded. Some of my former co-workers still work in news and enjoy it, others do it because they don't know anything else. 
[How were the HR practices by way of movement or promotion within the company.  I.E. were you able to move around laterally within the organization provided you met the required competencies as opposed to the company making outside hires?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ukv42/i_worked_at_fox_news_no_im_not_the_mole_amaa/c4wcnj2?context=5)|I think there were more outside hires for several reasons -- most of the positions that became available were entry level production assistant positions (because people would be promoted or just leave after a while). If a new show was launching, Fox would use a few in house producers and then hire writers and such from outside. Also, to keep costs low, instead of promoting someone from within and having to give them a raise, they'd hire from the outside and lowball salary.
[I've been around politics and news north of the border so I find the confluence of hiring practices between newsmakers and policy makers interesting.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ukv42/i_worked_at_fox_news_no_im_not_the_mole_amaa/c4wcnj2?context=5)|I can tell you this much, it's not easy to be promoted from within. You have to work your ass off. Some people try really hard for a while and then burn out, and keep their shitty jobs. It can be a soul crushing experience. 
[In your opinion, is Fox more concerned with reporting the news or viewership and ratings? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ukv42/i_worked_at_fox_news_no_im_not_the_mole_amaa/c4wcngg?context=5)|They aren't concerned at all about ratings. They kill the competitors and it's been that way since they started. You might see ridiculous adds like ""11 years of being your number one news channel."" They have worked to broaden the viewership demographics. They've got the lock on the old white man market, but increasingly try to gain the viewership of the oft-coveted 18-35 demo. They work hard to ""improve"" (for lack of a better word) programming to gain younger viewers.
[What was your job?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ukv42/i_worked_at_fox_news_no_im_not_the_mole_amaa/c4w95cy?context=5)|I started as a production assistant (worked with the video department, graphics, and ran scripts). I was promoted a couple of times, and left as a writer. 
[What kind of writer? Politics,Sports,Technology,etc?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ukv42/i_worked_at_fox_news_no_im_not_the_mole_amaa/c4w9933?context=5)|General stuff. The newsroom isn't split into different departments. We don't have a sports department to write sports stories or a political department to write political bits. All writers must be up to date on current events and on-going stories. I've written lots of stuff from bears falling out of trees, the market ""crashing,"" and bombings in the Middle East.
[Do you currently work as a journalist?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ukv42/i_worked_at_fox_news_no_im_not_the_mole_amaa/c4wblmx?context=5)|I may do some freelance work from time, but I no longer consider myself a journalist. Currently, I work in a business related field and I've returned to school to get a second degree to advance.

ulq7p,6,2012-06-05,Need advice: brother just came out of the closet to me and seems depressed. I don't know what to do.,Dontknowwhattodo987,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ulq7p/need_advice_brother_just_came_out_of_the_closet/,"Reddit, please please please give me advice. I don't know what to do and I don't know where to post this. This is so long and I don't know how to condense it. I just got off the phone with my younger brother (20 years old) and can't stop crying. I know he needs lots of counseling and therapy, but there's no way we can afford it, nor is he comfortable opening up to someone in general.


My brother has always been quiet and always keeps to himself. He has friends, but it doesn't seem like he gets super close to them. Today, he told me he was gay. I have no problem with, but I'm worried that my family will since most everyone else other than my immediate family lives in Asia. My parents will be somewhat uncomfortable, but I think will eventually come to be okay with it. We're not very close with our parents, which also leads to many problems. Before I talk about that, I want to write out what happened today.

He's been hooking up with guys that he's been meeting through on an app. He started dating one of the guys exclusively who is supposedly a sex addict. This guy told my brother the urges stopped because he met him. I don't know how long this has been going on for, but my brother said that this guy has met up with others from the app but ""hasn't done anything."" My brother doesn't know what to do. Gay or straight, it's too suspicious to me. My brother doesn't want to leave this guy because he's the first person he's opened up to ever and especially doesn't want to leave him if he's a sex addict (I don't know the dude, but it sounds like this guy is guilt tripping my brother into staying with him). I told my brother to leave him and nurse his heartbreak by getting outside, blocking this guy on facebook, hitting the gym (typical reddit breakup advice). My brother seems to be apprehensive about breaking it off with him. The guy told him that he stopped himself from doing anything with the person that he met up with because he thought of my brother. I think fucking bullshit. The intention was there. How do I get him to stay away from this guy?

I asked him if he's gotten tested and he said yes, so I think he's clean. When I told him to go to the gym, he just said that he just really doesn't want to be around people. It makes me so sad, I don't know what to say or do. I want him to be safe and I want him to be happy.

He's an only child and is the only boy in the family. I knew he always kind of felt this way, but today was the first time he's voiced it. My parents have always had higher expectations for him because he's the lone male child, and I don't know how to change that. He knows my parents care about him, but doesn't really feel it. He can't stand being around them and he wants to move out ASAP. We have a rough relationship with our parents and it's not because they're horrible parents, but they don't know how to show affection. Their way of showing us they care is by being on our cases all the time. I moved away for college and am now living in San Francisco doing an internship. They love us and we understand that, but there is a language barrier so it's hard for us to communicate. The kids don't really speak Mandarin, whereas my parents don't speak English that well.

My brother never comes out to eat dinner with the family, never really talks to anyone in our family. My parents are very asian and used to spank us when we were little. It stopped a long time ago after they realized that it's not acceptable in America. My brother said he's getting flashbacks to when they used to spank us. It seems like he's getting a lot of abandonment feelings and I want him to talk to someone, but he's not comfortable with talking to people and opening up. He's never really been very close to anyone, has always kept to himself. How do I get him to talk to someone? Do I refer him to LGBT for support? We have so many family affection issues that don't have to do with him being gay. How do I fix this? My parents can' afford counseling, I wouldn't even know how to bring it up.

My little sister is also young and I don't want her to go through the same family problems that we both grew up in. I consider myself a strong and secure person, but I think it's because I've always had a very close-knit group of friends.

I think my brother is thinking about suicide. I'm trying to be there as much as I can without physically being there. He didn't tell me anything, but I've had a friend commit suicide and this seems too similar. Reddit, I'm sorry this is so long, but can you help me with any advice please?

EDIT: He just said he's going to a gun range tomorrow. That's okay right? It'll help him get his mind off things? This makes me really nervous for some reason, even though I probably shouldn't be."
ullyu,1,2012-06-05,Nothing huge... I'm just so damn frustrated with my own self defeating attitude and inaction,19Throwaway91,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/ullyu/nothing_huge_im_just_so_damn_frustrated_with_my/,"Well, this my my chance to whine and complain like a bratty kid and not feel bad about it. 

Every single day I fantasize about how my life would be different if I had a do-over. I have a mother who loves me and is extremely supportive. If I opened up to her she would be very compassionate. I will never open up to her though. It's not how my mind works. My father and I have a very shallow relationship. He's a great guy, but I have never talked to him about anything more personal than sports or vacation plans.

Through highschool I was friendless. I had people who I enjoyed to hang out with at school, but we never interacted outside of school. This would probably be surprising if you met me because I tend to be very spontaneous and lighthearted when I'm with a group. Now I'm in college and I made a tight knit group of friends. We went on road trips and cooked together. Now for no reason I'm just backing away from them. Avoiding them. No reason at all. I'm stressed because of what I'm doing and I'm doing what I'm doing because I'm stressed.

I fit a common stereotype on reddit. Coasted through highschool without any effort whatsoever and did excellent on standardized tests so my parents though I was some sort of genius destined for fame and fortune. Thought this success was some inherent part of myself and I expect things to fall into place without me taking initiative. Now I'm an engineering student at a mediocre school who's grades are getting progressively worse and worse. I should study, but I have no motivation. (What a terrible excuse, eh?) I may fail a class for the first time ever when grades are released in a couple days. Classes are the sum total of my accomplishments so far in life, so that hits hard. 

I've been a lazy bum when it comes to applying to engineering internships, so it comes as no surprise that I didn't get one. I'm an engineering student who will graduate at the end of next school year with no internship, or research experience with a mediocre gpa. Hopefully I'll get a internship period to hire deal at some engineering firm.

I think I hit the nail on the head with this: ""I expect things to fall into place without me taking initiative"" 

(Summary of the ""Wah wah, I don't have a girlfriend paragraph."": I friendzone girls who show attraction to me. Why? No reason and I hate myself for doing it.) I'm only a little socially awkward and can pass it off as bashful, in fact I love good discussions. I'm not overweight or anything, in fact I'm athletic and love ourdoorsy things. Still, I've never been on a date, never held hands, never kissed (Virgin goes without saying?) at 21 y/o. There's been a few girls who were definitely relationship material. Hell, for a year and a half a wonderful girl and I had a mutual crush. Did I do anything about it? Ha! Good joke! I even went to her house a few times with a group of friends, was sitting in the hot tub right in front of her and told her to her face that I thought she was awesome, but no, I didn't want a relationship. What the fuck brain??? Why'd you say that??? You hurt her feelings and she's just laid it on the line. I'm not gonna break out of my shell. She moved away. Recently, there's been a cute girl who has been going out of her way to say hi and smiles at me from far away. I suspect that she's been interested in me for a while. I plan on doing precisely nothing about it.

I've also disappointed some other people more recently whom I respect. Purely by my inaction.

I know exactly what I need to do to get rid of my problems, but I don't do it. I never have. Will I ever? Only time will tell.

Well, that's all for now folks. If you know who I am, please pretend you don't. Anyways, I realize I'll probably look back at this in 10 years and think it's completely inconsequential, just like I do now with ridiculous 8th grade drama, but I'm angsty and frustrated at myself. Perhaps I'm a little bit depressed. Not really though... I still find humor everywhere. It's just that there's the person I know I could be and he's awesome, then there's the person I am. I know what I need to do to fix it, but for no reason at all, I don't. What the hell. C'mon! Just do it! ... Sigh ...

I think I'll feel better over the summer."

Thanks in advance for your suggestions!  Also, any other information about what to do this summer in Baltimore would be great...  thanks!"
uld7b,6,2012-06-04,"Louisville, you're a great city, but...",capnthrowacct,Louisville,https://www.reddit.com/r/Louisville/comments/uld7b/louisville_youre_a_great_city_but/,"This has been bothering me for months now, and I'm hoping this makes me feel somewhat better. Rant ahead.

When I was first told that the internship would be at Louisville, I was a little worried. I'm from the southern part of Florida (actually I've noticed quite a bit of Florida plates), so to me going *anywhere* in Kentucky might as well been like sending me into the boonies. Needless to say, I was very pleasantly surprised upon arrival. Everyone that comes up to visit has the same impression.

The state itself is fucking gorgeous. Coming from nothing but flatness and endless heat, anything with more than one hill in it puts me in awe. The people are friendly (though I will say it depends on where you go), and theres no shortage of things to do.

One thing though...and this bothers me to no end. It isn't the way you guys say Louisville, LaFayette, or any other French named thing most of America admittedly butchers anyway. It isn't the food. Oh dear God, it isn't the food. It is *absolutely* not the food.

Its the driving. You guys can't drive worth salt. I've been here twice, for a total of around one year, and it never fails to amaze me how absolutely horrifying the drivers are. At first I thought it was the snow. Sure, being from Florida myself I wasn't the greatest, but I made do and managed to not break down sign posts *constantly*. OK, it will definitely get better in the summer.

No, it doesn't. Somehow, its worse than before. The merging lane is for **merging**. When approaching a merge, it would be awful nice if you moved one lane over. You know, to avoid slowing down traffic? People getting on won't magically just disappear or stop. They're going to get on, whether you block it or not. The blame isn't placed solely on those blocking the merge, the mergers are pretty asstastic, too. If you're getting ready to enter high-speed traffic, you should try to *at least match the speed of the highway*. Why the fuck are you going 10 mph *less* than everyone else?

If that isn't bad enough, once you actually get on the highway, it isn't any better. Do people here know what the mirrors on their car are for? This isn't a huge game of deathly bumper cars, look before you haphazardly dive into a lane.

When it rains, the road is not trying to kill you. You don't have to **stop in the middle of the highway** (yes, this has happened) or slam on the damn breaks every time you approach a light. You can go fast, in fact, pretend it isn't even raining. Just leave a little room between cars for once, and everything will be fine. Breathe. Relax. Take a deep breath and let some oxygen flow through your system.

There is also the fact that **red lights are a totally foreign concept**. Its comical how many people will cruise straight through a red like it isn't even a thing. Bitch, *you can die from that!* I know you're probably thinking ""dude it doesn't even happen that much!"" Well, that may be true, but I will say in Miami I can count the number of times I've seen it happen on one hand. Literally. This is in Miami, where cops don't give a shit unless you're throwing crack out your window and shooting them with an automatic rifle like some game of drug dealer's skeet shooting. Even then you've got to be doing it in a nice neighborhood for it to be an issue.

Here? Dudes burning reds is called lunch time traffic. Not sure why though, because drivers here are mind numbingly slow. Its like nobody has anywhere to be ever, so might as well coast and take in the view. Gotta burn that red though, it'll slow you down from going ten under the limit, right next to the guy going the same speed. Its like some game of low speed drag racing, and the only losers are the people behind you, because we can't fucking go around.

Even nature here has a tendency to be awful motorists. Stupid ass Canadian geese, chilling out on the fucking backroads like its all good with their geeselings(?). *SERIOUSLY?!* Doesn't matter how close you get, they just waddle around with a look that I can only describe as ""What, you're gonna hit me with your pussy ass truck, bitch? Come at me, bro!"" At first, it was cool to see those geese. Now I just want to strangle them and deal with the huge fine. Get the fuck out the way, feathers!

The worst part of every day is waking up knowing that there are plenty of great places around, but getting there means I have to deal with *this shit* again. Fuck.

Edit: Added a small section about rain. No idea how I forgot about that given the rain thats been happening."

I was originally going to post this in /r/questions however I figured redditors here would have a better understanding of the subject. 

Long story short, I'm a business student looking for internships in marketing and I see many that require knowledge in Graphic Design, however I am unsure of what specific skills are required. 

**What would you consider neccesary to be able to claim knowledge of intermediate graphics design skills, compared to a basic or advanced level?**

If you want to answer my bonus question, **what is a good way to improve upon my graphic design skills.** I consider myself computer fluent (like most redditors) and can do the basics with photoshop and could probably navigate my way through some graphic design software with some practice, assuming it is not meant for users with a higher skill level.

What exactly does it take mathematically to manage thousands of players and millions of projectiles and animations going on in a digital world/continent. How do those discussions go down when you begin designing an infrastructure for something that colossal? I know you guys were testing for some innovative spawning options to keep people in the fight. What about any innovative chat/voice system between squads and platoons? The ability for a squad leader to have voice of their own squad overridden by command voice chat with another squad they are working with would be awesome. I'm sure everyone else will have a million questions so I will depart with a final one : Can any/some the air vehicles do a barrel roll ? I found it very difficult to get away from things in the first one, almost like I wasn't really flying.

Say we consider the first 100k of a claim to be basic. What my boss would do is calculate development factors from basic claims data, calculate developable claims amounts for a given period by subtracting out 100k * number of maxed claims and then apply development factors and then add the 100ks back in. I say that this underestimates the ultimate since using the maxed claims in calculating the development factors is going to weight them down since they are fixed at 100k.

The knowledge I have is introductory Circuits, Computer Systems, and C Programming (Physics 2, Intro to Computer Systems and Hardware, and Intro to Programming respectively.)

I was wondering if you guys have any ideas for hands-on projects to launch me intro my next semester at school, where I'll be doing all ECE classes. Some things I had in mind would be; Straight up furthering my programming knowledge, picking up something like an Arduino and trying to program that to do different things (need more inspiration here if this is a good route), or just picking up some reading on Circuits and getting ahead on the material.

Best case scenario, I'm doing something hands-on, and ultimately have something to show for it. Some early experience that simulates something I might be doing in an Internship (a ship that has not yet sailed for me, but working on it.)

I'd appreciate any input, and Cheers!"
uo9iq,3,2012-06-06,Can I use MS Access for this?,Shariq1989,MSAccess,https://www.reddit.com/r/MSAccess/comments/uo9iq/can_i_use_ms_access_for_this/,"So here is the thing:


I started an engineering internship with a tug and barge company this summer. My boss wanted me to build him a vessel maintenance management system using which he could


1) Enter records of maintenance completed
2) Enter records of regulatory inspections completed
3) View a history of maintenance and inspections completed
4) View all upcoming maintenance and inspections, tiered by priority. 
5) An alert function for tasks upcoming within a given time duration
6) A way to print a report for work history (3) and a worklist (4)
7) There would be a separate workbook for each vessel. Easily add new components or inspections to book for it to track.
8) Easily copy and modify the workbook to work with a new vessel


I am a really computer savvy guy but had little to no knowledge of programming or macros. I do have a really good ability to pick up new computer skills quickly to get work done. As long as I have a defined problem, I can come up with solutions. It took me a little over two weeks to figure out how VBA works with Excel and build a system that does everything mentioned above really well. The maintenance and inspections work off of either time or engine hours. I figured out a way for the worksheet to pull the engine hours from another workbook that gets updated with running hours every month. Using ""Hours to Go"" till an overhaul or inspection is due and the average number of hours an engine runs over the course of a month, the workbook can predict when a new inspection or maintenance is coming up. All these inspections and maintenances are compiled into a sheet where they are prioritized using conditional formatting. Once an inspection or maint. is completed, my boss will select it from a drop down and hit a button which will paste the entry with a time stamp into a Work History sheet and at the same time, reset the Upcoming Work sheet so that the component or inspection gets an updated due date (satisfying 1, 2, 3 and 4). Then I figured out a way for Excel to send out an email using Outlook once a component or inspection fell within a certain ""Days to Go"" range (5). The email would contain the name of the vessel, the component or inspection that needs attention and the number of Days to Go. Currently working on figuring out how to have Excel automatically add the due dates to the Outlook Calendar. I am also in the process of streamlining 6,7 and 8, and just making the workbook robust in general. My boss is highly satisfied with this current system I built but I want to make it better. I want to explore all the possibilities. 


I have two more months to go on the internship and I have just now started looking at MS Access. The program just seems to be a lot more clean-cut and has the same VBA capabilities. I am wondering if it would be worth it for me to move this whole program into Access or if it is a total crap shoot. As it stands right now, I know nothing about the program but I can learn quick and am pretty interested in learning about databases. I have already started playing around in Access, just exploring what it is capable of. So it is time for me to reach out to you Access gurus! Is it worth it? Are there any better options?"

My question is, is this a common occurrence? Are people expected to literally program for 7 hours a day? Is this a recipe for burning out if it continues?"
unxaj,0,2012-06-06,"Reddit, has your life been rewarded with little work and feel that it really is unfair to other people?",[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/unxaj/reddit_has_your_life_been_rewarded_with_little/,"So growing up i was always a c/d student. My parents always told me that I wasn't going to make it in life because I just didn't try hard enough and did not care about school. Well after I graduated(2.1 gpa) I started at the local community college. I was working for a car wash and knew I wanted to work in computers (networking or something). 

Well I found a job and it happened to be where my dad worked. He is an engineer and the job was an IT helpdesk position (internship) So I applied and gave him my resume to hand it to them IT team. They interviewed me and must have liked me gave me a job. I was 18 making 12 bucks an hour and felt like a boss. Fast forward 2 years of basically browsing the net and doing some basic help desk duties I found another job making a few dollars more an hour. This job was a hardware manager and eventually full system admin position. 

I hardly did any work other than what had to be done. I got laid off from there after multiple rounds. It was my turn to go. I stayed unemployed for 6 months didn't even look for a job. The last week of my unemployment I'm like oh crap need a job. Interviewed at 3 places and one of them called me back and offered me a job that was better and making more than I was previously.  So i started immediately.

Now fast forward a few months and i'm offered another job making 20% more than the job i took so I told my them and they matched almost all at about 18% so I stayed. I am currently still working here and support everything but I keep everything fixed so there is nothing for me to do. 

I don't make a lot now 50-55k. But having no degree and being 26 I feel like it just isn't fair that I haven't even tried and it feels like it has been handed to me. 

I see people all the time working 2 jobs just trying to make ends meet and the work they are doing is 100 times harder than what i do. 

How has life been unfair in a positive way for you?

**TL;DR: No college degree 26 making over 50k/year and don't do anything at work. Never tried hard at anything.**"
unk5g,1,2012-06-06,Close friend lied about having a degree &amp; probably cancer. What's this dude's deal? *Long post - TL;DR included*,[deleted],psychology,https://www.reddit.com/r/psychology/comments/unk5g/close_friend_lied_about_having_a_degree_probably/,"Hey guys,

I had originally posted this in /r/askreddit and it was suggested that this should go here. I apologize if re-posting this is against any rules, and furthermore apologize for the upcoming wall of text. Basic * *TL;DR* * is at the bottom. Hoping some of you Psych Redditors have the time to read this, and if so - thanks!

I'm 23 now, I first met my friend (well call him ""M"") M &amp; my current group of friends when I was 19. When I first met this dude I thought he was amazing. He claimed to have received his chemical engineering degree in 3 years while battling pancreatic cancer that had occurred while he was away at school. He also loves smoking weed as much as I do, and at that point in my life I blamed the marijuana on my laziness instead of taking a much deeper look at myself.

I was just coming back from University at the time, after failing out due to partying, playing WoW and never going to class. I was in-between friend groups at the time, leaving my high school friend group finally as they took the plunge into harder drugs that I'm glad I stopped while I was ahead. I say this so that you can understand the allure that M had to me, as solid proof to me at the time that you can party AND get your work done. What a motivation &amp; confidence booster!

Turns out that the degree doesn't exist and he dropped out of school when his high school Gf dumped him and he was too sad to attend classes (f**kin pussy). One of my friend's moms met up with M's Mom in the town supermarket and she mentioned his degree. M's mom looked at my buddie's Mom dumbfounded and was like, what degree? I guess that explains that in all of the years of our friendship I have NEVER been invited into his house or formally introduced to his family despite hanging out together just about every day.

As far as the Pancreatic Cancer goes, he had some minor procedure done and he must have told his ex they also found cancer to try and get her to feel awful. He told all of us it was cancer and rode this lie for a good 3 years until we started unraveling everything. At this point, we've started to make strides on calling him out on everything, except for the degree &amp; this. The degree is obvious, I just don't feel like arguing about it. As far as the Cancer, our bro's agree that we'd almost rather not know if it's real or not and still want to give him the benefit of the doubt due to the severity of the potential circumstance, despite never seeing any proof of this. He appears to be in perfect health, never watching his diet &amp; doing what he pleases.

I'll write more about it below, but M has a ""charm"" about him that I've never witnessed before. It's almost creepy looking back on it how people bend to his will &amp; how incredible he seems off the bat. I felt great thinking this guy was my best friend, and I get this charisma and charm to myself &amp; I can learn and grow my confidence further. Also, keep in mind I have never had a father figure so I take what I can get in those areas to supplement.

I remember one day he bragged about how charismatic he is and how he has a habit of splitting up groups of friends. At the time I was sure that there were other circumstances and didn't think much of it. I had introduced him to a best friend of mine, a kid that I've known the longest but didn't see as often due to our schedules. He and M hit it off and I thought it was great, until I started not seeing any of them often &amp; knowing they were just hanging out together without me.

I didn't want to look like a jealous asshole, especially amongst bro's - but one day it finally upset me enough and I cracked. I confided in M on a car ride and said that I felt like I was loosing my friendship with one of my best friends. He assured me that it was all in my head and that my other friend had mentioned nothing of the sort.

M ended up pissing off this kid a few months down the line (more on this to come as it's relevant) and I finally re-connected with my best friend. I told him that I had had that conversation with M about how I felt that I was losing a very good friend. To my surprise, my friend said that he had had the exact same conversation with M about me, and that M said that I had never once mentioned it to him.

At that point it was clear that he was making an effort for whatever to try and de-rail my friendship. I still don't understand why, and try not to dwell on it simply because I feel like it's utter stupidity. We're 20 something years old, this isn't high school and certainly the last thing I'd want to deal with when spending my time with dudes.

As for how he pissed my best friend off (who is normally extremely easy going) - we have a mutual female friend who is extremely over weight. One of the kindest girls I know, but due to her weight she acts out overly promiscuous and my friend likes to keep it in line as he is essentially like a brother to her. It was a topic that was discussed many times that if someone ever legitimately wanted to date her that they need only ask, if they truly were into her. You need to keep our ravenous dudes on a leash when she's hungry for some dick and the booze is flowing.

From my best friend's exact words to me were ""M looked me in the eyes and said ""Our friendship is more important that just fooling around for easy sex"" .""

As it turns out, because women have huge ass mouths, is that they'd get drunk and go screw around. I guess it only happened 3 times, but M's excuse was ""oh I was drunk"". Yeah? 3 times? My friend FLIPPED the fuck out, and this girl's older brothers (huge scary italian dudes) were about to kick the shit out of my best friend because this girls at home crying her eyes out saying that my friend is really mad at her. Obviously she isn't going to say ""I fucked this dude and here's the real situation"".

Sparing the rant, this is what pissed me off the most. I tried to take M out and talk to him about this. I told him that this kid is getting flack from this girls brothers due to HIS actions. He goes, ""oh, they're mad at him? Oh well, at least I'm ok."" - he then proceeded to laugh it off like a fucking joke. Meanwhile he'll be texting my friend saying he's so sorry, and that he's crying his eyes out and that he's sorry for being a shitty friend.

Fast forward to this week, everyone's back from school including her. When we get together and he manages to come around he has her giving him back massages and shit, since this girl is still head over heels for him. She keeps begging my friend to let them fuck again, even though M is seeing another girl. He still pulls this shit, and I guarantee none of the girls he's had since have any idea about this shit. He has absolutely no problem straight up using this girl in-front of all our friends &amp; her group of friends.

It's only as I've smartened up and stopped putting this kid on a pedestal that all this shit added up. You think you fucking know a guy man, and then you find out everything about him is total bullshit he made up to feed his ego.

I can't fuckin stand him and I still see him at least once a week. Anytime someone calls him on his shit he makes up some ridiculous crap, its mostly entertaining at this point and none of my other friends feel like upsetting an otherwise good time to argue with this idiot, but everyone is well aware. He never gets invited out, so if he finds out what's going on he'll usually just end up inviting himself through someone else who may also happen to be going and isn't in our immediate group of friends.

Just last week we were at a pool party with a new group of girls. He doesn't even have shame anymore, he's sitting in front of 3 of our friends talking to this one girls dad about how he's going for his second degree and is being contracted by the department of defense for chemical weapons development and blah blah.

THE WORST FUCKIN PART is that people eat it up. He comes off so charismatic, always has girls all over him even though I bust my ass at the gym and he doesn't do shit. After bullshitting this chicks dad all I could hear the other rents present talking about was how awesome that new guy that came over is. Makes me so fuckin mad.

The thing is, he IS smart. If he actually did anything with himself maybe he could achieve something. He still swears he has a degree, yet he's working at KOHLS. His Mom works at KOHLS, let's take a guess on who got their 23 year old son a job? If you have a Chemical Engineering degree, where's your fucking internship somewhere? Oh, he also switches the title of his degree from Chemical Engineering to Organic Chemistry depending on the situation, and I'm positive he thinks that I just don't care enough to remember.


The only great thing that's come of this is for me really. For years I was so certain that this kid was for real that I adapted the qualities that I liked in myself. I worked my ass off for a year and a half to get accepted back into school full-time, while working full-time. I just finished this semester with a full course load and received A's in all of them. I'm pretty stoked - and I still party and enjoy myself quite a bit. All in moderation. My confidence has never been higher, and for this entire experience I'm actually grateful. Losing someone you're close to blows, but I've learned way to many valuable lessons here.

Reading back on this entire post makes me seem like a bit of a pussy. I'm cautious when dealing with him on such extreme matters because I am infact afraid of him. The kid knows how to get into everyone's house, and if angry enough I wouldn't put it past him to do something very extreme. 3 of my other friends have expressed the same concern. 

* *TL;DR* * - Close friend lied about having a degree &amp; possibly pancreatic cancer. Uses his ridiculous charisma to carry himself through life while lying left and right, and it works. Actually intimidated by what he would do if truly angered and uncovered.

unhdc,5,2012-06-06,Side Projects,danjam11565,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/unhdc/side_projects/,"So, to preface this, I'm only a rising sophmore in college studying comp. sci, and am probably getting myself a bit psyched out over nothing, but as I look into career options for CS, I keep seeing sites like GitHub mentioned, as well as the importance of having various examples of code to show off during interviews, like writing an app, or something similar. Do people have code from classes in cases like this, or do people really spend tons of their free time writing programs?

I'm just kind of wondering, is it realistic for companies to expect students fresh out of college to have written a bunch of code on their own time? There's always code from classes, but the way it sounds sometimes makes it seem like you have to spend your weekends coding just to get a job. 

I know that elite companies like Google will expect stuff like this, but do more average good companies, or do they understand not everyone (even good coders) codes their own programs during their free time for fun?  


Edit: I want to add that I know employers expect some sort of experience, and I definitely plan on applying for a lot of internships over the next few years, but do they also look for independent projects as a neccessity? "

If so, how did you get him and do you have any crazy bounty hunting stories?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uma1u/iama_very_independent_filmmaker_who_recently/c4wlpip?context=5)|That was Dog!  We lucked out in getting him on board.  The director of the film, Alan Deutsch is also a producer and director on Dog's show so he pulled a few strings and got The Dog to come out to Austin, TX and do a cameo for a day.  He was incredibly nice to everyone on the cast and crew and was adamant about us getting exactly what we wanted out of him.  And he loves Pepsi.  A lot.
[What kind of Pepsi? Also, did anybody offer him ice with his Pepsi? If so, did he think they were referring to crack cocaine and give them a speech?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uma1u/iama_very_independent_filmmaker_who_recently/c4wmd25?context=5)|Just regular Pepsi in a bottle.

[Will it be on Netflix in the near future?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uma1u/iama_very_independent_filmmaker_who_recently/c4wlqd2?context=5)|It will be.  Sometime this summer.

[Any advice for independent filmmakers now that you've completed a feature film?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uma1u/iama_very_independent_filmmaker_who_recently/c4wm84p?context=5)|Don't shrug off post-production costs.  During filming, we were always running into things that cut into our post budget and we did what we had to do to just finish the film.  Then we got to post and had very little budget for editing, sound mix/design and music.  That's the real reason the film took so long to complete.
 |Also, next time I'm going to write a more simple story that takes place in only a few locations with a few characters.  I loved having all of our actors and set pieces but it was a beast to coordinate and pull off.
 |Also part deux, don't be a dick to people.  They're working for cheap or free to work in the film industry.  Be nice.
[I would have edited and mixed your audio and did the sound design for free. Independent artists need to help each other out and support the arts.

[Budget?  Tech stuff? Camera? Edited on?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uma1u/iama_very_independent_filmmaker_who_recently/c4wlxde?context=5)|Budget came it at around 100k.  We shot on the Canon 5D and 7Ds.  Edited on Final Cut Pro.
[How did you feel about using those cameras re battery life? I was thinking shooting on my t2 but dunno should I look around and borrow something else.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uma1u/iama_very_independent_filmmaker_who_recently/c4wlzxx?context=5)|Battery life wasn't really an issue because so many people on set had Canon products, we always had a few spares to go around.  The issue that we kept running into was the cameras overheating.  When that happens there's nothing you can do but turn it off and wait in the 106 degree heat for it to cool down.  
[What about sound equipment?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uma1u/iama_very_independent_filmmaker_who_recently/c4wmd3l?context=5)|I'm not sure of the exact brand of sound equipment.  We used both boom and lav mics and had a field mixer.  
[Interesting. I've heard of overheat problems but never had it happen myself. I had the chance to work with the 5D mk III and it's awesome as a movie camera. All the crap you have to work around with the mk II, the 7D and the T2i is totally gone.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uma1u/iama_very_independent_filmmaker_who_recently/c4wml4t?context=5)|Yea, the mk III is a dream.  I wish we had that when we shot.  
[Did you re-dub all the audio in post production, or was there not enough time/resources/money left in the budget?

[How old are you? What made you want to become a filmmaker? What advice can you give to an aspiring script writer/filmmaker like myself?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uma1u/iama_very_independent_filmmaker_who_recently/c4wnawn?context=5)|I'm 27.  I've wanted to be some kind of entertainer since I was a kid.  After realizing I couldn't break dance, I started to mess around with short comedy films around junior high time.  Since then that's pretty much all I've focused on.
 |Only advice I'd give is to write/make your films.  I spent a lot of time doing internships and working shitty jobs on set and didn't get too much out of that.  It's good to network and meet people but you'll never get the opportunity to make your films if you don't have something to show.  Plus, you'll get a lot more respect as someone who's made a film rather than someone who talks about making a film.  
[That was for show, right? You didn't actually smoke oregano...](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uma1u/iama_very_independent_filmmaker_who_recently/c4wnizn?context=5)|No we did.  It was disgusting.  Actors hated us.

[Trailer looks awesome! I think I may have to give this a watch. I've always wondered though, what is that weed substitute they use in films? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uma1u/iama_very_independent_filmmaker_who_recently/c4wm4ko?context=5)|Here's a little vignette with our chosen method of weedery: [Link to youtu.be](http://youtu.be/b5QWPp1tbLA)
[The trailer looks hilarious!  How long have you been into making films and what was the budget for the movie?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uma1u/iama_very_independent_filmmaker_who_recently/c4wlnur?context=5)|Thank you!  I've been making films since junior high, although they're pretty unwatchable now.  I guess I've been serious about filmmaking since college.  Budget was around 100k which goes pretty quickly when you start shooting a feature film.
[There are a lot of trolls on this subreddit. Not saying I don't believe you, but is there any way to prove you made the movie?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uma1u/iama_very_independent_filmmaker_who_recently/c4wm2l7?context=5)|I'm no celebrity so no reason for me to lie, but nonetheless, I linked a picture of me in my illustrious cameo role as DJ Tinklesqueez (which can be seen for a split second in the trailer).
[Anyway, the movie looks hilarious. I've always thought what it would be like if my friends and I all ended up teaching at our old high school. It sounds like making it took much more time than you expected. What was it that made it take so long? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uma1u/iama_very_independent_filmmaker_who_recently/c4wm2l7?context=5)|Thank you! It took so long because of our restricted budget.  The whole ""fast, good or cheap and you can only pick one"" saying was very true. We had to pull in favors at every stage of production so we couldn't rightly give hard deadlines to our friends that were doing us a kindness.  We also did a shitload of test screenings to make sure that our jokes were hitting their marks.
[Would it upset you if people torrent your movie rather than paying for it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uma1u/iama_very_independent_filmmaker_who_recently/c4wpw8c?context=5)|Upset is a strong word.  I would prefer that they purchase it in some form or fashion so that we can make our investor his money back and continue to make films.  BUT, if it were between not watching the film at all and torrenting it, I'd prefer people get to see it somehow.  I torrent things myself, mostly when I'm not able to find something or when the distributor withholds the release of something (GoT).  That being said, let's torrent things like Battleship and throw the indie guys a bone!
[ even torrent the movie as a measure of judging the quality of the movie before going out and purchasing it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uma1u/iama_very_independent_filmmaker_who_recently/c4wpw8c?context=5)|I'm not opposed to that.  There's a lot of shit out there.
[I just smoked is this movie on Netflix, HuluPlus or some shit?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uma1u/iama_very_independent_filmmaker_who_recently/c4wloo8?context=5)|It will be on Netflix very soon.  Netflix doesn't give the best deals to the independents.
[I've always wondered how that worked. Do you get a cut for every view or is it like a renter store where they just pay a larger amount up front?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uma1u/iama_very_independent_filmmaker_who_recently/c4wp3cj?context=5)|No cut per views.  They basically put the film on their site with the ""save"" function on.  Then based on how many people add the film to their queue, you got one flat fee for a certain agreed-upon amount of time.  It sucks.  I'm not sure how disc rentals work on there but Instant sucks for filmmakers without an established name or marketing campaign.
[Cool movie! Or so I think from the trailer! Do you have any ideas for your next movie? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uma1u/iama_very_independent_filmmaker_who_recently/c4wmz95?context=5)|Thanks!  I do.  And it sure as hell won't take place in a high school.
[Why, what's wrong with shooting in a high school?  Any stories to tell?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uma1u/iama_very_independent_filmmaker_who_recently/c4wt7qv?context=5)|Nothing wrong with it.  It was just incredibly difficult to shoot an R-rated  comedy in a state-run high school.  Then when we finally found someone cool enough to let us, there was the problem of filling it with high school aged kid extras whose parents didn't mind them being in a comedy that glamorizes drug use.  
[Hehe sounds cool, what genre?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uma1u/iama_very_independent_filmmaker_who_recently/c4wn1b2?context=5)|Comedy/horror.
[Together? Like an Evil Dead/Army Of Darkness kind of thing?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uma1u/iama_very_independent_filmmaker_who_recently/c4wonat?context=5)|Yea.  I pray it's in the same realm as those.

Otherwise, you may have to take to the high seas...

I appreciate that but we don't have our own distribution outlet at the moment.  Amazon Instant is coming soon, as is DVD and Blu-Ray through Amazon.
[How hard is it to actually make a profit in the independent world? Any ideas for future films in the making?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uma1u/iama_very_independent_filmmaker_who_recently/c4wn9ol?context=5)|Well, this is my first foray into the feature film world but I have a lot of friends who have been in it for a while and it's pretty difficult.  The studios and distributors don't want to make or release anything that doesn't have a big name attached or is already a viable property (comic book, reboot, toy).  But, Video On Demand is changing some of that.  It's getting easier to secure a release with VOD and if the film's budget is kept low then making a profit is less daunting.  We'll see how this one goes.  It's been out on VOD for a couple of months but we haven't heard anything from the distributor about what kind of numbers it's done.  Fingers crossed.  The real goal is to just make the investor back his money so I can continue to make more films.
 |I've got a few ideas in the works.  
[How do you go about finding investors?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uma1u/iama_very_independent_filmmaker_who_recently/c4wsjah?context=5)|We actually found our investor at Burning Man.  That's a good place to start I guess.
[How did you get your start? What advice do you have for film students who are trying to follow their dreams like you are?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uma1u/iama_very_independent_filmmaker_who_recently/c4wsb9b?context=5)|I got my start out of film school as a post-production dude at a video game publisher.  Did a lot of editing and a little bit of shooting.
 |Keep at it.  Get around people who know what they're doing and watch and learn.  If you want to write or direct, do that as much as humanly possible.  That's more important than going to film school.
[What was the hardest part of the shoot? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uma1u/iama_very_independent_filmmaker_who_recently/c4wm19u?context=5)|The hardest part of the shoot was just getting it all in the can.  Because of our restricted budget we had to cram in a lot of things to a short period of time.  We had about 35 locations and close to 100 featured roles and 19 days to shoot it all.  Dumb.
 |Also, there is a rally at the end of the film that was particularly hairy.  We were trying to sell it as a jam-packed, city-wide event but getting extras to come stand out in the 100+ Texas heat for no dough was difficult.  It was an exercise in camera wizardry to fill the frames with our same 50 extras.  Hope that doesn't ruin the illusion if you choose to watch the film!
[I was able to find a torrent for this surprisingly enough, but me once being an aspiring filmmaker i could not make myself do it. 10 dollars to you good sir! But for the AMA part.  How did you get started in film making?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uma1u/iama_very_independent_filmmaker_who_recently/c4wqoxi?context=5)|I've been making films for a good portion of my life but sort of got serious about it when I went to film school.  I made a few films during school and did a lot of internships at local production companies and on sets.  Then I broke off and did my own thing.  Started a production company called Beef &amp; Sage with a very funny man named Will Elliott, where we made a bunch of comedy shorts.  www.beefandsage.com.
[How did you keep yourself motivated in the early stages of trying to become what you are now?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uma1u/iama_very_independent_filmmaker_who_recently/c4wqoxi?context=5)|I just have a crippling fear of failure that my parents instilled in me at an early age and that has kept me motivated.  Also, watching funny or great films is a big inspiration to try to make great work.
[Duuude! This looks awesome!! What was your favorite part to shoot?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uma1u/iama_very_independent_filmmaker_who_recently/c4wwflb?context=5)|We shot at a place called Hippy Hollow.  It's a nude beach here in Austin.  That was really fun.
[I didnt know they had nude beaches in Austin! Sounds cool!

[Does this have the token sexualization of women and treating them as one-dimensional fuck objects?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uma1u/iama_very_independent_filmmaker_who_recently/c4wsyuz?context=5)|Yes, women are sexualized in the film but so are men.  Intrigued?  I think there are a enough strong female characters in the movie to even out the hyper-sexualized ones that were shown off in the trailer.
[Edit: Still looks fucking awesome, don't know why I felt the need to ask a cynical question. Just waiting for the downvotes now.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uma1u/iama_very_independent_filmmaker_who_recently/c4wsyuz?context=5)|""Dinosaur eats man, woman inherits the Earth.""
[Trailer looks great, how was it working with Dog?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uma1u/iama_very_independent_filmmaker_who_recently/c4wni21?context=5)|Dog was a badass.  He had just come from doing something with George Clooney (not sure what but I want to see it).  He told us a story about how he asked Clooney if he had any advice for him.  Clooney told him, ""Just go for it.""  And he definitely did.  He was at full intensity every time he was on camera and we could all tell he was having a blast.  He's a good man.
[If you had a chance to make the movie over again, what would you do differently?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uma1u/iama_very_independent_filmmaker_who_recently/c4wn3k1?context=5)|I would write a more contained story that didn't take place in a high school.  We had way too many locations for our budget and securing a high school for an R-rated stoner comedy in Texas was quite difficult.  That was the only location that was really hard to lock down but oh was it hard.
 |I also wouldn't shoot in June.
[Looks like a good film to watch while baked. Is it available to watch anywhere else other than itunes?

undhw,0,2012-06-05,Do you feel that GPA is a good indicator of a persons skill?,oshidoman,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/undhw/do_you_feel_that_gpa_is_a_good_indicator_of_a/,I am a recent college graduate and I ended with a decent GPA 3.0 as an engineer. I ended up getting screwed over in a few of my classes in college so my GPA was not as high as I had hoped. Even with a year of practical intern experience I feel that it is difficult to find a job just because of my grades. A lot of my fellow classmates had the higher grades but by no means are they smarter in my opinion. Yet just because of those grades they get the jobs. Do you guys feel that a persons grades in college are more important than work experience?
uncpo,8,2012-06-05,Where to go from here?,twonx,actuary,https://www.reddit.com/r/actuary/comments/uncpo/where_to_go_from_here/,"So I am a recent graduate in ActSci with exams P FM and MLC passed. My GPA isn't good (barely above 3.1). Anyways I have tried very hard to look for internships in the past but was unsuccessful. Now that I graduated I have no internship experience and it's difficult to find a company that would accept someone with no background.

So I have thought about changing careers and going back to school for something different. Or maybe settle for something else? Is it reasonable to still search for an internship at this point? Were you guys in a similar difficult situation?"
un8wh,2,2012-06-05,"Help with my girlfriend's rather difficult parents, please?",[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/un8wh/help_with_my_girlfriends_rather_difficult_parents/,"Hey R_A, I have a problem that, after awhile, I decided to ask you strangers what to do; someone has to have a similar incident. **TL;DR AT BOTTOM!** 

I've been dating my girlfriend for close to a year. It's been wonderful and after two horrendous LTRs and some ONSs, I've fallen in love. I'm 21, she's 19 and we met at college. I'm from New York and she's from New Hampshire - about 4 hours apart. Both have full time jobs (I'm a landscaper and she works at a dog shelter) over the rather work-filled summer to consume our time, but thankfully texting and Skyping on the weekends has kept it good. Since school ended in May and won't start up until August, we've decided that for a few days she should come down to me and I can introduce her to NYC, as well as get her name into the zoos here in hopes for an internship - and my parents, close family, and not-so-immediate family absolutely love her.

On campus, she's a welcomed visitor to my house by the guys I live with; her positivist attitude, cooking skills, and attempted to be one of the guys is admired by all.

Her parents however, do not love me, let alone like me. I'm Hispanic - Puerto Rican and Spanish, complete with the caramel complexion and affinity for laborious outdoor jobs at over minimum wage, while she is Caucasian and extremely sheltered. My parents have raised me with a, ""don't tell him the stove's hot, let him touch it"" approach while hers have deemed it necessary to bubble-wrap and hide everything from her. Now while I was understanding with the dislike towards me (Daddy never wants to let his little girl go), the dislike has become more spiteful and mean.

-Her mother REFUSES to acknowledge me. Going for a handshake, a hug, initiating or reciprocating a conversation leads to acting as if no one has said a word. When she came to my school condo to pick-up my girlfriend, she refused to leave the car and called her to leave, as well as denied my request to invite her in. He Christmas gift to me was a broken Navigational system, which I believed was an accident on her part (broke on transport, fell, etc.) until my girlfriend mentioned that it was a dud they had received ages ago and never threw out.

-Her younger brother's hate for me. Entering puberty, he generally can't stand me. It isn't surprising, he is the younger sibling and I wouldn't expect him to care about me too much since our similarities are bar none (He loves soccer, while I prefer going to the gym for example.) However, he wanted admission to an ""Academy"" of sorts for high school. When I mentioned to the family that at my community college, I won numerous awards in English, worked in the English department, and worked at the writing center, they asked for my help in his paper; an entry paper or, ""why should you come here"" essay. After formatting and fixing all I could while abiding to the rules I was taught, and his mother given the final lookover, when he was rejected the blame was placed on me by the parents and him. He constantly berates me for my ""accent"" that I never knew I had - it's all fun and games until I ask him to stop; then his father acts quite angrily towards me. Once again, childish antics.

-Her father believes he's competing with me for her affection and love. I'm not a sports fan, I admit baseball is boring without beer, football is good only for the Superbowl, and soccer is only fun if I'm playing with the guys at work for fun, etc while he is, thus he is extremely competitive. I've been quite understanding that yes, he must feel the pain every father feels when his little girl finally becomes serious with someone but also taken aback at some of his actions. I've said multiple times that I want to have a good relationship with him and that I admire him for being a ""self made man"", and in no way do I want to separate the family. He refuses to have anything to do with me as well; he has had multiple conversations with my girlfriend trying to convince her that I'm trying to emotionally and even psychically abuse her into leaving her family for me. He's told her many times that I want her for superficial reasons and that if our future extends beyond that of dating, I'd permanently separate the family for good. He has also done everything possible to cancel any form of communication between us - Skyping is interrupted by the immediate need to help him, texting me when he's around leads to him mocking my girlfriend and making her cry. He has also refused to pay for anything she needs since she started dating me. When they take us out (only after much begging from my girlfriend) I was required to pay for my meal after he ordered me a pricey dinner.
 
-Her family, two nights ago said that if our relationship continues that she will permanently be disowned - currently, my girlfriend is upset at the temporary disownment placed on her. Calling me crying, I was unsure what to do. I've been abiding by my mother's advice - ""never badmouth the parents, just be a shoulder for her when necessary."" She's never been the kind of child to scream and yell how she hates her parents and whatnot, but lately she feels unloved. Upon confronting them, they treat her like a two year old asking what sex is and feed her crap.

About my parents: they are both bilingual and rather ""modern."" My mother, Puerto Rican and secretary to an extremely well-off architect and my Spanish father, unable to work due to being shot and leaving him somewhat crippled and depressed, has become essentially a ""stay at home dad."" They both suggested that upon the meeting of the two families, any hate or negativity (she believes that, since where my girlfriend lives white is the only color around, her parents assume we embody the negative Spanish stereotype) would melt away and this would be a thing of the past. Her parents did NOT want to see my family nor liked the idea which have convinced my folks that there may be racism involved, something; her great-grandparents did call me a Spic upon meeting them but I credited that to their generation.

I've helped my girlfriend lose 20Lbs and counting, helped with her writing (she's dyslexic). and improved her self image and self-esteem. as well as (at first) got her to understand that her parents love her. I've slowly been introducing her to the ""real world"" and opening up politics (in a way where she can form her own opinion) and the like. I, as well as multitudes of other people - including her own grandparents - have said that we are wonderful together and I'm such a great guy. Yet her parents disagree up and down, and would swear by it. 

So here's the question and the 

**TL;DR** - what do I do with extremely spiteful parents towards me? Do I just let it roll and hope for it to end? My girlfriend is tired with the animosity from her parents, and I'm tired of the attacks at every possibility. I don't want to break up with her, but I'm afraid that this may lead to well, that, or her parents losing their daughter.

I've been looking around for intern jobs over summer, and I've been checking out Github as a way to create a programming portfolio so when I leave Uni I will have lots of coding experience to write on my CV.

However, it all seems way beyond me, I'm sitting here thinking am I ever going to know all this stuff I need to know to get a job in programming?

So I was wondering if you guys could enlighten me on whats expected when you get a first job in programming? How much do I need to know? What kind of programs should I be capable of writing? Etc. The more I know that I need to know; the sooner I can get started on teaching myself it..."

Pearce's pistol seems to be labeled a ""92-FS."" Google reveals that [this is an altered version of the Beretta 92](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beretta_92#92FS). Again, probably not significant.

The price of fuel appears to be $4.34 for a gallon of unleaded 84.

----------------------------------

That's about everything. Hopefully at least one of the random specific details will be important to the ARG. Even if not, at least I found some information such as protagonist background and the fact that this probably isn't too far into the future considering the price of gas doesn't seem very inflated."

Pearce's pistol seems to be labeled a ""92-FS."" Google reveals that [this is an altered version of the Beretta 92](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beretta_92#92FS). Again, probably not significant.

The price of fuel appears to be $4.34 for a gallon of unleaded 84.

----------------------------------

That's about everything. Hopefully at least one of the random specific details will be important to the ARG. Even if not, at least I found some information such as protagonist background and the fact that this probably isn't too far into the future considering the price of gas doesn't seem very inflated."

I tried (and failed) to secure an internship for this summer and after a rough semester (I failed one class and had to drop another) my GPA has dropped to 3.11. I have three main questions. First (I'm not sure if it's bad form to ask this on Reddit, but...) I am in the Baltimore/DC area and I was wondering if anyone knows of anywhere I could work that would actually provide any kind of tangible field experience. Second, if I can't find a job what would be a good productive way to spend my time (right now I'm trying to learn some web development skills like javascript/html, and PHP). Third, with no job experience going into my junior year (I have some volunteer stuff that's it) and my GPA where it is am I kind of screwed?

edit: Feel free to mention anything that you did as an undergraduate that you feel turned out very well for you."
uqces,7,2012-06-07,I don't think I can complete this project (or start it),RandAcct,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/uqces/i_dont_think_i_can_complete_this_project_or_start/,"Recently, I was offered a 3 month Internship for a data visualization company. I am currently a CS undergrad, so it seemed right up my alley at the time. The posting asked for a few months of experience in HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery, and a little bit of Java. Not really any problems there at all. 

The problems came when I was given my assignment. I was told that I have one month to convert a VERY dynamic flash data visualization to Javascript. I don't get any training either. I was given access to the system, and a developer's station, and that's it... So I started boning up on Javascript and some of the data libraries. Still not bad, right?

Well, I find out today (on my first week of the job), that I can't build this visualization from the ground up. They want me to look through every single Actionscript file on the old visualization and begin converting it. Unfortunately, I don't really know AS and the code is a mess. There are 8 different AS files with atleast 1000 lines in each. From what I can read, they all link out to Java commands as well (to pass data, and build stuff). This is where I am starting to get physically sick and scared. I have no idea how to read all of this Actionscript. I feel like it will take a month just to understand these files, and then it will be past the deadline and I won't even have a start.

I know this isn't really a straight forward question, as I didn't include any technical data. But how should I start something like this? Where do I begin? Does this seem like a typical thing for undergraduate Interns? Help?"

I'm just wondering what jobs I can typically go for and while I'm in or as soon as I get out of college. I'm very passionate about programming and I know I want to go into any sort of job relating to the field. But, I also know that it's not definite that I'll land a programming job on my first try. For example, my high school CS teacher said he started out as a debugger out of school. I've looked up careers in the field, but hearing experiences from other people is always better than reading up online. Also, internships aren't really an option right now due to immigration processes. Thanks in advance!

Edit: I'd like to add that I'm (slowly but surely) building up my portfolio with small applications and games I've made. I've been teaching myself several languages that aren't built in my curriculum hoping that it will help open up more job opportunities for me."
upnsk,15,2012-06-07,"Alright r/Egypt, time to vote for the new moderators!",wq678,Egypt,https://www.reddit.com/r/Egypt/comments/upnsk/alright_regypt_time_to_vote_for_the_new_moderators/,"**Please upvote this post so it can stay at the top of /r/Egypt's frontpage and everyone can see it and vote.**


*If any of the candidates would like to give a paragraph or two about themselves and why they should be elected as a mod, they can PM me and I'll put it up in the post.*

**Candidates who are already on the list can only vote for one other candidate aside from themselves. That means you can only vote for yourself and one other person from the list.**

Please take the time to read the rules.

OK, so the idea is to elect two new moderators who will actually care about /r/Egypt's growth as a community.

I'm going to kinda pull a SCAF on your asses and add in an extra proposal for you guys to vote on.

I'm proposing that [**sidewalkchalked**](http://www.reddit.com/user/sidewalkchalked) be voted in as a third moderator so that he can help with the design and look of the subreddit, serving alongside the two other elected moderators who will be responsible for day-to-day management of the subreddit. He does seem to have a life, so he may not be able to be here on a regular basis to manage the subreddit.

So you guys get to vote on that too.

OK, here are the voting rules:

Each person gets to choose two candidates from the Candidates List below, unless you're already on the list in which case you can vote for only one candidate aside from yourself:

**Moderator Candidates List:**

* [**docmosis**](http://www.reddit.com/user/docmosis) **(Bio added.)**

* [**Masribrah**](http://www.reddit.com/user/Masribrah)

* [**daretelayam**](http://www.reddit.com/user/daretelayam) **(Bio added.)**

* [**MohamedO**](http://www.reddit.com/user/MohamedO) **(Bio added.)**

* [**wq678**](http://www.reddit.com/user/wq678) **(Bio added.)**

* [**kingofthehill**](http://www.reddit.com/user/kingofthehill) **(Bio added)**

* [**iredditlastnight**](http://www.reddit.com/user/iredditlastnight)

* [**~~iNKu~~**](http://www.reddit.com/user/iNKu) **(Withdrew)**

* [**psychotiki**](http://www.reddit.com/user/psychotiki)

* [**ChutneyPie**](http://www.reddit.com/user/ChutneyPie) **(Bio added.)**

* [**zidane33**](http://www.reddit.com/user/zidane33)

* [**~~Xivile~~**](http://www.reddit.com/user/Xivile) **(Withdrew)**

* [**sidewalkchalked**](http://www.reddit.com/user/sidewalkchalked)

Each person gets to vote **Yes** or **No** on the [**sidewalkchalked**](http://www.reddit.com/user/sidewalkchalked) proposal.

If you vote **No** on the proposal, you can still vote for him to be one of the two moderators.

If you are already on the Candidate List, then you vote for yourself by default and get to vote for only one other person from the list. 

*(The exception is **sidewalkchalked**. He gets to vote for two other candidates in addition to himself.)*


**Voting will start from now until the end of the 9th of June. Result will be announced on the 10th.**

I'll give my vote here to give you an example of what a vote/comment should look like:

&gt;**Yes.**

&gt;* wq678

&gt;* kingofthehill

I hope this isn't too confusing. If you have any questions just ask here or PM if you wish.

OK, start voting!

**Candidate Bios:**

Below are a few words from some of the candidates letting you know a little bit about them and why you should vote for them:

**MohamedO:**

&gt;I've been studying abroad for the last few years. Prior to that, I was born and mostly raised in Egypt. I'm an avid follower of the news, especially the news at home. I was one of the moderators of a small but fairly active message board for my university at home, so I have a little experience with that. I take a very dim view of censorship, but don't like feeding trolls either. I feel very strongly about politics, and loves me a hearty discussion. If I'm not elected mod, I still pledge to become an active member of r/Egypt. We really owe it to this subreddit I believe.

**daretelayam:**

&gt;I'm Egyptian, I've been a redditor for 4.5 years (pretty much addicted), I've been a mod of r/berserk for a year, and have seen it grow from 15 members to 600+. In short, I'm running on the 'experience' platform :D In the interest of full disclosure though, I have not lived in Egypt for a while, and most likely will not for the foreseeable future. I won't be able to organize meetups etc.
However I'd really really like to help in cultivating the growth of this subreddit and see it grow to be an intellectual meeting place for Egyptians online, even beyond the scope of Reddit.

**docmosis:**

&gt;I am an Egyptian born citizen who spent a number of years studying abroad but moved back to Egyptian shortly after the revolution take part in the political movement as well as complete my degree in political science. I love my country and I feel that as an Egyptian redditor it is my duty to make sure that this subreddit grows to it's full potential. The world as a whole has a very limited view on the reality of what is happening on the streets of Cairo and I want to make /r/Egypt an integral part in changing that. As a moderator I will work to my full potential to offer a domain where free and fair speech is available to those both inside as well as outside Egypt. Egypt is once again on the verge of immense change and I believe that this subreddit needs to follow suit to become a beacon of reliable information on what is happening in my homeland.

**ChutneyPie:**

&gt;Been living in Egypt for two years now, working in advertising. Fairly new to reddit compared to others, enjoy reading from the reddit community on the whole and also with regards to r/Egypt. If elected, would ensure a no tolerance policy towards spammers/anti arab posters as well as keeping a fresh environment that encourages new posts and comments.
Thanks,

**kingofthehill**

&gt;I am an Egyptian graduate student, currently based between Egypt and Europe. My research focuses on social media and public discourse in Egypt, and have a diverse spectrum of interests, from technology to endurance sports. I have lived in 'The City Victorious' all of my life aside from short stints in the US/Europe for one thing or another (studies, internships, etc). Reddit is a fantastic online community, and /r/Egypt deserves to as vibrant a subreddit as the country's rich history and culture. I plan on contributing to that as a member or a mod of r/Egypt.

**wq678** (I'm so sorry I took so long.)

&gt;I am an Egyptian college student who has lived most of his life in the Gulf, but who has lived the past 5 years here in Egypt. I had been living in the amazing city of Alexandria for the first four of those years, before moving last year to Cairo for my education. The first time I ever participated in a protest was when ElBaradie came to Alexandria to lead a large protest against police brutality shortly after Khaled Said's murder by Mubarak's Secret Police. I also participated in the Police Day protests on the January 25th of 2011 (the protests later turned into the Uprising that toppled Mubarak) in Alexandria. After the collapse of the Police, I decided to stay to close to home to help keep an eye out in my neighborhood and make sure my family is safe. We fought with thugs twice, and two of our neighbors were accidentally shot (one killed) by an untrained pistol-wielding idiot from our building. I voted No in the Constitutional referendum, voted for the Egyptian Bloc in the parliamentary elections and voted for Hamdeen Sabahi in the first round of the Presidential Elections. I won't be voting in the run-offs, because fuck both candidates. 

&gt;I promise to help grow this community by constantly seeking the opinion and consensus of the community and by being responsive to the community's requests. 

&gt;My aspiration is that /r/Egypt can eventually grow into being a highly-influential Egyptian internet community that will be a hub for Egyptians and residents of Egypt to organize non-partisan civic and political action for the greater benefit of Egypt.

&gt;I vow to respect everyone's right to air their opinions, no matter how hateful and morally repugnant they may be."

 I've had just a few classes about human–computer interaction so I am really a beginner at all of this.

So with what graphic library should I start with? I've already heard about SDL, MFC and Qt; is there any others and which one is the most suitable for my project?
And where can I find a good tutorial about this library?

Now, if I was planning to stay in the Chicago area, I know that I would be pretty much set because that is where I'm going to be. All my internships and what not would be here.

However, my boyfriend, career wise, does not have very many options location wise. He's planning to go into the reserve units with the air force and right now, the ones that are the most feasible to him are the ones in California, and possibly Portland or Seattle. If he transferred, it'd be to the East Coast. New Jersey or Delaware or something. 

There's a possibility that he'd be in Milwaukee but that's a long shot.

So here's my question. If I graduate from a 2 tier school, close to the top of my class, what are my chances of getting hired out of state? Should I intern where he would end up to increase my contacts? What should I do?

Any and all advice is appreciated :)"

My story or whatever. Just thought a wrap-up is necessary. This is my new account for this subreddit. I will use an absolute scale for girls with 6.5 being my fuckable threshold and 10 being unobtainable. I can't put timestamps on these.

I made lots of good friends this year. It can be attributed to improving my confidence through improving my body and mind. Reading some Tolle, listening to RSD vids, going out and talking to men and women, kissing lots of girls, getting freaky, and doing well academically.


Did study abroad and kept my girlfriend back home. Did the long distance thing. I didn't cheat or anything even though I had plenty of opportunities. We broke up during my finals week and that sucked a huge one. I was really into her and it was pretty emotional for me. She wanted to ""be 21 in her city for her summer internship."" Yeah she wanted to do whatever and be guilt-free. 

My buddy had mentioned ""The Game"" to me about it was about getting good with women so I ended up reading it. It was entertaining enough but I wanted more. I searched Mystery and all those guys. They seemed kinda weird but were apparently pimps just not my style. Nothing really for a while but then youtube showed me a Tyler RSD vid that was suggested for me. This was October, the beginning. Watched quite a few RSD videos. Tyler is one crazy mofo (hilarious) but his talks made sense. I was hitting the gym and my inner game was pretty good. 

Halloween I meet a girl though a friend and I get laid (HB 6.75, busty redhead,my bed, awesome sex, we are still friends)

However, I wasn't 21 yet like all of my friends so there wasn't much I could do.

**I turn 21**

Birthday weekend I bring another girl home but then the semester ends. (HB 6.5, makeout, crashed at my place, I was drunk)

**Spring semester senior year**

Party at our house I flirt hard with a girl who is a sorority sister of
housemate's GF. (HB 7.5, fantastic body, makeout first night, become friends with benefits, 3rd base almost every other night, still friends)

Out at a bar soon thereafter, meet up with a friend, cute HB 8 in group, we talk and I make it to her sorority house and I get her number and we end up hanging out a few times. I never even get a kiss. I still regret not being forward enough.

I find out about Natural Game and I watch the Tim Method stuff.

**Level up time**

Go to a bar/club. Meet up with a girl friend who brought her friend. We end up hitting it off. Dancing hardcore. Grazing faces. As we are bouncing to another bar I pull her and against a wall. Makeout. Two hours later back to her place. (HB 8 redhead, freak, F-close, good times)

Hooked up with friends little sister. (HB 6, not that attractive, I swear she roofied me, 3rd base) 

So I'm still seeing the redhead at this point. An open relationship of sorts.

**Spring Break time (holy shit)**

Basically it's my university down in this spring break town. Level up time. 

7 or 8 total makeouts and one F-close in one week. 

One night in particular.

* Madeout with a HB 8.5 but she felt bad because I literally took her from a friend of mine who asked her to a formal (I didn't know), 
* 30 minutes later a HB 7.5 (tad chubby)
* 20 minutes later I told my friends I was in the zone. Went up to a HB8 we sorta know, told them I could makeout in less than 5 minutes for $5. I won.

F-close was the the next night. I had approached her (HB 8) and her friends (One 8 the other a 8.5) two nights before and got her number. I texted them, met up by myself with three girls. Left with all three. I thought I was gonna have a 4some. Two of the girls leave and my girl says she's wanted me since I got her number cus I was smooth as fuck and sexy apparently. 

**Back home**

I end up getting a new hookup buddy from a different sorority. HB 8.5. She's really well known by everyone on campus but she's a bit weird.


Then one of my close friends in my friend group reveals that she has had a thing for me. I've always liked her. Really awesome girl. HB 9, former cheerleader but a bad semester made her a bit chubby not bad tho. We end up dating for a while. First night we were seeing each other I was still in game mode. I accidentally picked up a girl and next thing I know I'm making out with this HB 7.5 or so and my hand is on her ass and she is wanting to bounce. I tell her no.

Continue dating HB 9 for next month till school ends. She is sad cus we are really good together, she finds out about my PUA side and is disappointed and disgusted but I respect her decision as she is truly a fantastic person.

And here I am now waiting to move down to ATL to start my new job.

I know I missed some hookups. There are more than I ever could have imagined. The best nights I had were the ones where I went out with friends and just had fun with them. This attracted others into our frame and they were aroused and by simply adding sexual energy we were all able to have a good time. 

That that girl I was dating when I was abroad? Yeah she now wants me back. Will I let her back in? No way! There are lots of amazing girls out there and once you realize that you are just as amazing you will be the prize and choose what you want. Don't settle.

one?",[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/us99y/how_do_you_cope_with_the_unexpected_loss_of_a/,"Even though it's just started, this has been a really shitty summer. At the end of May, my wife and I had to put our 20-year-old cat to sleep. Then, six days later, our 25-year-old niece died in a car accident this week.

**tl;dr**: Please just go read some other post. Right now, I'm looking for understanding and support, not half-informed, off-the-cuff comments that are only tenuously related to what I'm talking about. I'm not trying to be a douche, but I'm just not in a good place at the moment, so I'm kind of grumpy.

She was the daughter of my wife's sister, but I've known her for 11 years, now. She wasn't much younger than us (my wife is the youngest of 9 children--this niece was the same age as my younger sister), and a few years ago, she lived with us for a year while attending a local community college. She and I hung out together and became close friends. She moved away to go to a different school, but she spent a week with us in March when she had a short internship here in town.

I'm fairly introspective and self-aware, and I'd like to believe that I'm quite articulate. I'm not the stoic, emotionless kind of guy, and I'm not the type that suppresses my feelings or refuses to talk to others about them, or that can't properly express myself when talking about how I feel. On the other hand, I'm not particularly sensitive or emotional, either. I'm normally pretty laid-back and happy-go-lucky, and although I have a wry, sarcastic sense of humor, I prefer to look for positives or find the humor in a situation, or simply let it pass, rather than dwell on the negative. But this situation is affecting me in ways that I don't understand. It's not that I'm particularly hard-hit by it, although I'm obviously upset; it's that I'm not as distraught as I feel I should be. 

On an intellectual level, this loss occupies most of my thoughts, and I haven't gotten much work done, but if I want to, I'm able to focus on other things without obsessing over this. I'm not at the top of my game (and I'm sure that part of this is due to my current physical condition), but I don't think that I'm noticeably distracted or absent-minded, or anything like that. I've noticed that I've been occupying my time with low-priority, mid-range intelligence/focus tasks, such as beefing up the security of my home network, cleaning the house and rearranging all of the rooms, etc. To some degree, that's because I'm a little burned-out; I had paper deadlines in April and May, and then I immediately had to prepare for a professional certification exam that I sat for last week. So right now, I'm not particularly enthusiastic about jumping right back into the mentally-taxing tasks (i.e., more research, writing more papers, doing edits on others and trying to get them published, etc.) that are higher on my to-do lists. But I'm also aware that I'm not able to do my best work right now, so I haven't really been trying to tackle anything too complex.

Physically, I'm fairly messed up. My back and shoulders ache like I just climbed a mountain, and I've got a constant low-grade headache--both of these show up when I'm under a lot of stress, but usually these symptoms subside a bit once I recognize them for what they are and make a conscious effort to control my stress levels. That hasn't been the case (maybe because I have no idea how to limit this kind of stress), and I have other physical symptoms that are less normal for me. I can't sleep, although not because I'm up late dwelling on things--I just can't fall asleep. Insomnia isn't uncommon for me; I usually spend at least one or two nights each week tossing and turning, and even on good nights it normally takes me about 90 - 150 minutes to fall asleep on any given night. Now I'm lucky to fall asleep at all, and when I do, I wake after an hour or two. I'm also extremely tired in the morning. I expect that's primarily because I haven't been getting nearly enough sleep, but normally, I'm a morning person, and even if I haven't had enough sleep, I'm awake once the sun comes up. Unless I'm extremely sleep-deprived, I wake naturally 15-30 minutes before my alarm goes off, and I don't feel unduly tired throughout the day; I'm starting to cross that deprivation threshold, but I've felt abnormally tired and lethargic for the past week and half (basically since we made the decision to have our cat put down). My appetite has been disrupted, to: I'm able to eat if I remember that I should, but I haven't felt hungry at all, and I've been completely uninterested in food even when I do think of it. Alternatively, I'm occasionally--but rarely--ravenously hungry. Normally, I'm somewhat of a foodie. Also, I have a sore throat, and in general, I feel like I'm coming down with something (and I probably am--not eating or sleeping isn't good for you).

Emotionally, I'm not experiencing nearly as sadness as I had expected. I've had a few moments of intense sadness, and I've cried a few times, but most of the time it's just a generalized disappointment, like something that I was really hoping for didn't work out, and I haven't decided on an alternative yet. I'm familiar with the stages of grief, and I know that they're not as linear as they seem on paper, and I'm definitely experiencing some of them, but some of what I'm feeling doesn't fit into any of the categories, and some of what did fit didn't seem particularly significant (but I didn't notice a stage for ""not complying with the stages of grief"").

I know that part of why I feel the way I do is because it hasn't fully sunk in yet. After she moved out, we only saw her a few times each year, so I didn't have the shock of going from seeing her every day to not seeing her at all. Also, I've seen photos of her car after the accident, but I haven't seen her (and won't--she's already been cremated). I'm definitely the type of person who finds some measure of closure in seeing the body. When we had our cat put to sleep, I wanted to be there in the room, partially to comfort the cat and to be sure that it was as peaceful as possible, and partially for my own peace of mind, so that my last memories of her weren't of a stranger just taking my cat into another room. But I can't have that with my niece, and I'm actually feeling a little indignant about it, even though I rationally know that (a) it wasn't possible; and (b) as an uncle that married into the family, my wants in this situation are subordinate to quite a few others. In some small way, I'm also displacing some of what I feel about the loss and putting it into that--I feel cheated because I won't be able to see her one last time, but I haven't yet reached the point where I'm confronting her death directly.

Another part of my problem is that my wife's family is much more stoic than what I grew up with. As I said earlier, I'm not particularly sensitive or emotional, but my family (both nuclear and extended) was usually somewhat open about their emotions when it came to grieving, and we're the type of people that copes by talking about things. My wife's family, on the other hand, is much more guarded. Neither men nor women display much emotion. I don't think it's that they think men aren't supposed to show emotion, or anything like that; it's more that they aren't comfortable with emotions--for the most part, they're not even really comfortable hugging, which makes the first 10 minutes of every holiday with my side of the family particularly awkward for my wife. But because they're they kind of people that prefer to deal with their emotions privately, my normal support-giving/getting strategy doesn't work in this situation. (However, this doesn't make me upset, or anything, other than just feeling awkward, because the things I would normally do in similar situations don't seem appropriate in this one.)

Something else that really makes this hard for me is the fact that it happened so soon after we had to put our cat to sleep. First, the kind of comforting thoughts that I've cultivated over the months, knowing for a long time that our cat would never recover don't work when applied to our niece. I feel better about the cat when I'm able to say to my wife (or to myself), ""It's okay--she was 20 years old. She had a long, full, happy life."" And our niece wasn't much older than the cat, but thinking about the fact that she was 25 isn't exactly comforting. Second, I feel bad that I've hardly about the cat, because I did like her, but because this happened so soon afterward, I'm preoccupied with thoughts of our niece. And if I *do* think about the cat, I feel bad that I'm thinking about a cat when what happened to our niece was much more tragic. And third, I still haven't recovered from the stress or sadness of losing the cat--all of those emotions have just been pushed to the side, so I alternate between feeling like those emotions are going to evaporate before I have the chance to experience them, or they'll come rushing back to me much later. In the first case, I'll feel guilty about the fact that what I felt over the loss of our cat wasn't proportionate to how much the cat meant to me. In the second case, I'll either feel like it's unreasonable to be so upset about the cat so much later--and therefore won't let myself deal with those feelings properly--or I'll be upset because I'll most likely have forgotten little things, even though I cared about the cat.

But thing that I find most difficult about everything is the fact that it happened so suddenly and unexpectedly, and that the impact is so immediate and permanent. Apart from the shock, I'm still struggling to reconcile the intellectual facts that I know to be true with the emotions that I can't predict or control. It might be ridiculous or cliché, but I have to admit that I still feel like young people are relatively invincible--nothing seriously bad happens to us. People grow old and die, but that's to be expected. Cats grow old and die, and that's to be expected. But not only did I not have any time to mentally prepare myself for this loss, but a big part of me was successfully ignoring the fact that people under 30 are just as mortal as those over 70. This experience hasn't caused me to confront my own mortality, or anything like that, but it has been jarring to have my expectations realigned like this. And like I said, I didn't have time to prepare for this. I wasn't ready for it, and I hadn't been able to process the reality of the loss ahead of time, so it's hitting me all at once. But instead of being able to sit down and confront it, I feel like I'm so overwhelmed that I'm still just kind of in shock about it. In the meantime, I'm just sort of going through the motions of what I think I'm supposed to do, and trying to feel what I think I'm supposed to feel about this.

I guess the one positive thing I can say about losing our niece is that the realization that I'll never see her again or make any new memories with her has really pointed out how many happy memories of her I do have. Sure, I also have the memories of the ways that she annoyed me and the stupid things she did that everyone always comes to cherish after losing a loved one, but I can confidently say that I have many memories of hanging out with her that are geuniunely happy and pleasant, and that in the short time that she was in my life, she brought me a disproportiately large amount of joy.

I know this was a long post--I tend to wax prolific when I discuss serious matters. Thanks for reading everything. Although I _am_ asking for your thoughts and advice regarding coping strategies, I also wrote this post with the intent that it would serve a cathartic function, helping me to work through my feelings with my rational mind, rather than having a jumble of emotions playing musical chairs in my head. I guess to some degree, it has, but I think now I need some time to process everything, before I can make sense of it all.

To wrap things up, I'll leave you with a quote from my niece's About Me section of her Facebook profile. I know it seems a little trite--and stereotypical for a 25-year-old girl--but it seems entirely appropriate, if a bit painful:
""Some important lessons about life: What you see is not always what you get. Love always wins. Be true to yourself. Don't take a single moment for granted."""
urxi9,0,2012-06-08,How in the world do I fix my current social an economic situation?,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/urxi9/how_in_the_world_do_i_fix_my_current_social_an/,"Dear Reddit, 

I’m trying to figure out where I went wrong and concrete solutions to my perceived problems. 

********************************
Start TL/DR;
********************************

My current situation is as follows:

•	20 going on 21 years old

•	Zero living friends (will elaborate later in this post)

•	Dead end job that barely makes ends meet.

•	Occasionally do questionable at best for extra cash when the ends don’t meet up.
 
•	Stuck in a small town with a shattered economy where an open air drug market exists. 

•	Stuck in college with little to no financial aid that is rapidly evaporating. 

********************************
End TL/DR;
********************************


To be frank, I’m fucking distressed. To put things into perspective, I’ve been homeless as a minor and lost my mother when I was 7 and still never felt this bad before.  My view on the list above is as follows: 


Problem A) Zero living friends. 


Most of my friends were in Seattle, WA. The short version is that most of them overdosed on drugs of their choice or combinations of them. It still doesn’t change how I felt about them or still feel about them. They were all I had in the world that I knew I could depend on. These aren’t the friends that are only there on Facebook and whatnot, these were people that stuck their necks out for me. Since I started college I haven’t been able to make a single friend or contact. My existence is one of barely making enough money to continue, school  and having just enough sleep to avoid getting into a horrible car crash. 


Solution A) Find Friends.


Much easier said than done. I learned quite a few things about the character of people from living in austere conditions, but it turns out that most people are just as shallow as I remembered. The ones who aren’t still give me the same funny looks, so I eventually adopted an “I don’t give a fuck” policy and simply spoke what came to my mind. A prime example of this would be what we call “The Porch Kids”. There was a smoker’s porch at my old university and it had some interesting characters on it. I was homeless at the time (2nd time around, longer story involving a backstab and failed attempt to get me and my significant other to Florida). All of them cracked homeless jokes. Some even started rumors about me being homeless. I was asked if I was homeless. When I told them the truth, none offered to help. They bugged out, actually. Once I was on my feet again, I found that most of them have called for various favors, but out of 8 or so, only one has treated me decently, and I actually view him as a role model even though I haven’t heard from him in a month. Most people also don’t believe I’m 20 and that presents a barrier when trying to make friends and network. Either way, I used to approach situations neutrally, got treated like shit, decided to not follow social protocol, still get treated like shit so I opt for not following protocol because it is easier. 


Problem B) Dead End Job that barely makes ends meet.


I started at FedEx Ground where I used to live and moved up from a package handler to QA then to a management. The city I used to live in was so expensive even as a full time manager, I still got by on the skin of my teeth expense wise.  I had to bump down to a package handler again for the transfer to the city I’m in now. The positive is that I can barely get by on 15 hours of work a week due to the extremely low cost of living. The downside is that my work environment is terrible. It’s a lot worse than when I was a new hire in my old city. To get an idea, you have 6 guys including myself at this facility. I bust ass and am responsible for not just one door, but all 4 doors while we have one guy splitting (not as difficult as loading trailers but still hard) 3 guys unloaded vans and trailers (cake compared to loading one) and we have another guy that literally sits and does nothing. The QA does nothing either. The Manager is the same as QA. I find myself doing the shittiest and most difficult jobs in the shortest amount of time then doing the QA’s and manager’s job. To rub it in, when I’m pulling for the QA’s and manager’s slack; I then get told I need to increase my load rate. When I point out that one guy can only do so much (my average load a night is 3600-4000 packages, all industrial shippers greater than 75lbs a box) they tell me to only do my job. When I only do my job, then I get told to do QA and the Manager’s job. Tonight I went into their office to get a battery for a STAR III scanner and both of them were watching YouTube videos. I really hate my current work environment. It’s not the job, but the environment. 


Solution B) Find a Better Job. 


This is proving to be very difficult. I can’t find anyone that is actively hiring right now other than guys who are in the good old boys network. I’m still hitting the beat and will do my best to get out of there before December. 


Problem C) occasionally does questionable at best for extra cash when the ends don’t meet up.


I’m not going to go into what I do specifically other than I’m nothing more than a logistics guy. I don’t steal or sell anything. I have to do this sometimes to make sure I can pay tuition and other expenses if they get too far out of hand. I’m pretty sure I’ve lost part of myself or the ability to feel as much as I used to. I grew even more acute eyes in the back of my head and find myself checking the rear view mirror constantly, or if there’s a knock on my door, covering the peep while I stand off to the side. I also became even better in the woods and better at driving on a variety of surfaces ranging from tarmac to gravel. 


Solution C) Join the Army Reserve or Something.

 
I figure if I’m already damned good at evading trained personnel, have a little over half of a chemical engineering education, a wide variety of job experience ranging from customer service to welding, can move through the woods like a ghost, and get to elevated positions like roof tops that are inaccessible, I might as well make myself legitimate and serve my country. It would also get rid of my college money problems. I just can’t find a recruiter that doesn’t seem hell bent on fucking me over in any branch. 


Problem D) Stuck in a small town with a shattered economy where an open air drug market exists. 


It’s just a depressing environment. I go on a 2 mile run every night after work and it is painful to look at my surroundings. I try to zone out and not think, but I loop back to what problems I’m trying to solve, and many times I leave home with fewer problems than what I come back with. It’s a fucking self-destructive cycle. 


Solution D) Finish My Engineering Degree and get the fuck out. 


This is the only solution that doesn’t present more problems. It’s actually the only constant I have right now. 


Problem E) Stuck in college with little to no financial aid that is rapidly evaporating
Since day one, I have been fucked by financial aid. I have presented proof that I was homeless and independent as a minor in addition to paper work going farther back that I was in and out of state custody for a 6 year stint. It simply was an aide counselor not wanting to work with me and both institutions. I even wrote my senator about the issue and I got what appeared to be a generic response instructing me to fill out the FASFA. To rub it in, grad school and internships are a dead dream with my 2.2 GPA. People don’t understand that 8-10 hours a day working and full time school makes a C+ seem like an A+. With the fewer hours at work, I can focus more on school.


Solution E) 


See Problem C. It’s nothing near ideal and it creates the same fucking self-destructive loop. 
See Solution C. I just need to find a recruiter that’s willing to not fuck me over. Last one tried to tell me 88 mike was the same thing as forward observer. Airforce recruiter is so full of it his eyes are brown. 

The disturbing part is that I find myself wanting to die.  I’d rather have nothing than any of this. I mean what the hell am I loosing that is positive? I can’t even enjoy sex anymore the rare time I find a fuckbuddy. The feelings of distress and despair get worse when I start looking around myself. The average  20 year old college student appears to be happy. They have friends. They have a family. If they have to work they typically have high paying internships or a good part-time job that has little bullshit in it. They have great grades, and often don’t have to worry about making ends meet. It seems so alien to me. Almost like I’m an interloper and do not belong in what surrounds me. 


I’m looking for viable solutions that can help me achieve my goals- Not pitty. I’m going to be a Chemical Engineer one day. Please help me to do this. Anything. I’m tired of this and want it to be over

""You have a nice frame on you, big shoulders son.""

I couldn't believe what I'd just heard. Trying to regain my professional bearing before tears began to flow, I pretended to have misheard him and asked, ""What was that?"" I hoped he would realize the offensiveness of his comment and change the subject, but he plowed right ahead. 

""You look like you're in great shape. Do you exercise?""

For 5 minutes I tried to endure the torturous conversation about lifting and fitness, and finally I could take no more. I excused myself to the restroom and cried in the stall until lunch time.

I don't know how I can return. Just because my polo shirt fits tight over my arms and chest and displays my swole back, I have become a target of discrimination. Im terrified that another wheelchair bound senior will crush my soul again, and I don't know what to do."
urou5,86,2012-06-08,Just something I'd like to share. New interns at work.,[deleted],TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/urou5/just_something_id_like_to_share_new_interns_at/,"Okay so I work for a government agency and we just got a fresh batch of summer interns in my department (IT), all male. There is a pretty diverse work force here otherwise and I'm proud to say there are a lot of women in management positions. I've been here a year and I have never heard that fact mentioned, let alone in a negative light. That gets me to today. 

A coworker was helping me format some reports and happened to mention something he heard the interns talking about, at full volume, in the hallway. They were discussing how weird they thought it was that so many women were managers, they were actually complaining. They were talking about how they're glad that their female manager isn't the emotional type, and how hard it must be to get work done with all the other female managers. I was so taken aback. This from 20 year old college students? I'm glad I wasn't there. God forbid if I had gotten ""emotional"". 

It stinks because they will be here the whole summer and I can almost always hear them carrying on and being loud. They seem to talk about women a lot, I've caught snippets like ""Ew! what if you had to wake up to her every morning!"" or "" yea I'd do her, she's a little old though"". Charming. I assume they are the types that hardly have contact with women, every time I've gone into their room (they keep the 64 bit test machines in there) they go awkwardly silent. 

So, these guys have more than two months left here. Lets hope they don't say something stupid in my presence. I don't know if I'll be able to hold back."

If I get a Sysadmin position it would most likely be a very junior position since I have no experience with things like AD other than a small project I did for school(set it up and add users). I'm not really seeing jobs out there that they would be willing to take me on and train me a bit.

What I'm trying to figure out is where to start. It seems as though all the Analyst postings are looking for several years of experience. 

I never really looked for an internship during school because I was able to work and pay most of my tuition, resulting in almost no student loans. It seems most employers who are offering internships aren't looking for individuals who have already graduated. 
I'm currently studying for my CTP and trying to teach myself the gist of SQL.

I didn't even realize there were unpaid internships, but it's the only place that has gotten back to me (didn't realize it was unpaid when I applied).

Is this a bad idea? It's kind of either I do the internship this summer, or take classes. I'd much rather do an internship but I'm just slightly put off because I'd never heard of unpaid tech internships before.

Not even sure where to start...

We've been together a year and one month. He's 23 and I'm 21. He's from Europe and moved here to be with me. We just moved into our first place together..

Because he moved here from Europe he has lots of friends from all over. On of them though, has always not sat right with me. She's about my age and before he met me they talked all the time. He says they have always had a teasing/playful/joking relationship but had never had a sexual attraction or any kind of physical interaction except a hello/goodbye hug.

My first time being freaked out by this was a month into dating. I saw a facebook chat from here where they were joking and he randomly mentioned that his dick looked bigger when shaved. Didn't sit right with me. I got upset, cried, yelled. That's not an appropriate thing to say to another girl when you have a girlfriend.

In fact, when we first started dating we had the ""What constitutes cheating"" talk. We both agreed right off the bat that sexting/flirtatious messages was cheating.

Anyway this occurrence led me to ask him to please tell me when they were talking, not ask me if he could talk to her, just inform me.
Fast forward 9 months are so. We are living together in a temporary place. As far as I know he's always informed me of when they spoke. One day, at around 6:30pm he tells me again that they had been chatting for a few hours. Something led to me asking when they had started, he said idk, i said check the time stamp, and it said 10:30am. I dont understand why he would lie about something that trivial. Maybe it meant nothing. I'm just telling the whole story.

A while after we had a fight about me being controlling. I told him he no longer had to inform me of talking to her. He was on his own with that.

Fast forward again to last night. I went into his home office to get his tablet to play a game on. It was open on a fb chat from her. I didn't read it all, just saw something he said that looked flirty. I asked him about it, he said he was joking, and i dropped it. But it kept bugging me, so after he went to sleep I went and read the whole thing.

It started out normal, then got suggestive. She needs an internship and told him she was ""his"" if he could get it for her. He asked her things like what we he get out of it, she replied whatever, and he said sexual favors. It went on like that. There were plenty of this winky faces and ""haha's"" suggesting that the conversation had a joking tone. It reached its peak when she asked him what the favors would consisted of and he said: ""Generally you, me, a bed, or possibly some other random piece of furniture, maybe a third party if you are willing to agree to that.""

There was never anything more intense than that. Neither mentioned bodyparts or even referenced them, nobody said anything about getting hard or being wet, there was no descriptive text about licking, sucking, positions... nothing like that.

So I lost it on him. We talked for hours. He told me that he's been under a lot of stress worrying about money (I haven't been able to get a job since I graduated six months ago, so he is the only provider). He says that he has no friends here. He works at home and I'm always home, so we are literally together 24/7. I know that this can put tension on the relationship, everybody needs some alone time. He had never mentioned this to me before though. He said he always felt like that if he had wanted to go out along, drive around, go to a bar, play games alone, or whatever, that I would cry and react badly. He's right.

In the past I have overreacted about him leaving. I've found it hard to trust him because of the incidents prior to this one, and I know he could very easily cheat on me without getting caught. I'm worried that when I have a job he will be here alone all day, making it extremely easy to cheat. Anyway, the point is that I havn't been understanding about him needing his space.

He says he's felt pressured because of that. He says he doesn't know why he started talking to this girl this way. He was working while he was chatting, and says he wasn't even really paying attention. Whenever I ask why he did it his best answer is that he doesn't really know and that he thinks it may have been a subconscious lash out because of him feeling trapped in the relationship. I understand this, because I had a similar situation in my previous relationship.

Sorry this was so long.. I guess what I'm asking is what next? We have talked for hours and both want to work things out. I've told him that I forgive him, but i have not forgotten. I don't know if I can forget. The words just keep rolling around in my head. Probably worth mentioning, I told him it's me or her. He said me and I explained that that means he can't talk to her again, break off the friendship, no talking ever, no updates on life ten years from now. I said I want to see this message to her before he sends it and I want to be told if she ever tries to get in touch with him in the future. I feel bad about asking this of him, but at the same time I think I am within my rights to do so. He says he understand and would probably do the same if it was a reverse situation.

So what should I do now reddit? I'm having trouble letting go of this. I can't forget it. My trust for him is gone, and yet somehow I have to trust him to go out without me so that he won't feel trapped. Should I break up with him? Forget about it? Am I overreacting? Please Help...

**bold**TL;DR Caught boyfriend flirting by chat, forgave him but don't understand why he did it. Want to know what I should do now.

Edit: He just took the keys and went ""out"". Says he doesn't know where he is going or when he'll be back. This blows..."

I'm a computer science major, and just got my first internship at a small startup about a month ago.

The company consists of just 3 principles trying to launch their business.  Since being hired I've designed and configured their MailChimp, and am now building their site off previously established mockups, as their developer is no longer able to work on the project.

The principles are pretty computer illiterate and I am pretty much building the entire infrastructure of their web presence.  I recognize that they are at the very beginning stages of their business, and was told this in the interview, but...

I had hoped to be engaged in a learning environment, and I feel as though I am sort of being taken advantage of, and teaching instead of learning.

Is this standard for most internships? Should I look for something else or be grateful I am intimately involved in their business?

What doesn't make it easier is that it is a very exciting concept to work on, and the principles are extremely nice, cool people...

Any advice is greatly appreciated

**Edit:** Wanted to throw an edit in here to first thank the shit out of you guys for the advice and support it's been great.

Also wanted to defend my currently employers(?) to a certain extent.  They are nice, friendly, and smart people with impressive backgrounds.  But as noticed by the community, they are pretty disconnected from the actual process of implementation - even though they have mapped it.  

In thinking this over, I think it will be beneficial to both parties if I decline the web project in a manner where I explain the magnitude of the process in hopes that it gives them a better understanding of how necessary the employment of a professional developer is.

Really appreciate the advice, and opportunities that have resulted from this thread - you guys are great."

Thanks!

I loved to think spatially and always had a curiosity of how the world around me worked. Even while very young, my teachers would mention to my parents that I would rather study the bottom of a toy car than play with it. After being exposed to physics in high school, I developed my curiosities for why a horizontal wire would hang in a hyperbolic shape or how forces transmit through structures. I have also always had a strong desire to create and can recall many hours spent making 3 dimensional computer environments, building my first computer, and Friday nights at the bookstore fulfilling my curiosities of such things. Following a desire to learn more about spatial structures and systems, I decided to pursue my undergraduate degree in civil engineering and planned on obtaining a graduate degree in architecture afterwards. However, after exposure to flexure theory, Müller-Breslau principle, and the likes, I had become infatuated with the analysis of structures. I found the understanding of their complex interactions to be the most beautiful and fulfilling of any kind. Wanting a deeper understanding of their engineering applications, I have decided to pursue a master’s of Science in structural engineering at “said” university.

While studying at the “ugrad school” I became involved in structural health monitoring research as an undergraduate research assistant for “mentor”. Having an interest in the dynamics of structures, the opportunity for exposure to sensors and data analysis, and coming from a summer internship in the space guidance and navigation department of “electronics company” aerospace, led me to become heavily involved. As the only funded undergraduate on the research team, I worked closely with graduate students. At first my tasks were simple and involved writing reports on market searches for wireless sensors, embedded computers, work on cad drawings, and publication formatting. Then I became responsible for larger tasks and projects and had an opportunity to solve open-ended research-related problems. I worked closely with two graduate students on the possible implementations of using infrared and high definition video cameras for more objective bridge inspection methodologies. With the aid of the two graduate students, my responsibilities included the design of a candidate bridge prioritization algorithm, the organization of the research report, and the operations planning for a bridge site visit. I made a presentation to the “state” Department of Transportation on how such nondestructive evaluation technologies could be implemented into the current inspection methodologies. I discovered that I have an ability to organize and implement an idea. Realizing a need for more structural oriented industry knowledge and exposure, when the “state” Structural Engineers Association was looking to start a student chapter; I contacted them and sought out the feasibility of starting such a student chapter at my University. When I noticed that I could improve my grades through organization and technique, I meticulously developed smart study habits and corrected inefficiencies in how I held a pencil or my typing technique. The benefits of this came to fruition when I made a 4.0 during a semester of my senior year with 4 upper level engineering courses. 

I see the possibilities of integrating computer technology to stream line the design process and hope to have an opportunity to influence its advancement. My intentions are to continue developing my skills and deepen my understanding of structural engineering with a Master’s of science degree from the “grad school I’m applying to” and then go on to have a unique impact on the field of structural engineering.

* I currently have a 15"" MacBook Pro, and the Apple Store recently told me that I am having kernel panics (again... last time they said it was a faulty battery) because my hard drive is reapportioning itself in preparation of failure.  It's been a bit over two years.
* My mom's 13"" MacBook Pro, which is newer than mine and seldom even used (she really just doesn't know how), just had a hard drive failure.  What!

Can someone tell me what's going on?  I mean, I'm the first to admit I was a drunk college kid who smacked my 15"" a few times, and I took it to classes a lot (large Big Ten campus, so a lot of movement).

My background is PCA evangelical (somewhat conservative, white upper middle class, in my experience.)  I have a BA in Biblical Studies and am working on an MA in Chaplaincy, just to give you a bit of background on me.  

With the exception of a couple Catholics, I'm probably about the most theologically conservative person in the group of 16 interns, which includes Christians of much more liberal denominations, Rosicrucians, Buddhists, Sufis, as well as gay Christians. 

What I've come to realize is that in this context, theology becomes more of a barrier than anything else (at least for me).  It distances me from real people with real, authentic, valid life experiences of their own.  I have to let go of almost all my theology - and almost all my religious heritage and tradition - in order to be an effective minister.  One of the verses that has been rolling around in my head has been from 1 Corinthians 8, where Paul says, ""Knowledge puffs up, but love edifies.""  My knowledge may or may not be superior; it may be more theologically rigorous and Biblically accurate - but that will not help me convey God's love to my fellow interns, much less the hundreds of patients we'll see.  

The reason I mention this here is because one of the ongoing undercurrents of conversation here at /r/Christianity is the tension between Christian liberalism and conservatism, and verses and doctrines get thrown back and forth.  As a chaplain, if I got involved in a conflict like that in the hospital - with anyone - I would be wrong.  It's too easy to get sucked into theological shit fights, where no minds are changed, no hearts are softened.

One of the approaches we're learning about through this internship has to do with encountering another person, in the model of Martin Buber's I and Thou, recognizing that each person isn't an homogeneous object, but a complex mix of thoughts, feelings, and experiences that is deserving of recognition.  Part of encountering the Thou (especially when it's a patient or patients in conflict) is letting go of the outcome.  I'm not there to make sure that orthodox practice is established and followed.  I'm there to help people understand each other, make decisions that need to be made, and process their feelings in a healthy way.  Let me encourage all of us to listen with open minds and open hearts to hear each others' stories, and to lovingly respect each other."

This is a beast of a computer that I'm not sure I quite need (if you guys remember my old post about me hesitating to build one in the first place). However, I just landed an awesome summer internship so I thought I'd treat myself to something NICE. 

I mean I could probably swing 1400 but I don't want to pay that much for something I'd only use for school and *some* gaming (nothing too heavy either). I think ~1000 is more my price range. Where are places on this build that I could trim some fat?

Also, is it possible to make a Hackintosh *easily*? I despise Windows, and would like to dual boot Mac OSX with Windows. I might just end up running dual boot Windows/Linux if that isn't possible though.

uus4f,1,2012-06-10,Facebook Ads for Greek Life,4DaWin,GreekLife,https://www.reddit.com/r/GreekLife/comments/uus4f/facebook_ads_for_greek_life/,"I decided Reddit was probably the best place to ask this question. I go to a school of about 1200 students. We have 13 Greek organizations and are approaching %50 student involvement in Greek Life. In the Fall of 2010, one house was shut down by it's national headquarters due to lack of size. I noticed one day on Facebook adds showing up talking about being the founding class of a fraternity at my school (I was not in school at the time, as I was taking time off for an internship). This house's national office sent in recruiters to restart the chapter and had paid for targeted ads for students of my university between certain ages.

Recently, my house has been doing a lot of experimenting with social media and it's possible uses for rush. Having a page for our chapter has proven to be quite useful. In the past few months, we've looked to that aforementioned example as reason to experiment with using adds to drive freshmen traffic to our page. Facebook offers pay-per-click and pay-per-display options, with automatic cutoffs. We've been considering just throwing $25 towards it at the start of the term and seeing how much more traffic gets driven to the page.

My question to the Reddit community is, has anyone tried this before? Was it effective? Does having an ad make your house look desperate for new members or is it in fact a smart way to reach out to potential members?"

I took it in high-school and did pretty well, but I lost a huge chunk of my vocabulary. I've been using Memrise to try to build my vocab back up.

But I'm questioning the order in which Memrise is having me learn some of these words. I'm learning tons of ""business-related"" words like Printer, Intern, ~~Printer~~ Payroll, etc. before learning basics like left/right/up/down, bathroom, light, door, shirt, etc.

Any thoughts on this?"

* I'm also trying to figure out how to make the timeline more useful--maybe with positions listed or something--but so far I haven't found a good way to do that.  If anyone has suggestions of how to add more information to it in a non-busy way, I'd appreciate that a lot!

* This resume is supposed to cater to either internships or temporary/part-time entry-level positions in the science/tech industry, preferably software engineering or research/data analysis. I do not intend to work in the Aerospace industry, hence its placement near the bottom.

uu76s,3,2012-06-10,"In a Community Obsessed with Violence, the Average Citizen must stand out from his Fellows",SiIence,Hungercraft,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hungercraft/comments/uu76s/in_a_community_obsessed_with_violence_the_average/,"Hello. My name is SiIence, and it is late at night and this is clearly a trollsome post. What follows is a collection of letters and quotes submitted to me from a number of users, protesting the recent spike in violence and killing in our community. I hope you consider this, and hopefully come to the realization that in a harsh society such as ours, violence is not the answer.            

Recent HungerCraft winner Scoola states ""I don't know about all this killing, man. I mean, it may be the point of the game and all, but I'm not sure that we are making the right choice as a gaming community, you know? There is so much we could accomplish in our hour and a half if we all worked together for once.""            

Scoola's point of view is one of growing importance and popularity throughout our community. In protest to these senseless deaths, he and several others have begun building up towers at the corn and jumping, rather than continue the violence.            

""Dear SiIence,
       Regarding your recent message to me on Reddit, I must say I agree with you on all points. As a whole, picture all we could accomplish! We could build grand cities, create lavish mines, but instead, we pilfer, plunder, and murder. Is this the way we want to live? CAN we live with ourselves this way? I know I've done things... Things I don't want to talk about, all over a porkchop midway through a game. The friends I have betrayed just to stay alive will never trust me again. Can I live with that? I don't know. I just wanted to thank you for being there for me through all this. It's been tough... (EDITOR'S NOTE: Parts of this letter were edited out due to unneeded declarations of love) And through all this, you've been there. Where was I? Oh, yes. The killing. Yeah, it's bad. We need to band together, now or never to choke this evil at its root.             Sincerely, Sup13r4367na787554327584732597289562439t43al            

Interview with Yamata4TW, dated 6/8/12, 8:43 PM.      SiIence: So, what are your views on the violence in our community?      Yamata4TW: Erm, what? I thought you asked me in here to see if I wanted to join the map building team.      S: No, I... Wait, what? Why on earth would we want you? You suck at everything! Erm, pardon. Most things. Back to the topic. What are your views on the killings?      Y: Uh, they are bad, I guess? I mean, I've never thought about this before, but it is sort of pointless. We have to stop the violence and bond together. It is our only real hope if we want to stay sane throughout the harsh enviroments we voluntarily put ourselves into. It's wrong.      S: What do you think is wrong about the killings, and how do you think we should stop them?      Y:Well, what is wrong with them is obvious. Killing in any medium is murder. We need a court system in our games, so that those who are murdered can be sentanced and tried fairly, rather than an eye for eye, tooth for tooth approach. I don't support the death penalty. Game in prison, maybe? I don't know. But as for stopping the killings, the murderers must be publicly punished. A harsh reaction is our only option here.      S: Thank you for your time.      Y:Wait, I don't even get a reward for doing this? Screw you, man, F--- *END INTERVIEW*            

Dear SiIence,      
This killing is terrible! We have to end it as soon as possible. I'm planning a rally tonight, MC1 at the corn. Be there and we can see what we can stir up.      Signed, Manastacious

Transcript of the MC1 Massacre, dated 6/9/12      Manastacious: Brothers! Stop the fighting! We must stop the fighting before we are completely lost to this! Lay down your arms! Give up this senseless violence! We must- *MANASTACIOUS WAS KILLED BY TYLERTHEBRAIN*      Scoola: He's got a diamond sword! Run! Run! *GENERAL SOUNDS OF SCREAMING AND PANIC, THEN SILENCE*      Tylerthebrain: Stupid hippies.            

Doctor M. Rasta's patient logs of Tylerthebrain, dated 6/10/12       Rasta: How have you been feeling, Tyler?      Tylerthebrain: I've... I've got this urge, doc. I can't help it. There's a voice.      R:And what is the voice saying?      T: It's... It's saying the violence is good. It's saying you have pork. And armor. It's saying I should kill you. I... I should KILL ALL OF YOU. KILL...      *PATIENT SUBDUED BY INTERNS*      R: *TO HIMSELF* I've never seen someone this completely insane. We must end the violence as soo- *TYLER HAS ESCAPED AND STABBED RASTA WITH DIAMOND SWORD*       T:No. It must continue. There must be a winner. I must be the winner.           

I hope I have convinced you tonight of the plight of our society. We must band together before we fall apart. The average man must muster his courage and somehow show his heart, be it through scuicide at the corn, hiding, or working together with his brothers to better the world in which we live before we destroy it entirely.

utye4,6,2012-06-09,How do I get started in programming?,Guardian_Of_Pigs,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/utye4/how_do_i_get_started_in_programming/,"A little backstory . . . I am 13 years old and I have always loves  computers and games. Same as almost every redditor. But I have always wondered how they work and what makes computer software work and things of that matter. As I have just passed the 8th grade. And going into high school. I have given deep thought on what I want to do with my life. And like I said before, I have always loved the amount of passion and work being put into coding and programming software and games. I have always wanted to learn how. Such as C++, Java, an Python. Now for the real question. Where do I start? Any recommended collages? Electives I can take in high school (my school does not have many). Internships I can take? Anything would help, thanks! "

utwy8,17,2012-06-09,"Breaking down today. (o no, female FA)",pun_about_throwaway,ForeverAlone,https://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAlone/comments/utwy8/breaking_down_today_o_no_female_fa/,"I can't handle it anymore.  I can't take the sheer lack of contact with people.  This sounds desperate, but maybe I am.

When I was younger (read, up until I was about 20), I had more friends than I knew what to do with.  I had moved several times when I was a little bit, but I thought I had everything under control.  I had a boyfriend who I was convinced I was going to marry.  I moved to another country for him (not as if I hadn't met him before or anything like that).  I had made friends in his home country, and in my own.  Then I lost my bestie due to my own anxiety issues manifesting as pure-asshole-bitchiness.  Then a few months after my visa expired and I moved back to the US, the ex told me he was cheating on me and we were over.  Of course, all the friends I had made in his home country left me.  

Then, I just slowly crashed.  I thought I solve my problems with xanax.  The ex toyed with me, telling me he was sorry and we would get back together.  A family member got ill, so I balanced a part time internship, a full course load, and taking care of my family.  (I'd often only sleep 3 hours or so a night).  The summer I turned 22 was the start of me really crashing.  I was working 40 hours a week, living on my own, having this ex tease me, and often rushing to the ER with the sick family member and spending the night(s) at the hospital with her.  I found a boyfriend for a month, but it failed.

It was then that I stopped going to classes.  I failed semester and lied to everyone about it.  I stopped leaving my apartment, unless I had to.  I was put on anti-depressants which put me in a weird manic episode where I paced around my living room and threatened to kill myself.  I stopped them cold turkey (but still took the xanax and beer to numb everything out).  It was then that I could only sleep with the benzos, and could hardly function at all.  I lost the few friends I had left, of my own volition.  (Agoraphobia is a bitch)

Somehow, I forced myself to snap out of it enough to finish my classes (with one major relapse).  I found two jobs that I enjoy, and have generally been happy with my life. It's been two years (I'm 25 in three months) since any major problems.

**tl;dr: Went a little crazy, no friends.**

What's the point of this?  I have noone around anymore, and I feel like I'm starting to fall back in to my depression.  I have no ""peers"".  I don't know anyone in the area, and I don't have any real hobbies any more.  I lost a lot of my confidence after my breakdown.  I have no real family in the area.  I have co-workers, but most are either in their mid-30s with kids, or in their 40s and 50s.  Nice enough people, but still nothing.  I gained some weight during my depression (went from a size 12 to a 16-18ish), and just feel like no one would want to be around me any way.  I don't drink any more.  I just... am alone, obvs.  And I needed to just tell SOMEONE, because I'm afraid if I don't I'm going to do something stupid some time soon.

Sorry for the throwaway."

uwy2w,1,2012-06-11,Looking for some advice...,gamermonk,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/uwy2w/looking_for_some_advice/,"I just don't know what to do. I want to get out of Michigan, period. Right now, I'm going to a local 2 year college, and will have an ""Associates in Applied Science - Programming"" by next spring. Thats all fine and dandy, but people are telling me that this really doesn't mean anything. They say that I need to go to a four year college (transfer or whatever). By the next spring when I'm ""done"" I will know Java, SQL, Vb.net, C++, etc. What more is 2 more years at a ""university"" teach me? I mean really?

Also, I'm trying my hardest to get a programming internship during my last few semesters, so I have some actual experience.

All I want is a secure future. I don't wanna get this ""degree"", get some experience, and then not be able to get a job (especially if I end up moving. Don't wanna move then not get a job and have to move back home.)

TL;DR Do I need a 4 year degree to get a job in programming? Or is experience and a two year degree just fine?"

Give me your stories and advice on choosing careers and changing careers as well!",[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/uwr3o/askreddit_how_does_one_decide_on_a_career_im/,"**My situation:** May 2011 I graduated with a degree in civil engineering from a decent state school. Even though I didn't really WANT to be a civil engineer, I picked my major because it seemed at least moderately interesting. For the ~18 months leading up to graduation I wasn't too enthusiastic about my major, but I figured I'd go with it.

Graduated with an internship, 3.7 GPA, and EIT designation (passed FE Exam junior year). I also worked throughout college to pay for my education (no help from parents or anyone). I have pretty good social skills and interviewing skills for an engineer: I was ""runner up"" in my first interview out of 20 candidates, and at my second interview was offered a job 15 minutes after leaving. 

Not trying to brag with that last paragraph (anonymously on Reddit with a throwaway, yeah right), just trying to say that I am a capable worker and I think I can do anything I set my mind to. The only thing is that my mind isn't set to anything.

13 months removed from school and I have had a temp job for 3 months and a job as a structural engineer for 9. I have no desire to succeed in my profession or get my PE license. I know I'm lucky to have a job, but should I be satisfied for the rest of my life with the thought of just having a job? I don't think so.

I'm only 23, but I'm getting a little panicky that I have no idea what to do from here on. Everyone says ""oh, you'll know what you want to do, don't rush it"" ... But what if it never comes? It seems like any path I might be even slightly curious in is a huge risk (see: money) for something that isn't even CLOSE to guaranteed? I know engineers often become teachers (summers off maybe, not much money) or bankers (big money, 100-hour weeks), but both of these would require me going back to school. $60,000+ more in education is so steep for just something so unsure.

**So, AskReddit, I would love your input.** I am looking for advice on my situation, or your own stories of how you chose your career and the risks you took to get there. Did you just ""know"" what you wanted to do? Are you happy with your choices? Do tell!"

uwlqs,1,2012-06-11,What are some tips for finding a job in today's economy?,thefreek323,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/uwlqs/what_are_some_tips_for_finding_a_job_in_todays/,"I graduated from a very well-looked-upon university back in 2010 with 3 years of internship (part-time) experience in my field. I thought finding a job might be rather easy. Eighteen freaking months later, I finally got a job.

As most people graduating from college nowadays will tell you, you run into the ""You can't get a job without experience and you can't get experience without a job"" Catch-22 HARD and very quickly upon graduation and it can be annoying and discouraging.

This post is to try to encourage those out there who have yet to find a job (there is hope, I can tell you from experience!) and to ask for any pointers from those smarter than me on good habits to get into during this difficult phase of life. Some quick pointers from me that I picked up during my 18-month stint to start off:

1) As discouraging as it gets, *always* keep working to get a job as hard as you were when you started looking. It can get incredibly discouraging, especially when you start hearing the seemingly condescending ""So....why haven't you worked for a year?"" or ""So...what have you been doing for the last year?"" questions, but don't ever slow down.

2) Don't be embarrassed to collect unemployment if you're following pointer #1. Collecting unemployment can come with the negative stigma that you're being lazy on others' dollar, but don't let that stop you. If you're legitimately looking for work, that's what unemployment is there for.

3) Some people, maybe even your friends, may start talking to you like you're not doing your best. If they aren't giving you *constructive* criticism (ie if they aren't just talking to you with a ""You're being lazy"" tone), ignore them and keep working your hardest.

4) Stay busy. And I don't just mean ""play video games or watch movies all the time."" You won't be unemployed forever, use the enormous amount of free time that you have to do productive things now, while you can. Try starting a business if you have the money in savings (but of course, be wise!), try writing a book, or try using any of your talents/hobbies to make some money. If it doesn't end up making you any money in the long run, at least you were able to do something with your time that was productive. And, on top of that, you'll be able to (honestly) tell your interviewers that you've been doing something other than playing video games all day!"

I'm a 21 year old guy about to enter my last year of college. I'm going for a degree in my school's fairly new IT program with a minor in English. Anyway, since I didn't land an internship this summer I've just been thinking about what will happen when I try and find a job in IT. Anyway, I have some questions:

1. If you work in IT, what do you do? Do you like your job?

2. What kind of things should I be searching for when looking for an IT job?

3. My program kind of exposes you to everything but doesn't make you a master of anything. For example, I just took a class on Python last semester, but it was mostly just basic stuff. Next semester I will take a class on Java but it will also be basic, as well as a basic database tech stuff, etc. Anyway, when I look at job postings I see a lot of people want someone who is a glorified computer programmer so how important is it to be really good at something like Java to get a job in IT?

4. Anything I can do to spice up my resume this summer?

Thanks for any help reddit."

uwi2s,148,2012-06-11,"Fuck you, Alan.",booksarepretty,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/uwi2s/fuck_you_alan/,"Warning: Long and contains language. I don't usually use this much language but Alan is a terrible human being. There isn't a classy way to express my distaste for him. I apologize if I offend you. 

Fuck you, Alan. Hard. Working with you these past 7 years has been terrible. You are a terrible co-worker and the entire organization thinks so. Do you know how hard it is to induce the scorn of nearly 300 employees? Pretty fucking hard, but you did it. 

What exactly is it that you do? I know that you lurk around our office like you think you are important, drifting into conversations like you have business there. You don't. We will let you know when something pertains to you. Promise. 

You float into meetings you aren't invited to and steal the extra lunches. Fuck you for that. I take those extra lunches downstairs to the interns, who can use all the help they can get since they are working for free, and Will, whose entire paycheck (nearly) goes to pay for medical treatment for his disabled child.Fuck you for taking their lunches when you make triple their salaries. What in the hell are you even doing at the meetings? You have been told repeatedly that you aren't to invite yourself to them but you still do. 

Our CEO is a man who loves to hand out second chances to you because you did that one spectacular thing 7 years ago when you first started. OMG, you totally brought us a supporter! I will admit that it was much needed . But when he turned his back on our organization four years ago because of you, you should have been fired. Now our non-profit is barely scraping by because you are too lazy to go out and do your actual job. You have one job, Alan. One fucking job. 

How dare you go into my office and log on to my computer when I wasn't there. You don't think I know. I do. Fuck you. You don't even work in my building. You work in the office across town. Why in the hell are you even over here? You didn't think I would reported you to HR, did you? I did. They were appalled. It is part of the reason you are under review now.

I recently got a lock installed on my office door. Good luck getting in now. What the hell were you looking for anyway? 

Also, fuck you for calling me repeatedly while I was on Maternity Leave for things that weren't emergencies. Debbie was fucking handling my stuff while I was out. You got the fucking email I sent out regarding it because you replied to it. I don't even deal with anything you would need to contact me about anyway! "" Do you have a copy of the report from last year?"", you said in one voice mail I received shortly after giving birth. No I don't fucking have a copy of the report from last year because I don't handle the reports. I don't fucking handle the reports. You aren't new. You know this. The second and third calls ( I was still in the hospital) about how the break room was out of paper towels was just fucking mean.  

Coming back after maternity leave to 200-something emails from you was wonderful. I didn't answer them because you don't need that information. It isn't even your job to know that information. 

Fuck you, Alan. Fuck you and how you take Carrie's parking spot when you visit our location even though you know she has to park there because of her recent surgery. She had fucking cancer, Alan.

Also, how dare you come to my baby work shower (that was after fucking hours) and eat the majority of my awesome cake. That was my cake. No one invited you. How do you even find out about it? You don't even work in our office. Did you just decide to stay until 7pm one day at the office you don't work at for some reason? You just stumbled into my closed office with that stupid look on your face and said, "" Er, look! Cake!"". Fuck you, Alan. I was pregnant and I was going to eat that cake. I said one piece, Alan. Not the whole rest of the cake.  

You really hurt Noah's feelings when you made fun of the way he speaks. He has a fucking speech impediment, you asshole. Not to mention you work for a fucking non-profit whose job it is to help people like Noah. 
   
Tomorrow you have a review with the Board and the CEO to determine whether the department you run is up to standards. I hope you fail. It sickens me to think that because the jobs of the individuals with disabilities who work at your location depends on your success, but I can't help but delight in the fact that you are failing. 

I will dance, Alan. I will dance and I will celebrate with cake - my cake, not yours- (quietly and alone) when they pull your expense records and find that you are mismanaging funds, and finally fire you.

Fuck you, Alan. 

You are the only thing I hate about my job.  

Edit: Thanks for the words of support and the sympathy anger, everybody! You are too wonderful. It is 8:04, my time (CENTRAL), and Alan just arrived for the meeting. My office is usually pretty quiet this early in the morning, but everyone is buzzing around conversat-ing about what is about to go down in that conference room. I will do a update post when I have the news. 

Again, thanks so much for all your comments!  

Edit: I did an update [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/uyga5/update_byebye_alan/) if anyone is interested in checking that out.  "
uwhxz,25,2012-06-11,"I'm a hiring manager at a well-known non-profit, with lots of strong opinions about applications and the job search. Ask me about it!",robertgfthomas,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/uwhxz/im_a_hiring_manager_at_a_wellknown_nonprofit_with/,"I did an AMA a while ago, but I don't really want to answer questions about my penis size again. I'm happy, though, to answer any questions about the hiring process!

Please take my answers with a grain of salt, because every organization and business is different and looks for different things.

Off the bat, let me say that I see there being two main ways to market yourself to a potential employer: you can market your expertise in some particular skill or area of knowledge, OR you can market your individualism and personality.

You can try to market both personality AND expertise, but your résumé's only a page long and effectively making both of those come across in such a tight space is really, really difficult.

Instead, pick one, and commit to it like there's no tomorrow.

If you're applying to a job where you're going to be doing pretty mindless number-crunching all day, then the employer is going to want to see expertise over personality. If you have a BA in Accounting, really flesh out all the stuff you studied, and any practical experience you might have had. This isn't the place to say you were the star of your college's performance of 'Evita'. DO include a few things that paint an image of you as a human rather than a robot, but limit it to a line or two of ""hobbies/interests"" at the very bottom of your résumé.

On the other hand, it seems the vast majority of people on Reddit are 20-somethings who are fresh out of school. Odds are you've had a couple jobs here or there, took some relevant coursework, and were in a few clubs. (If you've already published a novel and you revolutionized Goldman Sachs' finance department while you were an intern there, then you probably don't need to be reading this because you already do what I'm talking about.)

Do NOT take the approach I see in 75% of the hundreds of applications I read every month and try to make your position as Publicity Chair of Alpha Beta Gamma or your summer job as stockboy in Walmart sound like something more than it was. 

You were NOT an Inventory Management Specialist; you were a stockboy. I was hired to this position in hiring because I sniff out bullshit like an Irish setter, just like every other hiring manager in the world. There is no shame in saying you were a stockboy. There IS shame in trying to disguise that fact, because it's basically lying to me.

So what the hell are you supposed to do?

My sister's an actress. Casting directors, like hiring managers, get those jobs because they're great at sniffing out bullshit. Most people when they go into an audition try to anticipate what the director wants. They think, ""OK, they're looking for someone funny, but not TOO funny, and someone whose voice sounds like this,"" and so on. Basically, they're trying to read the casting director's mind.

The problem here is that the casting director is human. This means a three things: 
First, they're looking at hundreds of auditionees that day most of whom are trying to be mind-readers and who are probably all going to assume more-or-less the same things — with the result that they'll all look exactly the same. 
Second, the director probably has a vague idea of what they're looking for, but they won't really know it until they see it. 
Third, the director really does NOT enjoy sitting through hundreds of auditions. They want the first person who walks across that stage to be IT. Second-best would be for every person auditioning to be at least be an easy ""yes"" or ""no"".

When you're auditioning — as with when you're applying to any job — don't assume you know who the director wants. You don't. Instead, think about who you already are. Think about a specific personality trait or style that is quintessentially You, and then just commit to that personality or style 100%.

Get a piece of paper or sit and stare at a wall and marinate in these two questions, until you get answers that are as specific as possible:

1) What are you doing when you're most ""in the zone""? What activity is the easiest for you to get lost in? ""Looking at cats on Reddit"" is a perfectly acceptable answer.

2) What are the things you're mildly ""obsessive compulsive"" about? For example, I HATE having unread e-mails and I HATE being around people who are giving each other the silent treatment, and I'm going to get really frustrated and anxious and worry about all that until I've done something about it.

Then, look for patterns in your answers. What you're going for are the behaviors that are most fundamentally and sustainably You.

Working for a non-profit, I see lots of people who ""just want to give back to the world."" That's very nice, but the reality is we're far more sustainably motivated by the things we DON'T like than by the things we DO like. You might really care about ending child poverty now, but your interests will probably change in the next year or two. However, if the concept of child poverty just drives you crazy to the point that you lie awake at night and worry about it and just want to solve it so you can get a good night's sleep — THAT would be appealing to me.

When you're writing your résumé, think about the things that you just don't have a choice but to do or to be because they're fundamentally who you are. They might not seem like strengths, but they're a tremendous asset in that those are most likely to be constant sources of energy. The things that drive you crazy now, or in which you can lose yourself now, will probably stay the same for a big part of the rest of your life.

As an employer, I want to see that. I don't want you to walk in wearing a banana costume — unless tense situations are one of the things that drive you crazy and you'll do anything to dispel them. If I'm looking for a technical editor, then sure, I might not hire you for the job — but I'll DEFINITELY, definitely remember you and feel much more of a connection to you, and since you showed me a clear picture of who you are — instead of a fuzzy picture of what you think I want — if I'm aware of something else that might match your style I'll be far more likely to refer you to it.

At any rate, I'm rambling.

TL;DR: You don't know how I think. So figure out how you think and commit to it 300%.

Ask away!"

uw9g3,3,2012-06-11,"As a student in my last year of university, what sorts of things should I be doing in order to prep for the workforce in order to become successful?",xracquellyy,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/uw9g3/as_a_student_in_my_last_year_of_university_what/,"I am currently a Communications major in my last year coming up in September. I am just kind of wondering what sorts of things I am able to do in order to give myself a better chance at finding a decent job coming out of school. I know everyone hopes to find one after graduation and that may not happen for most, but what would help someone in order to at least have a good chance?

What I'd like to do as a career in the long-term would be to work in the gaming industry within the fields of either Communications, Public Relations, Marketing or anything else related to those.I would like to get into the actual game companies or even just gaming magazines as well. I'd love it. Technology was another thing that had caught my interest as well - computers, phones, hardware etc.

I have gotten into writing for a gaming website and I have been doing that since March. I also did a little writing as a Digital Marketing Intern for another company. I'd like to further my experience and skills so that I get a good start. I was also trying to think of ways to gain experience in regards to skills in web or graphic design or even programming a bit, because I feel that maybe that'd help.

A friend of mine mentioned to hand-write letters saying that I am interested in getting into this field and ask what sorts of things do they look for in a potential employee and just go from there. It'd show that you are dedicated and interested from what he had said. 

Any suggestions would be appreciated. Thanks!"

I'm still new to Python, and I'm currently using v.2.7.2 for my internship. However, I really like the online book ""Dive into Python 3"". Do you think it's wise to go ahead &amp; read the book for a version of the language I'm not ever using. Is Python 2 really all that different from Python 3?"
uw4ci,4,2012-06-11,[For Hire] 29 Year Old with English Degree From OSU,SultryHues,forhire,https://www.reddit.com/r/forhire/comments/uw4ci/for_hire_29_year_old_with_english_degree_from_osu/,"Good Morning Reddit: Forhire!

I am writing to you today to offer my services. You see, I am in a bit of a spot, as so many of us are. I graduated two years ago from my beloved OSU with a Major in English Literature and a Minor in Women's Studies.

Unfortunately, I was sick for the last few months of my degree and failed to consider an internship or my after school employment. I have since moved back home with my parents, and have been half-surviving on odd jobs unrelated to my schooling. And that is how I have found myself here.

I need to have experience in order to have my resume looked at by employers. I didn't get that experience in college, so I have been trying to find freelance work. A lot of that freelance work also requires experience. What is a girl to do?

I am looking to break into the editing and/or publishing world. I have the beginnings of a keen eye which will only grow sharper with... you guessed it... experience. I read constantly (I carry a book in my purse at all times), am working through writer's block and I do the odd editing/proofreading/brainstorming job for my friends.

I have a passion for learning and personal growth. My time as a substitute teacher has taught me that, while I may be good at it, I am not cut out to be an educator long term. Literacy is very important to me as well and I think that it is something that has sadly fallen out of style. I would love the opportunity to put my talents to work at a great company with similar interests. The opportunity to help women grow and prosper would be a big bonus for me, but who am I to be picky in these times?

And so I shall conclude this letter by saying that I will gladly accept any constructive help. Maybe you would like to help me through networking with me on [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/profile/connections?id=55823772). Maybe you have some sage advice, which I will consider even if I've heard it before. Maybe you are in the same boat as I am and would just like to talk and share some resources with me. And just maybe you are in HR at a company in the great city of Columbus, Ohio, and you would be willing to take some sort of chance with me by letting me get my foot in the door, even if it's just getting coffee and lunch for editors. I shall accept it all.

Help me Reddit: Forhire, you're my only hope!

Best,

Jobless in Zanesville

uvx08,2,2012-06-11,Need Info on MS in CS at ASU.,creepingdeathv2,ASU,https://www.reddit.com/r/ASU/comments/uvx08/need_info_on_ms_in_cs_at_asu/,"Hello there! 

I have been accepted for MS in CS this Fall. 

I don't have plans on continuing to do PhD, as of now. I plan on cruising through my MS - working hard, keeping my grades up throughout, try to get a good internship and eventually taking up a good job, that pays around $70-75k atleast or more. 

I want to know if I am taking the right step ? How were the internship and jobs offered to the graduating class of 2012 ? Are the grad students happy generally about their placements ? What is the median salary package offered to an MS grad ? 

thanks guys! looking forward to joining here!

uvssa,1,2012-06-11,In what unexpected way did you end up meeting and dating/marrying your SO despite the odds?,fbea,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/uvssa/in_what_unexpected_way_did_you_end_up_meeting_and/,"I'll go first. I met my girlfriend while working at a fashion internship with a start-up fashion site. She and I were both interns at the company. This was my first internship ever and wanted to impress so I would typically walk into the office dressed in skinny jeans, a tight dress shirt, dress shoes and the whole nine yards so that I'd ""fit in"" as a fashionable guy. My girlfriend didn't quite dress particularly in feminine clothing at the time, but rather chose to wear t-shirts and boy shirts (not fashionable at the time), which I understand the reasoning for now that I think about it. Our job was to interview people on the streets and hand out promotional material (essentially bitch work), and seeing as how our job required us to walk about 20 miles a day from one end of the city to the other looking for stylish people while baking under the sun. Gf was smart to wear comfortable clothing. I on the other hand was not as bright (pun intended).

More than half the other male interns were gay, so my girlfriend assumed that I was gay. I can't blame her considering that I was painting a mannequin's fingernails during a marketing project, which was part of an idea that I was responsible for having come up with. For some reason or another, I thought my girlfriend was lesbian. Two months of the three month-long internship passed and we didn't think much of each other. Apparently she didn't quite like me at the time and I shared the same sentiment. We may have butted heads a few times during projects. It ended up that in the final month, myself, and my girlfriend were the only ones left working on the mannequin project. The other interns had dropped out. Every day my girlfriend and I would walk around New York City with a mannequin in tote. We'd take pictures and coming up with story lines for a page that would go on the website. Eventually, we became friendly because we'd end up talking every day and we'd chat via text about work and non-work related stuff. During this month I began to develop feelings for her when I began to realize that she wasn't a lesbian after all. We'd take long walks around the city, and on several occasions she talked about the guys she dated in the past and was into. Funny enough, she (she's Asian) explicitly mentioned that she had only dated white guys, and here I was a socially awkward virgin Korean American guy who had never had a legitimate girlfriend (I've had teenage flings), trying to figure out if she liked me. All signs pointed to NOPE, but I was hopeful. I asked my friends, painted a picture to them of the situation where she was calling me ""dude,"" despite spending quite a significant amount of time with me, and every single one told me that she wasn't interested in me. I then in my final effort asked one last friend, who told me that my yet-to-be-gf seemed to be interested in me. Not sure why she came to that conclusion honestly, but it was good enough for me. 

The last day of the internship, my yet-to-be gf and I hung out till the wee hours. We decided to say our goodbyes, walked into the subway station, was about to swipe my Metro card, when I said fuck it. I was extremely nervous and socially awkward as fuck, but asked her if she wanted to grab drinks. I was one month into my 20th year of life at the time and toted around an obviously fake and blurry international ID card, but I thought to myself, hey, why not? I was naive and look like a 14 year old (I'm turning 24 and I still get carded for purchasing lottery tickets), and the thought that I'd get rejected with my ID never crossed my mind. I went to one place that a couple of older friends had told me about. I presented my ID to the bouncer at the door and he laughed at me. My girlfriend was two years older than me so she had no issues. I stood my ground telling them I was 21, which was obviously a lie, and the bouncer decided to call a manager down. The manager took my card, looked at me, looked at my fake ID, looked at my girlfriend, looked at me, looked at my girlfriend, and then handed the card back to me. He waved us in. In 99% of cases I'd never allow a minor into a bar myself, but I'm going to be a hypocrite and say that I'm forever grateful to that guy for letting me in. To my hypocritical defense I also did shell out a decent chunk of change that night. My yet-to-be-gf and I chatted about life, love and got drunk that night. We left the lounge buzzed, and while we're walking and my brain couldn't formulate rational thoughts, I thought to myself, FUCK IT (for the second time). I asked her if she wanted to be my gf. She said that's nice, but unlikely. She was going back to college in the East Coast and I'd be back to college in the Midwest. Of course I didn't think that part through. It was pretty awkward for about 2 minutes while walking silently next to each other. Then a third FUCK IT moment came to me thanks to alcohol (and no I don't condone underage drinking, but I'm going to have to be a hypocrite here). We ended up waiting for the light to turn green on a corner while cabs and people were whizzing by, and I mustered up the courage to take her in my arms and kiss her like I had watched in the chick flicks (I dipped her and everything). 

We kissed for a while, and eventually she invited me to her place, where I finally lost my v-card. I GFed her that night.

We decided to undertake a long distance relationship for almost 2.5 years, and after my graduation I lived with her for about 6 months. She actually recently moved overseas for a job, while I'm working in the states, so we're going through another long distance relationship, but I think we're managing. Of course it's not easy.

**T(fucking)LDR; Met gf at internship. Gf thought I was gay, and I thought she was lesbian. Worked on long project, got to know her better, I was socially awkward as fuck so I didn't know if she liked me. Decided to listen to the only friend who said my yet-to-be-gf liked me. Final day, despite my shitty fake ID, I was accepted into a lounge where I got drunk, got enough liquid courage to ask her out (twice kind of), and I lost my v-card. Now she has been my gf for nearly 4 years**

Any one else have any fun stories with meeting their SO despite the odds?"

My degree is in engineering but I am working as a technician atm. I have been doing very good work which I feel has been over looked for the past year. Because of my degree I am able to do the work of an engineer and the technician which makes me twice as productive at times. However I feel my boss does not see this. I have been working twice as hard as many of my coworkers so I was given a really tough project. In the year I have been making big strides on the project which has brought its completion to realization. I feel that my boss is not letting me leave my position now because of the work I did for this project. ( Because I am more valuable where I am than someplace else.) However because of that I am not given the opportunity to progress my career. So I missed out on this years intern program because my boss wants to keep me on this project. Now I have absolutely no chance to move from my position at this company because I missed out on the opportunity to become an intern and get an entry level position. What should I do to help my boss see that I should get an entry level job there. Or should I just look to leave?

uypff,0,2012-06-12,Parsing an XML properties file with Java,brandnewaquarium,java,https://www.reddit.com/r/java/comments/uypff/parsing_an_xml_properties_file_with_java/,"I'm currently at my first internship, and I've been fighting with a new project.  The other developer I was working with got pulled onto other things, so I thought maybe this would be helpful.

I want to parse an XML document using Java.  The purpose of this application would be to create a very basic in-house file archiver. 

Structure of XML Document:
http://pastebin.com/6tyj8LsD

So, the ""special properties"" for the sub directories would be able to have all of the same properties as any other directory, but they wouldn't necessarily be REQUIRED.  Instead, we would have the parent directory overwrite any unstated properties for the subdirectory.  Normally, the only thing to be overwritten would be the archive location, though occasionally we may want to add a file to be ommitted or limit the amount of time for the subdirectory to be worked in.

Breakdown:
* Each directory will have its own thread from a threadpool.

* Each thread will be fed from one main function.  Basically, I'd like to have each thread be spawned per &lt;directory&gt; tag.

* But how to parse the XML document?  I've so far tried doing this recursively, but recursion isn't something I'm very well practiced at.  Should I be parsing the XML document into a NodeList or a CopyOnWriteArrayList?

* How would I pass each collection to the thread?  I never learned very much about collections in school, but I've heard things like map and hash thrown around.

* What kind of collection would be best for this type of tree?

* I'm a little but unsure of how I should be handling the XML document.  Should I be using SAX or XOM or DOM?  I'm not even entirely sure of how to use any of them - perhaps an example?

* Any other useful references, or stuff I should be aware of?"

uygy8,1,2012-06-12,Help with car audio?,[deleted],CarAV,https://www.reddit.com/r/CarAV/comments/uygy8/help_with_car_audio/,"I recently started an internship this summer, and I'm making pretty damn good money with it. I have always loved listening to music, especially thumpin' some songs with great beats over a great car audio sound system with friends or just driving.


anyways, I just got my first car pretty recently, a [1994 Toyota 4runner](http://consumerguideauto.howstuffworks.com/1990-to-1995-toyota-4runner-6.htm) that [looks somethin like this](http://www.google.com/imgres?q=1994+gold+toyota+4runner&amp;um=1&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=N&amp;biw=1440&amp;bih=775&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbnid=lAeOhpYekascNM:&amp;imgrefurl=http://www.expeditionportal.com/forum/threads/73331-94-4-Runner-Build-newb-thread&amp;docid=t5lTJXNLC7adQM&amp;imgurl=http://a8.sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-snc7/421988_241147235966333_100002131760963_534983_107055691_n&amp;w=960&amp;h=720&amp;ei=X57XT-vQDaP42QXVp9iFDw&amp;zoom=1&amp;iact=hc&amp;vpx=1148&amp;vpy=433&amp;dur=282&amp;hovh=144&amp;hovw=194&amp;tx=119&amp;ty=75&amp;sig=103651068722960306348&amp;page=2&amp;tbnh=135&amp;tbnw=182&amp;start=25&amp;ndsp=30&amp;ved=1t:429,r:11,s:25,i:189). I love her so far. Her name is Roxanne. She needs some work and some love, but I want to fix her up (not only with engine work but also with my audio).

I'm pretty positive the front speakers are blown, but that's alright because I was probably going to replace them regardless. the problem with those is that they are in the dash, so if I install them myself I'm guessing it won't be easy. just judging from the size I believe the front speakers are 4"" speakers. I would also like to put subs in the back, most likely two 12 inchers. I've done some research over what brands are better than others, but I figured it would be pretty helpful to figure out what I would like to do on here. basically I'm looking to get a new stereo deck, front speakers, subs in the back (I have plenty of room), and an amp if it's going to help. I would like to spend enough on this system that I can keep it and place it in the next car I own (probably after college if this 4runner will last me).

Another note: I have a company car, a [2010 Chevy Tahoe](http://www.google.com/imgres?q=2010+chevy+tahoe+ltz&amp;num=10&amp;um=1&amp;hl=en&amp;biw=1440&amp;bih=775&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbnid=shPT4Z3TjIBxoM:&amp;imgrefurl=http://beautycarsden.blogspot.com/2010/02/2010-chevy-tahoe-ltz-suv-pictures-and.html&amp;docid=Fmj_E8ycuT-d2M&amp;imgurl=http://assets.clickmotive.com/ail/stills_white_0640/4484/4484_st0640_046.jpg&amp;w=640&amp;h=480&amp;ei=tp7XT4n9Foui8ASl5bG2Aw&amp;zoom=1&amp;iact=rc&amp;dur=324&amp;sig=103651068722960306348&amp;sqi=2&amp;page=1&amp;tbnh=117&amp;tbnw=156&amp;start=0&amp;ndsp=28&amp;ved=1t:429,r:1,s:0,i:115&amp;tx=110&amp;ty=62), that I get to use all summer and I will be driving around a lot in (hour long drives at a time). it's a hell of a fun drive, it already has a built in Bose system (I know I know Bose, everyone hates Bose) which has a pretty good sound, good bass too when I crank it up. it's pretty crisp, and it would really thump with some subs in it. if I'm going to do a lot of driving in this Tahoe over this summer, so I figure it's worth looking into buying subs and installing them in this Tahoe, and then moving them into my 4runner at the end of the summer. if this is indeed feasible, let me know. it would be awesome to do, but if it's too complicated let me know. I also realize that the 'runner will have different power outputs than a pretty new Tahoe, and I feel like that's what I would have to worry about most.
so yeah, I appreciate any and all help / advice I can get from you guys.

**tl;dr** I own a '94 Toyota 4runner that I'm looking to trick out my audio for, and I'm entertaining the idea of putting subs temporarily in my Tahoe.

I used to be in pretty good shape, exercising for 2-3 hours six days a week, but after going to college, I gained a lot of weight. Freshman year I had mono, so when I came back for the summer, I was 15 pounds less than what I was before, (around 120, I'm 5'9), but now I am at a solid 150.

I really want to lose weight and get more toned. During the school year, I did go to the gym and I did a lot of pushups, and my arms have gotten a lot bigger, but also there's a lot of fat on there too. Also my stomach has started to show, and I've never been able to see it before so it is very distressing to me. I intern at a company from 9 till around 7 at night, and usually when I get home I'm too tired to want to go running or exercise.

Do you guys have any tips for getting in shape besides to stop being such a lazy asshole? Especially like routines, workouts, or diet to pay attention to. Thanks guys!"

They had a coding style that I felt would be the best learning environment for me. Problem is they don't really have any entry level positions available. And all they could offer me was a summer internship with the possibility of full-time employment in August if I can perform well (no guarantees). The internship is for 10 dollars an hour and the full time position is for 42,000 a year.

Both offers felt a bit underwhelming on the salary side but I can feed myself and still afford entertainment on it and that's all that really matters.

Is it worth it to take a hit in salary early on if you feel it'll be a true learning experience for you? Or is the experience I get likely going to be similar in all companies and I should just aim for the highest salary?"

(Throwaway used)",TossedAwayForReal,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/uy56x/27m_i_really_feel_like_im_taking_a_risk_here_but/,"What I mean by taking a risk is that there is a new intern that got hired where I work. She's going into her last year of college this coming fall so I assume she’s around 21 or 22. I've been in plenty of relationships, just never one where I met the person at work. I work in IT and I setup her PC and made some smalltalk. I took my sweet time because I was really attracted to her. I guess you could say we  ""hit it off"" (IT Crowd fans: It means she kept talking to me after I'd fixed her computer) but I couldn't really tell if she was being flirtatious or just friendly. I pretty much just asked things to get to know her like: ""Where do you go to college?"" ""What's it like so far up here?""  ""Where are you staying while up here?"" ""Do you travel home on the weekends?"" etc. She smiled as I asked away and didn't really ask me anything back. After the couple minutes of conversing she says ""thanks for your help"" and we go about our work and business. 

I then get to see her again because she had some general questions and just wanted some things setup on her desktop. She asks me about a home internet question and of course I give my best answer. I catch her looking at my junk and then she looks up in my eyes. I'd imagine that's a good sign, you ladies will have to help me on that one. I then just talk a little bit more about anything I can possibly think of. I ask her how it's been again so far, now that she's been here for two more weeks. I learn a little bit more about her. She seems to like being outdoors and  she said that she reads a lot. We start discussing bicycles and I talk a little bit about mine  and she seems interested in what I'm saying. Once again, smiling, and once again she thanks me for my help and sends me on my way. She seems to keep pretty good eye contact with me as well.

So far these have been my only interactions with her and I'm trying to be as detailed about it as possible. Naturally, I'm scared to death to ask her out. My biggest fear when asking a girl out is that they are already taken, it just makes me feel weird for some reason. I also don't want any awkwardness at work if she says no for one reason or another. I'm the only IT support in her area so I have to face her if she needs anything and I was never good at interacting with females that reject me.

What I want to accomplish is finding out if she's already in a relationship. Is there anyway to  figure this out without sounding awkward or making it obvious I'm trying to find out? She has no  personal photos at her desk, and doesn't wear any rings at all. That's about the best detective work I could do. If I can get that far, what would be the most appropriate way to ask to do something outside of work? She lives by herself while interning and I'm sure she would like some social interaction and a friend. I don't wanna ask her out right away anyway, I really want to get to know her first and be friendly and do friendly things and take it from there. 

TL;DR: I’m interested in an intern at work, and want to find out if she’s available and how to ask her to hang out.

Any advice would be nice! :) Feel free to AMA as well.


EDIT: Thank you everyone. I'm extremely thankful for all the advice! I'm concluding that I will just let this one go. I'm in a ""career"" more so than a job, so I want to keep everything as clean and rumor free as possible, even if it's just an intern. Other office workers know about how some people talk, so I feel I'm good. If she asks me out, maybe I'll try it, but I don't wanna be the weirdo that tries to get with coworkers. As I stated, I have no experience with dating coworkers and for a damn good reason it seems. I always felt it was a bad idea, but this girl was really different and special to me. There will be many more outside of work. Once again, Thank You :) "
uy3ij,16,2012-06-12,Is this job worth it? ,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/uy3ij/is_this_job_worth_it/,"After I graduated school, it took me a good 1-2 months to find a job. I was stupid enough not to go for really competitive internships during school and did one only where my dad worked which didn't really help much with finding a job after college.

Anyway, now I got this job basically as a LAMP developer (having come out of college knowing Java/C++) with a salary of 45k. It's a very crappy salary, and it's slightly depressing especially knowing a couple of friends are working in Apple and Goldman Sachs making over 90K straight out of school. I live in the NYC area as well, so I know for a fact that this salary is crap for where I live.

The thing is, I know for a fact that I'm worth more, but I am honestly learning a lot in this company, and we are at a phase where we are building a new product from scratch which is actually pretty exciting. I've built custom frameworks using various libraries and basically learned more about web programming in 3-4 months than I have my whole college career. 

My development to maintenance ratio is probably 9:1 which is the best part. The environment is also very relaxed, and we joke around a lot. But there are also days where I have to stay late and get work done, although it's relatively rare. 

The job is great, the only problem is this awful salary. Should I stick it out and suck the company/developers around me for all of their knowledge and then switch? Or should I wait another month or two and try to ask for a raise? Any other tips would be appreciated as well (or similar situations/stories and how you guys have handled them)

PS I've been working here for about 5.5 months now. "

uxlxv,1,2012-06-12,"Help with out of state speeding ticket (live in IL, ticket in WI, first violation)",notspeedinginwsc,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/uxlxv/help_with_out_of_state_speeding_ticket_live_in_il/,"Hi-

I have a bunch of questions regarding a ticket I received for speeding on a freeway (11-15 mph). 

Details:

First off, my car (silver 2001 ford escort) and license have Illinois registration and I was driving East on 43 in Walworth County on Saturday afternoon at 3:40.  I was heading back to my college town from my internship site in northern WI to give a speech at an opening of an exhibition I curated at a museum, and had been driving for about 2 hours.   I was running a bit behind because of a housing emergency and water was leaking in and needed to wait for a plumber.My car does not have cruise control.  While I do not know how fast I was going when I got pulled over, the officer (a state patrol officer) showed me the laser radar at 87 in a 65.  I do not believe I was going that fast, but he was positioned halfway down a fairly steep hill.  He lowered the speed to 80 on my ticket, stating that he normally lowers the speed for people who cooperate.  I did tell him I was running late for an opening that I was headed to, but I did not admit to speeding (though I realize now this could be considered an implication of guilt). 

My fine is for $200.50 with an estimated 4 points on my record. This is my first ever violation on my record and I am 21 year old female and have had my license for 4 years.  I honestly can not afford $200 at this time as I am living off of grant money and I do not want this getting back to my insurance in IL as I can equally not afford an increase in my rates there, nor do I want to have to deal with my parents about it.  It will be difficult for me to attend my court date as I would need to request the day off and require me to drive 2 hours again, but there is a chance I could do so.

My questions are:

1. Should I contest the ticket in court or just pay the fine and be done with it?
2. If I contest the ticket, what should I plead in order to increase my chances of not paying/reducing the chance this will end up on my record?
3. I've heard of people writing to the judge, like this post: http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/i9r34/speeding_ticket_advice_needed/ . Is this a viable option in the state of Wisconsin? 
4. I've heard Wisconsin is one of the few states not required to tell other states of your driving record in state.  Is this true?
5. If #3 is true, do I have to worry about the insurance rates increasing?  I have Allstate if that helps.
6. Should I worry about mail being sent back to my parents house (residence as listed in IL)?"

ux7jg,1,2012-06-11,Grad School question.  Is it worth it?,klin324,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/ux7jg/grad_school_question_is_it_worth_it/,"So I have read and heard from multiple sources that if you can't get into a top 10 or 20 (I hear different thresholds) compsci grad program then it is not worth going between the monetary cost of the program and the opportunity cost, especially considering how hot the job market is now for compsci grads.  I'm only talking about a master's program, I have no interest in working in academia so I'm not even considering a Ph.D.  I love computer science and I would thoroughly enjoy studying it (and conducting research) for two more years in an academic environment.  I recognize that getting a master's typically means a pay raise, and that is appealing to me.  I'm not looking for the typical response: ""If you're doing it for the pay raise you'll be miserable in a M.S. C.S. program"".  I'm just looking for someone to shed some light on the validity that there is some sort of threshold when it comes to going for a graduate degree.

Also, realistically, how many undergrads obtain research experience?  I know this is a primary factor during the admissions process, but I'm curious what the typical 'competition' looks like for the various levels of grad schools, top 5, top 20, top 50 etc...

Do internships hold any weight during the admissions process?

Thanks in advance for any insights."

I was a college junior at during that time and was seeking for an internship that would lead to full time.

I was rejected by almost all of them but eventually landed an internship at the end. This company will offer me full time employment upon satisfactory completion of my internship.

I've done a large range of interviews, from 10 minutes to 6 hours. I've been asked some weird questions and have received weird responses. My experience made me painfully familiar with the interview process and I know more or less how these things go.

**REDDITWRITINGCLASS:**  
I'll be leading discussions but I'll also be participating in exercises and reading responses. I hope (and expect) to learn from all of you. I consider you all my peers. I'm currently hawking 2666 by Roberto Bolaño.

**wvlurker:**  
I hope to learn a lot here. My (fiction) writing background is pretty sparse. A few stories and poems in college. I've always enjoyed writing and really enjoyed seeing other people read what I write. I'm especially looking forward to the challenge of being forced into writing with a group of folks who might actually cast a critical eye at what I put on paper.


I'm a graduate student in philosophy, so I write a lot of nonfiction. I'm finishing up the research on my thesis now, which is a historical work on Augustine's Theory of Forms. I don't know that I have a current ""must-read"" author or book. I read a few at once - right now I'm reading Neoplatonism by Pauliina Remes (history of philosophy), a collection of science fiction short stories (of mixed quality) called Far Horizons, and an old collection of Poe's stories called The Fall of the House of Usher: And Other Tales and Prose Writings of Edgar Poe.  
.  
**nichole123**  
I hope to learn more about my writing style, and what others think about my writing objectively. I write YA Fiction, so I tend to read a lot more YA than Adult. I'm also a romance and fantasy junkie, so that will color my book suggestions.


I've written ever since I learned how (I wrote an award winning book in 3rd grade, woop!). I love telling stories about honest people that evoke real emotion in people. I love writing in general, and the way it can transport you somewhere you would never think to go.


Adult must read is Kelly Armstrong, specifically her ""Bitten"" series. Great voice, and the first ""action"" books that I actually enjoyed. YA must read is Maggie Steifvater. Anything by her. She writes very poetically and draws you in to the characters.

**hack1690**  
Hi all. If you had told me I would pursue a career in writing a few years ago, I would have laughed at you. Growing up, I was always an avid reader, but I excelled in the technical and math classes. The last four years I've spent my time working towards a computer science degree. Through an internship and subsequent job making iOS/Android games, I found that passion was for story development, not programming.


I am now majoring in Journalism and Screen Studies and should be graduating next spring. I want to continue my career in story development/ worldbuilding/ narrative design in the game industry.


I have had no formal training in fiction writing (the first will be a 400 level script writing class in the fall, yikes!), so I am hoping to learn some of the finer points and experiment with different styles.


For fantasy writing, Tolkien is probably the most influential. For science fiction, I am particularly fond of a less known author, Dan Abnett, who writes in the Warhammer 40k universe, among others. Recently I have been on a sci-fi streak with Snow Crash (Neal Stephenson), Ender's Game (Orson Scott Card) and The Hunger Games trilogy (Suzanne Collins). I am currently enjoying World War Z (Max Brooks).  
.  

**CunningB**  
I currently work as a copy writer for an SEO firm and fictional writing is my way of escaping the tripe that i have to force out on a daily basis!


Personal ability wise: I was a pretty poor writer at school but an avid reader, mainly of fantasy works, which eventually inspired me to give writing a go. I've been 'seriously' writing for around 6 months now, and I'm interested in breaking out of my fantasy home to meet some of the neighbors; as i feel working around a cliché would be much easier with a larger tool box.


As for authors i love, Steven Erikson, for his convoluted plots; Elizabeth Moon, for her absorbing female characters; and my latest love affair, Patrick Rothfuss, for his voice.  
.  

**scienceisgayokay**  
I hope to refine my writing and take it to a higher level where writing is more incorporated into my daily life. i've always been somewhat of a writer, though i didn't write much on my own until recently. when i was around thirteen i started writing a short fantasy novel and got to about twenty-five pages of completion before stagnating on it and before it got deleted by an unknowing mother.


i really liked cities of the red night by william s. burroughs, and plan on reading the rest of the trilogy. this is the first book of w.s.b. that i've finished, and i know it won't be the last. his writing is so beautiful and so carnal. it's always pleasantly intoxicating to dive into his stories. i also liked snowcrash by neal stephenson, because he did an excellent job at creating a fun and believable sci-fi story. one thing that i like about it is how under the superficial layers of the story are his ideas on how symbols and language can activate latent parts of the brain.


my inspirations in terms of authors include henry miller, william s. burroughs, chuck palahniuk, and david foster wallace.

Hi.


I've been writing for about 5 years but I've yet to write anything that I feel was really substantial or worth creating. I've never completed a peace of writing that I've felt was as good as it could have been. I don't think I've ever experienced anything worth writing about either, though perhaps I'm wrong about that. I joined this course because I want a reason to write something worth reading. Also, I like Irvine Welsh and at the moment I'm reading his book Filth.

Hello everybody, my name is Jacob. I have no professional writing background, as I'm only still a student in high school. I don't doubt that I'll be the youngest of the 14 of us to actively participate in the class. I sought to join this workshop because I need a metaphorical kick in the ass to my writing. A year ago, I set the goal of finishing the rough draft of my novella I had been working on by the time I graduated. Since that day, absolutely zero progress has been made toward that goal, with me instead just whimsically writing short stories and poems with no real direction or end-goal. I feel that this workshop will help give me the motivation I need, as well as providing honest, objective critiques of my writing.


I am a fan of dystopian novels, such as A Clockwork Orange and Brave New World, as I feel they provide a sobering look at many of the problems in society. I delight in surrealist writing, as well as nonsense poetry, though I don't confine myself to absurdity alone. I also enjoy philosophical writings, ranging form the more modern works of Bertrand Russell to the classic Socratic Dialogues, and cheap paperback novellas of the 1950s, like The Green Odyssey and Strangers in the Universe. I look forward to conferring with you all and growing as a wordsmith!

**in-wonderland**  
Hey everyone! I'm an English major and about to be a senior in college. Some of my favorite authors are Henry James, Oscar Wilde, Poe and George Orwell. Most of my work is critical analysis and comparison of works, but I've always wanted to get a bit more creative. Hopefully this class will give me a chance to share without the fear that comes along from sharing with people you actually know.


I just finished The Puttermesser Papers by Cynthia Ozick and I wholeheartedly recommend you check it out. Puttermesser is an amazing character and the book lends itself to a TON of analysis. If anyone wants to talk about it then let me know!  
.  
**Totally_Straight**  
I have always enjoyed writing but only started 'seriously' writing near the end of my university career. 


After 4 years of my creativity being slowly sapped I decided that a change was needed and I began the whole ""Morning Writing"" thing as suggested in The Artist's Way. This really helped to inspire me and I have been trying to write as much as can since. 


Though i just started writing prose, all throughout University I have written sketch comedy and comics. This has made itself evident in my writing as most of my stories seem to be comedic. My favourite writers are also reflective of this; Douglas Adams, Kurt Vonnegut, Neil Gaiman, basically anyone who can make me laugh well still telling a story.


I just want to create writing that motivates and inspires people.

v0c4k,2,2012-06-13,"Need some general advice / reassurance / opinions regarding my girlfriend and myself going ""on a break.""",supersaying,BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/v0c4k/need_some_general_advice_reassurance_opinions/,"I just got off of a long video chat with her, so this is all fresh.

Me and my girlfriend (both 20) have been dating for a little bit over 2 years now. We both attend the same university, and have 1 more year to go before graduating. We both had our own rooms, so we were able to spend a lot of time alone together to talk, hang out, nap, have sex, whatever. We were very close, and talked throughout the day on the phone.

Enter summer vacation. I had to stay on campus for an extra month for a work contract, and she went home. She visited me on campus at the end of the month, but she was noticeably different as far as her attitude went - she was quieter, and didn't really connect with me like I thought she would after some time apart.

I'm back home now too. I live out of state, so now we are an hour and a half away from each other. She has started an internship, and I am working from home for my father. 

Last week, we video chatted and everything was great. Ever since that day, she has not been responding to texts or calls, and said a few days ago that ""she needs some time."" She said that she feels overwhelmed with things, that there's too much happening too fast, and that she will ""keep me posted.""

Fast forward to today, and I am sick of being chumped waiting for her to decide on anything. I left her a voicemail saying I have something relatively important to talk about, which led to our video chat that ended 10 minutes ago as of this writing. She and I are now ""on a break.""

I don't know exactly what this means, and neither does she, really. I asked what I'm supposed to tell people when they ask my relationship status, and she said I can say whatever I want to say. She said that she still loves me, and that I'm the only guy that she does love, and I told her I love her back. It honestly comes down to the fact that she really just felt that she needs ""me time"" for herself.

Just as it all ended, she texted me saying that she is changing her Facebook relationship to where only see can see it, so technically it's still there, but nobody will know about it. She said it's because ""we are not completely together or single. I know this sounds silly, but I just don't want to take it off.""

I guess what worries me is what she wants to do. We've been on a break before, last year, where she went on some dates with another guy to figure out if I was what she wanted, which I was. I don't understand why she would want to do that again, but nonetheless, I would still feel cheated on if she were to do it.

Did I do anything wrong with how I handled things? We ended on good terms, and agreed that whenever we want to talk to each other, we should just call and talk like it's no big deal. Also, should I be worried about anything that she might be planning on doing that would further distance us? I really feel that we are good together and would like to do something to not lose her, but I also don't want to overstep.

I might be talking / worried about nothing, but I would really like to hear some kind of feedback about the situation. In the end, I'm a paranoid parrot when it comes to relationships, and want to know more rather than less. I really didn't want to be on a break, but she wanted it, so I felt it was my only choice.

Thanks.

But not knowing much about open-source communities/available projects out there, I'm not exactly sure where to start, especially since the skills I have to offer are (at the moment) pretty limited. I know there are lots of learning-resources out there, but I learn best by setting goals and working towards them hands-on, rather than just reading about things abstractly (though obviously I will read up on documentation when a project calls for it).

v004r,4,2012-06-13,Step mother issues,asher8,Assistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/v004r/step_mother_issues/,"Here's the backstory:

I'm 20 years old, and 3 years ago my father married a woman who I literally can not stand. She has some severe mental issues, including what may be bi-polar and borderline personality disorders. I could go on and on with what hardships she has caused this family. Because of her instability, she and my fathers relationship has been volatile and almost ended countless times, which started to become a problem even just a few weeks after they started dating 5 years ago.

I dislike everything about her, even when she is acting normal, I can't stand her personality. She analyzes and judges everybody, and sees me as somebody who needs her help and advice every time I open my mouth. I have so many problems with her that I will not go into further detail for the sake of making this easy to read.

So, because of my feelings toward her, I have done the bare minimum to remain civil and somewhat normal with my family. This includes saying things like 'hello' and 'good morning', and answering her when she addresses me, yet I never seek her out, or have friendly discussions with her. Basically, I pretend she is not there unless I am forced to interact. I should make it clear that our relationship has not always been this way, but after years of dealing with her and the problems she has caused, I can't bring myself to feel or act differently. My treatment of her seemed to be going fine, as things were fairly peaceful.

So here's what happened: 

Last night she called a family meeting with me and my dad, for which I had to leave a dinner with friends for. It was not so much a meeting as a full on attack on me, the way I conduct myself, and how I am not pulling my weight in this family by making her feel safe and welcome in our home. I was being treated as though I was openly disrespectful to her, or even violent. My dad told me that I need to stop disrespecting his wife or else I cannot live in this house. They both took turns saying insulting things to me, about how I am ungrateful and need to grow up and account for myself. I don't feel that I have done anything wrong, and I am really insulted by what they had to say. It is hard for me to accept the idea that I am the problem. I don't understand the approach they took with me, and how they could expect to finish the meeting with no hard feelings. I cannot change the way I feel about her, and this meeting has only made me hate her more. My other issue is with if I decided to do what they say and be friends with her, how could it ever be taken seriously, as it would be fake and forced. 

I am incredibly frustrated, and thinking about what my options are. I can either do what they say and treat her like a friend, or move out completely and become independent, which I feel capable of doing. I am renting a room in an off campus house, but I am home for the summer because I have an internship nearby and need access to a car. I think I should be able to become completely independent without too much trouble. So, should I swallow my pride and make peace with two completely delusional people, or should I drop everything and leave? Sorry for the long post, although I could make it ten times as long with details, I hope that I have explained enough."

uzhtd,3,2012-06-13,"After a few seemingly hopeless and daunting set of events in the past few months, I seem to be having the most fortunate month in quite some time.",WhoDoIThinkIAm,happy,https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/uzhtd/after_a_few_seemingly_hopeless_and_daunting_set/,"I approached my last set of finals knowing that regardless of what happened, I had to attend school for one more semester with more than the 18-hour limit of classes than the 4 years I had expected.  That puts a lot of pressure on me to do well on finals.

First, I was offered an internship during my first final.  My entire job in the presentation was to keep my mouth shut and I did so.  During the question and answer session afterwards, though, it seemed as if my ideas really wowed them.  I was pulled aside and discretely told that if I was interested in interning, they'd be happy to have me.  Unfortunately, when I attempted to get in contact with them afterwards, they said their position had been filled, but I was welcome to join during the fall.

The rest of my finals went great with my lowest grade being a C, which was actually much better than I was expecting and my highest being an A+ which I have never received as a final grade.

Next, my first car, a hand-me-down, 11-year-old Lexus, had begun to randomly violently shake, lose traction, and become all-around unsafe for me to be in.  Although the problem was fixed, my parents had realized that this was the straw that broke the camel's back.  They had spent too much money over the years on that car and it was time to trade in.  Although my new car sounds like a step down from a 2001 IS 300, I'm very happy with my new Versa.  The MPG is great and has a ton of features I was missing, not to mention I don't feel as anxious driving it, considering the massive cost difference, but I won't turn this into a Versa commercial, I'm just happy that it worked out.

Shortly after finals ended, my macbook pro of 1 or 2 years stopped taking a charge(the remaining battery cycles had reached 0).  I took it into the genius bar, knowing I was safely inside my warranty timeline.  I gritted through the drive that was about an hour longer each way than it should have been as my local Apple store was closed for renovations.  After waiting for around 45 minutes, I was told that I had liquid damage(it took me a few minutes, but I remembered what caused it-not me, but a klutz from a few months prior) and although the battery was able to be replaced, they could not return my computer with a new battery without charging me for repairs(I had immediately dried my computer, started using what I call a ""keyboard condom"" and kept it safe, and there were never any problems in performance) which would total $1200.  I walked out, thinking I was sans computer, which I saw as needed for someone who wants to get into advertising, not to mention a student.  However, my good friend offered to build me a brand new computer from scratch without limiting me to OSX.  Using $200 less than the cost of the replaced MBP, he built me a mini-super computer(16GB of Ram, TB of memory, and the dual-slot video card which was able to run skyrim and assassin's creed 2 simultaneously with almost no blur).

After a few years of cycling between loneliness and futile attempts to create a romantic relationship, I made friendly conversation with a gorgeous Subway employee who had caught my eye.  She made a damned good sandwich while giving me some sort of feeling that I needed to talk to her again.  I came back a week or so later(trying to seem nonchalant) and she suggests I come back on a weekday morning since she works every weekday and there are fewer customers, which I thought implied she wanted to talk to me personally.  I came back another week or so later as the only customer in the store.  I couldn't see her in the front, so I was wondering to myself if I should ask another employee if she had called in sick or something until she popped her head out of the back and waved.  We shot the shit a little, nothing too personal.  Once I was done eating, I tried to gather my nerves to ask for her number, but couldn't do it(That would have been my first time to ask).  As I got up from my chair, she told me not to go just yet, called me over to the register, and wrote her number on the back of the receipt, swearing she doesn't do this often.

To make a long story a little shorter, that was 2 fridays ago.  I didn't know before our first date that she had a three-year-old son and a few months ago, that might have turned me away, but my willingness to see where things led allowed me to meet this amazing kid that is impossible not to love.  This part might sound dishonest, but I love that I'm proving myself wrong when I say that I portrayed this adventurous personality who loves the outdoors and physical activity when before her, I might have spent half a day online gaming, smoking cigs(a pack a day at the worst), pot(if I could afford it) and drinking alone to excess(not that there's anything wrong with that).  But now that I've met her and given that impression, it's like my life is starting to become what I said it was, which I've found is much better.  I've almost stopped smoking cigs(1 cig every 3 or 4 days at most), pot(For some reason I'm drug tested now that I have an ADHD medication prescription) and drinking(once every week or two, and usually not alone), I've started working out and I'm getting more active to play with Owen(I forgot how much energy a 3 year old could have).

Finally, just this past Monday, we shared our first kiss.  Not 30 minutes later, I walked into my first class for bartending school.

I apologize for the wall of text, but I feel ecstatic to be who I am where I am in life.  If you made it this far, thank you for taking out the time in your day.  

tl;dr: finals looked scary but I did pretty well.  My first car got dangerous, my parents bought a cheaper but better one.  My computer broke, my friend built a better one.  I was stuck in a rut romantically, I clicked with a girl at Subway and found out that she and her son are awesome people.  I had a sedentary lifestyle but told her that's not who I want to be, and the person I want to be is coming to me easier every day."
uz7i6,3,2012-06-12,Maybe I just need to vent.,hugeletdown,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/uz7i6/maybe_i_just_need_to_vent/,"Ok, here we go.

My grandfather died last easter. Both my parents were so busy when I was young I was basically raised by my grandparents (on both sides). I had exams around then and I fucked up. It was my first year at uni and I could retake without too much consequence.

This year things started ok, but went downhill fast. Nothing had gone well for me for a long time now (typical underachiever) and I started not doing work and just being apathetic overall. 

Recently, thanks to my dad, I managed to bag an internship over the summer. This really hit me and I realised how much of my university life I have thrown away. Exams are looming and I get more anxious every day, and more and more disappointed with myself for this year. With the amount of marks I have thrown away by not doing work, I am needing a very high average to merely pass.

During a phone call recently my dad heard the distress in my voice and turned up to chat with me. My whole family have always been so supportive of everything I do, even spending large amounts of money for me to go to a public school for a period of time when we were quite poor. I don't know how I can go about repaying my parents. I have been given every chance and I've failed them every time.

I haven't told anyone about this because I didn't want to be a burden. I wanted to be the guy that was mature and could handle everything, and be successful like so many others. Unfortunately it turns out I have been the most naive person around and I've lost a lot of confidence.

What do I do now?"

I've been watching a show where the protagonist breaks down and starts smoking (the Killing, it's a pretty good show) so that has something to do with it, but I think more has to do with a lot of guilt around something I did this weekend. 

So I've had a pretty big crush on a really cool girl I worked with last fall. I know her bf, and he's a really cool guy. Dude's a bartender in town and I've totally gotten the hook up from this guy.

All that confessed, I drank a bottle of wine tonight, broke down and just bought a pack of cigs and smoked one, soon to be two, and I feel like a total bastard.

Anyway, I'll attempt to re-add what I had before:

Hello everybody,

Unfortunately, my second computer that I ever built has recently broken. If this were 2-3 years ago, I would have attempted to fix it and bring it back to life. Unfortunately, as a college student with an internship and a waning interest in computers at the moment (though I am pursuing a similar path in college), I've decided rather than trash it / work on it, I would rather donate some parts to those in need.

Here's a little backstory before I get started; recently, the computer refused to boot up. My mother said (this was used for them), that they came back downstairs and one day it just wouldn't turn on. I replaced the PSU and video cards to no avail, so I narrowed it down to the motherboard as there was no POST error codes or warning beeps. As I took it apart, post throwing away the case and PSU, I decided I could just donate some of the parts as long as people are willing ot pay shipping. I have more computer stuff than just the computer that I will end up getting rid of, so I might update the post or start a new one as soon as things are organized.

For now, I will start with the RAM. It is a pair of OCZ nVidia SLi ready RAM: http://www.ocztechnology.com/ocz-ddr2-pc2-6400-sli-ready-edition-dual-channel-eol.html

They are DDR2-800 and they are 2 x 2 GB for a total of 4 GB. Like I said, they may actually end up being broken, but if you're willing to pay shipping and they work, they're obviously yours.

Next up is the HSF (sans F):

(Updated with pictures) http://imgur.com/a/eSagm

I believe it is a THermalright Ultra 120 Extreme HSF. Unfortunately, I don't have the 120mm fan, so it's just the Heatsink at the moment. It also only has the socket 775 adapter and the mounting screws (no backplate if it came with one). 

Please let me know if you're interested. I'd also love if they went to a place where someone would take care of the parts as they did, and still do, mean a lot to me.

Thanks :)"
uyxsm,5,2012-06-12,GRRRRR...,Recamen,MyLittleSupportGroup,https://www.reddit.com/r/MyLittleSupportGroup/comments/uyxsm/grrrrr/,"So uh, lemme start off by saying that... I think people who say that you don't need luck to be successful are full of shit.

Why, you ask? See, a month ago I was getting ready to graduate. I had a full-time job lined up with the company I'd worked with part-time over the past year. The supervisor liked me, my coworkers liked me - hell, one person there, a lead analyst, gave me a recommendation on LinkedIn. I was happy. Everything was alright.

...Then next Tuesday rolls around. ""Sorry, but ah... we had a budget miscommunication. Your position's been cancelled."" I feel like the rug was fucking yanked out from under me. Sure, the other intern who worked in the same group gets a position (albeit elsewhere), but I don't!? Don't give me that ""luck doesn't matter"" bullshit.

Since then, I've been throwing out a grand total of 48 applications over this past month. Of those, you'd think that companies would WANT a guy who worked his ass off through a Master's program in Applied Mathematics WHILE WORKING PART-TIME FOR BOTH YEARS! You'd think that after the first year of being a statistical consultant for a whole bunch of thesis and dissertation students (and even one client from the nearby medical center!) and after the second year of working for said company above, I'd be set! WRONG, WRONG, WRONG. Sure, I get callbacks, maybe some even lead to phone screen interviews. Hah! I had three such screens between last Thursday and Monday, and what do I get? ""..."", ""..."", and ""Oh no, because you screwed up on ONE MEASLY PROBLEM you can fuck off.""

I'm just - maybe I'm overreacting. I realize it's only been a month, and there's plenty of time left, but I am beyond frustrated at the moment, and pretty much all on my own, and add it all up, and I'm not quite right in the head. No, I'm not a danger to anyone, but I can't think straight. I just feel like... like it's pointless! I sent out all these online applications, contacted people back if they didn't get back to me, and for what? Nothing! And this lease ends in August, and what then? I wind up living back with my parents? God, that would just crush me! I didn't go through six fucking years of school just to wind up back with my fucking parents and be put through all this bullshit!

And I can't help but feel like someone out there, somewhere, is lifting a giant bird to my face and jacking off to my anger. It-it's just... argh! It all makes me so furious, and I feel like all I'm doing with all these online applications is wasting time. It'd be great if I could do some actual, face-to-face networking, but I don't even know where to start. I'm going into my former university's career center on Thursday, but that involves waiting, and I absolutely despise waiting. And I still feel like even the network I DO have is letting me down. It's just... this wasn't supposed to happen to me. Someone's fucking with me, and I want to find them and punch them in the face."

Anyway the farm at which I interned was one that raised 100% grass fed beef, in addition to ""free range"" laying hens and broiler chickens. (preface, this farm was heavily modeled on the familiar salatin method, so comparisons are appropriate)

I'll start with the beef.  The cows were rotationally grazed, and allowed 1-2 days on the pasture before they were moved.  The cows had great health, and great physical stature.  I see grain supplemented cows on pasture near my house and they are lethargic and don't seem to graze as much, as a result of the grain satisfying their caloric desire.(this is a trend i noticed much more prominently with the chickens)  These cows were active and during moves and transfers to new pasture they would run and buck and expend all kinds of energy.  It was really entertaining to watch.  The pastures were allowed to recover fully before the cows returned, some to where the grass was up to shoulder height, of varying density, but always enough to keep the cows satisfied.  If they were reaching outside the fence line consistently, we knew it was time to rotate.  While this keeps them from lingering around their own manure for too long, it didn't entirely keep the cows free from disease.  Cows have a terrible lack of awareness when it comes to their bowel movements and it was not uncommon to see brown streaks down the side of cattle, and very rarely cases of eye infections, which i believe were comparable to pink eye, as a result of fecal matter getting in there.  However in all, the health of the heard was spectacular. It was not uncommon, so they informed me, to go a season with no losses due to health issues, although it had happened.  The cows were also fed a kelp mineral supplement, a salt supplement and another vitamin mixture.  Can't comment too much on the nature of that.

The Chickens and laying hens.  This is where i feel the community may benefit.
The laying hens were brown heritage varieties, and were allowed free range during the day time and penned in a mobile coup at night( yes this is very similar to the salatin method)  The laying hens were given 24/7 access to a grain/soy based feed.  This is what made me stand back and begin to look at things objectively.  At first I imagined foraging birds eating lots of bugs, however the reality of the situation is a bit more variable.  Often the birds spend large portions of the day inside the coup, or underneath seeking shade, forgoing the opportunity to forage.  Not to say some birds aren't very active and foraging, however it is not uniform.  It is safe to say that the persistent presence of supplemental feed diminished the desire of the hens to forage.  In this respect, i had higher expectations.  This was reflected in the overall health of the laying hens.  Deaths and illness were more common than in the cattle, but less so than in the meat birds.  It was expressed to me by the farmers that the feed seems to leave a lot to be desired and could be a cause for illness. What i've learned, and what i was originally suspicious of, is that birds labeled ""free range"" still strongly resemble factory raised eggs and chickens, in that the majority of their diet is grain/soy based and high in PUFA.  While forage may contribute to a more balanced quantity of polyunsaturated fats, i fear it may not be what most of us hope for.  Some would consider this nit-picky, and i myself feel it is as well, however i don't want to shun the opportunity for progress just by being placated by the ""free range"" title.  

The broiler chickens.  These birds were the standard cornish cross, meat specific birds.  They would receive large batches of several hundred chicks, days after birth and raise them in a confined room until they were big enough to pasture.  The broiler room, they called it, was required to be kept at a warm temperature, and the method for doing this, much to my dismay, was with propane burning lamps.  I was slightly concerned about the issue of burning large quantities of propane in a sealed room( about this i would love to hear more discussion, in addition to the possible nutritional shortfalls of a solely grain based diet for birds. ex: do they have the same requirements for SFA as we do?).  I would not have been so concerned, had it not been routine to wake up and find 5 or 10 dead chicks in the morning, out of a batch of several hundred.  I have heard it said that the cornish cross is a breed with which you can expect those kind of losses.  Their feed, from birth was also a standard grain/soy combo, and i feel this may have contributed to the losses.  When they were finally out on pasture in the salatin inspired cages, they were packed about 45 chickens in a square about 12x12 feet.  This was another concern.  At each move, which occurred daily, the chickens would have access to fresh greens and however many bugs can be found on a 12x12 patch of pasture.  However they were also given 24/7 access to the grain supplemental food, which for many of the birds altogether eliminated their inclination to forage.  It's also important to note, that as the chickens matured, and the space grew more limited, so diminished the quantity of forage per bird, and so increased the accumulation of waste.  Often by morning the square was caked thick with waste, in which the birds lingered through the night.  Casualties were not uncommon as a result of general illness.  It should be noted that these birds, upon harvest, carried a sizeable visceral fat deposit, more reminiscent of a factory farmed bird than a wild bird.  

I know this is not news to most people, that farms fall anywhere on a spectrum in terms of their dedication towards profit seeking or market vaibility, versus their desire to create the highest quality product.  I really hope to prompt more discussion of the differences in the market, to make people aware that sometimes the ""free range"" title is not what the label hopes to convey, and to acquire input on what people feel the ideal diet is for poultry, based on the assumption that foraging for bugs and greens can only fulfill a certain percentage of nutritional and caloric requirements for poultry or pork.  Does anyone have any studies in a similar vein to the tokelaun study, where they observe the effect of diet on the end composition of poultry/pork/(even beef, as it would be nice to be able to enjoy a marbly steak without the pufa concern)  I remember reading that their pork was unusually low in PUFA as a result of their feeding tubers as a primary calorie source.  

TLDR open discussion about best livestock rearing practices, staple feed crops and the quality of the final product."

You know the story:  ""I just moved here from a place blah blah blah no real crime blah blah.""  

I live in the Mt. Pleasant area, and the locals here don't seem very intimidating or threatening.  But by locals, I'm guessing mostly Hispanics of different types with a sprinkle of white and black folk.  Though, sometimes there looks like a sketchy type of person.

Unfortunately, due to my work (having a job is fortunate, though!) I always look professional with nice shoes.  It makes me look like I have money, and therefore, I think, a target.  Hopefully I just come off as an unpaid intern, though.  

What I'm doing so far:
1.  Minimize pulling out my smart phone.  It's in an otterbox, so it looks like an older iPhone.  

2.  Keep my eyes to the ground, not making eye contact.

3.  Have an angry-face/""I'm not in the mood for shenanigans"" face.  

4.  Not look like I just moved here/am a tourist.

5.  Not go out at night on rarely traveled streets.  I tend to go only where there's lots of people walking, and I'm not out very late.


I keep reading around on safety, and the general consensus is ""don't be a moron and you'll be okay.""  Well, instructions on not being a moron seem pretty vague to a person who's never really had to worry about being mugged.  

Is there anything I'm missing?  Or is what I have incorrect?"

What happened?",CookiesandCandy,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/v3fuy/redditors_what_are_your_unrealized_or_failed/,"When I was 10 my family took me to New York City and on a tour of 30 Rock. It was the best day of my life, and the day I decided I wanted to work in television. I spent my life working toward getting back to NBC. I bought my first camcorder at 12, worked in the newspaper in middle school, and took Video Journalism in high school. My senior project was a video yearbook. I moved to Washington, DC for college and majored in Media Studies in college, holding internships at CosmoGIRL! Magazine (lots of video and web content), CNN, a film festival, and a production company.

In 2009 everything started going south. I had another internship at Sesame Workshop I had to turn down because of graduation (no one's fault, just disappointed that another great love went unfulfilled), and an unofficial job offer at CNN was rescinded because of the bad economy causing a hiring freeze. No one else was hiring, either. I submitted my resume to the page program but never heard back.

Around the same time, I fell in love and when I didn't immediately get a job I moved back to North Carolina, since I could at least be happy with him while I looked for work. I applied everywhere - I didn't care where I went, he promised to go with me. About 10 months after graduation, after nothing but retail work, I was finally able to get a job at an amazing local news station. After about a year of working there I applied again to the page program. I was completely willing to leave my loved one to go to New York to follow my dream. He could follow me there - I was always more ambitious than him.

But the page program never happened, and I was unable to support myself on the minimum-wage rate I had at the television station. So I left, taking a salaried position in the sales department of a publisher.

It just hit me last night that I'll never be a page - I'm getting a bit old for it, and now I've spent about a year out of the TV business. I'll probably never live or work in New York like I had dreamed my whole life. I have a great life anyway, so I'm not terribly upset, but I'm definitely mourning the lost dream. I did everything right, but it can't work out for everyone.

She's definitely already disappointed and discouraged because she was not able to land an internship with a major studio, as a result of the senior portfolio reviews (or whatever you call them).  So now she's looking for basically any job, and the job market is already as shitty as it is, much less for someone with a degree in art/illustration.  She's gets more and more discouraged each day she does not get a desirable response to a job application.

Whenever I talk with her, it ends up going back to the topic of ""I paid $100K to go to this school, and I havent gotten any response from companies.  This school was a scam, they should have given us more help and informed us of companies that are hiring blahblahblah."" 

I personally find this to be a very self-entitled attitude, HOWEVER I do feel for her at the same time, and I remember what it was like when I was job-searching as well.  I remind her to keep searching, don't be discouraged, you will find the right place, don't take it personally, job searching sucks, etc.  But it doesn't seem like shes in a place to hear these things, and just wants to stay negative.  She's only been out of school for about a month, and has already been talking about how she may need to change careers, or go back to school for a second degree.

Any have any tips on how to help a friend not get so discouraged?"

v31yn,0,2012-06-15,"[Was told to post this here]Known this girl for about six months, need an outsiders opinion on the situation.",[deleted],dating_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/v31yn/was_told_to_post_this_hereknown_this_girl_for/,"I (22) met this girl(21) last October at a dinner function, I barely said Hi to her and the next day she added me on facebook. We started to chat and we hung out in a group of friends twice before she left for holidays/home for about 3 months. In this time we continued to chat on facebook amounting to approximately 2500 messages exchanged between us. 

The highlights of this exchange in chronological order:
* She invites me to come and visit her on holiday, I decline (a) I can't afford it (b) I don't feel comfortable doing that as I don't know her well enough at this point.
*She came back briefly for an interview she had for an internship, and we got to see each other at a friend's party. I was nervous as hell and also intimidated by her. While I was conversing with someone she comes over and asks if you want to come with her to a friend of hers at a slightly different location in the party. She then asks me to hold her drink, which I do, then asks me to hold her phone; I cannot as I am holding her drink and also my own, so she slips her phone in my shirt pocket, links arms with me and begins walking to her friend. On the way I say jokingly ""Did you just make me your bitch?!"". She responds with ""You love it..."". When we walk over to the friend seconds later she says ""So you two just met at that dinner and fell in love?!"", I thought this was very forward but obviously this girl had been talking about me to her friend with romantic intentions. I decided to play along and say ""how can you not"" while gesturing at the girl. Her friend then goes on about her mess of a dating life and how she is taking a break from the scene, to which the girl, who is right next to me says ""Oh I don't want to date anyone for like a year"". I don't say anything. They then immediately decide to go and hang out with some more friends and the girl says for me to come a long. I don't go with them and just socialise with other guests of the party until I have to leave early without saying good by to anyone since my friend got in a fight and we decided it was best to leave. She calls me the next day with the topic of how she didn't get to say goodbye to me, I was upset and I think my tone conveyed that, only pleasantries were exchanged and we hung up.
* She goes back on holidays so that chat continues, about after two weeks after she leaves she asks me to come visit her. I decline (a) I don't know her well enough to burden her with my own entertainment (b) I can't afford it.
*After new years she tells me about how she is feeling down about one of her exes and I console her about it. I feel like at this point I was seen as more of a friend, which is fine, but sudden and thus felt rejected, but clearly this girl had stuff to work through.
*I ask what she is doing, she tells me that she is telling the guy she drunkenly made out with at new years that she only wants to be friends.
*About a few weeks before she comes back she tells me how she doesn't want to date anyone for six months. At this point it is clear that I am only her friend, but it still felt as though the door might be open for me in the future.
*When she comes back she says we should go clubbing, I cannot as I was sick at the time, but also I admittedly had a hard time adjusting my feelings for her.


So before her birthday party, which I was already well aware of and had rsvp'd, she calls and asks if I was coming, perhaps because I hadn't really kept in touch as I was back at uni and also because I was trying to readjust.

When I get to the party she seems slightly nervous around me, and this is a very social girl, so it was unusual for her to be like this. I still don't know what to make of it.

We then chatted on facebook occasionally for a few weeks before we organizes a dinner with a few friends, which did not go well as I didn't speak at all. But she was trying to get me to talk anyway. As we walking back to the station she linked arms with me again, she is generally a touchy person so I didn't think much of it.

Two weeks later I meet her and her friends for some drinks, during which she lets on that she is seeing someone and also implied that she had slept with him(I may be wrong about the last part, not sure). As I am leaving she gives me a tighter hug than normal, which made me think that she must know something about the way I was feeling.

A few days later she impulsively throws a houseparty, I attend, she had invited the person she was seeing but he had plans with his family. I didn't really talk much with her and had generally good time socialising.

Few days later she initiates a chat on Facebook and we discuss the anecdotes of the house party, I tell her I was glad she invited me and that I was glad that it happened. She initiates chats with me approximately once a week for the next three weeks, then suggests a group dinner because she hadn't seen me 'in so long'. On the night I ask if its still on, she says she forgot and thought it was tomorrow, we reorganise for tomorrow but she cannot make it as she lost her bank card. We talk generally for a bit on the night of the dinner.

A few days later I post a picture on facebook of a beverage I made at home, this beverage is also one that the girl claimed to love. She then jokingly posts about how I should of made her one. Then invites me to meet her at a club for some drinks as a few of our friends are going there anyway. When I meet her she says she wants one of those drinks that i posted on my facebook; bewildered, I suggest to her that she make it herself, to which she retorts I want you to make it. The rest of the night she is blatantly flirting with me, I was flattered enormously, but also upset, I felt like a doormat, I don't know whether or not I am justified in feeling this way or not.

What I want to know is this girl flaky? Is she just going to hurt me when she has gotten what she wanted from me? Am I wrong for feeling like a doormat.

TL;DR Has life given me a lemon? If so can I make lemonade with it, that won't leave a sour taste?"

And over these study sessions, id begun to develop a crush on her.  We never hung out outside of that though.  We'd had tentative plans to go see a movie together, but those kinda fell through because of finals. 

During that week, I told her that I'd be going to Albuquerque for an internship, and she said that ""I should come visit you there!"".  I had thought she was joking at the time, but it turns out she was not.  I got a text from her the other day asking about hotels, and two days after that, she had bought her ticket.

I have trouble believing she has any kind of romantic feelings for me, mostly because this girl has seen me at my absolute worst. Unshaven, wearing dirty clothes, half asleep, etc.  But at the same time, there's a lot of evidence suggesting she does.  For example, she talks to her mom about me quite a bit.  She even told me her mom thinks I'm handsome.  And just yesterday she was lamenting the fact that I ""didn't give her a hug before I left"".

So how can I make sure we have a good time together?  I'd love for this to turn into something romantic, but I've never been too good at those sorts of things.  Any advice?

I'm a 26/M and she is a 26/F, we started dating last year when she was on exchange from Germany for the year, while she was here I organised an internship for her to come back to Australia in 6 Months time. After I organised that. I got a job 4000km away on a 2 year contract, so even when she get's back I'm still a 4 hour flight away.

Because of this we both said let's just see what happens as having two years with minimal contact is a big ask on any relationship. We've been apart for nearly 6 months now and she gets back to Australia in August.

I 've been waiting for her this whole time and we've stayed in contact through out this period and we were planning when to see each other again ect. I asked her where everything was going as I missed her and didn't understand were I stood with her.

A week later she sent me an email saying that I had hurt her a number of times last year and she doesn't want me to wait for her, when we talked she then said she doesn't love me or see a future with me.

She says this was based on her looking back at our relationship and seeing that what we had wasn't love. We did have a few issues when we were together which I thought we had worked through, she is now saying that is wasn't enough. I don't understand how she can complely change how she feels about me.

I poored my heart out to her in an email and tried to explain the issues she was concerned with from my perspective and what she was thinking wasn't my intentions, I apologised for any pain that I caused her last year even if it wasn't intended. In the end she said all she can offer me is, when she sees me again if she feels something then maybe.

I fell like that's a huge amount of pressure to have on me as I'm only going to be able to see her for max 1 week and it seems as if she has been playing a select few bad things over and over again in her head.

How do I show her the person she loved from the other side of the world? How do I show the issues that she has had in the past with our relationships won't be an issue in the future? Finally How do I show that the person that she currently thinks I am isn't how I was in our relationship or how I will be in the future?


Edit: I'm afraid that I will hold on to this feeling of hope that when we see each other, she'll want to be with me again.  When ever I've had a relationship end. I've never been able to accept that it is over and move on, I've always held on to a hope that I'll find a way to fix the issues? So I guess my question has two parts, how do I save the relationship and if it can't be how do I move on from her how do I not hold on to the hopw that I can save it.
Thanks

v2rv7,5,2012-06-14,I'm interested in a girl at work. . . ,nobody2000,askagirl,https://www.reddit.com/r/askagirl/comments/v2rv7/im_interested_in_a_girl_at_work/,"I will do my best to keep it concise, but detailed. 

Also, please ignore the fact that we're at work. The company is fine with intra-office romances, and we currently work far enough apart that post-relationship ugliness (if it ever got there) would only be a minor inconvenience. My particular role never crosses into her territory. 

1 year ago(ish), while I was an intern, our company (huge company) hired a girl to our department as an intern. I'm in Marketing, she's in Finance. 

Her first day was on the day that the HR dept. had a company cruise on the river. She sat with me and some of the coworkers, but it was mostly her and I that talked. 

Next day all my coworkers mentioned how we had hit it off, and that she was cute (she is). I had avoided relationships for a while and I recently decided that it was time to explore the possibility again (took a hiatus from dating due to shitty relationship).

So I did what you're supposed to do. Stop by her desk and chat her up. Asked her about what she was working on, talked about my stuff...just continued the conversation. 

I did this for a number of days when I realized ""Fuck this, I feel like I'm spinning my wheels, she oughta stop over and talk to me."" She didn't, so I figured that maybe she just wasn't interested. . .

As the months went on, I stopped visiting so frequently. I'd stop by to say hi and shoot the shit maybe once a month whenever I was thinking ""I gotta talk to her."" 

Down the line, they moved my desk 2 down from her, and that was cool. We talked more often about stuff, but this one dude another department chatted her up a lot. 

I Kinda put 2 and 2 together, and realized what was going on. Kept it friendly, but kinda realized that she must've been into uncomplicated men (this dude is . . . super uncomplicated. . . if I have to put it in a PC way). 

By November 2011, I kicked the ""intern"" label, and now I'm a full blown associate. 

By March 2012, I've dated numerous women casually and started getting serious with another - who dumped me. While talking it over with some of the ladies at work, I casually mentioned ""Is finance intern single?""

I learned that not only was she single, but she wasn't seeing the fella from the other department ever. She DID have a boyfriend in the previous months, but she dumped his ass. 

So I resumed my ""crush"" and I had no choice but to not be a fucking idiot here. I started talking her up - daily. Good conversation and all that. Learned she was applying for a job in the department. Nice!

So I cockily told her the news she wanted to hear - ""Everyone loves you, the old VP talked to me and spoke very highly of you (she did), they wouldn't have to train you, you'll get it.""

And so I offered ""You and I will celebrate when you get this job."" As she questioned herself and her confidence waned, I told her ""Don't let me jinx you, we're going to celebrate your first paycheck.""

This is really risky stuff. What if she didn't get the job???

Sure enough, she got the job. 

I didn't see her in the office, so I emailed her ""Congrats blah blah, I told you I was right, I'm always right."" (she knows I'm joking around). 

She replies: ""Thanks, I'm just nervous of all the work I'll have to do. . . we have to go out and celebrate my first paycheck!""

So that brings us to today. . . 3 or 4 paychecks past when we were supposed to go celebrate. I mostly blame logistics - she's been pulling 12 hour days, I've been pulling 10-12 hour days, been busy on fridays. It sucks (I can't even go out with friends or other dates because of this shit - being in a band AND pulling a 50-60 hour work week blows). 

***

You have the story from my perspective, and I am honest about the whole thing. I'm not a looker - 26, a little bit balding, dry skin (dermatits), and overweight, but I've ditched 30 lbs since the beginning of 2012, so I'm really not looking too bad (could always lose more). I'm very charming, smart, funny, and actually great in bed (when every girl you're with gets to see the back of her orbital bone because her eyes roll back that far, you don't need to be told you're good). 

I do have a confidence issue sometimes. I don't trust others when they praise me. I was recently asked by another coworker I'm close with why I wasn't together with this girl already. 

**TL;DR I'm 26, she's 25, Been flirting on/off for a year. Both went from interns to full-associates. I feel like I'm more interested than she is. I also am mostly a prize in terms of brain and personality. Looks need work that I'm providing them as best I can**

1.)Would you say that she's interested in me from this? I only ask because I've offered opportunities here and there to take the lead, and  she's only taken the one ""we gotta celebrate"". My other female friends (not from work) tell me that it will make her day when I ask her this. Are they correct?

2.) Is this the type of thing that I'm better off exploring as friends with no outward romantic intentions and let it get there in time if it's supposed to? (again, ignore the fact that we ""sorta"" work together)

3.) Do I need to just bite the bullet and flat-out ask her to drinks some Friday? She sits in a crowded part of the office, and I just don't want to ask her there because it's not anyone else's business but ours. I'm tempted to shoot her an email, but that's lame. Thoughts?

4.) What other thoughts might you have? 

Thanks!"
v2m4q,2,2012-06-14,Looking for a roommate for the summer,damillionthkim,UCSD,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSD/comments/v2m4q/looking_for_a_roommate_for_the_summer/,"We're looking for a female for one side of a double, which will be priced at $415 a month. You will be sharing a room with another girl, so females are strongly preferred (Sorry guys. That's how it goes). The side is unfurbished, so hopefully you have a bed or a desk. If not, our rooms are carpeted and we have a living room, so no worries there. 

We're located at La Scala, so its super close to the bus/shuttle stops to take you to school or anywhere. We've got a pool, a gym, and an office center where you can get access to free printing. Also within walking distance to Ralphs/Trader Joes, so food needs are easily met here. Move in date is on July 1, and you'd have to move out around Sept 8th. 

A little bit about us: one student (lit major) going to summer school at UCSD, one doing a computer-science-y internship, and another that works from home. We're all easygoing, relatively quiet, and pretty chill, so it'd be nice to have someone that fits this profile as well :) Also if you like board games, that's a plus! 

This is perfect for UCSD students who are looking for summer housing or anyone who needs temporary housing. And that want to avoid the BS of Craigslist. Feel free to message me if you're interested, we'll set up a meeting and what not. "
v2lv8,1,2012-06-14,Long distance Girlfriend told me she doesn't Love me anymore,spaceman86,BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/v2lv8/long_distance_girlfriend_told_me_she_doesnt_love/,"I'm a 26/M and she is a 26/F, we started dating last year when she was on exchange from Germany for the yer, while she was here I organised an internship for her to come back to Australia in 6 Months time. After I organised that. I got a job 4000km away on a 2 year contract, so even when she get's back I'm still a 4 hour flight away. 

Because of this we both said let's just see what happens as having two years with minimal contact is a big ask on any relationship. We've been apart for nearly 6 months now and she gets back to Australia in August. 

I 've been waiting for her this whole time and we've stayed in contact through out this period and we were planning when to see each other again ect. I asked her where everything was going as I missed her and didn't understand were I stood with her. 

A week later she sent me an email saying that I had hurt her a  number of times last year and she doesn't want me to wait for her, when we talked she then said she doesn't love me or see a future with me. 

She says this was based on her looking back at our relationship and seeing that what we had wasn't love. We did have a few issues when we were together which I thought we had worked through, but I don't understand how she can complely change how she feels about me. 

I poored my heart out to her and tried to explain the issues she was concerned with from my perspective and what she was thinking wasn't my intentions. In the end she said all she can offer me is to say when she sees me again if she feels something then maybe.

v2lk6,0,2012-06-14,Preparing for Internships,HerpMasterFlex,AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/v2lk6/preparing_for_internships/,"Fairly common question I imagine, however I may not be using the correct search terms, my google-fu is lacking. 

Intro: High school student, going to an engineering college with few basic pre-req courses complete. Studying Computer Engineering, hoping for a minor in Economics. 

Question: It is common knowledge that freshmen internships are hard to come by, and things don't start getting ""interesting"" until Junior year, when the pre-requisite course work applicable to the position is completed. What I would like to know is what should I do to prepare for the various tasks ahead for internship application. Are there any specific materials I should be going over in preparation for the various interviews? Starting a collection of any projects I'm working on when I go to college for presentation. I realize this varies greatly from job to job, but I'm not sure where to start. Anything that I should specifically work on that will help me from the get go? Any adjunct material I should cover on top of my coursework that will give me a clear advantage or distinguish me from other candidates. 

What I know to do or have done: 
- Visit the career webpage of my university
- Prepare and revise a resume 
- Create a LinkedIn Account 
- Got to the career services office often, and meet with an occupation counselor 
- Go to career fairs held at the university
- Visit prospective company internship pages and understand the requirements for each position
- As with above: watch any supplemental material for preparation for internships
- Maintain a 3.0 GPA. 

Prospective companies I've thought about (of course this list will change, I'm just giving my naive and inexperienced look into a very competitive field which is engineering internships): 
- Freescale
- Marvell Corp
- Micron
- Texas Instruments
- Qualcomm
- Intel
- Nvidia
- AMD
These are highly competitive fields, I don't expect to land a position without proper preparation. Obviously, this isn't all the companies with internships for Computer Engineering. I don't have access to the internships board at my university (maybe I haven't looked correctly), so this is prior to actual ""investigation"" 


I'm rather ignorant in this regard and appreciate any help in this matter provided by fellow redditors. Thank you for your help. "

v5ksa,0,2012-06-16,"[20/m] Ok internet strangers, I can't get over her [20/f]",soupisgreat,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/v5ksa/20m_ok_internet_strangers_i_cant_get_over_her_20f/,"Rewind 2 and a half years to senior year of high school. We dated for about 9 months. Everything was great. When it was time to leave for college I stupidly told her that it probably wasn't a good idea to continue the relationship even though she was all for it. We went to schools that are about 4 hours away from each other and I didn't feel that a long distance relationship would work well. Neither of us had the means or time to get to each others' schools to visit. 

So we broke up. Despite this, we talked/Skyped almost every day that first semester. She even came with her dad to visit me one weekend. During our 5 week winter break through the next summer we hung out and had sex quite often. During these times I asked her repeatedly to date me again. I really loved being with her and I felt that we could work through the distance. She refused. I feel that she was extremely hurt by me breaking it off before that first semester of college. It was not my finest hour. 

When this school year (2011-2012) started, she said that we could be friends because she ""really cared about me"" and ""doesn't want to lose [me]."" So we'd text each other frequently. I started to feel that she was becoming distant but I'd keep texting her. When the last winter break came around I took her to dinner, the movies, and lunch several times. We'd have fun but if I ever tried any time of intimacy, holding hands, hugging, kiss on the forehead, she'd pull away. Again I feel that this is some sort of punishment for breaking up with her a year and a half before. She always was willing to go and she even invited me to do a few things. 

So I once again asked her to date me again. This was towards the end of winter break [Mid-January 2012.] She got upset with me. She kept saying that ""we obviously can't be just friends."" So instead of dating me again she told me that we needed time apart. She said maybe a year or so of no talking. As a way to follow this through she blocked me on Facebook and wouldn't answer my texts. She even said ""Even if we were still dating I probably would have cheated on you."" I was stunned. This wasn't like her at all but she really knows how to hold a grudge. If it had any truth to it I don't know. This really hurt me but I accepted and we didn't talk.

That was 6 months ago. Since then I have only texted her once asking to catch up over lunch right when summer started. (Might not have been my best idea but I couldn't help myself.) Unfortunately she told me that she'd be staying at her school for the summer because of an internship. I wished her luck and we haven't spoken since. 

The problem is that I continue to think about her constantly. I have been with other girls (not dated,) but I still can't get her out of my head. Its been 1 and a half years since we actually dated and about 10 months since we were last intimate. Today I saw a picture of her on a mutual friend's Facebook. She was tagged but I obviously could not go to her profile because she had blocked me. This picture really tore me up because I haven't seen her since January and she was looking as beautiful as ever. I don't know what it is, but I can't get over this girl.

On a side note, she was absolutely amazing in bed. I've been with other girls since her but they don't even compare. This is definitely one reason why I continue to hold on to hope of getting her back but not the only one. 

Also, her mother adored me and still continues to text me once in a while asking me how I am. She obviously wants us back together but whenever she (her mom) brings it up to her she gets upset.

I now have a car at my school and I'd love to try and make it work but I don't know how to get to talking to her again. Should I even try?

**TL;DR** I have been on and off with my high school girlfriend. Mostly off now a days but I cant get her out of my head. Should I even try to rekindle that fire?"

v55kn,5,2012-06-16,I left my home town and now I'm completely alone in a new one,[deleted],socialanxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/v55kn/i_left_my_home_town_and_now_im_completely_alone/,"I just left my old city for a college internship out of town. I thought it would be a good idea to get some job experience in a different city. 

The problem is I want to be alone but I'm not. When I was looking for housing I signed up to live at a house with 4 other people. Its only been the first day and already I'm afraid to leave my room to go get breakfast. I wish I could see this place as a home but I feel like I'm trapped in my room and when I leave I'll be confronted by strangers.

The only two people I can say I would feel comfortable living with is my girlfriend and my old roommate/best friend back in my hometown. I need help. I have no where else to live but I want to avoid these people. But then on the other hand I don't want them to think I'm antisocial and never come out of my room. The feeling of not being at home in your home is killing me. I can feel all my old anxiety I thought I had under control rushing back and I just don't know how to deal with it.

EDIT: I finally made it downstairs for breakfast and one of the roommates was there. Made small talk. And I ate and came back up. I'm starting to consider keeping some food products in my room so I don't have to leave it so often."
v4y32,11,2012-06-16,Should I quit my internship?,KAMFlamenco,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/v4y32/should_i_quit_my_internship/,"Back in February, I was thrilled that, after numerous attempts of getting an internship, a utility company called me up for an internship and fast forward, I got the job.

At first, I was just happy enough that I will get some ""real"" life experience before I graduate (this upcoming December) so it will definitely boost up my resume (and it's nice to have a paycheck coming to your mail).

I applied as an part time electrical engineering in the GIS Dept. during spring semester. After few weeks later, however, it got really mundane and unchallenging (my work, I kid you not, consisted of drawing squares all day). I asked several times if I could do different task, but HR did not respond to my email until the very end of my termination. But I decided to stay with them because it was close to school, they were flexible with my schedule, and again, that small paycheck are what made stick with them for 14 weeks.

Now, after HR finally responded my email, she apologized and mentioned that there was a summer intern position (full-time) available and she sent me an email about it. It looked promising since it gave me a description of applying engineering skills (even though the pay rate was lower than my previous job, I value more on experience). So I applied and got the position.

Just after working in my new internship in my third week, I feel miserable. Here are the cons:

-My job ended up being as mundane and unchallenging as before. I basically just help organize files onto to computer. No engineering skills is really needed
-Prior to going there, my boss mentions that HR still wants me to the same task that I was doing during spring (why???)
-The facility is much further away from I school, so gas-wise, it's not helping (35 min drive vs 15 min drive)
-I am taking senior design this summer semester and I feel I should really spend more time on it than I am currently right now
-In addition, I should really spend time studying GRE (working full time really wears you out)
-Lower pay rate (significantly lower now that I've realized with tax included)
-no real engineering experience

The pros:

-Very laid back work environment
-I got my own office with a window (wooo!)
-A job is better than no job
-In the end, if I stick with them, I can possibly get a good letter of recommendation (I hope)

So what should I do reddit?

If I do end up quitting, I do not want to leave it in bad terms because I may use their resource when it comes down to reference and letter of recommendation in the future.

v4txm,12,2012-06-16,I'm single again after a 5 year relationship. I need some help.,breakUpHasShockedMe,BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/v4txm/im_single_again_after_a_5_year_relationship_i/,"My now ex girlfriend(21f) and myself(20m) have just broken up. We had been dating since we were 15. She knows my Reddit account and I don't want her to kick me anymore while i'm down. I need to vent, I have no one to turn to. If you don't want to read the story I understand but there are questions at the bottom I would really appreciate answers to! Here is the story:


It started in 7th grade(about 13 years old) when I met her. I was an extremely overweight kid. No girl had ever given me a chance to really talk to them at this point in my life, no girl would even look at me. She did. She gave me a chance, she rolled the dice and I still don't know why. From that day on I wanted to make sure she was happy. I had a crush from the first day I met her, but this girl was completely out of my league. We quickly became best friends from then on and I would give her advice on everything she struggled with, which was mostly guy problems. I was essentially friend zoning myself and I didn't even realize it because I was only in 7th grade. But I continued to be there for her through anything. This continued for about 2 years.


We get to high school and it's a new and exciting time. I have lost around 70 pounds from training to play football at this point. Our friendship is as strong as ever. Within the first month of high school she has her group of friends tell me that she likes me. I didn't believe it for a solid month, she had never given me signs of that. I thought this was a cruel joke that her friends were playing on me. I was thinking they just wanted me to ask her out so I would be embarrassed in front of everyone in the school. I mean... A GIRL wanted me? A GIRL had feelings for me? THE GIRL had feelings for me? Well after that month I grew a pair and asked her.


She said yes to my complete surprise. People thought it was a joke that she was dating me. From then on I made sure she was the happiest girl in the world. We would get made fun of everyday because of how attached we were. We would literally be holding hands the entire time we were together. She became my first kiss about 3 months into dating. I was too nervous to make the first move so she did. I had never been happier after that though.


Well after about a year she ""cheats"" on me. She kisses an ex boyfriend who I had given her advice on. It crushes me but we remained friends. I couldn't live without her. Me dating her made other girls curious about me. I had more girls texting me and calling me than I could believe after we broke up. I ""hook up"" with a few (if you can even call making out hooking up). About 5 months pass since we broke up. She apologizes in tears for everything.


We start dating again. We lose our virginity to each other during this time. But sadly the relationship only lasts for 3 months. A 21 year old who helped out the teacher in one of her classes started chasing after her. She apparently tells him everything and he convinced her that I was only dating her to get into her pants. He told her she was going to get hurt dating me. So she breaks up with me again.... And of course starts dating him.


Well we stop talking after that and she dates him for about a year. I still love her after all this time, I'm envious of what this other guy has that I don't. She comes crying back to me again after he breaks her heart. We get to know each other again. And me being the sucker I am took her back again.


This is when the real relationship begins. We were starting our 3rd year(junior year) in high school. We were both determined to make this work. About 10 months of us dating pass and something we were never ready for came up. She had gotten pregnant. We made the toughest decision in our lives to abort the baby. We both decided we couldn't provide the life a baby deserves. It cuts me deep but I have to stay strong for her. I still to this day carry around the ultrasound of the kid everywhere I go. It has been my inspiration to become a better person. No one besides us to this day knows about the abortion. After the abortion our relationship grows so much closer.


We continue to be the happiest couple throughout high school. We communicate, we laugh, we go on dates, I would get excited to see her texts and calls come in. High school finally ends and I get a summer internship offer at Google and 3 universities offering a full ride scholarship. The closest being a school about 2 hours away. She didn't perform too well in school so she decided to stick with community college in the town we had lived in. At this point we decide we were going to stay together throughout college. Because of this I decide to stay as close as possible. I go to the college that is 2 hours away.


This is where our relationship starts to strain. I move out for the first time with roommates I don't know. My original roommate was supposed to be a 27 year old bank teller. But he didn't really live well with others so I end up with the only other apartment they have open at the time. This apartment was co-ed. I was going to be living with 2 girls for my freshman year. Imagine my girlfriend's excitement when she heard this. I can tell she's hurting at this point. She wants to move in so bad with me but I didn't want to put her in a bad financial situation. I told her it wasn't worth the debt to get the same community college education 2 hours down the road. (I understand how dumb that sounds now but if we were truly staying together long term I wanted to keep us in good financial standing. I regret that decision still to this day.) I drive up each and every single weekend during the school year to see her. I wanted her to know I love her and cared about her. I still surprise her with dates and flowers. Over the summer I would stay at my parent's house and bring her lunch at work everyday.


We go another year of doing the same thing except I live alone this time. This next year we had planned to move in together. I still drive up every weekend in order to see her. And In order to show her I love her. Well because of this and because I have to keep a high GPA for my scholarship I don't and still don't have a social life in college. I work hard all week so that I don't have any homework left over for the weekend. Our relationship is still strong this entire school year.


This last month when summer started has been where it got bumpy. She starts to tell me she doesn't want to go to my school anymore. She wants to follow her dreams and go into fashion merchandising... This kind of saddens me but I tell her to go for it. Shoot for the stars. The problem is that the fashion school she wants to go to is 8 hours from my school. We definitely would have to have a long distance relationship at that point. No more seeing each other every weekend. This puts strain back on our relationship. I tell her I still completely support her with whatever she wants to do though. We have been dating continuously for one month short of 4 years now.


Well then comes the past few weeks. She starts to ignore my calls and texts. She bails on dates I had planned for her. I learn from a mutual friend that she has been hanging out with other guys in our group when she would tell me that she's sick and can't go out. This makes me saddened inside but I didn't know how to confront her about it. She becomes moody with me all the time. She doesn't know that I know what she has been up to.


Then this week comes. The week that has crushed me completely as a person. She tells me that she has fallen out of love with me. She doesn't get happy when she sees me anymore. She gets annoyed when she sees my face. She hates how I love to spend time with my family and that I am a mommy's boy. She tells me that she hates that I give my dog so much attention. She hates what I wear. She tells me she wants to see other people. She says that she has been in relationships all of her life and she doesn't even know who she is. She doesn't know if I'm the best she wants to see if there are better guys out there. She wants to make stupid decisions and live with them. She wants to hook up with a random guy and regret it. She wants to ""find herself"". And after that she ""finds herself"" we should get back together and get married. I told her things don't work that way. I'm not going to sit here and wait while she hooks up with a bunch of guys and then just take her back. You can't have your cake and eat it too.


Mind you this all came within a couple of days. She built all of this up and just exploded these past few days. I told her she needs to tell me these things and not let them build up like this. I can try to fix things but I can't fix everything at once. I've always been fine with her talking to other guys and making new friends. I never breached her privacy in any way. I trusted her. I loved her. I tried to continue to surprise her as much as possible. I took her out on fun dates. I loved to make her happy that was all I ever wanted since I met her. I had tried my hardest at that point to be the best boyfriend I could be.


For the last few days she tried to end everything over text. She didn't even try to do that with our shorter relationships. But I told her our friendship is worth more than that and she knows that. I couldn't just let an 8 year friendship end over a text.


Well tonight ended our relationship, but more importantly it ended our friendship.


We met up at the park where we first started hanging out 8 years ago. I hadn't seen her since a week ago. This part may sound weird but I had decided I wanted to end our relationship on a happy note not a sad one. I knew she was done with me it was inevitable at this point but I wanted her to look back and constantly wonder why our relationship and friendship ended. We went and got milkshakes and went ice skating like we were just on another date. It was a great time until it came time to say goodbye. I broke down. We hugged for a hour straight. We cried in each other's shoulders for a hour straight. We didn't say a word for that hour. After that hour of breaking down I gave her a piece of me, a piece of us, to keep. I gave her my inspiration to become a better person. I gave her the ultrasound of the baby we were supposed to have from almost 3 and a half years ago. She had no clue I had been carrying that around with me this entire time. I told her the story behind it. I told her how deeply cut I was by the abortion. I told her why I carry it around. I told her everything. I thanked her for being the girl that gave me a chance 8 years ago. We continued to cry for another hour in each other's arms. She told she had to go after those 2 hours. Before she left I told her to remember the ultrasound whenever she feels down. Whenever someone breaks her heart. Whenever she fails a test. Whenever she needs it. I told her to take care of it wherever she goes. We unexpectedly kiss and she heads home. I sat in the parking lot for 30 minutes before I could I even move. It's insane how something that has lasted so long can end so quick. I've sat here for a hour and a half typing this. Everything is so hazy right now. I'm going to miss her. I'm going to miss our relationship. But most of all I'm going to miss our friendship. I just want her to be happy again.


**My questions are:**



* I've realized I don't even know how to make new friends anymore. I don't want to stay in the same mutual group of friends as her. I know it will only hurt me and I'll never get over her that way... What do i do over the summer to make new friends? How do you even approach people without being creepy? I have a connection to get hundreds of baseball tickets to all the our local MLB team's games, would that be a good place to invite new people to try to make them become a friend of mine?


* Are there steps I should be taking right now to help this process?




* She has hurt me pretty bad this time. Should I be just completely ignoring her calls and texts?


* I need a new hobby to keep my mind off things. I'm open to any suggestions! Please let me know what you do in your free time and why you love it."

He told me he would text me early in the day so we had a chance to talk, and he didn't. When I texted him, he barely got out a reply and hasn't even responded since. Fuck that. I'm sorry you only have time for me when you're horny now. I love you, but I'm sick of having to defend you only to be treated like shit. What ever happened to you doing anything not to make me feel like a sex object? Guess words really are meaningless.

I love my mom but she just doesn't get it. She can't even say the word ""anxiety"". I'm sorry mom but I have an anxiety disorder. I get panic attacks. I have crying spells. Don't tell me that ""my down is someone else's up"" when I was told that I needed weekly therapy and to be put on medicine and you told me you didn't want that for me. I told you I didn't want to disappoint you, but at the same time I feel like you're not helping me, or letting me get the help I need. Which is hard to say because you're a great mom and you do so much but this is something you just refuse to accept, and I already felt like shit about it, and when you make it seem like less of a big deal than it is to me, I just feel worse.

I'm sick of not having a friend in the world to talk to about this. I'm sick of feeling like I burden everyone. I'm sick of feeling like nobody actually cares.

I hate that when I was a virgin, I was called prude and bullied. I hate that now that I'm not, the people who know give me judgmental looks and make me feel like a slut.

I hate that I graduated high school with over a 4.3 GPA, over 10 extra curricular activities and about 100 community service hours, a pretty decent SAT score, and great recommendations from my teachers. I'm rewarded with no merit scholarships, no scholarships at all actually, and started school in a year where there was no honors programs. Now that there are I feel like I got screwed out of it. I'm always one step away and then get screwed over. There were things I wanted to do in high school (TA, starting clubs, etc) that I couldn't do because my counselor either didn't know about them or didn't give me the right information. Now I'm getting screwed in college for not having prior experience, and living far away from anywhere that I wouldn't be able to intern anywhere or anything.

I'm just angry that I keep trying and seem to get nowhere. I feel betrayed by my family, friends, and school. I know that the answer is ""you have to start nowhere to get somewhere"", and I try and put on a happy face, but I feel like I've been doing it for years and it's gotten me nowhere. 

I'm sick of trying and just being one step too short. I'm always everyone's second. Never anyone's first. Second choice for a girlfriend, second choice for a best friend, second choice for opportunities, etc. Hell, my dad even had surgery and I heard him say to my mom that he was counting on my sister to help because he didn't think I would, even though I had already been helping him and have been helping him with stuff for over a month now.

Life is just way too frustrating.

tl;dr - Life screws you over and you have to just deal with it, I guess."

First time peacocking, too.",onlybuilt4cubanlinx1,seduction,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/v4hhd/fr_no_kclose_no_close_no_nothing_but_still_had_a/,"hey guys, i posted a few FRs already so this is my third (i think). i literally just got back about 20 minutes ago.

like the title says, i didn't actually get with anyone but i still had a great night. i'm kind of coming to terms with the fact that getting with girls shouldn't make-or-break my night, and if i had a good night regardless then it's still a good night. anyway, on with the FR

note: i wasn't peacocking til a bit later, so don't expect it from the start :P


* left student accomodation around 10pm, with about 20 other friends. met around 10 more on the way
* was an ""end of exam party"" at a club that we had prebooked tickets for, ~400 people from my university were going to be there (i haven't actually started my exams yet though, haha. start next week)
* got to the club around 10.30
* opened up a few sets outside, using some opinion openers
* some girls replied ""is that your pick up line?"" i wasn't sure how to reply but i just blurted out ""yeah, you're kind of getting of script, so can we get back to the question?"" 
* they weren't really responding that well, so i decided to leave them (is this the right thing to do? how else could i have approached this?
* went inside, pee'd, went outside for a smoke
* opened up a 2-set with my buddy, HB7 and HB9. both french, HB9 didn't speak much English. she was over for a few days visiting HB7 while HB7 was here doing an internship (i wasn't really too sure how to include this into the conversation. any hindsight ideas?)
* spoke to them for a bit, teased them about how little English they spoke. HB7 responded well, HB9 just occasionally laughed at stuff we said but didn't really contribute. her body language was pretty defensive (arms folded, kind of looking away)
* ended up speaking to them about the french football league and the french team in the Euro 2012. one of their friends came over, spoke to them in french. i got the feeling she was trying to get them to come back inside, but they responded in french and stayed out with us.
* my buddy was pretty drunk by this point and was saying some hilarious stuff, but i kind of got the idea that it wasn't really going to work out for us with them
* i decided to eject (""my legs are begging me to dance, try and have a nice night without me!"")
* left them, went inside
* met up with some other friends from my university, met a girl they were with a few of my friends (HB6)
* spoke to her, turns out she went to a school near the one that i used to go
* didn't stay too long with her as i kind of got the impression she was with this guy that was nearby
* left her, walked around the club. getting my dance on, was bumping into people i knew every 10 seconds. was great for my esteem, not going to lie. everyone was pretty happy to see me (""hey, how'd your exams go!?"" ""haven't even started yet, mate!"" they'd always laugh at this, haha""
* opened up random dancing sets, ""can you hold something for me?"", i'd offer them my hand and then twirl them around
* some girls seem pretty offended, others seemed to dig it. funny though, the ones that digged it were the ones that already had boyfriends who would always try and push me away instantly. shame, really.
* went with a friend to this part of the club which had this chemistry themed bar, got a pair of lab-goggles from the table. put them on
* went back, found the HB6 who i used to go school near. she was wearing this black top-hat that had glitter on it. asked her for it, she gave it
* started rocking the hat as well as the goggles
* was getting looks from everyone, i was loving it
* went back to dance floor
* walked past a 2-set. 2 x HB8
* smiled at them, they smiled back
* walked past them, one of them poked me so i turned around, ""hey, i'm telling my lawyer about that.""
* she laughed, wanted to get a photo of me and her from her friend. we did
* gave her my hand and the twirl. pulled her away to dance, she tried to pull her friend to come with but her friend left her with me
* we danced for a bit, she tried taking my hat. i tried to go for a kiss after a few seconds.
* she kept turning it down, my friends smacked my ass as they went past and i burst into laughter.
* she kind of left me after this, decided to leave the dance-floor with my friends
* went around the club, lots of high-fives from random people and people laughing at/with me at my ridiculous look
* i genuinely had no idea what to do with the attention
* lots of people re-greeting me after they had seen me before
* spent a solid 45 minutes in the queue buying a drink
* went back upstairs to one of the dancefloors
* HB8 that i danced with pokes me as i walk past
* ""you lot haven't been kicked out yet?"" she didn't really hear what i said
* ""let's go dance"" she still didn't hear what i said
* ""i'm going outside, it's too hot in here"" i think she said, so i replied ""yeah i know i'm hot but wait til you get to know me"", she still didn't hear what i said as she was turning to leave
* i grabbed her as she was leaving and said ""let's go dance"", ""maybe later"" she replied
* ""i probably won't be here when you get back"" i replied, she shrugged and walked off with her friend
* fuck it, i thought. time to dance
* spent a solid 30 minutes dancing, tried to make myself the centre of attention by jumping into the middle of the circles that the groups were making. lots of laughs.
* was playfully headbutting anyone else wearing the goggles or the hats. 
* at this point, it was ~2.30AM and despite the place still being packed, 80% of the girls were already taken and the other 20% didn't really seem to be ""on it""
* decided to leave on the high of the social proof
* got bus back to dorms
* put some chicken in the oven
* wrote this FR, haha.


so yeah, all in all i'd say i had a great night. i'm not sure what to do while peacocking. i've still got the hat and the goggles so i might wear the hat out on a different night out. but a lot of people tried to take it from me (""hey, hands off the merchandise""). like i said, i didn't get with anyone or anything but i had a great night just dancing with friends and just getting up to stupid shit. i pretty much missed out half the stuff in this FR of just the banter and stuff we got up to as i just kept it to the girls related stuff.


i appreciate all the comments/criticism/advice :)

thanks for reading! :)"
v4g51,1,2012-06-15,"I'm sick of the U.S. immigrant worker policy. H1B visas suck. I've been here for all of my adult life, yet have no real means to remain in America legitimately at this point. What the hell am I supposed to do?",throwitfarfarfaraway,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/v4g51/im_sick_of_the_us_immigrant_worker_policy_h1b/,"Hi Reddit. I'm using a throwaway because I don't want this rant associated with me. Long post follows, and thanks to those who read. I'm trying to be objective - I'm really quite humble when it comes to describing myself (not in interviews of course), but I'm trying to be candid, and I assure you that my qualifications and recommendations are indeed true and well earned.

A little bit about myself: 

I was born to Indian parents in the UAE, and have an Indian passport. I've never lived in India, though, and spent the first 18 years of my life in Abu Dhabi (UAE's capital, often overlooked for Dubai). I came to the US to go to college, and earned my bachelor's as a dual degree in science and the fine arts from a school ranked consistently within the top 10 in the country. I then got a master's in graphic/digital design from a university whose graduate design program is also ranked consistently within the top 10 in the country. I've had great feedback from every professor I've studied under, both undergrad and grad. I've had good internship and freelance experiences and solid portfolio reviews from professionals and academics. My master's thesis was considered among the most well written and produced among those in the last five years of my program.

I've been looking for full time jobs in the US since I graduated in December, and I'm currently on [OPT](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optional_Practical_Training), which allows me to work unrestricted for a year after graduation. This comes with the caveat that I can't be unemployed for more than 60 days, so I accepted an internship offer to work while I hunted for full time jobs that would sponsor my visa application. Since then, I've had offers for jobs that have been rescinded because of my sponsorship requirement, and also offers that I couldn't accept because the salary proposed was less than that required by the H1B visa petition process (the salary has to be higher than the [""prevailing wage""](http://www.foreignlaborcert.doleta.gov/wages.cfm) for the occupation and geographical area - yet one more hurdle for me, because I'm willing to work for peanuts to get my career going - just as any determined American would.) 

To add to this, the number of [H1B visas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-1B_visa) allowed per year is limited to a certain number (around 65,000). There's a specific start date to that application process (April 1), and the end date is whenever the cap is reached - which happened to be June 11 this year. So I'm out of fucking luck. My backup plans right now are: 1. Look for jobs with non-profits and Universities, which are exempt from the visa quota (want a funny story? I can't transfer this visa, if i get one, to a for-profit organization in the future, and will have to reapply under the quota if I want to make such a career change. HAHA.) 2. To move to the UAE or, if that doesn't pan out, India, and look for ways to come back in the future.

The funny thing is, I feel more American than anything else. I have no real attachment to living under a pseudo-benevolent monarchy in the UAE, and no attachment to living under a corrupt patriarchal government in India. The U.S. has its own problems when it comes to government, sure, but it's the only place I feel at home anymore. In addition, I've met the girl I want to marry here (but unfortunately can't, yet, due to family obligations and conservatism) and we're terribly in love, so this feels like a forced separation. I've considered the EU, but it's equally hard to get in there being an Indian citizen (and I'm quickly coming to despise this status).

Anyway, the primary issue here is that the visa quota for the year was filled this week, and I'm feeling very despondent. I'm incredibly frustrated with all the hoops that I have to go through to get a fucking job. I've tried incredibly hard, and seen candidates much less talented than myself (I'm trying to be objective here, I really am) get sponsored. I hate this situation, and I hate that I might have to leave the one place that I feel I can call my home, the friends who I think of as family, and the girl who I hope to one day have the financial stability to propose to. 

I know my options, but I hate them all. I guess I don't think I'm looking for advice, since I think I've covered every option I can think of - I'm not sure? I think I'm just looking for someone to read this, and understand what a shitty situation this is. Maybe I don't know what I want from Reddit. I dunno.

I'm frustrated at myself, angry at the U.S. and its policies, and just flat out depressed because I've been doing this for the past six months now. I wanted to get it all out, so thanks for reading -your time and comments are appreciated.

TLDR; H1B visa application processes suck. I've been here for 7 years, and feel like this is my home, but I'll likely have to leave anyway because of the U.S.'s draconic immigrant worker policy. I'm looking at non profits and higher-ed jobs that are exempt from the quota but things don't look hopeful. Shit sucks, man."
v7678,1,2012-06-17,"My older sister and I have nothing in common, she's controlling, a compulsive liar, and we don't have a relationship. Is it possible to have one at this point?",[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/v7678/my_older_sister_and_i_have_nothing_in_common_shes/,"I'm 20 years old (male) and she's 24. When we were kids up until about when I was 9, we got along fine. She did the normal older sister stuff, bossing me around, we fought, but at the same time, we were able to have a relationship. Probably because we were kids... Once she got into middle school, she started hanging out with the wrong crowd. Drug users, people who drank alcohol, and just... weird. Not to mention a lot older than her. I'm sorry but it's weird if someone in high school is hanging out with a kid in middle school. Since then, she got into loads of trouble, got shit for grades, always lying to my parents about every little thing, and it put a huge strain on the family and my parents marriage (I think). My mother is more free-spirited, so my mother and sister have always gotten along for the most part, but my dad was the one who was trying to put some sort of order into her life. Like any normal parent, he set curfews and RULES. My sister has just never been someone who did what she was told. 

And then there was me. I can't remember the last time my parents needed to tell me that I had to do my homework, clean my room, etc. I just always did what I knew I was supposed to do, and never got into any trouble. I got along with both of my parents and never really had any issues with them. 

What the hell went wrong here? Fast forward to about two years ago. She was 22 and myself, 18. My mother went to Florida for a week to visit her mom, and my dad was always working at the time. I haven't had a curfew since I was 17, went to a friends house, and get a call from my sister, screaming that I needed to be home. It was 2:30am, but I was watching a fucking movie at a friends house. Forgive me... I get home when the movie ended because let's be honest, I'm 18 years old, and I'm not going to let my degenerate 22y/o sister try to enforce a rule that she just made up for me, and she just... yells. Telling me I need to be home when I was told, blah blah blah. She calls my dad, who's at work and doesn't have the time to deal with petty crap like that, and tells him that I shoved her, and just started spewing more lies out of her mouth. I ask calmly to talk to him, she pushes me, I grab the phone from her hand and she proceeds to grab my hair, kick my balls, scratch my face and hit my kidneys. At that point, I was pissed, but I knew that if I hit her back, she'd call the police on me and come up with some elaborate story to get me arrested somehow. I finally get her off of me, and I just leave. 

I'm convinced that I was more mature than her 22 year old self, when I was 12... I'm in my third year of college, just got an amazing internship, doing well and have good prospects for my future. My sister dropped out of community college that my parents paid for, and now works as a hairdresser who can't make enough money to move out of the house. At this point, whenever I see her, I'm just irritated. She doesn't even wash her own dishes. I can think of a million other things I don't like about her, but it'd be pointless. My parents also bought her a horse and 2 cars. All of which had to be sold/junked because she couldn't afford to maintain them and neither could my parents anymore. She's a parasite. Because of the financial strain she put on my parents, I had to take out tens of thousands of dollars in loans just to go to school. I know I'll be able to pay them off, but I can't help but think how much better off my family would be if she wasn't around. It sounds terrible, but I have no reason to get along with her as you can see. Recently she tried blaming our lack of a relationship on ME. This was after she called me, again screaming, telling me that I needed to get home and go with her to a wake that my mom said she had to go to, or she was going to ""kick my ass"". I just hung up, because obviously, that had the opposite effect that she expected. Now we're just not on speaking terms, as usual.

My question is, what can be done about this? After texting her and convincing her that she was indeed wrong to threaten me, she still thinks that until I'm ready to have a relationship with her, we won't have one. At this point, why the hell would I want to have one with her? She's just so different from me, and we obviously cannot get along because of her control and perhaps jealousy issues. I really don't know. People keep telling me that we should try to have a relationship, but at the same time, why should we have to force something like that? I just can't. I choose my friends wisely so that I can keep drama out of my life and have done so successfully. But, I couldn't choose my sister, and she is the only source of drama in my life right now. It's toxic. 

Sorry for the wall of text, but I had to explain some specifics."

I've always had an easier time being friends with girls than guys, and there aren't too many girls at my workplace I see myself being close friends with.  I enjoy going out to find new food, but also enjoy a casual day laying in the sun by the pool at my apartment.

While I'm not actively looking for a relationship or summer fling, I'm definitely not opposed to considering  it if things really seem to click.

A bit about myself, I'm a little under 6'1"", white, have been going to the gym regularly for the last few months, not to lose weight, but to gain some muscle, and I think it's going pretty well, but that's for others to decide :P

If you want to hang out, find some good local food, or just lay by the pool with me let me know :)"
v6vuy,1,2012-06-17,"Reddit, I recently had a TERRIBLE experience with my orthodontist. What should I do? ",g3t0nmyl3v3l,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/v6vuy/reddit_i_recently_had_a_terrible_experience_with/,"So, the other day I went to the orthodontist because i needed to get my teeth cleaned. When you get your teeth cleaned when you have to get the wires in your braces taken out.

My orthodontist usually has only interns. Fresh out of college. They never know what they're doing, they always hurt me, and sometimes it's as stupid as what happened the other day.

This intern lady had the simple task of putting my wire back in, but it was obviously too long. I thought she realized and would stop to cut it, but I started day dreaming and didn't say anything because I thought she would have it handled. So, she gets it in, and she needs to pull it out for god knows why. But It wasn't to cut the wire because she realized that later. Okay so she starts to pull and yank, and it hurts like a bitch. So she leaves me there for about 15 minutes doing absolutely nothing with half a wire in my mouth while she silently calls 2 other people over to help, so then I had 2 other people try and pull the wire out and no one said why it needed to come out. So they just end up saying fuck it and the actual orthodontist main person comes over and says ""oh, we'll just push it in if we can't take it out!"" and pushes that shit straight in to my gums.
Okay so now I'm bleeding, and he doesn't really notice, and then he calmly says ""oh, that's a bit too long. I'll cut that out for you."" okay so this wire cutter that he uses does in fact cut the wire. But once the wire got cut the excess wire just went deeper in my gums and they spend 2-3 minutes to try and get it out. Then he pushes the other side in my gums and that hurts like a bitch, but wasn't as bad.

Since they were pushing and pulling so much my mouth was sore for almost a week. (this happened about a week ago and my mouth is still kinda sore.) and come to find out, while they were pushing and pulling so much, it made one of the brackets (the big metal pieces on each tooth) come off my tooth. I know that it wasn't me because my mouth has been too sore to eat anything besides ice cream and really really soft stuff. The bracket is currently barely attached to my tooth, but I don't want to go back because of that experience.

I have had maybe one or two good - OK experiences in the 3 years I have gone to that place, but this has been by far the worst. My supposed to be 15 minute appointment went for 110 minutes.

But it's not like I can just stop going there because my parents already paid it all off. But that was just ridiculous and shouldn't be ignored.

Reddit, please help me."

Questions|Answers
:--|:--
[How can a recent college graduate get on a path leading to similar work?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v59z3/iam_sebastian_thrun_stanford_professor_google_x/c51gi53?context=5)|There is no single recipe here. The thing that worked best for me is to be relentlessly driven by the desire to solve problems I really care about, and to be open to changing my mind along the way when I learn new things. A lot of successful entrepreneurs do this. They pick a vision of something that's important, and work as hard as they can to make it happen. It can be done inside companies. They all try to solve important problems. Act as if you already know that you won't fail. What would you do if you knew that you wouldn't fail? (credit to Regina Dugan for this question). And have a healthy disregard for rules. There are way too many rules, and they usually have only one effect: to slow down those how are active. If you believe your activities are in the best interest of the company that employs you - yet you fear you have broken enough rules that you might be fired - then you are doing well.
[What are the career prospects of someone who wants to do cool research and coding or robotics projects (as opposed to manufacturing automation\)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v59z3/iam_sebastian_thrun_stanford_professor_google_x/c51gi53?context=5)|Now - on to education. We are trying to design Udacity around the idea of student empowerment. Rather than lecturing to you how to solve problems, we let you, the student, solve problems. I am a strong believer in learning by doing. I believe you can't lose weight by watching someone else exercise. It's really hard to learn by watching someone else solve problems (and lecture about it).
[How can self-learners organize their education so they don't have gaps in their knowledge?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v59z3/iam_sebastian_thrun_stanford_professor_google_x/c51gi53?context=5)|I wouldn't really worry about ""gaps"" in the education. Even if your education is gap-less right now, it'll have tons of gaps 5 years from now. Worry about skills. Worry about that you feel empowered to solve hard problems.
[How do you aim to provide that guidance at Udacity?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v59z3/iam_sebastian_thrun_stanford_professor_google_x/c51gi53?context=5)|Mentorship: There is a on of mentoring going on at Udacity, although I agree, we have a long way to go. This is one of the holy grails in online education. Can we educate at scale, yet still empower all students? Is 1:1 mentorship by an instructor really required, or can peers mentor each other with the appropriate guidance? We hope to explore this going forward.
[I'm sure you know the people involved with Coursera. What are the top differences that you see between Udacity and Coursera? What is your relationship like with them?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v59z3/iam_sebastian_thrun_stanford_professor_google_x/c51gt3c?context=5)|I really want both entities to succeed. I really like Coursera a lot, and the founders are amazing individuals. Both companies are trying to being high quality education to everyone. We need more entities doing the same.
 |A lot has been written about the commonalities and differences between Udacity and Coursera. You cal easily Google people's opinions. At Udacity, we are trying to change the pedagogical approach. we don't just aspire to bring the existing classroom experience (lectures, assignments, exams) to the online world. You find that Udacity classes are focused around student exercise, not lectures. Videos are minimal, often less than 90 seconds long (although some are longer). At Udacity, you will spend more time thinking on your own than listening to a professor. I feel the online medium is so amazing, we should really go beyond the replication of the classroom experience.
[What keyboard layout do you use? based on the ""cal"" typo, it doesn't look to me like you use qwerty.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v59z3/iam_sebastian_thrun_stanford_professor_google_x/c51ihjh?context=5)|Oops. Can. It's qwerty and I have no clue what happend. Perhaps UC Berkeley was on my mind (=Cal).
[1\) What would you say to people who want to learn to code?  2\) What programming languages would you recommend?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v59z3/iam_sebastian_thrun_stanford_professor_google_x/c51ghyo?context=5)|Of course.... I highly recommend CS101 at Udacity and the subsequent classes. All of them focus on making you learn coding by doing it yourself.  I recommend Java, Python, C sharp, Ruby, and perhaps C++ - depending on what you are using it for. C++ is great for systems level work. There are of course a lof of special platforms, like iOs, which requires Objective C. I don't recommend Fortran :) 
[3\) What programming languages do you know?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v59z3/iam_sebastian_thrun_stanford_professor_google_x/c51ghyo?context=5)|I should add: I know only a small number of programming languages. Some are archaic: Basic, Fortran, Lisp, Modulo II, Pascal. This dates me! Most of my professional programming has been with C++. I have also taught Java. Pythin is my most recent language, and I am not very good at it - as some people remarked for my CS373 class. But I am getting by :). I love python. I also love Matlab. It's amazing. I do a lot of prototyping in Matlab.
[At what point will there be too many classes on Udacity? Also, what is the one class you would like to see be created?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v59z3/iam_sebastian_thrun_stanford_professor_google_x/c51gqsi?context=5)|I'd like to throw this back to the people on this forum. What classes do YOU want to see on Udacity? Please reply!
 |Wow - I love this thread. Thanks for the many suggestions - and keep them coming. You just wrote the roadmap for Udacity!
[Professor Thrun,](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v59z3/iam_sebastian_thrun_stanford_professor_google_x/c51h6m3?context=5)|Would love it. I hear form the Department Education that they are pouring $2B into the development of open source educational materials. They have an amazing vision. Anything ""open access"" is great.
[I am curious on your opinions on the development of high-quality open-access textbooks?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v59z3/iam_sebastian_thrun_stanford_professor_google_x/c51h6m3?context=5)|BTW, I wonder what happens to the idea of a text book in the video age. One of the things that frustrates me about books is that they ""don't talk back"". I can do the exercises, but the book won't tell me what I am doing wrong. I really want to see innovation on that end as well.
[Software is eating jobs, and self-driving cars are going to put a lot of people out of work who currently make a living driving vehicles.  Do you have any thoughts on how society should adapt to what seems to be a ""new normal"" of higher unemployment?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v59z3/iam_sebastian_thrun_stanford_professor_google_x/c51hh5e?context=5)|Ever since time, and certainly through the Industrial Revolution, have seen a restructuring of the workforce. Over 90% of all people used to work in agriculture and now it's about 2% in this country (number may be inaccurate). Are we better off or worse off? I think better off.
 |This is just my personal opinion. I believe society is wasting huge resources with ""inefficiencies,"" and when we invent methods to overcome these inefficiencies, society tends to be better off.  I think we have to be socially responsible to the people who might be negatively affected by all this, but just retaining things as they are cannot be our guiding principle going forward.
 |Just my 2c.
[Do you believe that online schooling will eventually replace all classrooms?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v59z3/iam_sebastian_thrun_stanford_professor_google_x/c51gqo1?context=5)|No! Absolutely not. Cinema hasn't replaced stage play either. What online will do is to reach many more students, those who can't afford being in classrooms. And it'll augment classroom teaching to enable teachers to focus more on the tutoring aspects of learning, and meaningful small group interaction - over giving lectures.
[I have several people with Ph.D.'s tell me not to go on for one after my master's unless my career path genuinely requires one. Are doctoral candidates really that badly used and abused as a source of cheap academic labor with little hope of fulfilling the dreams they hoped they might achieve by earning a Ph.D.?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v59z3/iam_sebastian_thrun_stanford_professor_google_x/c51gt1a?context=5)|I would not share that opinion.
 |I recommend all my student to do a PhD if they would enjoy the process of getting a PhD. Getting a PhD is really all about learning to do research. Research is often frustrating, since you don't just find solutions, you also have to find interesting problems to work on. And someone who's great in college isn't necessary great in research.
 |A PhD is a significant time commitment. Make sure you'll enjoy the process, and you feel good about the process.
[Do you think something like Udacity will eventually lead to PhD level education, or is the general idea better suited for undergraduate work?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v59z3/iam_sebastian_thrun_stanford_professor_google_x/c51hd52?context=5)|I don't think so, at lest any time soon. The PhD is a very personal experience where the interaction with the mentor is really essential. I don't think it easily scales to the Web. I think Udacity will go to Master's level for now.
[What is your favorite project you have worked on?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v59z3/iam_sebastian_thrun_stanford_professor_google_x/c51glsm?context=5)|Self-driving cars, Google Glass, and of course Udacity. These are all very amazing projects to me. Plus - very importantly - helping my son to grow up (he's now 4 years old)
[What do you see as the major challenges for AI/Robotics now and in the future?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v59z3/iam_sebastian_thrun_stanford_professor_google_x/c51h7e4?context=5)|I think we should really try again the big goal: create human level intelligence. I think this is totally doable. We now have faster computer than ever before, more data than even 1,000 humans can comprehend during their live times, and much better engineering. If I ever run out of things to do, that's what I'll do.
[Welcome, mr. Thrun. I'd like to thank you for your work on Udacity and being one of the people responsible for the current wave of online education that, I hope, is only just getting started. As someone who dropped out of university the ability to keep learning this way is wonderful, both personally and for my career. I'm also a mod over at /r/OnlineEducation, so please excuse me for promoting that subreddit here.  Udacity is planning on broadening their subjects into other sciences and humanities. You have also said that you think/hope Udacity and other online universities such as Coursera will largely replace offline higher education.  Coursera has Standford, Berkeley, the university of Michigan and others backing it. EdX is the work of Harvard and MIT. Udacity has no famous 'real-life' names supporting it. Do you think this will be a problem?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v59z3/iam_sebastian_thrun_stanford_professor_google_x/c51gy0m?context=5)|First, let me clarify. I don't think online education will replace higher offline education. Quite the contrary. I think it'll draw more people into education. Movies draw people into theater. Radio brings people to live concerts. It's long been known that MIT's Open Courseware program has drawn students to MIT.
 |I believe that online education will improve the educational experience and the outcomes. It'll give existing colleges and universities much more reach, and reduce their costs.
[Were you speaking English language in childhood? If not, was it difficult to you to learn English? How many natural languages do you know?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v59z3/iam_sebastian_thrun_stanford_professor_google_x/c51glg6?context=5)|I learned Latin, English, and a little bit of French in high school. I pretty much forgot all my Latin and French. I learned English mostly by living in the US.
[Most courses in Udacity are at the beginner/introductory level. I also noticed that each course covers less material than its semester equivalent in a university. As university graduate, I would be interested in taking in-depth graduate courses in CS. Does Udacity plan to cover fully that need in the future?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v59z3/iam_sebastian_thrun_stanford_professor_google_x/c51heqq?context=5)|This is a great suggestion. We hoped that CS212 and CS373 were graduate-level advanced. But I agree we need more advanced classes.
[How come you abandoned a successful career at Stanford? AFAIK you advise your team for a few hours a week? Do you plan to return in the future?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v59z3/iam_sebastian_thrun_stanford_professor_google_x/c51heqq?context=5)|I commented on my decision to teach online at my DLD talk (google me and DLD video). I really am intrigued to help hundreds of thousands of students worldwide, and to empower them.
[Do you have different views/approaches on online education with your Stanford colleages (Ng, Koller\) @Coursera? Which are these?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v59z3/iam_sebastian_thrun_stanford_professor_google_x/c51heqq?context=5)|I commented on Coursera above - I am excited to see so much activity in this area. Together we can change the world!
[(transferred this question from previous thread\) **How do you complete a project (that's not part of a class\) where it's not clearly defined, and you don't know what you'll need to learn or what steps you need to do it?**  I can complete classes because they present material step by step and give you exactly what you need to solve the problems that they give you.  But when I want to do my own project, it's not clear what I have to learn to solve it.  Furthermore, I'll start learning a topic to solve it, then find that I'll have to learn something else.  It's not clear how far I'll have to search and how deep to finally get my answer.  Often it's frustrating. As a result, I often give up on completing the project.  So how do you do it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v59z3/iam_sebastian_thrun_stanford_professor_google_x/c51het5?context=5)|I agree, this is had. The best rule for project completion is to complete it. When you get frustrated, I bet you get frustrated because things don't proceed as you want them to proceed. That's a learning opportunity right there. If you give up, you miss out on the most important part: the opportunity to learn something surprising. If you understand this, and use this as a learning opportunity, and develop pride once a hurdle has been taken - you will complete your projects!
[(I'm copying 2 relevant items from the previous thread, here is #2\) As systems become more autonomous and intelligent, what kind or research do you think needs to be done to make sure the machines ""understand our wishes"" properly? Specifically what do you think about SIAI's efforts in this area?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v59z3/iam_sebastian_thrun_stanford_professor_google_x/c51gmrf?context=5)|I think this is key to intelligent systems. In the end we build smart systems to help us, the people. Not to serve themselves. A lot of existing technology doesn't really connect to people. But.... the machine doesn't have to be human like. My calculator perfectly understands my wishes (by pushing calculator buttons) without smiling at me and asking me how I feel.
[**1. As a child/teengaer, did you always thought you were going to grow up as a person of major influence? Did you always knew you were smart and perhaps always one step ahead of your peers?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v59z3/iam_sebastian_thrun_stanford_professor_google_x/c51inbu?context=5)|I was just the opposite. I didn't think I had a talent. I honestly didn't care much about school, and it took me until college to realize I am actually good in math.
[When did you start getting into computers/coding?**](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v59z3/iam_sebastian_thrun_stanford_professor_google_x/c51inbu?context=5)|Two things I always had were: passion, and a gentle disrespect for rules. If people say it can't be done, then likely those people are wrong. But instead of arguing things, I really tried to do things, and to keep my mind open for learning new things.
[Also, could you please do a C++ class for udacity? Thanks!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v59z3/iam_sebastian_thrun_stanford_professor_google_x/c51inbu?context=5)|So be passionate, try things, and when you get stuck don't give up. See it as an opportunity to learn something new. Every wall can be climbed, any ocean can be crossed.  
[You mentioned at one point that designing good questions is key. Do you use trial and error for designing questions or something more systematic? Have you thought about hiring an instructional designer to help?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v59z3/iam_sebastian_thrun_stanford_professor_google_x/c51grfo?context=5)|We don't do a great job with this quite yet. In my own class, I usually do things twice. The first version of questions is okay, but will be rejected by our internal instructors. The second version is then much better. We still don't do a great job with A-vs-B testing, and we don't yet have a good mechanism for student feedback.  So much more work to do....
[1\) How long would you estimate we have, before we are all riding around in self-driving cars?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v59z3/iam_sebastian_thrun_stanford_professor_google_x/c51h02w?context=5)|Highly recommend a visit to Google. The company is truly amazing.
[2\) Is Google's campus really as awesome as I've heard it is?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v59z3/iam_sebastian_thrun_stanford_professor_google_x/c51h02w?context=5)|As for time: I wish I had a crystal ball. We are still focusing on getting the technology right.
[1\) What is the reason that Udacity's coursers are easier than Coursera's coursers and graduate level courses in general? Is it deliberate approach? 2\) Are you planning to implement sort of holistic approach when students may get equivalent of knowledge that brick and mortar universities give? Or you are going to provide just special courses for someone who needs just to broaden his knowledge? 3\) It seems that Coursera provides coursers under brands of universities (Princeton, Stanford, etc\) and Udacity provides coursers under name of its authors. Why is it so?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v59z3/iam_sebastian_thrun_stanford_professor_google_x/c51hacg?context=5)|Some people thought the Udacity CS101 was harder than the Coursera CS101. I haven't paid much attention to the other courses on Coursera's Web site, sorry.
 |We are trying to make complicated material as accessible as possible. And we are trying to shift the focus from lectures to exercises. I generally believe exercises make material easier to learn.
[Ai-class was highly connected to Stanford University. Why did you decide to make Udacity completely independent of any university?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v59z3/iam_sebastian_thrun_stanford_professor_google_x/c51hay8?context=5)|I love edX and what MIT and Harvard is trying to do. The more of us try to do meaningful online education, the better.
[What do you think about edX (MITx + Harvard\)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v59z3/iam_sebastian_thrun_stanford_professor_google_x/c51hay8?context=5)|Udacity is independent because we want to radically innovate. I think as a Stanford entity, it would be hard to issue meaningful certificates without confusing the entire world what these certificates mean. And remember, in AI Class we graduated 23,000 students with a certificate (and we never checked IDs).
[Thanks for Udacity! It's a great place!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v59z3/iam_sebastian_thrun_stanford_professor_google_x/c51hay8?context=5)|We have an excellent relationship with Stanford. President Hennessy and I meet regularly. 
[Will google glass ever be... real?  Please! ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v59z3/iam_sebastian_thrun_stanford_professor_google_x/c51ijhr?context=5)|Babak Parviz and the team are working on it!
[For Google Glass, are you currently beta testing the devices with people out in the world?  And if so, is there any way I could get my hands on a pair?  Also, you're pretty awesome both for your neat Google stuff, and for doing this AMA.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v59z3/iam_sebastian_thrun_stanford_professor_google_x/c51h845?context=5)|Thanks!! Glass: A few of us at Google are testing them in public right now, and it seems there is now a good number of photographs of people who spotted us.  But we are not handing them out to others right now.
[What do you think of the future of Symbolic AI?  In what areas would Statistical AI not be suitable? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v59z3/iam_sebastian_thrun_stanford_professor_google_x/c51hcl3?context=5)|I feel the pendulum swings into one direction, then into another. If you look at the best of AI in a company like Google, there is a lot of symbolic AI. But it's different from the symbolic AI from the 1980s. It's using extensive machine learning, and it marries symbols with probabilistic methods. I believe symbols will be in, but in a very different way from how it all started.
[Professor, I took the first CS101 course on Udacity and I have to say it was amazing. What else are you doing to encourage technology and the sciences? I've always felt that Google should have some massive expo for kids like the Stark Expo in Iron Man 2.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v59z3/iam_sebastian_thrun_stanford_professor_google_x/c51h17h?context=5)|For high school students: I very strongly endorse US First. Dean Kamen and the First team are doming something amazing for the Nation. If you haven't heard about this, Google it. A great way to spend your time!
[I think Udacity is a brilliant idea, and I'm really excited to see where it will go in the future. I was wondering, are there any plans to expand into subjects outside of computer science and mathematics? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v59z3/iam_sebastian_thrun_stanford_professor_google_x/c51gywb?context=5)|We have decided to stay within technical fields for now, especially in areas where there are ample employment opportunities. We are getting a ton of interests from employers, and many students asking about meaningful certificates that employers would accept. Once we have figured out how to make it work in CS-related fields, we will think about extending this to other disciplnes.
 |So let me turn this around: People on Reddit: what subject disciplines would you like us to cover???
[Is there a future for Udacity to give degrees or will it always be just a learning service?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v59z3/iam_sebastian_thrun_stanford_professor_google_x/c51imx8?context=5)|We are moving into certification. We soon will be offering in-person tests through Person VUE. We are working with employers to give meaning to these certificates. We already placed students in jobs.
 |We won't give a ""degree"" any time soon, and we are not accredited.
[Are there any plans for networking courses?  I'd really enjoy a good class on that, especially as the world becomes even more connected.  Thanks for doing what you're doing!  Keep up the good work.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v59z3/iam_sebastian_thrun_stanford_professor_google_x/c51indm?context=5)|Thanks - will add this to our list. I agree this would be great to have!
[One Question: I'm fresh to the tech industry, coming from and currently on the business side of a start-up. One inefficiency I notice all over SOMA is that businesses are so silo-ed between those that can code, and those that cannot. Certainly the best productive value is had when someone is proficient in both domains, but it's a difficult and rare medium to achieve. As you built a team of researchers, how did you evaluate the proportion of the team which would be focused on each? Do you favor the silo-ing methods, or do specifically search for people with both sets of knowledge? Or instead is having business-focused people superfluous at the beginning of a tech-project?  Second Question: This is the age, once again, of the amateur scientist, so they say. I believe it. Do you believe that great innovation in the next 10 years will come out of garages, or instead do you believe that it will take the foresight, risk taking, and bank accounts of a company like Google to to underwrite impactful research?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v59z3/iam_sebastian_thrun_stanford_professor_google_x/c51olqs?context=5)|I much prefer people who can do things. Talking is one thing, doing another. We have way too many people who talk, and way to few who do. In Web start-ups, programming is a big part of doing. But there are many other ways. Get things done, don't talk about how to get things done. This is my mantra.  I think great innovation will first and foremost come from great people. People with vision, skill, and determination. (and we only teach skill at Udacity). Innovation can take place at large companies or small companies - even in Government. But often bureaucracy kills innovation.  
[Could you be awesome and do Physical Chemistry? There appears to be little to no online lectures for this tough subject.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v59z3/iam_sebastian_thrun_stanford_professor_google_x/c521o9s?context=5)|Noted! :)
[To second this, Udacity's focus on mix of making you write your own code and interpret existing code really solidify the new content they've introduced.  Also, they introduce concepts in a way that really allows you to understand the building blocks leading into more complex constructs.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v59z3/iam_sebastian_thrun_stanford_professor_google_x/c51ir33?context=5)|Thanks! Cudos to Dave Evans. He's amazing.
[I second this. My company is committed to employee growth and we spend real resources on it. Something that was designed for internal skills training would be sweet. Our CTO currently teaches interns and qa how to code in weekly classes. That's expensive time.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v59z3/iam_sebastian_thrun_stanford_professor_google_x/c51i8ro?context=5)|Yes, we are interested. Although I am committed to open education. We can't lock up education in silos.

v63qt,1,2012-06-17,My life is fucking miserable and I don't know what to do about it.,Metro53,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/v63qt/my_life_is_fucking_miserable_and_i_dont_know_what/,"I don't even know where to start. I don't know why I'm writing this or what I think I'm going to accomplish doing so but since it's the most active thing I've done since finding out that I've been dismissed from college I guess I might as well go through with it.

My life, quite simply, is a train wreck. Yes, there are starving kids in Sri Lanka much worse off than I am. So i'm not so confused or dramatic as to think I'm the unluckiest or most unfortunate person in the history of the world. But still, my life has reached the point where I see nothing redeeming about it.

Throughout school I've always been one of the smartest kids but also one of the laziest, I guess you could say. For whatever reason I've always felt some sort of force field between me and work. I would never hand in homework assignments. I would half-ass studying for tests or not study at all. But when it came down to things like final exams, I would always do well. I got high scores on AP exams without even studying. I got a 1990 on the SAT's with minimal effort. My grades in middle school and high school were decent enough but could have been significantly higher if I just got my work done. Intelligence alone plus the sympathy of teachers who understand that I was a good kid with some sort of mental block helped me get through high school. And I eventually went to a very reputable college on a partial scholarship.

College was a different story. I failed two of my five classes my first semester and stopped going to class altogether my second semester. I  ended up withdrawing from those classes and taking the semester off. Scholarship revoked. At home, I did absolutely nothing aside from visit a psychologist. I at in bed all day with minimal social interaction and ate a lot of food, to the point I gained a decent amount of weight. The plan was for me to visit with this psychologist, get my head on straight, and go back to school ready to work. The psychologist, while understanding completely what my issues were on a level that most people have been unable to get, was unable to figure out the root of my issues or how to fix it. Over the summer I lost all the weight and got into the best shape of my life, and for the first time in months I was genuinely excited about going to school. Immediately upon arriving at school again, though, something felt off, and indeed it was. The people who were once my friends now barely hung out or taked to me, many walking past me as if we had never met before. This piled onto the already significant dilemma of me being unable to get work done. I withdrew from two classes and still failed my other two since I stopped going to class and didn't hand anything in from that point. The next semester, I met with a psychiatrist who insisted that there was no doubt in his mind I had ADD and that this was the root of my problem. He gave me medication.... which did nothing. I actually had a decent start to the semester but eventually stopped handing things in again. More failed classes, and now I'm kicked out of university. 

I have no clear path towards any sort of career right now. I'm not in school obviously. I have absolutely no idea what I'm going to do this upcoming year. I've had absolutely no success with girls; I've never had a girlfriend and I'm known in my circle of friends for having the worst luck, with girls treating me like shit or blowing me off one way or another. All of my friends live relatively far away from me and are doing well at school, studying abroad, getting all sorts of amazing internships, and as a result I feel completely worthless. I see absolutely nothing about my life that gives me any sort of hope for the future. I have absolutely no consolation to cling onto as some form of happiness. 

Just to provide a list of people I had at one point or another worked with to try to fix this issue:

-My parents
-My close friends
-My teachers/professors
-The Dean of Students
-My academic advisor
-The counseling center of my university
-Two psychologists
-Two neuropsychologists
-One psychiatrist
-Three different kinds of medication


And I've found no answers and have just continued to spiral downwards into the shithole situation that I am now entrenched in. No matter how many different people I meet with or how many different things I try nobody seems to have an answer for how to solve this. I don't know what to do. I don't know how to explain to anyone how this happened to me. I desperately need something that gives me hope but right now I have absolutely nothing to cling to for that. That's something even my most optimistic friends have conceded to me. I highly doubt anyone is going to read all of this but I guess it's nice enough to just write this all down and get it off my chest. And in a depressing irony it would be fitting for nobody to read this. Or give me any advice. Since that's more or less been how life has treated me the last few years. "
v62up,1,2012-06-17,"Women have never liked me before, now that they do it makes me angry and I don't know why.",[deleted],AskWomen,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/v62up/women_have_never_liked_me_before_now_that_they_do/,"I must warn you, this post is long. Throwaway account because I am ashamed to admit this. I should start off by saying that I'm a college student who is on his way to graduate next year with pretty much a guaranteed job in my field. Before this however, I wasn't much of anything. I had interesting hobbies, nice looks, had a decent part time job and dressed well. However, that did not make me seem like a viable person to date. Also, I lived with my parents, so one could say that that was a deal breaker too. It didn't help that my sister seemed to resent me living with the family and didn't miss a chance to insult me because I was a ""deadbeat."" I felt like a burden to just about everyone around me. I felt weak and I hated it. However, that's only part of the story. There are also three other women involved in this as well. All of them I have known over a three to five year period. These weren't the only women that I pursued, but they are women that I liked a lot and tried to develop something romantic with each of them. I failed on all counts. I was massively disappointed and depressed over the outcomes, but I managed to get over it, we became good friends instead, they integrated into my social circles and vice-versa and they went off and dated other guys. This has been more or less the pattern for other attempts at a relationship with other women. I soon learned to get used to it and just stopped expecting anything to come out of any advances I made, until I eventually just stopped trying. I got much more involved with my school work, started working out more and just trying to find other social avenues that I could pursue that didn't cause me to stop and think that I was possibly never going know what it's like to have a girlfriend in college. So, fast forward to three months ago. I get news that I'm getting into my internship, at a place where I'm likely to get the job there or someplace else if I do well. I've also saved up enough money to afford a one year lease on a flat close by and I'm also on my way to graduate and get my undergraduate degree. I'm feeling pretty good about myself and my situation. I told my male friends about it, guys who've been friends with me for years, and who encouraged me to keep going when things got bad for me, and are very proud of me. However, somebody must of said something, or something else must have happened because now, I seem to be attracting women. Not just acquaintances, but women just seem to act so much more nicer to me now and want to hang out with me. Even two of three women who rejected me before (one is married now) have gotten in contact with me and are wanting to get together with me, under no prompting or pursuing on my part. For the first time I'm starting to get dates and numbers and while looking at my life now things seem like they are going great, they're not. I'm now more depressed than ever and it has become exhausting keeping a smile and a chipper attitude in public when I'm out at school and doing my job. I see all these women who now like me and I hate them. I hate all of them. It's illogical and childish and yet it has become this beast that cannot be fed and it's growing. I talk to these women and I want to like them, but I can't, I just resent them. There's a voice in my head always screaming ""Oh, so now you like me, you whore?"" it won't shut up. I'm afraid, I think I'm going to lose my mind if this continues, I've contemplated seeing a psychologist. It's like I finally get a toy for Christmas that I've been asking for for years and the first thing I want to do is take it out of the box and break it. I don't know what to do. I don't even know if this is the right place to post this, but I don't care anymore. I have to write this, just to get it off my chest and maybe that's enough. I'm going to bed now."

v5sv4,3,2012-06-16,Question regarding internships,french_toast_morning,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/v5sv4/question_regarding_internships/,"Hi all, I will be starting my third year at university this fall, and I'm studying computer science. I have an internship this summer doing IT work that doesn't involve coding/development in any way, it's more of a managerial/project management program. 

I've decided that this line of work really isn't for me, and that I want to go into software engineering/development. Is it going to be a difficult transition for me? I feel like as long as I continue to develop my technical skills through coursework and side projects I should be fine, and that exploration of multiple possible career paths is one of the purposes of having an internship. Still, a part of me feels like having this on my resume is going to work against me, and push me into roles similar to what I am doing in this internship in my future.


Any advice anyone can provide would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!"

Today I went into work knowing I'd only left myself a handful of tickets. I figured it would be a (relatively) relaxed day. And it was, for a little bit. *Cue ominous music...*

Around 11:00 my boss busts into my office in pretty much full panic mode. Apparently there are two new interns he wasn't told about, that I need to set up with accounts and a machine (a full day of work at top speed). This would be fairly standard, had we been informed two days earlier. But we hadn't, so there were two interns sitting downstairs at their desks, twiddling their thumbs and looking bored all day, because they needed computers to do their jobs.

*facedesk*

TL;DR: Someone in management is probably trying to get the sysadmins fired"
v8rgx,3,2012-06-18,Making the transition from internships to actual jobs/job offers.. How do I do it?,sambunny,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/v8rgx/making_the_transition_from_internships_to_actual/,"I have an AA in journalism and intend to continue my education at some point.. That being said, I feel as though I have enough experience and enough skill to start applying for jobs in my field.

I have tons of experience working for my college publications but I've also had an ""internship"" with a local newspaper. I was really a paid reporter for the news and features desk, writing more than 30 stories in the few months I was there.. I was not offered a full time position because of layoffs and budget cuts and freelance wasn't worth it.

I then had an internship with a major television corporation. I worked with a division of NBC Universal and wrote several articles and worked very closely with many of their main columnists/editors.

Is this enough experience for me to start asking for actual career positions? Or am I going to be stuck in the land of internships forever?

I know I could get another internship, but I'm ready to be paid for my work and I know that my portfolio is strong enough to prove I can do it.

So, do I send out my resumes and cover letters asking for paid positions? I'm not really sure what to do at this point. Do I still search for internships and try to find companies that will offer positions if I prove myself? Help r/jobs!"

v8pha,3,2012-06-18,Well that was an unexpected turn of events...,[deleted],dating_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/v8pha/well_that_was_an_unexpected_turn_of_events/,"Afternoon all, 24 Male here

So apparently I've been completely obvious to the fact that I'm supposed to state romantic interest extremely early on according to this [thread here](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/v5ldc/ladies_i_am_often_only_ever_interested_in_dating/). I usually try to be friends first to see if I'm interested in her personality. I've always been a SAP, and I've been trying to break out of that be trying to be as social as possible lately.

**TL;DR: Hung out with a girl (22) I was interested in this past weekend, things stall, meet her awesome friend (21) who lives in my town. Awesome friend is now single and it's obvious my traditional method of approaching a relationship doesn't have a very high success rate. I'm throwing a party next week that the new girl is coming to.** 

**Full story:** I've know this girl (I'll call her A) for a few years now, we were never really more than just acquaintances as we bother were in relationships when we went to college together. We're both recently single, and ended up talking a little bit after she found out I moved to a city a little closer to her. 

I drove to her town about an hour away three weeks ago hung out all night but I didn't make any moves as she had mentioned to me she was tired of every guy she's know in the past four years coming out of the woodwork trying to make it with her. She didn't want a relationship or a FWB situation. She gave no signs she was really interested in me.

A invited me out to an anime convention where I came to find out that I'm just not really interested in her in anything more than being friends (She doesn't seemed interested in me either as she was constantly texting a guy all night, who I later came to find out she went on a beach trip with and was sleeping with him.) Whatever, I still had a good time at the convention, I met some of A's friends who were pretty cool. All of whom made it a point to say how much of a good friend/awesome guy I am. 

**Enter girl B.** B met A last year at the same convention and became friends. I don't know too much about girl B other than she had a boyfriend who was being a dick lately. I don't know how long they've been dating. He got an internship in a different state some undisclosed amount of time and recently said, ""There is nothing here for me in (my and Girl B's city)."" 

I was friendly with girl B, she thought I was funny, and told me, ""I bet you get this all the time, but you're fucking awesome."" We got to know each other a little bit, had fun as a group and I ended up crashing in the bed with both girl A and B. Girl A was not happy with me or something as she didn't want to be next to me. Girl B however had no issue with being against me (no cuddling or anything, she had a BF and I'm not going to pull anything with another guy's girl) 

I got home from work this morning (I am temporarily working 6:30PM to 6:30AM ) to find out that girl B is now single on FB. I'm throwing a party next week to celebrate moving out of my parents house and the end of my crazy work schedule. B RSVPed to my party before her and her BF broke up.

**As for some of my questions:**

* Should I try to hang out with girl B before my party or should I just wait until my party?
* I don't have her number (I seriously squandered on that one as I got everyone else's number except hers) should I just ask her for it via FB or see if she'll text me first by posting my number on my facebook event? 
* How do I approach stating interest in dating with a girl who's fresh out of a relationship? Should this happen before the party or during?"

v8euj,0,2012-06-18,How to Troll a Fitness Nerd: JCD Edition,[deleted],Fitness,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/v8euj/how_to_troll_a_fitness_nerd_jcd_edition/,"**This was written for a select group of people on Facebook, it was simply uploaded via Reddit. If you clicked on this through Reddit, you will probably have no idea as to what's going on so pls**

Looking back on things, it’s hard to believe that it wasn’t even a year ago to the day that the foundation of my very internet being was shattered and remolded into the person I am today. What began as a routine venture of scouting out babes at my pool’s apartment complex and having them mire my manly complex turned into sitting under the shaded area of our pool patio talking to some short-ass Israeli kid with a Westside Barbell cutoff on – he stood out from the rest of the inebriated residents like a sore thumb. While the typical pool-goer was chugging Natty Light by the case and screaming abhorrently at the intoxicated person a mere foot or two away, he was fixated on a book regarding human anatomy, completely ignorant of the collegiate chaos that surrounded him. Slightly intrigued, I sat down next to him and ignited a conversation with quite possibly one of the most interesting people to traverse this planet: Jordan Syatt.

As many of you know, Jordan was completing an internship at Westside Barbell located in Columbus, Ohio – because of this, his time here was [unfortunately] limited. During his brief few months of a stay in town, though, he and I became good buddies as he introduced me to a whole new side of fitness; not just fitness in itself, but the revolutionary people who make fitness what it is today: “big names” like Bret Contreras and Eric Cressey were tossed around, as were the relative new-comers who are making names for themselves and who will, in time, surely make their way to the top: Nick Horton, Rog Law, and JC Deen to name a few.

Ah yes, JC Deen. His name: it’s quite pungent. It’s a *formidable* scent; it stings the nostrils in a good way.

If you don’t live under an internet rock, you knew it was only a matter of seconds before his name came to light – you could practically *smell* it.

Perhaps the greatest feat to emerge from my friendship with Jordan was meeting Mr. JC Deen – residing a short fifteen minutes from where I grew up in Tennessee, JC is a fitness enthusiast who began his own business of helping and inspiring his clientele to reach their full potential through controlled and no-BS diet and exercise. I won’t go into details because, well, if you’re reading this, guess what? You already know him. Dipshit.

I’ve made it my life’s ambition to make JC have as many notifications as humanly possible upon opening Facebook. This is done in a variety of ways: pictures, articles, messages, wall posts, “liking” comments – you name it. One thing every notification has in common, though, lies in the actuality that it’s trolling him. Even if it’s not trolling, it’s trolling.

http://i.imgur.com/GwFIL.png

What exactly is a troll, you ask? According to Wikipedia, a troll is *someone who posts inflammatory, extraneous, or off-topic messages in an online community, such as an online discussion forum, chat room, or blog, with the primary intent of provoking readers into an emotional response*.

For you older, non internet-savvy folk, the above definition is a very baseline definition of trolling – trolling, much like any other social activity, has the capability to evolve as its user sees fit. Take, for instance, this perfectly-executed trolling by Jahed Momand several weeks ago, in which he posted an *inflammatory comment* which *provoked JC into an emotional response*; Jahed’s comment, however, was deleted a short moment later. The result? Well, just look at this unprovoked outlash by JC:

http://i.imgur.com/bhyjb.png

Jesus, JC. Quit acting like you have turrets. Calm the fuck down.

So, trolling is not just posting things or saying rude shit, it’s also manipulating and twisting others words and actions around to piss them off. That’s the end game of serious trolling: when it’s all said and done, the target victim needs to have so much adrenaline coursing through their veins that they could smash their monitor in without thinking twice.

What makes a good troll, though? How exactly do you troll? What’s the point of it all? And why is JC the only one being trolled?

These are all good questions. Let’s begin with some of the characteristics that define a successful troll: cunning, smugness, and wit. You read that right – trolls are, generally speaking, *extremely intelligent* creatures. They know how peoples’ minds work, how to manipulate them, and how to *piss people off.* It’s a survival tactic. Revert back to the definition. If you’re “trolling” and not making anyone upset or angry, guess what? You ain’t trollin’. Still not convinced? Let’s look at JC’s three primary trolls:

http://i.imgur.com/3VzlP.png

All of us, despite what internets may believe true, happen to be fairly educated and established individuals – not to sound conceited, but we sure ain’t flippin’ burgers at McDonalds. 

I cannot speak for the other two, but I was raised in the South, went to college up North, and met a whole bunch of people of different race, religion, sexual orientation, political beliefs, and personalities in between. I was raised in a family where two languages were spoken. I’ve travelled to foreign countries, continental and overseas. While I sure as hell don’t know everything about how people operate, I sure know a lot more than your average Joe. “People experience” is a powerful tool to have in your trolling arsenal. That said, we can define trolling as not necessarily being a learned tactic (in the sense that someone could *teach* you how to troll), but one that is intrinsically acquired through years and years of real world interaction and experience.

By this point you might be thinking, “OGM DAT’S ME LOL!” and guess what, asshole? You could be absolutely right! Without you even knowing it, that inner troll has probably been trying to gnaw and bite his way out of your cerebral cortex for *years* now, only to be suppressed by societal norms. The nerve of modern-day society – oy vey.

Trolling is an art. To break it to you plain and simple, there isn’t any definite way of showing someone how to troll; much like dieting or weightlifting, what works for you may not work for the next person. Everyone gets to be their own special snowflake and, over time, develops their own method that complements their personality best.

http://i.imgur.com/m0yS0.png

Let’s observe matberry’s method of trolling. 

Having a PhD in philosophy, he refines peoples’ thought processes (or whatever it is they do), with a heavy focus on the area of exercise psychology. Probably whips up a damn good Pumpkin Spice Crème Frappuccino at Starbucks too. You can check out some of his work at your local coffee shop or on www.myosynthesis.com – there’s good shit there.

If you’ve played on the internet at all in the past year, you may have come across some of his work. You’ve indisputably come across some of his trolling.

If you’ve seen his trolling, then, you know he’s nothing shy of an expert. But what is it that makes him so *damn* good at trolling? Aside from the fact that his profile picture has been trollface.jpg for millennia, matberry *knows his audience* and that, my friends, is his means to success. 

Much of his trolling dabbles in the area of “bro-science,” which we’ve all bore witness to with a simple Google search to bodybuilding.com – if you’re discussing optimal carbohydrate timing after your fourth meal of the day but before your eighth on a controlled bulk, rest assured that matberry will swoop in like fucking Batman with relevant yet irrelevant PubMed articles that not only use your own arguments against you, but also make you look like a complete and total douchebag moron, further humiliating you in front of your peers, xXcurlzbroXx, FKBTCHSGTMONY, and DickTalens. When you finally come to grips with what just happened within your infinitesimal brain, you’ll see matberry is nowhere to be found. Like Batman, damnit. Like Batman.

I honestly don’t give him enough credit. He’s been my inspiration since day one.

http://i.imgur.com/PDADO.png

Don’t get caught up in the specifics of his methods. Remember, *everyone is different.* With practice, you too can become a trolling superstar. Like me.

Some of you reading this may be shaking your heads thinking, “Why the fuck do you even bother? Go outside you fkn fag,” to which I say “u mad?” Think for a moment – if you’re getting upset while reading this, *by definition* I’m trolling you. But the real reason that I, along with many others, troll and will continue to troll is because it’s fucking *fun.*

Recall a couple of weeks ago. D-Day. The storming of JCD Beach. Operation Trollverlord. *His birthday.* Many of you, up till now, failed to realize that May 30th was not JC’s birthday but actually an elaborate scheme developed by yours truly, and executed by the three musketeers – me, Jihad bin Laden, and matberry.

**The birth of an empirical idea:**
http://i.imgur.com/A5dSd.png

Note the date in the photo. In the course of two days (thanks matberry for being on New Zealand time and fucking everything up), JC Deen’s wall was transformed into a birthday apocalypse:

http://i.imgur.com/jCJbd.png

Millions of Facebook users from around the globe flocked to his wall and for nearly 36 hours straight, a birthday bonanza unfolded as the “t” and “y” keys on JC’s keyboard slowly dwindled into nothingness. The battle was won. The war was over. There was nothing left of JC Deen’s Facebook page except for melted ice cream and leftover cake frosting which some fat bitch probably ate for breakfast the next day. Overall, it was a tremendous victory for the trio – needless to say, champagne bottles were uncorked and emptied out that night.

I recall a moment some time back where Rog Law referred to me as being a “monogamous troll,” in that only one person is victimized and suffers from my rampant trolling: Mr. Deen himself. To be quite frank, I had no retort. Why is it that I honed in on JC and JC only? Why don’t I spice things up and troll Bret? Or Eric? Why don’t I troll this chick:

http://i.imgur.com/TS9Xj.png

who believes (or believed) dietary fat to be filled with carbohydrates that will cause her to gain weight? Read what she said. Now do it again. Holy shit, it’s like macronutrient inception: dietary fat inside a carbohydrate inside a fat reservoir. **DA FUQ BRO**

Point is, I don’t really know why I only troll JC. I do know he’s fun to troll and I mean, he’s kinda cute. In a gay way. I’d hit it.

I hope this internets pamphlet helped some of you who may be confused about trolling and why the denizens of the internets continue to troll. Hopefully I inspired you to start your own trolling career. To that I say: Go forth. Become great."

So my girlfriend and I have been hooking up for about a year and a half and dating for the better part of a year.  We have yet to have any major arguments and things are going really great!  We share most of the same opinions and outlooks and I think I'm starting to love her.

The problem:  I'm extremely driven (professionally and academically) and she's...well, not.  I always pictured my future partner being as motivated to succeed as I am.  The last thing I really want is to be the head of a single-income household.  I'm on track for a very successful engineering career (well paying internships with prestigious companies and I was flown out to Stanford to perform research with a lab for a semester).  On the other hand, she failed out of sociology freshman year and is very uncertain of what she wants to do with her life.  Whatever it is, she will likely depend on her future husband to provide for the family (though money does NOT matter to her.  I'm confident she'd be content with a combined income of 50k/yr).

Similarly, I'm very curious and get by pretending to be intelligent while friends ask me how I can be so patient with her (stereotypical blonde).  I come from a rather poor family while she comes from a decently wealthy one.  I've supported myself since I was 16 while she has never had a job and I honestly can't picture her in a professional setting.

Ultimately, I'm not sure what to do about the future.  I always pictured being with someone as driven as myself and she's quite the opposite.  On the other hand, I really love spending time with her and for the time being, we have a great relationship.  Any advice?

Thank you for taking the time to read this, I'd love to hear your opinions!


tl;dr- Our relationship is going great.  However, her lack of drive concerns me about her future.  I'm scared of having a ""trophy"" wife.  Advice?

Edit- If the community needs any more information, I'd be happy to provide it."

v7zrr,5,2012-06-18,Have you ever sabotaged your own path to success after getting yourself so close to your dreams? I'm getting there.,icedmatcha,selfhelp,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhelp/comments/v7zrr/have_you_ever_sabotaged_your_own_path_to_success/,"When I was 18 I was shunned by my group of friends after confronting my then 'good friend' of the fact that her uncle raped me. She quickly twisted my cry for help into something far less sympathetic, and as a result I became alienated. My first real relationship fell apart a few months earlier, home was anything but peaceful and I spiralled into depression. 

I turned my basement into a bedroom and proceeded to spend almost two years hidden in that room. On several occasions I would find myself trembling in tears during the dead of night, because I felt alone, and I knew that as a result of my alienation, nobody would have noticed my absence. I had no friends, a terrible relationship with my family, poor health and no motivation. 

Finally after an aborted suicide attempt (my older sister walked in on me when I was in the process of hanging myself), I realized that I was punishing myself for people's misdoing. I mustered up all the dignity I had left - along with a small fortune, got myself in shape, purchased a new wardrobe and at 20 applied for another program that would lead me to the dream job I held on to before and during my breakdown.

I landed myself multiple jobs and internships to prepare myself for my new career, and accumulate an impressive resume. This September I will be entering an amazing PR Program and finding myself several steps closer to my dream. I am living with my soulmate, have a ridiculously wonderful relationship with my family, and plenty of friends. But as the reality of my improvement in life and happiness kicked in, I am not finding myself unconsciously creating problems. Recently I've been ignoring my friends, slacking off at work, picking fights with my S/O and hesitating to go back to school. It finally hit me that I am going to be some average asian nerd, trying to excel in a program (literally) filled with good looking/hot blondes. Now, I find myself wanting to quit.  I can't bring myself to network anymore. I try to convince myself that my intelligence and experience would be my advantage; however sitting in a room full of beautiful people who probably possess the same skills and intelligence as myself is intimidating, and almost unbearable. I am by no means pretty, nor do I have as many twitter followers, or social media contacts as them. I find myself falling further and further behind. At times I feel as if the coordinator accepted me into the program as a cruel joke, or worse: the token ethnic. "

[Parents..........go! how do they act? any instance of special asshattery?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v6zm3/iama_worker_on_the_childrens_wing_of_a_pysch/c51wri8?context=5)|Parents, I've been waiting for this. Anytime someone asks me if my job makes me hate kids me response is ""It makes me hate the adults raising the kids alot more"" so experiences with parents usually goes one of the following ways.
 |If the kids been hospitalized before, the parents are usually pretty chill, they know the routine etc.
 |We then have the parents who refuse to leave their child with us. Basically in MA if a section 12 is filed on you, you must be hospitalized for up to 72 hours for obsevation. Alot of the times parents will refuse to leave the hospital or will try to take their kid with them. This is when we have to call the cops to deal with the parents.
 |I have two instances of special asshattery.
 |We have ""passes"" on the weekends where a child and their parents can visit off the unit as long as they stay on hospital grounds. Mom took the kid on pass then just drove the kid home. AFter we called the cops and got the kid back, she filed abuse charges against everyone on out unit...all unfounded but still a pain to deal with.
 |We had this 11 yo girl admitted for routine stuff, fighting at school, making suicidal statements, drinking a bit. She comes and her mom is a bitch to her the entire time, swearing at her, telling her she hopes we keep her for months etc. Cut to two weeks later, the girls discharged to her mom (we informed DCF about suspected abuse, they didnt see an issue) Girls back three weeks later because her mom tried to kill her and her little sister. My patient actually caught her mom choking her sister and fought her off. But yeah, if I ever see that mom again I will kick the shit out of her. No questions about it.
[*We had this 11 yo girl admitted for routine stuff...drinking a bit.*  I did a double-take.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v6zm3/iama_worker_on_the_childrens_wing_of_a_pysch/c51yi0s?context=5)|When I first started I thought it was silly they didn't have a kid's admission packet that omitted that substance use questions, after the first week I realized just how many kids were using drugs/alcohol.
[It's kind of sad that an 11 year old drinking a bit and making suicide attempts is ""pretty routine""](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v6zm3/iama_worker_on_the_childrens_wing_of_a_pysch/c51yeyr?context=5)|Just a clarification she was making suicidal statements, she didn't have any attempts.
[Most fucked up / scary story to tell ?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v6zm3/iama_worker_on_the_childrens_wing_of_a_pysch/c51w0o0?context=5)|There are way too many. One that comes to my mind right now involved this 5 year old boy we had, he was severely sexually and physically abused and thus had a history of sexually acting out. One day I was sitting outside his room playing with him.  Out of no where starts telling me to suck his dick. I try to talk him down, he then pulls his pants down, and proceeds to grab my hair and tries to pull me head down to his penis, i was able to get him off of me but still having a kid that young, already acting that violently and sexual to this day fucks with me a bit.
[Are you make or female? I mean, as much as the whole situation is fucked up, the degree of how fucked up it is changes depending on your gender. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v6zm3/iama_worker_on_the_childrens_wing_of_a_pysch/c51y2as?context=5)|I'm female.
[Are there ever kids or adolescents coming in who you consider so dangerous, like psychopaths, harming others and fully aware of what they're doing? and would you think it's better to keep them locked up for life?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v6zm3/iama_worker_on_the_childrens_wing_of_a_pysch/c51wlg1?context=5)|One kid (a 9yo boy) in particular comes to mind. He's been in twice, once for killing his neighbors dog and once for trying to murder his baby brother. He came at me with a toobrush he had snapped in half once He was such a good liar, and manipulative and could be so charming. You can't diagnose a sociopath that young, but none of us who worked with him will be surprised if he's the next Ted Bundy.
 |But in spite of that, as far as children go, I am completely against forced institutionalization 
[Wow i'm in shock, i was actually expecting to hear: no that only happens in movies or something. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v6zm3/iama_worker_on_the_childrens_wing_of_a_pysch/c51wqlq?context=5)|I guess I should add that it is pretty rare. Even my coworkers who have been in the field 30+ years said he was one of the worst kids we had...so it happens but rarely.
[Sometimes clinicians (that I've known\) have diagnosed child antisocial PD under PDNOS.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v6zm3/iama_worker_on_the_childrens_wing_of_a_pysch/c51xbx0?context=5)|Yeah most I've worked with prefer not to just because technically according the DSM you can't be diagnosed antisocial until your 18, even if its under PDNOS. Most I know will label it as conduct disorder (which is pretty much just a child version of anti-social PD)
[What's PDNOS?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v6zm3/iama_worker_on_the_childrens_wing_of_a_pysch/c51y4nd?context=5)|Personality Disorder Not Otherwise Specified.
[I'd always heard ""PDDNOS"" - Pervasive Developmental Disorder, Not Otherwise Specified, but it's nothing like what you are describing - at least not what I've learned of. Do you know if they are just to very similarly-named, different disorders?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v6zm3/iama_worker_on_the_childrens_wing_of_a_pysch/c51yjcb?context=5)|Yeah, PD is any type of personality disorder. ANd most psych disorders have a NOS category, for example Anxiety NOS, EDNOS (eating disorder NOS etc)

This 7 yo girl (who was one of the cutest things ever) and this boy are having a fight. I seperate them but they're still yelling down the hall to each other. SHe tells him to go suck his dad's dick. He says that his Dad is dead. She replies ""Good then go dig up his fucking bodies and suck the maggots out of his dick then""  There was defiently a good 20 second silence while me, the coworkers, and other kids tried to take that comment in.

I had gone over to the adult unit just to provide an extra body becuase they were having a pretty hectic night and all the kids were sleeping. I'm just chilling over there when all of a sudden this women sees me and goes ""Fuck you bitch! You think you can fuck my husband and steal my crocodile""then proceeded to try to punch me. Good times.
[Why did you steal her crocodile?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v6zm3/iama_worker_on_the_childrens_wing_of_a_pysch/c51ydaj?context=5)|A crocodile's a dangerous item. I can't have that shit roaming my units.

Do you see yourself continuing to do this job?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v6zm3/iama_worker_on_the_childrens_wing_of_a_pysch/c51xkf3?context=5)|I personally like working with the kids more, but the adult unit is also really interesting. I'm starting grad school in the fall to get my master's in counseling so I see myself staying at this particular job until I have my masters.
[What education do you have? I'm just curious, in terms of job qualifications and whatnot, as I'm preparing to enter this field in the next year or two.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v6zm3/iama_worker_on_the_childrens_wing_of_a_pysch/c51z7t8?context=5)|I have a bachelor's in psych.
[What is the youngest child you have had admitted?  Roughly what percentage of children you see do you think will be able to be independently functioning adults?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v6zm3/iama_worker_on_the_childrens_wing_of_a_pysch/c51vnlz?context=5)|The youngest age we will admit is age 4, and we have had a good amount of them while I've been working there.
 |The functional adult question is a little bit tougher. Ideally, I hope with intervening this young, most will be able to function as an independent adult. Realistically, I'd say probablly about 50-75% will be able to do so. Most of the cases where I think they'll have problems as adults, are the severely abused and the ones getting bounced around in DCF custody. The system sucks, so I have less realistic hope for those kids.
[What was the four year old admitted for?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v6zm3/iama_worker_on_the_childrens_wing_of_a_pysch/c51z70d?context=5)|We have had a few since I've been there. One told his pregant mom he was gonna kill the baby then stabbed mom in the belly with a fork. Another recent was a 4 year old girl who lit her mom's bed on fire (while her mom was sleeping in it) because she ""wanted mommy to go to hell so she made it hell""
[Was the child abused? Or does this just happen for no reason?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v6zm3/iama_worker_on_the_childrens_wing_of_a_pysch/c5202go?context=5)|Yeah there was abuse in both cases, most of our kids have some type of trauma history.
[Do the kids have to wake up by a certain time?  Can a kid stay up later than 8 or 9?  Male to female ratio?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v6zm3/iama_worker_on_the_childrens_wing_of_a_pysch/c51xy3a?context=5)|Kids can stay up later than 8-9 but they have to be doing something quietly in their room after that time  Male to female depends. We can have up to 14 kids, and the ratio varies all the time.
[If one of them is schizophrenia, how are you told to deal with it? Are you told to act like some of the hallucinations are real if the child is young and doesn't know any better?  How many patients are there per room?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v6zm3/iama_worker_on_the_childrens_wing_of_a_pysch/c51xy3a?context=5)|We don't have too many kids with visual hallucinations but when we do how we handle does depend on the age and if they are able to grasp the concept of a hallucination. Its not ideal, but sometimes we will pretend they're real if its the only option. For ex, this one 4 yo would always complain of seeing snakes. If we ""killed"" the snake he would calm down.
[Most fucked up example of parenting?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v6zm3/iama_worker_on_the_childrens_wing_of_a_pysch/c51xy3a?context=5)|All the rooms either have 2 patients or 1 patient.

[On the other hand, do you feel that sometimes the institution you are working for is bad for a particular child recovery and may be pushing him down?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v6zm3/iama_worker_on_the_childrens_wing_of_a_pysch/c523kqi?context=5)|It can happen sometimes. A big thing that happens is alot of the times certain kids will bully another kid. Us as staff do our best to keep them seprated or are civil to eachother but kids do tend to bully eachother which is obviously not the best for their recovery.
[I don't know if you have experience with this, but what happens when the child's family disagree with the doctors about treatment, i.e. refuse to treat with medications? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v6zm3/iama_worker_on_the_childrens_wing_of_a_pysch/c51ww3y?context=5)|Well we cannot give meds without the parents consent to each specific med so in that case they just do all the therapy and stuff without medicine. 
[Are social services more likely to be notified about a family if the parents do not consent to medicines?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v6zm3/iama_worker_on_the_childrens_wing_of_a_pysch/c51ygv6?context=5)|Nope that's entirely in their right.
[Have there ever been guardianship issues when the parents are being ""holier than thou"" and the therapy alone isn't working?  Just curious.  Not saying a pill cures all (it doesn't, working in pharmacy I get sick of this question\).

But since we are designed as a short term unit, unfortunately what happens in this case is the patient is discharged even if they aren't better.

[So, job interview! I ask you why you decided to pursue a career in this field. Do you give me that true story or go with the safe bet and make up some nice BS? Personally I think I'd go with the true story (it sounds very poetic\) but replace the ETOH / drug use with something less severe.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v6zm3/iama_worker_on_the_childrens_wing_of_a_pysch/c52fxt1?context=5)|I used a toned down version that didnt involve the inpatient stay but mentioned that i stuggled with depression and anxiety when i was youner

I do believe that starting talk therapy and learning coping skills at a younger age is beneficial in the long run. On the other hand, alot of these kids are of anti-depressants, anti-psychotics etc, which I think in the long run is worse for the kids because their tolerance level is similar to an adult, so the meds lose their effectiveness.
[I feel the same way about the talk therapy vs. drugs. Diagnosing mental abnormalities in children and prescribing psychotropic drugs to 'correct' them is a very slippery slope.  How long do patients stay in the childrens wing for? Have you bonded with any kids in particular?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v6zm3/iama_worker_on_the_childrens_wing_of_a_pysch/c51w3rh?context=5)|Most kids stay about 5-14 days or so. Though if a child is still having problems they will stay for longer. We have had kids there for 3 or 4 months before.
[My question: daily seeing all these kids that are messed up, do you think you would ever want one of your own? Do you already have one?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v6zm3/iama_worker_on_the_childrens_wing_of_a_pysch/c51zmwt?context=5)|I don't have kids, and working here does make me slightly terrified to have on haha but yeah I do still want kids eventually. Also, its made me consider adopting kids  more seeing all the foster kids we have. I'm considering adopting a few older kids just because it sucks seeing these kids who have been in the system for years and are probablly not ever going to be adopted because of their ages and histories.
[ off, thank you so much! It takes a strong and special person to do what you do.  Sorry if this sounds really nihilistic, but are there any patients that you don't think will ever be able to function in society? Any hopeless cases? If so, what is their future like? Institutions? Group homes?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v6zm3/iama_worker_on_the_childrens_wing_of_a_pysch/c51ylie?context=5)|Not so much on the children's unit, but on the adult units there are weekly trials to determine if patients should be institutionalized at a state hospital.
[Are these children coming from abusive home lives? Trauma?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v6zm3/iama_worker_on_the_childrens_wing_of_a_pysch/c51zd05?context=5)|Yeah about 80% of these kids have some type of confirmed abuse or trauma history. And of the remaining 20% there are definetly some kids who have abuse/trauma but are not disclosing it.
[Yea sorry! Like what is the difference between this and a normal hospital. Are there group therapy sessions, or that sort of regular event? Is it kind of like a prison in a way? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v6zm3/iama_worker_on_the_childrens_wing_of_a_pysch/c51xdv9?context=5)|Yeah there are group therapy sessions run a few times a day. We are strictly a psych hospital, so we don't have the same equipment/set up as a regular hospital. And as much as I hate to say it, there are some similarities between it and prison. Locked doors, strict routine, unbreakable windows etc.
[Have you had any patients you especially bonded with? was it hard to say goodbye?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v6zm3/iama_worker_on_the_childrens_wing_of_a_pysch/c51zw2v?context=5)|Yeah, actually oddly enough that 5yo who tried to force me to give him a blowjob. He ended up being there for three months, and he needed alot of 1:1 time just because he was so volatile with other patients, we bonded. And it was def hard to say goodbye, esp because his abusive parents were giving custody of him again and he was being discharged home. Hands down the most upsetting thing that ever happened 
[How did you get this job? Do they accept volunteers on the floor? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v6zm3/iama_worker_on_the_childrens_wing_of_a_pysch/c51xd5j?context=5)|We don't have any volunteers, everyone is salaried. My position is entry-level in the psych field so some hospitals only will require a high school diploma while others require an associates or bachelors. Personally, I have a BA in psych.
[Is parenting getting better or worse?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v6zm3/iama_worker_on_the_childrens_wing_of_a_pysch/c51xq77?context=5)|The head child psychiatrist once told me the following and I think it answers the question. ""The one constant in this field is that some parents will suck and others won't"" I personally  dont think is a generational thing thats improving or devolving.
[Has your hospital received any donations from Child's Play?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v6zm3/iama_worker_on_the_childrens_wing_of_a_pysch/c51xvmv?context=5)|No we haven't unfortunately. The latest video game system he have on the unit are gameboy colors.

I am primarily research-focused, but am working on an internship in a MFT clinic. What in your opinion is the best method to bridge the gap between research and practice? I sometimes feel like I'm doing nothing useful for the children you see when I'm sitting in the lab doing lit review after lit review. Even the terminology is euphemized in the literature, so far removed from its' actual human presentation. It takes a lot to force yourself to think about what ""negative urgency, etc."" actually means. What are your opinions regarding this?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v6zm3/iama_worker_on_the_childrens_wing_of_a_pysch/c51xeur?context=5)|I definetly think research plays is just as important as clinical work. Most of the time I'm using all the concepts I've learned in my classes without consciously realizing them. For example, when a kid has a good day and I decide to give them an extra 10 minutes to stay up before bed even, or make them go to bed early if they had a bad day I dont think to myself ""Why, thats some nice operant conditioning."" when really thats all it is

I guess it would depend on the severity of the issues, the kids age etc.
[ off, thank you for what you do.  Do you or someone else use any art therapy techniques with your patients and if so, does it help? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v6zm3/iama_worker_on_the_childrens_wing_of_a_pysch/c51ztzb?context=5)|Yeah actually we have an art therapist do a group with the kids almost daily, and most of the kids love it and I think it does help them process things that are hard for them to vocalize. That being said most of the adults patients think its bull shit haha.

What happened?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v6zm3/iama_worker_on_the_childrens_wing_of_a_pysch/c51zb0h?context=5)|Not too often, most of the time people come in with diagnoses they've had  for a while so we don't often do any intial disgnostics. The most common thing though is when someone comes in with depression symptoms, and are given anti-depressants, often times if they are actually bipolar instead of depressed the anit-depressants will make the patient manic.

[As a guy who's brother was in a teen psych ward I want to thank you.  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v6zm3/iama_worker_on_the_childrens_wing_of_a_pysch/c521756?context=5)|No problem :)
[How much do parents have to pay on average for meds etc...](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v6zm3/iama_worker_on_the_childrens_wing_of_a_pysch/c51xgm6?context=5)|This I'm not really sure about. I know insurance covers most if not all of it, but I don't have much to do with billing and stuff.
[It was an abandoned children's pysch ward until they took it down. Operational into the late 90's I think. It was like 20 minutes from Boston. It was really sketchy, but there's fun downhill mountain biking nearby.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v6zm3/iama_worker_on_the_childrens_wing_of_a_pysch/c51ws10?context=5)|Oh ok cool. I was still in middle school in the 90's so that's probablly why I never heard of it lol.
[I've been to a psych hospital in MA, and was in a children's unit. The schedule that you explained was exactly how I remember it. I'm wondering if I know you... All I really feel comfortable saying is that it was Westwood Lodge and that I fucking hated that place.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v6zm3/iama_worker_on_the_childrens_wing_of_a_pysch/c51wqjm?context=5)|DMH has most of the activities standardized. Pretty much every children's unit has a similar schedule.
[Did you ever work at Gaebler?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v6zm3/iama_worker_on_the_childrens_wing_of_a_pysch/c51wn2m?context=5)|Never heard of it actually.
[Doesn't this violate an ethics code of some sort?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v6zm3/iama_worker_on_the_childrens_wing_of_a_pysch/c520lag?context=5)|Nope. If I started naming patients then it would be.
[When u say priv do u mean they have to be good to get to go outside and how long are sum kids there for?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v6zm3/iama_worker_on_the_childrens_wing_of_a_pysch/c51w6k6?context=5)|Outside privs first have to be awarded to the child's doctor, and only after they have been in the hospital for at least 24 hours. If the kids become assaultive or start acting up in any other major way, we can take away their outdoor privs for the day.Typical length of stay is 5-14 days, though we have had kids stay for months before.
[Do you substitute the out door privs with some other exercise?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v6zm3/iama_worker_on_the_childrens_wing_of_a_pysch/c527g97?context=5)|We try to. We have an indoor basket ball hoop we set up times. And well do things like keep away and stuff in the hallways.
[Ty, interesting ama.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v6zm3/iama_worker_on_the_childrens_wing_of_a_pysch/c51waux?context=5)|No problem, thanks for the questions :)
[How many people do you personally mistreat? i've seen fucks like you mistreat patients for no reason.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v6zm3/iama_worker_on_the_childrens_wing_of_a_pysch/c52055v?context=5)|None actually. I've actually set the record for the amount of times I've been listed under the ""staff who would always go the extra mile"" on these surveys we give patients upon discharge. I'm kind of a big deal.

v7ntp,1,2012-06-18,[Request] In the process of cutting nicotine from my life! In need of a little help (nothing huge).,[deleted],randomactsofkindness,https://www.reddit.com/r/randomactsofkindness/comments/v7ntp/request_in_the_process_of_cutting_nicotine_from/,"***Background:*** 

I started using tobacco when I was 15. I'm now almost 19 and have decided I've had enough with this substance controlling my life! I was a 2 pack a day smoker or a can a day chewer, ew. I've been using an e-cigarette to slowly ween myself off of the nicotine for about 4 months since I can't afford the patch or the gum and have no insurance to cover it. I've made it down to 1.2% nicotine by volume which is fairly low. 

***What I'm asking for and why:*** 

I'm hoping someone can help me out with getting a 3 pack of the 0.6% nic. by volume cartridges and a 3 pack of the 0% nic. cartridges. I've come to Reddit as a last resort. As of right now I'm at an unpaid internship which will turn into a pretty nice job in a few months, but I am ready to quit now. 

If you are willing to help you may PM me and I will give you details to the cartridges which are $10 a 3 pack. I would be very grateful.

vappp,1,2012-06-19,Looking for C++ Projects!,waddlingGiraffe,engineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/vappp/looking_for_c_projects/,I'm looking for some projects I can use to brush up on my C++ before my summer internship. I want to make sure I leave a good first impression. Any good resources or suggestions?
vajy8,3,2012-06-19,Should I just enjoy the moment or try and turn this into something?,twistoffate,LongDistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/vajy8/should_i_just_enjoy_the_moment_or_try_and_turn/,"Okay so I'm not sure if this is the right subreddit, but I'm not sure if r/relationships would quite get it. Sorry if this gets long, I must've re-written it like a thousand times before I finally posted. 

So I met this guy from my hometown on vacation last month, and I think the attraction was pretty instant. Unfortunately it was near the end of my trip so I'm only basing this off only a few days of knowing each other. The tension was practically tangible, but, we were constantly ""chaperoned"" more or less by his coworkers (I already knew them, that's how we got to talking, they introduced him to me as the ""new guy"") so he had to stay professional. Maybe part of it was that it felt so forbidden, but we managed to steal a kiss the night before I left and I can't stop thinking about it :) And we've kept in contact ever since, flirty texts and stuff. 

So, he's planning on visiting me next month so of course I'm really excited about that, but we live so far away from each other ($500 plane ride). So unless one of us were planning on moving soon there isn't much to go on... Well actually, I *am* moving- but for 6 months halfway across the world for an internship in the fall.  Definitely complicates things, but because of that I might move home for one full month in the spring (saves on rent, Ill probably be broke after my trip!), so we will only be a few minutes' drive away then. 

But basically, is this doomed from the start? Even if he wants to visit me in Europe, that brings us to a grand total of having ""met"" 4 times in a whole year, with a giant question mark of anything after that, if it even goes that far... 

I also acknowledge that I don't know him very well, and I'm wary of letting things get too heated while he's staying with me next month, I don't want him to think I'm just some international booty :|. But obviously, I really want to and don't want him to lose interest either. I think best case scenario would be like a When Harry Met Sally/Serendipity (don't judge!) sort of thing, where the timing keeps being off until finally it's right? Is that worth hoping for? Or should I just enjoy my renewed sense of having a real crush again, make him sleep on the couch and leave him (and me) wanting more?

Some background on me, I've been single for about a year after a string of long-term relationships, took the time to enjoy being single and have been dating really superficially for a while. He is the first person to come along that I really am excited about, getting butterflies when I think about him and shit like that :] I haven't felt this way since I met my last ex 3 years ago... I don't think I can just give up on it so easily :(. Also, just for info, he's 26 working in a real office and I'm 22 still a boring student with part time jobs. As for him, he does seem like a really nice guy, really funny, and although it's a secret from his work, I know they'd warn me if they saw us becoming friends and thought anything of it. All the stories I've heard about him from them before always just reinforce the fact that he's a good guy.

TL;DR: met a great guy from my hometown, trying to decide if I should vest myself into it (specifically when he visits me!) if I don't know what'll happen once he leaves. 

Pleease help, just typing this I can tell it's not the greatest idea, but I see so much potential and I haven't felt like this (so intense so soon!) in years! 

Also: I know a lot of you would kill to be able to see an SO that often, sorry in advance if I come off whiny. Its just all new and confusing so I want to hear from people who've been in this kind of situation before instead of asking people who'll invariably tell me I'm young/long distance never works/ I should forget about it.

I currently have a System Administrator job at a small eCommerce company with a Salary of 50k a year. I worked my way up from an intern to helpdesk to system admin over the past four years. However, I got a call this morning offering me a job as an Active Directory Admin offering 90k a year + benefits.

**So here are the pros/cons for my current job:**

**PROS**

-Good salary 50k + benefits

-Been here 4 years so I know the network very well

-Very lenient with hours/college.

-Learning all technologies, not just one IT area.

-Know most of the management and they know me.

-Only 10 miles from my house

-Stable in my position, I don't see me being fired or let go soon, however, the CEO made a comment the other day ""Here are the IT guys, we decided not to outsource this department yet.""

**CONS**

-I do everything, network, DNS, DHCP, routing, switching, fiber, SAN. So when something breaks they always bypass everyone and call me, I have become the ""IT guy.""

-Terrible health insurance, almost $300 every two weeks for just me.

-Company is not improving in profit, been about 8 million a year profit for the past 5 or 6 years.






**The Pros and cons for the offered job:**

**PROS**

-Better Salary 90k + benefits

-Fortune 1000 company so much more profitable.

-Better Health Insurance and other benefits (life insurance, cell phone discount)

-Will only be doing Active Directory only, so I only focus on one item.

**CONS**

-Farther away from my house. (about 35 miles)

-I only know one person (guy whom offered it to me)

-Iffy if they will be lenient on my school or not.

-Will it be stable? 

-Still learning powershell and in their job position they state that is a plus. I guess being thrown in head first is a great way to learn it.

-Will only be doing Active Directory, so learning opportunity as a whole is decreased.

Any opinions on the matter, I love learning all the stuff at my job currently. However, I could use the extra money, and I get to learn in-depth active directory (a new car as my current one is about 15 years old).

**EDIT:** I will have a daughter to look after too in about a month. So im trying to decide what is best for me/her. "

Only full time positions are available, no internships, part time, or summer work programs. Thanks!

**What we do**

We develop 911 emergency and public safety software. Our software revolutionizes the way emergency first responders receive calls, react, and deliver critical emergency services to the public. We believe that by applying innovation to the public safety sector, we can make a difference in people’s lives. Our products include next generation VoIP 911 communication (voice, sms text, and video), computer-aided dispatch, GPS enabled mobile units for fire/police/EMS, maps and live data delivery, police and fire post incident management/investigations, and data mining/reporting.

**How we do it**

We believe in agile software development. Our well defined and efficient processes are backed by the best tooling we can find. Some of the tools we use include JIRA, GreenHopper, FishEye, Confluence, SpiraTest, Balsamiq, Subversion, and Jenkins. We believe in continuous integration, unit testing, and automated testing. We like clean code.

Developer happiness is important to us. Work areas are quiet, spacious, window-facing, and all developers get fast boxes with dual 24” monitors. We have our own development lab to run load tests or bask in the warm hum of the server racks. Our systems engineers ensure that production issue distractions are kept to a minimum. Our QA group keeps us in check and even helps with the automated testing.

We’re looking for people passionate about software development. If you have side projects, contribute to open source, or enjoy reading about and discussing technology, then you sound like a great fit. We believe a strong foundation of data structures, algorithms, and design patterns is important. Our product line covers many diverse development areas such as distributed soa, web, backend, mobile, maps/gis, databases, caching, reporting, data indexing, and high availability. Each of these areas in a mission critical environment contains their own unique and difficult problems to solve. As such, a strong foundation coupled with the desire to learn, grow, and solve hard problems would make for a strong addition to our team.

**Junior Developer**

You have the passion and are ready for a challenge but are still getting started with less than a few years experience. You have exposure to some of the technologies listed, and are very eager to learn more while becoming stronger in the areas you already know. 

**Mid-Level Developer**

You are a seasoned developer with 2 to 5 years experience that can solve tough problems. You’re strong in at least one area of the software stack and are eager to expand into others. You are familiar with best practices and know how to write clean code.

**Senior Developer**

You are a very strong developer with over 5 years of experience. You are adept at breaking down and solving very complex and difficult problems. You’ve been exposed to most areas in the software stack and very strong in a few of them. You’re able to learn and integrate new technologies independently. You enjoy mentoring and guiding the more junior engineers.

**Technologies and Frameworks**

All of our developers have the freedom to pick the best tools to solve the problem at hand. Some specific technologies we like to use include Java 6 (soon to be 7), Spring, JPA/Hibernate, EHCache, PostgreSQL, H2, Web Services (SOAP and REST), Asynchronous messaging, Apache Lucene, Java Server Faces 2, Primefaces, HTML 5, CSS 3, WebSockets, JQuery, Android, Swing, TestNG, Selenium, Maven, JasperReports, Jython, Bash, Geoserver, OpenLayers.

v94me,1,2012-06-18,FUCK DR. ASSHOLE,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/v94me/fuck_dr_asshole/,"Fuck Dr. Asshole. He was a first-time teacher I had in my senior year of high school for an AP class that completely fucked me over. Thanks to his incompetence and inability to teach effectively, I failed his class and was consequently rejected from all but one of my colleges I applied to as a senior. 

I knew before I even graduated high school that I would have to transfer, so I went to that one college that accepted me (piece of shit, low retention rate, degree mill school) and left for a better school that was unfortunately much, much more expensive. Why was it so expensive? Because I was a transfer. Because I joined in as a sophomore, I was so graciously given the scraps of the scraps of financial aid. Now I will be in over $130,000 in student loans by the time I graduate. 

What did Dr. Asshole do?

* i went to a private school so they made us buy our textbooks. Dr. asshole assigned us *the wrong textbook* at the beginning of the school year but didn't tell us until the end. meanwhile, we're being tested by material and questions from HIS textbook while we're studying ours. COMPLETELY USELESS INFORMATION. And he had the nerve to tell us, ""I never told you to buy that textbook."" FUCK YOU, IT CLEARLY STATED SO ON THE SCHOOL WEBSITE. 

* CONSTANTLY CONSTANTLY CONSTANTLY blab about his time in the military instead of relevant shit for the class. FUCK YOU. 

* assigned useless homework assignments that had no FUCKING relevance to the chapters/lessons

* created the curriculum as we ""went along"". mind you this is an AP class that was highly notorious for failing to provide their students with the necessary tools for success on the exam in the past, so he never had any real references to work from since every teacher in the past was some SHIT

* speaking of shitty teachers, Dr. Asshole teamed up with Ms. Idiot to teach the class together. Ms. Idiot was the teacher who taught this AP class last year (with little success I might add). Yes, even two teachers couldn't help our doomed souls. Oh and by the way, Dr. Asshole has a PhD in the same field as our AP class and Ms. Idiot has a law degree from an Ivy League. 



thanks to this horrible class, i've had to go to months therapy on multiple occasions. it was painful seeing my peers go on and enjoy their first and second choice schools while i had to suffered through mine at Remedial University. Now I'm in student debt from new school, ALL WHICH COULD HAVE BEEN AVOIDED IF DR. ASSHOLE KNEW HOW TO TEACH. By the way, let's not forget that this AP class was the EXACT field I wanted to go into when I applied for colleges. How do you think colleges feel when their applicant is FAILING a class that he wants to major in?

BTW: My high school was, like I mentioned, a private school. We paid for our textbooks and had a strict nun that prohibited dropping courses. Otherwise I would have PEACED THE FUCK OUT OF AP MISERY. Worst part? Dr. Asshole is our principal, and all of my peers (including our valedictorian and salutatorian) were FATASS PANSIES who refused to stick it to the man. This was his time teaching first high school.

And don't get me wrong; I did EVERYTHING in my power from asking for extra help, attending tutoring, getting help from other students, etc. to survive. Dr. Asshole was just TO FUCKING BLIND and had TOO BIG OF AN EGO to realize that he is just not as smart as he thinks. 


Pouring salt into my wounds: I want to go to graduate school in the very same field. I'm making outstanding grades, have a glowing résumé filled with lots of prestigious internships, and excelling in my undergraduate research. I want to join the Peace Corps too because my studies directly correlate with the ideals and mission of the PC. Problem is I have student debt from hell, which, again, COULD HAVE ALL BEEN AVOIDED IF HE FUCKING KNEW HOW TO TEACH. ONE FUCKING CLASS RUINED MY LIFE. The graduate school I'm looking at unfortunately requests high school transcripts. Guess who got boned in the ass when he found that out?


Why pick such an expensive school to transfer to? Hell if I know. Because I was transferring after one year of college, my high school transcript is still heavily weighted. Surprise surprise, I was rejected again from more schools but I had to get out of my first school. My school now was actually my top choice because it was famous for my program but at the price it's at, i find it harder and harder to realize what is it that I fell in love with at the first place. 

**tl;dr failed a class related to my would-be major during my senior year of high school because it was taught by an incompetent and egotistical monkey who taught hs for the first time. now i'm in student debt from hell because colleges don't like transfer students.** should have went to a community college.

vbddi,12,2012-06-20,So I've been slowly developing this ability within myself..,paddywhack,intj,https://www.reddit.com/r/intj/comments/vbddi/so_ive_been_slowly_developing_this_ability_within/,"...and to explain it I guess I'll have to share a bit about who I *was* and where I've come from **and** how the events of the last 22 months or so have profoundly impacted my life.
 
I used to be a pretty average guy all things considered. I went to a university, got a degree in software architecture and design. I've always considered myself clever I suppose, always trying de-construct whatever it is im faced with, working mentally from the big picture to finer and finer granularity. 

I was quite fortunate back in 3rd year university and made the choice to go out and get an internship for 18 months with a great company. After returning to school for a final year and graduating in May 2008 (just before the financial chaos on wall-street) it was shitty pickings for new careers.  Great IT company from internship wasn't hiring, tightened up budgets and yada yada, whatever. Ended up taking a consultant type gig in a different city, re-located myself and set up life. Within first 2 months of new career had a relationship dissolve that stung really deeply. Re-bounded within the first few months with another girl and had a tumultuous 6 months with her, great sex but complete breakdown of communication and having a common ground.  
End that relationship poorly. Begin solid stretch of forever alone from April 2009 'til my subconscious clawed at my being and I got up and took 6 weeks off work and did the whole south-east Asia thing.

Came back to a depressing cubicle, and a depressed me. ""What the fuck am I doing in life."" Never ever been one to transcribe my thoughts, emotions down on any sort of medium before.. I picked up a piece of paper one day and wrote an honest self-assessment, I didn't just think about it, I wrote it down in August 2010. I cried alone in the dark over it. I knew I had to make a change, to feel fulfilled, to dream again.
Newton's third law plays into effect here, objects in motion tend to stay in motion so my shitty slide continued until about twelve months ago. 

I got involved in a business opportunity. 

This lead me on a path of personal development that I sought out. I've always felt, as an INTJ that I can process enormous quantities of datum and time-sinks like Reddit are fuel for that internal capacity.
So instead of putting my time towards what I always did, I **chose** to spend time consuming materials that enhanced my life, adding value in trying to achieve my goals that I wrote down in my honest self-assessment of myself back in August 2010. 

It was slow at first, building new habits takes time. Read a bit here and there, was recommended new books. I enjoy reading, but often fall prey to starting and not finishing what I start. I really caught on to success audio from a monthly magazine subscription I bought. I never read the magazine, just fell in love with the monthly audio. It all compounded from there, I'm listening to atleast 3 hours a day of personal development audio. You would be surprised where you can find the time to squeeze it in.

Ni is the greatest gift we have.

Anyway's I kept at it, even when things got tough, always bringing myself back to my ""why"" ... that vision of my future self that I had a burning desire to fulfil. I must change.

Bringing this all back to the point of this whole posting in the first place, the **TL;DR**.  Tonight I was around a group of friends, and some new person was introduced to me, now this person was outgoing but I could feel the tension under her skin. Everyone was sharing insights into what motivates them and this girl couldn't even look people in the eyes. Her self-confidence was low.  Truthfully, how many of you would feel comfortable sharing feelings to complete strangers.  I honed in on this, and leveraged a skill-set I have been consciously trying to build within myself. I was able, through conversation applying tonal patterns and empathising, to elicit a powerful emotional response in this woman, this complete stranger. I brought her to tears and made her come to realize for herself her deepest fear in life is not living up her mothers exceptions of her and living in her older sisters shadow. 

The wildest and most unexpected aspect of this action tonight for me was that I was holding back the tears myself, I knew I was consciously driving this conversation to get a desired effect in this woman. And I knew that if I didn't slow it down I wouldn't of been able to hold it back I would have broken down because I realized that I was passing on the same opportunity to change her life circumstances that I had made myself.  I made her promise me right there that whenever life got hard, and when she might choose to give up on her decisions to better her life that she come back to this moment and know why she made the choice to improve her life. 

I am only consciously competent in this skillset I've been learning, my goal is to get to an un-consciously competent level .. sorta like knowing how to drive a manual transmission in a car after doing it for so long.

I am proud of myself.  I first had to share this with my girlfriend, and now I'm sharing it with you INTJ'ers because I know this will plant seeds in a few of you.

Please reddit, need some advice!",[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/vb9wd/my_mom_recently_had_30000_worth_of_jewelry_stolen/,"Just got off the phone with her. Might be a little lengthy but here's what I know:

My mom was out of town for Memorial Day Weekend and was gone for about a week. She didn't notice anything was missing until last week when she went looking for some old jewelry. Everything was taken - engagement ring, family heirlooms, bracelets, earrings, GPS, possibly more that's yet to be discovered. Basically every good piece of jewelry she had acquired over 30 years plus some other items. 

She filed a police report and was told she had a detective assigned to the case. After not hearing from anybody for a few days (aren't detectives supposed to come ask questions, check out the scene?), she called in asking for the detective, whose name she had been given, nobody at the station knew who she was talking about - turns out it was an intern. Yes, an intern had been assigned to her case. (Isn't $30k worth of stuff a pretty serious deal?) She has a friend of a friend who works for the sheriff's department. Having this friend inquire about the situation resulted in a very angry call from a real detective who was pissed that she went asking about it. He threatened to just close the case.

Here's what we know concerning the actual robbery. We're pretty sure we know who is responsible:

My mom left a key to her place with one of her best friends of 12 years or so. Wonderful person, definitely not her. This friend, however, had recently taken in someone to their home. This someone is a young 20's female who we know had been kicked out of her home, kicked out of her church. She has a history of drug abuse, prostitution, etc. but we're being told has since ""found God."" My mom's friend &amp; her family are just great people and were willing to take her into their home. This young woman had very easy access to the key, full knowledge of the dates my mother was out of town, etc. Additionally, the circumstances of the theft were such that every object was so meticulously opened, replaced, and looked untouched, that it is obvious the perpetrator knew very well that he/she had plenty of time to do the deed. There are also no signs of forced entry: all of my mom's windows were locked and appeared untouched. The sliding back door had (and still has) a piece of wood preventing entry - it would have taken some SERIOUS work to get through it and would have left clear evidence. The only logical option is that somebody walked through the front door. Even more: the upstairs neighbor knew that my mother was going to be out - a very nice older lady who we're pretty certain couldn't have done it. She reported to my mother that she saw an SUV pull up to the house, two young 20-something females got out and entered my mom's apartment.  This neighbor had just assumed my mom got home early and these girls were helping move in (my mother had moved in only a couple months prior and has been slow in unpacking/removing items from storage). It's seemingly clear who's responsible for this.

Back to the police. My mother was given an ultimatum: she can request that the detective call in my mom's friend for questioning, or just close the case. So we're currently sitting at the detective saying ""Well I'll be out of town for a few days, so I'll probably call in [mom's friend] Friday or maybe Monday."" At best, this leads to questioning of the girl. At worst, that's the end.

Now, we are pretty certain she won't get anything back. Weeks have gone by, things could have been pawned off at any number of locations, etc. But we both feel it's absurd that there is little to no interest being shown by the police. My mom has had her security and privacy violated, has been having nightmares since she found out, and a general paranoia/anxiety. Nothing too serious, but not a good situation.

My advice to her was to, as soon as they close the case and do nothing, go to the media and start a shitstorm that way. She's afraid of getting a bad rap locally and causing the police to shun her in the future should she ever need their help again.

So, reddit, please help! Is there anything we can do? Is this just a lost cause? Is there any chance of justice here?

I'll try to answer any questions based on what I know, but can call her tomorrow and get updates as necessary. Thanks so much ahead of time."

(Warning; LONG)",gagagirl,BabyBumps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BabyBumps/comments/vb4rk/i_need_to_vent_advice_welcome_share_similar/,"This has everything to do with my SO, and I'm stressing really badly about it.

SO and I went to the same school and got the same certification as Dental Assistants. He finished his hours for internship and peaced the eff out of the field all-together. Now, he lives off tips working as a bartender at a hookah lounge and as a server at the same restaurant I work at. He lost his SUV when I was 10 weeks pregnant, and used the refunded down payment on a 2000 Yamaha R1. He crashed that when he was involved in a hit and run a few months back and couldn't do anything about it due to the fact that he did not have it insured, so it sat broken in his apartment parking lot for months while he tried to ""save money"" to purchase new plastics and new parts for it (he only got a new oil can, and spent most of the rest of his money on rent, cigarettes and beer). He missed two payments (one of which I helped him with, he still owes me $180 or so) and called me at 3:30AM to tell me it got repossessed, this happened sometime last week. He needed to pay close to two grand in fee's as well as a pay-off and only has a few more days to come up with the money or else he looses it for good.

So what's his solution? Save up and buy ANOTHER bike outright, because he cant come up with the money in time. I asked him today why he thought that was a good idea, and what would he plan on doing if he wanted to take Camilla somewhere? He assured me he'd have a way of getting her around safely, his mom's van being his first option. This saddens me and frustrates the hell out of me. He's 27-friggin-years old.

Bumpers, I love him. I really do. He knows it and loves me just the same. We're not together at the moment, but he realized just a few weeks ago that I have been one of the only people who has been stable in his life and willing to help him no matter what. I cant even count the times I've woken up early in the morning and driven across town to be with him after he had a nightmare (PTSD from the Army) and to just be there with him when he's lonely, and I dont keep track either only because I dont believe in doing so. He's rarely lifted that kind of finger for me, but I've stuck by him even when he was screwing around with our co workers. I've had to sift through countless rumors that flew around our social circle throughout this entire pregnancy and it's enough to drive someone absolutely insane. I've never once given him shit for his poor decisions because he gets enough of it from others, his mom included. I work two jobs, both on my feet. One in a dental office (and I dont get paid yet) and the other with him where I am a hostess and he is a server. I've given him rides when he needed it to and from work, as well as leaving my house to go across town (again, like a 30 minute drive) just to drive him home when his friends were too drunk to take him anywhere. All the while, he was struggling with a past relationship that he still had feelings for, ontop of a supposed ""girlfriend"" he made at our workplace among a plethora of other family problems. I stuck it out, because I knew I was better than all of them. I'm not the crazy ex who places myself in his life solely because of this baby, I stayed away unless I was called upon and even then, I picked and chose if I wanted to bail him out of whatever life threw at him. It got so bad, even his mom told me to stop coming around; not because she doesnt like me, but because she knew everything I was doing for him, he FAR from deserved. That's sad. I really want to put him in my position just for a day to know how I was truly hurt by all of this.

He told me he wants to make it work, but I'm so numb to his empty promises now. He's come to me twice in this entire pregnancy and said the same thing. First time was when I found out. He was piss drunk while I was working ( we were still together at the time) and he told me ""I love you and we will make this work"". He said it again when I was about 20 weeks post break up, said he wanted to be in her life, but wanted to be in my life later on down the road. I was fine with this. He tapers off again, only to come back a month ago and tell me ""I want to be with you and the baby. I love you, because you loved me enough to stick around when I needed you the most. I'm blessed to have you..etc etc"" and again, he's beginning to taper off. He's doing a lot better this time around, but he's keeping me on a long leash and its frustrating as hell. I told him he keeps going from one extreme to the other, and needs to knock it off because it hurts the crap out of me. He told me he wants to take it slow and get back to getting to know one another. We began dating for about a month before I found out, and he felt it was rushed (well, no shit!) but now would like to take me on dates after the baby to redeem what we lost. I am all for it, I just wish he wouldn't be so stand-off-ish in the meantime! 

Oh, and to top it off, he denied the baby up until the last phone call I spoke of earlier. He claimed the dates never matched up, until I told him there was a WIDE two week window in every pregnancy, and that two week window falls perfectly in the realm of the ""first time"" for the both of us .... the very drunk, unprotected, and stupid ""first time"". Now, he claims her and even gets mad at me if I call her ""my daughter"" and not ""our daughter""... oi vey. It got so bad, that... well let me tell that small story...

I met with him and a few friends who were all pretty wicked drunk one weekend at a hotel for a party. I sat around most of the night and smiled, giggling at the drunk people around me and mainly stayed quiet (which is not normally me, I'm just highly uncomfortable at this point because he is leaving every so often to go flirt with a few Puerto Rican girls he found, and I'm the only one not drinking or in a bikini looking cute like everyone else). I get up to go to the bathroom and his friend walks in with another friend who dont know I'm in the bathroom of the hotel room. One of them says ""Yeah, lets bring the pregnant girlfriend to the party... not my idea!!!! "" and leaves. I fight tears as I flush and waddle out, beginning to feel awful for even coming out at all, to which my SO comes up to me asking if I'm okay. I tell him what happened but asked him not to make a deal of it. Well, drunk him decides to pull aside his friend and berate him incredibly for what he said, telling him ""dont ever talk that way about the mother of my child. You're lucky I dont punch you in the face....blahblah man things"". His friend later came to me, sat next to me, apologized drunkenly a few times, and all was well after that. But moral of the story is, he's becoming more and more protective of me and the baby and I dont know how to take it. 


**SO, MY QUESTIONS ARE.**

1. How do I deal with him being so irresponsible? He's literally done NOTHING financially for this baby although he claims that he's planning on buying the $500 crib I want, also paying for my bills while I'm not working postpartum. My mom is angry at him for this, my dad is annoyed but has faith that he will pull his head out of his ass eventually...

2. How should I deal with him being so emotionally unstable about our relationship, and the relationship he is forcing on the baby? He went from denying her and me, to being incredibly protective of us. I dont know how to handle it; should I be happy? Should I be careful?


I will gladly clarify anything if need be. I wrote this scatter-brained so I dont know if I made a terribly-good amount of sense. 

Added note; I'm too scared to voice my fear in the second question to him, because he is the type to take what I say to an extreme. I'm afraid that if I do tell him, that he will pull off completely and I'll ultimately be left with nothing. Oh, the joy of pregnancy hormones."

I have no college under my belt but over 10k hours of experience in pretty much every aspect of the company. I have countless hours in practice of business proposals, presentations, renderings, T-24, code research, design, full structural document preparation, engineering markups, coordination with City/County officials &amp; meetings, DRC/ Planning Commission, structural inspections, and even some basic engineering (hardware, footings, beams, lateral analysis, etc).

I am a translator for a deaf architect and have literally been in the middle of hundreds of projects, mostly residential but plenty of commercial too. I've recently become eligible for the ARE and would like to start planning for the future. 

In addition to my experience, and soon-to-be licence (in CA), what other kind of skills should I know that would be most beneficial to the typical architect firm, preferably one focused in commercial design. 

I know the ins and outs of Revit and I am picking up Autocad and Sketchup quickly as computer programs generally come easy to me. My communication and people skills have also been improved dramatically over the last 4 years with help from personal hobbies. Aside from this what other programs, skills, etc should I invest my spare time into? Anything that will really put myself ahead of the competition would be most helpful.

I'm incredibly well disciplined and with available resources I don't see anything holding me back. Hopefully some business owners out there may have some good advice?

Thanks to all of you with experience in the field. Your guidance may just have profound effects on my future. 


Some areas I've thought about investing into but unsure of usefulness:

- capabilities of full structural analysis (at least for wood frame structures)
- photoshop / illustrator
- landscape architecture
- a second language- spanish, chinese?
- internet marketing"

Hello,

I would like to share my weird story with all of you. First, I must clarify that I'm a French guy and that I'm currently going through my nineteenth year. My english is not that perfect, but you should be able to understand without puking!

It all started when I was twelve. I moved and had to attend a new school. Couldn't make myself to have friends and most of the time I used to be really alone. Somehow didn't give a fuck about this, as I was the kind of guy who likes to be alone.

After discovering world of warcraft, I had difficulties to continue going to school, as what I where doing in this game was more interesting that the stuff at school... I eventually totally dropped school, little by little. Over years, I've repeated 4 times because I did not attend school at all.
This is where justice came and said to my parents I HAD to attend school, or else I'll have some big trouble with them. An educator came in the story (and eventually lied ; he said that I've been beating my mom...), then I decided to attend home course.

Unsatisfied with that choice, the judge thought that the best for me was to maintain the procedure. I've been followed by a new educator, after the last one made his report.

Here in France, you cannot leave school until you're sixteen. I was sixteen, but somehow, using the fact that I've been in ""danger"", the procedure kept going. On september 2010, after having proved really good grades with home schooling, they decided that they'll intern me in a psychiatric hospital, in ""observation"" and for an undetermined time. I could not escape this one, and making appeal would not have work before the internment statement. Me, my parents, and my two lawyers kept thinking this was all so wrong, but we could not find the ""justice"".

I did not known this fact until last week-end, but the judge tried to intimidate my father because we got lawyers, arguing that my father was trying to publicly discredit him... This has not succeeded, as my father was aware of how futile was this vast mascarade.

I did end up for a month in a public psychiatric unit for adolescents. At my arrival, I was ""held"" in a chamber were I could not take a shit with the bare minimum of intimacy, and with nothing to hurt myself : bed was fixed on the floor, and radiators were included inside the walls... Hopefully, I stayed in this room for 5 minutes, before they came and told me ""Sorry, that was a mistake, you should not be here""... I got pissed of and argued with the director of the ""service"", telling her that I'll take her in court and all this kind of shit... Of course, I didn't...

I was then transferred to the adolescent unit and stood there for a month before being able to being again transferred to a soften unit, which I'll detail below. I was held with other ""patient"" who where under strong medication and hopefully, I was the only one who wasn't and never were. This month was really, really hard, as I could not go home on week-ends and barely had visits, but it was not the worst!

After some tight negotiations I was able to be transferred to a less medicalized unit, which was literally inside a forest... The only ""rule"" was that I had to keep getting ""home"" schooled, and that the first month I could not establish contact with the outside world at all (a rule i've broken by using my ipod touch and ""hacking"" their wifi network, modifying my mac address with one allowed, sending emails to my father and bests friends)... This was a fucking long month, and I did not see the civilization at all except when I escaped once for an hour or two, arguing that I wanted to walk in the forest, alone.

After a month, and so much discussion with the head doctor, she said to me that she did not understand what I've been doing there... I convinced her to let me go home, and back me in front of the judge, saying I had to go home, or eventually it will become worse and I'll really start to develop some trouble. This was decided in two hours. I packaged my stuff and left the same evening, all in a hurry. I was then seventeen. I had my birthday in this center, without being able to contact the outside world, and no-one told me ""happy birthday"" except the other patient. They even made me a chocolate cake. Problem is that chocolate is one of the only things that I don't enjoy...

Judge eventually tried to get me back into court, but I did not attend any meet up and turned eighteen. During that time I started programming everyday, all day long.

Started working as freelance. Was not satisfied, decided to move Paris with only little money for a month. Living for a month at an irc mate place. During this time I found a job and got hired.
I then had to move on to one of my two best friend house, which is by more than ten years my senior. I was happy since living with someone I deeply respect, and was working hard. I was hired as an engineer.

After six months, and as I was finding myself unsatisfied to develop for externals clients, I started looking for a work that involved some research and ended up in a start-up as the referring programmer and r&amp;d developer. It's been six months then, and I moved in my own basement.


Sometimes, I just want to call all the people who was involved in keeping me inside psychiatric units and did not trust that I could work, or have an adequate adult social life, sending them my pay slip to prove them.

Ask me any details about this, I'll try to help. If anyone ever get stuck in an awkward situation like this, just keep going and does not let them take over you!!

Well, ask me anything

Special thanks to the friends who rooted for me, and a deep and very special thank to my friend who kept me at his home for a year, and his daughter whose good mood and innocence made me more optimistic towards life!"

During the last semester of my degree, instead of taking classes I did an internship, developing a kind of add-on web application for an existing application the company used.

While I do feel like I learned a lot, I'm not 100% happy with the final product that got deployed. Due to time constraints and, particularly, lack of direction, mentorship, and communication from supervisors that were overseeing my work, I feel like it's not up to the standards of more mature development environments at the bigger companies where I'd like to apply.

Additionally, while I don't think my past employer would say anything very negative about me as a reference, I'm also not sure her recommendation would be glowing, as she didn't seem to like me on a personal level for whatever reason.

So although I *could* link to the github repo and let potential employers browse my work, I'm not sure that's the best idea. Of course, none of my potential employers would know it was an open source project, but if I use my supervisor as a reference (and should I, considering? but wouldn't it also be bad to *not* have a reference from an internship?) but I'm still not sure how to best sell myself and my capabilities with these concerns in mind.

Any tips or thoughts? Thanks in advance."

We are now both going to be juniors in college this coming school year. Both of us have been very happy with our relationship and I would say we have both considered it to be a ""serious"" relationship since pretty early on. This past school year, she has stayed at my place 3 nights a week minimum. Sometimes is feels like we practically live together. We already have our living arrangements set up for this coming school year living separately. However, I brought up the idea of living together during the next school year. We both agreed that we would really enjoy living together, but she said that she believes that we should be at least engaged before living together. While I don't share this belief, I find it to be entirely reasonable. My problem is that I will be leaving for an internship for 6 months in January. By the time I get back, I will have to have already made living arrangements for the next school year. That means if I were going to propose it would have to be by December, which is sooner than I would like. I don't have any money for a ring (although I know for a fact she would be fine with even the least expensive ring I could find). And even if I do decide to propose some time soon-ish, myself and my parents don't really have much money to spare for a wedding at the moment. 

Again, we are very much in love and have a very strong relationship, and I can't think of any reason why I wouldn't want to marry her, but I realize that my perspective isn't as valid as it could be based on the fact that I am young, we've only been going out for 2 years, and she is my first serious girlfriend. (Is that last one a big deal, do you think?)

So, here are my main questions:

* Is it too soon to propose? How can I tell if we're ""ready""?

* How long is too long to wait between getting engaged and getting married?

* Anyone ever been in a similar situation? Anyone get married to their first SO and regret it? 

* How much does a small wedding cost?

* Any other advice?

I need to know I am not alone. ,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ve32y/what_is_your_worst_affair_story_i_need_to_know_i/,"This last two years have been living hell for me. I have been through a lot of therapy. I just want to feel like I am not alone right now ... so here is my story first.  I found out in November of 2010 that my husband had been cheating on me with my pregnant really good friend, since before we got married.  She was also our realtor who sold us our house right before our wedding.  She helped me do the wedding favors and pinned the boutonniere on my dad and brother. They started their affair before she got pregnant by everything other than sex in December of 2009 (before the save the date cards went out for my wedding). They made a packed that they wouldn’t leave their significant other and that they would make our two family's really close.  She made herself out to be my best friend after that.  When she found out she was pregnant that meant they could do everything else.  

We got married and she helped me paint my new house.  Things seemed normal through the summer.  She spent a lot of time at our house since her husband was a Doctor doing his internship.  I would pick her up on my way from work and she would stay the night in our extra room.   In September my husband and I started to try and have a baby. She acted so excited and told me I should tell her first and our kids would grow up together.  (luckily I didn't get pregnant)

She had the baby in October and she stopped paying as much attention to my husband (they would have lunch trysts before because she didn't work other than sort of real estate but she only sold two houses one of which was ours) My husband in turn withdrew from me.  I looked at his email after seeing them play footsie under the table as we all (her husband included) played cards and played with the baby.  

My world came crashing down.  She chose to stay with her husband.  My husband said he wanted to stay with me.  So I tried for a while.  We went on a preplanned trip to his family in for Christmas.  He swore he was done with her.  I found out right before we came home on the plane that he was still trying to communicate with her.  I had to fly the whole way back with him sitting next to me.  She wrote him and me a letter stating she wanted no more contact.  She called the cops on my husband.  I was stupid and continued to try to make thing work as he told me he wanted to stay.  He became obsessed with her. He would talk about her and there trysts in detail (to try and get me to leave I think) I did in may after our anniversary when he didn’t try to do anything for it.  She filed a stalking order against him this spring.  I don't have communication with him but it was at the court house I work at.   

The whole thing led to a lot of therapy.  Friends doing intervensions with me because I was saying crazy things.  I paid him off for the house (probably shouldn't it’s a little over my price range but I found the house and did a lot of work on it and I didn't want him to have it because he bought it thinking that he would have a relationship and family with her in it someday.)  So I spent the last year remodeling things myself.  I have become a master at tiling.  Totally re did my kitchen.  Its sort of hands on therapy.  

I have had to come to grips about a lot of things.  The fact that I have gotten older and may never have kids.  The fact that I will never have my big wedding again (my parents paid for the last one and he didn't pay them back).  

But on the good side although probably a little too quick I do have a new boyfriend who treats me very well.  Things are looking up.  I don’t cry going into work everyday,  I don't have panic attacks,  I am starting to see a future again.  

Is there any hope of being with a man who doesn't cheat... I am scared to death that if I marry again I am just setting myself up for failure.

I scored a summer internship this summer and was wanting to build my own PC to upgrade from my current one.  I am looking into mostly playing games maybe some slight video editing for my friend's YouTube channel.  I am wanting to overclock the CPU which is why i got the H100.  Is there any deal or flaw I am missing in here?  Also I do want to get a new keyboard and mouse if anyone has had any good experience with some.  The only difference in the list above is the GPU I am getting is the Direct Cu II top so it is $10 more dollars. "

vdeql,7,2012-06-21,Mother who suffers from BPD recently diagnosed with late-stage cancer.,[deleted],BPD,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/vdeql/mother_who_suffers_from_bpd_recently_diagnosed/,"Hi, BPD community -- I'm new here, but I really need help, and I'm hoping someone here can offer guidance.


I'm 21 years old, and I grew up living alone with a BPD-diagnosed mother. My parents divorced when I was 7, and when my father moved away, I was left alone with my mother -- I had to become the caretaker, the voice of reason, and ultimately fulfill the role of the parent. 

As I got older, things got worse and worse. My mother would say extraordinarily hurtful things to me: ""I made a mistake for thinking you were smart,"" ""No wonder you don't have any friends,"" ""My marriage was perfect until you were born,"" ""You'll never make anything of yourself the way I did.""

The worst of these, which I will never forget, was my mother sitting me down and telling me that I was a sociopath, and that I did not have the basic capacity to feel emotions. This was not an off-handed comment -- she sat me down in the living room, looked me in the eye, and told me she thought she'd given birth to a monster. I cried for so long, I don't even remember the length of time. I never told anyone, because I feared so much that she might be right. It hurt me more than anything -- I love my mother, and I would do anything to help her get better, since it is apparent to me that she is not psychologically well. She's not at all a bad person, but there's something wrong, and I know that it's not her fault. She has only hit me once, when I defended my father's second wife for some petty action that I no longer remember the full story behind. To this day, she will not admit doing it. It didn't leave a noticeable mark, but I remember it as clear as anything. Her verbal abuse, however, was non-stop, and her emotions are entirely unpredictable.

I began to engage in self-harm when I was 12, in the form of skin cutting. This became threatening only once, at which point I was hospitalized overnight. I was only recently able to stop this behavior. I suffer from EDNOS (specifically, a combination of orthorexia and purging disorder. I am in therapy for this right now.) I started purging at around 16. My eating disorder is not the fault of any one person, and while I take full responsibility for my own actions, I find that my symptoms get much worse when I'm spending time at home with my mother. Right now, I'm living at home for the first time in 4 years -- I'm here for 2 months before moving across the country.

I haven't lived at home since I was 17 years old -- I moved away to college before turning 18, and since that time, have worked and gotten internships to the point where I could live alone or with friends in different cities over the summer. My father paid fully for my college, including housing expenses.

Here, I guess, is the big[gest] problem: last fall, my mother was diagnosed with Stage III (metastasized to lymph nodes) neuroendocrine cancer. At the time of her treatment, she told me not to come home from college, and to try my best to finish school. While I appreciate her desire to keep me in school during her treatment, I became severely depressed: our relationship had always been awful, and now, I'm faced with my mother's fairly imminent mortality.  

**My question, I suppose, is this: I love my mother, in some strange way, and I am spending the summer with her because I want her to know I care for her deeply and will always be there for her should the need arise. However, her BPD makes it nearly impossible for us to coexist peacefully. She's hurt me so much and caused me so much psychological damage that I find it hard to care for her unconditionally -- even though I know she's very sick, every time I tend to her at her bedside, I feel as though I'm doing a good deed that is undeserved. I've been in therapy since I was around 10 years old to learn techniques to deal with her up-and-down, irrational, unpredictable emotions, but nothing works for us. We've been in both together and separately, and there is nothing that has helped at all.** 

I want her to know that I love her so much, and that when I found out she was sick I had the worst few months of my life. Even though she's hurt me, she's my mom -- she lives alone, doesn't work, and is now fighting for her life. It's a lot to deal with.

My love for her aside, her BPD is hurting me quite actively, and has hurt me immensely while I was growing up. I'm moving across the country in a month, which has already been decided (I have a job offer there), and I just want to show my mom that I care for her before I leave. I'm sure that a lot of you know how difficult it is to grow up with a BPD parent, and I'd love to hear some input from others who have been through similar situations.

Thanks, and I look forward to hearing from you.

**TL;DR: Grew up alone with a BPD-suffering mother. She hurt me a lot as a child, and our relationship is very strained. Found out a year ago that she has stage III cancer -- looking for advice, how do I proceed from here?**"
vcyoe,14,2012-06-20,"Ear to ear grin today. Had my first appointment with a gender therapist, and it went better than expected.",AliceCode,transpositive,https://www.reddit.com/r/transpositive/comments/vcyoe/ear_to_ear_grin_today_had_my_first_appointment/,"I had to travel 176 miles for this session, and I must say that it was well worth it. My therapist is a really understanding person, and I felt really comfortable talking to him. He allowed me to choose which pronouns I prefer to be identified by, and what name I'd prefer to go by. At the moment, I'm choosing to go by male pronouns/names because I'm not presenting as female, but I let him understand that I will change that when I start presenting as female.

He agreed that I'm transgender, which is incredibly uplifting to me because it took a lot to accept it myself.

He even told me that he was impressed by my perspective on life, and that I'm incredibly mature for my age. He also told me that he thinks it's amazing that I summoned the courage to educate myself, and come out as transgender, and make the steps to transition.

He's an LPC intern still, and he started counseling in January of this year, and I definitely think he's great at what he does. Very professional, and made me feel comfortable talking about personal things even during the first session.

It was also explained to me that he will write me my letter to start HRT after two or three sessions, just to cover all the ""basics"", I guess. All in all, everything went better than I figured it would, and I'm extremely happy about everything."

I got a 3.5 unweighted GPA sophomore year of HS (two honors classes) and a 3.9 unweighted GPA junior year (5 on AP physics c electricity mag, 4 on AP physics mech, 5 in AP compsci, 5 in AP calc bc). 2150 SAT, 800 math II, 760 Physics. Extracurriculars were cross country and competitive pokemon TCG. I applied under the computer science major (which was probably not a smart move) and got rejected.

So yeah, I'm going to either davis or santa barbara for computer science.

A couple of things that I *already* have going for me is that I got an internship at a Silicon Valley startup literally a few weeks after I submitted my UC Application, been working there for 6 months. I get paid $20/hr but I might get a raise to $30 soon. The startup is doing really well and is expanding very quickly. When I started we had 11 employees, now we have 60.

Yeah, so for the transfer applicants for computer science at UCLA, how hard did you have to work to get to that position? What kind of GPA did you have to get / extracurriculars / etc?"
vgj3n,1,2012-06-22,"Reddit, I wouldn't usually ask but I'm losing it and I need your advice as I have no one else to turn to",[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/vgj3n/reddit_i_wouldnt_usually_ask_but_im_losing_it_and/,"Context, I am 19, a uni student (after much fight), a carer and in an absolute state of despair due to my mother.

Now, my mother is not a bad person, not at all, she fought for me all my life. She ran away from my insane abusive father when I was a baby, and ended up homeless. Then her cancer returned, yet by herself she managed to juggle radiotherapy and caring for me. She really sacrificed alot.

However, I've always paid the price, we have no family or friends, I put up with her guilt trips, her caring needs, her hatred of me having ""middle class aspirations"", going to uni, wanting to do well for myself, wanting to live at home, not wanting to live at home, it goes on.

OKAY HERE'S WHERE I NEED ADVICE - My uni offered me to apply for a paid internship which would be invaluable to me, not to mention paid, as me and my mum struggle financially, this would allow me to do it.

This sent her, in short insane and abusive. She's been drinking very heavily of recent and this was tipping point. She has decided that if I take this one month internship away from her she's downsizing to one bedroom place because I clearly don't need her anymore.

If I mention friends she says I value them over her and I should live with them.  She screams down the phone day and night, destroys my things, demanding all the money I have from me and seems to take pleasure from throwing me on the street and telling me I'm awful as I try and look after her.

My question is, what do I do? I have no savings, she has drained me dry for bills. I abide by her rules, but I have no real life or prospects as I am expected to stay here forever and care.

If I stay here, I may be kicked onto the streets anyway, and that would mean I couldn't continue my education (which she says I should experience because she never did) and there are no jobs even to take as an alternative.

I feel awful asking, but I feel sheltered, hopeless, scared and unprepared for ending up on the street because of her issues."

vg2cz,1,2012-06-22,I'm a senior in college and I still have no idea what I want to do with myself after school. I'm in need of some advice or suggestions.,DarkEpsilon,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/vg2cz/im_a_senior_in_college_and_i_still_have_no_idea/,"Hi reddit. As the titles says I am a senior in college at SUNY Cortland, and I have no idea what I want to do professionally after school. As a bit of background information, I started as a Physics / Mechanical Engineer dual major at Cortland, but the workload was much more than I have anticipated after just coming out of high school. Needless to say it didn't work in my favor and I changed majors to Sociology with a minor in Computer Science. It was a difficult decision for me, and a very drastic change from physics. I really do enjoy learning about Sociology, but have no idea what I could do with it after school. I am currently floating on a 3.4 GPA in the sociology major, but from poor grades from some physics it looks to be much lower. I am going to spend next summer at school to retake the courses that need improvement to help myself if I decide to go to graduate school. 

I have thought long and hard about what I want to do, and still have come up with nothing. I have no idea what I think is best for me, or what interests me enough to pursue. 

At school I have taken a few courses in Computer Science to see if that can take me somewhere, because I know that it does interest me a lot, but I fear for job security. I have taken a visual basic course, and html 4 course and really enjoyed them, but it took me a long time to get used to a different type of thinking. In one of my sociology classes I had to create my own study about consumerism which was fun, but I don't think being a researcher is something that interests me enough. 

My father is a homicide detective in Manhattan, and knows a good deal of people and has good connections with them. I have thought about becoming a detective before but am still unsure about it. If I did follow through on it, I would be able to start off better then others in whatever precinct I would want to be in. My father also works construction as a second job whenever hes off, and I have been working for him since I was around the age of 12. I work for him every summer and it is how I make my money at the moment, and help pay for school. 

I have also thought about law school for myself, and think I would like it, but at the same time I know nothing of law and feel that I am in no way prepared to get into any schools without any prier knowledge. Again, my father has told me about his childhood friend who is now a very powerful lawyer who is willing to give me advice and maybe even some kind of internship over the summer. I have no idea what I would have to do, or if he would be willing to allow it so I haven't gone through on that either.

As you can see I have no clue of what is going on around me, and no idea what I want to do. I'm asking you, /r/AskReddit, for any advice or suggestions that could in any way benefit me in my situation. I'll try my best to answer any questions you have.

tl;dr: Have no idea what I want to do with myself after school. Sociology major with minor in computer science. Father has connections in police department, and with a lawyer friend. Law school possibility? Need advice."

My boyfriend (of 3 months) just moved 3 hours away for a summer internship. I started hanging out with my one of my friends again, even though she had been cold to me in the past few months. Boyfriend does not like her or her reckless behavior and thinks that she is a bad influence on me and our relationship. We kept fighting about this over the phone almost every night and I'm left crying each time. Then in the morning, he apologizes for overreacting. 

He is basically asking me to choose my friend or him. She has been my best friend for over a year but we had a nasty fallout this year. Normally, this is alarming because this is not something he should be asking. Yet his reasoning sounds right, that she is not trustworthy and is a reckless fairweather friend. They used to be friends, but he has cut her out of his life and does not want any association with her. He hates the idea of me hanging out with her and thinks that she is manipulative. He calls me a tool whenever I hang out with her.

I have asked my best friends for advice because I don't trust myself anymore. I might be too blinded by him to see the truth. Last night, I learned that even before this week's ordeal, my friends do not like him. They say that he has this tone of voice where it's like ""you need to listen to me because I know more than you"". And the worst part is that they hate the way he talks to me; they see him as being disrespectful and demanding. They have been holding back because each time, I would tell them of how happy I am with him.

Boyfriend is coming back tonight. I absolutely love him but this is starting to drain me. Everything felt alright until this week when he moved away. I think he's freaking out over the LDR and he overreacts at everything. Yet it's very concerning that my friends do not like him.

I really want to make this relationship work, but I don't know how. I don't think he's aware of his behavior. How should I talk to him tonight? Should we talk a break or should we just break up? 

TL;DR Boyfriend is overreacting due to LDR this week and wants me to stop hanging with a bad friend or else we will break up. I recently learn that all of my friends dislike my boyfriend, even prior to LDR. How do I mend my relationship? Or should I take a break? Break up? I really think he's the one, but I may be blinded."

vfa8g,1,2012-06-22,Kind of a shit year,[deleted],lostgeneration,https://www.reddit.com/r/lostgeneration/comments/vfa8g/kind_of_a_shit_year/,"I apologize ahead of time for the length and if I somehow come off the wrong way. I know a lot of people are in a much worse situation than I am in, but I just feel like I needed to get this off my chest.

-----

I'm a third-year Mechanical Engineering student at a Canadian university and for the past year, I've desperately tried to get an internship. Most people around me were doing it purely for the experience, but I've needed to pay down my loans as soon as possible (I would be graduating with 38 grand in debt - single mother family with 2 daughters), learn the professional engineering world all while getting anything useful on my resume. Most of the people I know who graduated this year are still trying to find jobs and almost all of them moved back in with their parents (essentially scaring the shit out of me since I have family problems and scared to hell about loan repayments).


I sacrificed my free time and a lot of my school time to prepare applications and getting ready for interviews. I even invested myself to the point that I delayed planning housing with my friends. I almost got one, but I lost it because I didn't have a full driver's license. Why? Because myself nor my family could ever afford Driver's Ed for practice and my mother didn't lend me her car because it was critical for her work to feed us. That and the fact that my estranged father was in more accidents than I have fingers led to me pushing it off until this year. So I lost essentially the dream internship I wanted and it started the downward path to depression.

-


40+ applications later, I have nothing to show for it. As a result, my GPA went down significantly to the point that I almost lost my scholarship (engineering degrees are insanely expensive), I'm living as a sublet in my friend's house with no clue as to where I'm living for the new school year. I've had over 10 interviews yet for some reason I can't get anything. Interviewers won't give me feedback and careers counselling services tell me I'm strong as an interviewee so I have no fucking clue as to what's happening. Additionally, I've had 3 mock interviews to prepare. I can't confide in people because one friend got one after his second interview, and all my other friends either had 1 or no interviews at all so they tell me to stop complaining (""*at least you got interviews*"") and have since moved on. Interviews don't mean anything unless you get something. 


My friend with an internship then rubs it in my face whenever she gets the chance because she's a bit of a cunt, talking about all her friends up in Alberta got one too without even trying (""YOU SHOULD MOVE TO ALBERTA TO FIND ONE EVEN THOUGH YOU'RE BROKE"").  I have no real prior work experience due to my Chinese family's study-no-time-for-work policy in high school and the job market souring in university (especially in this shitty uni town).


I've exhausted my school's career counselling help to the point where I almost broke down during a meeting with a career counsellor. In one meeting, the lady basically drew a chart showing Baby Boomers and my generation saying ""You won't get anything until 2-3 years from now"". I graduate in a year, what the fuck. In others, they just told me to keep trying (no other advice) despite me telling them my current situation.


The worst part is that I could have fully avoided this by getting a license but I was too stupid trying to get over own problems and became complacent in not getting one until now. I feel like a fucking failure in every aspect. I gained considerable weight because I was too depressed to exercise, started to drink to cope with finishing another application (I've since stopped because I realized it wasn't helping + I'm broke). Sometimes I could barely get out of bed and other times, I've stayed until for 3 days straight trying to even start another job application but I feel vomiting when I do. I get more depressed than I should be when companies don't even bother sending me a rejection letter (I'm left hanging with hope only to be crushed as the weeks go by).


At this point, I've been trying to get any job and have been handing out resumes around the town since the beginning of May with no success. My boyfriend got a summer job after looking for two weeks and now I feel even more worthless since he goes off to his job and come back while I sit at home all day being broke and doing nothing. I'm dreading the new school year since I'm **going to be doing the exact same thing all over again for a post-grad job**.


I fucking hate my life right now, yet I'm still applying to the slim pickings that are still available. I fucking hate this so much, just so fucking much. 


**TL;DR: Life.**"
vf7tt,15,2012-06-22,Is College Worth It Professionally?,mxmm,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/vf7tt/is_college_worth_it_professionally/,"Just for background, I'm studying at Cornell as a rising sophomore in Computer Science and Math, and I have absolutely no intention of dropping out, I just wanted to see what you guys think.

What made me think about this is the comments on this /r/programming topic: http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/ve31x/so_you_dropped_out_of_college_after_gaining_some/

The way the top comments talk down on education was a little surprising to me, as if it would be better for me to drop out now and get experience than to finish college. I mean, I am working as a programmer this summer and fully plan to shoot for a good internship next summer, which it seems my school would facilitate. As for background, I was really more of a math geek in high school who decided to learn Java 2 weeks before university, and so far I love the courses and have done well in what are usually considered the ""weeder"" courses, so I'm pretty sure graduating with a good GPA is feasible, if this matters in your advice. 

After going to university for a year and developing this summer for almost a month so far, I feel like I know infinitely more than I did a year ago, and can't really imagine understanding the theoretical basis of what I'm doing as well from self-study (I'd have neither the resources nor the motivation), and I can't imagine having as many big-name companies looking for internships in one room at one time in my hometown.

I'm sorry if this post sounds somewhat gloatful, since that honestly wasn't the purpose. I just want to put down all the reasons I feel like getting this education would be useful as long as I'm not putting a ridiculous financial burden on myself. However, many members of this website would imply just the opposite, and I'm curious to see what points I'm probably ignoring here. After all, I do come from a culture that puts a lot of value on education, so my opinions are likely quite biased.

Thanks."

In addition to gaming, this will be used for various work related things - I often run several VMs at a time, use Photoshop a lot, do a bit of video encoding, and sometimes even launch Adobe Reader...hence why I went with an i7 instead of the i5. On that note, should I stick with LGA 1155 or switch to an i7-3820 and find an LGA 2011 motherboard? The prices seem pretty similar.

~~Concerning the SSD, there is an ""OCZ Intern 120GB Agility 3 Series"" available for cheaper but some reviews said that it's a fair bit slower than most SSDs. Plus, Intel sounds a lot more trustworthy. Or is there an even better alternative?~~ EDIT: As suggested, switched to the Samsung 830.

Unfortunately, since I live in Sweden, the sweet deals on Newegg are out of my reach. I have labeled the components with the local prices here.

vhe0o,1,2012-06-23,Need help with express.js,[deleted],node,https://www.reddit.com/r/node/comments/vhe0o/need_help_with_expressjs/,"After 2 days of banging my head trying to go through express.js guide, I'm coming here because I need some help. I'm doing an internship, and while I applied for a python position, after about a week, I've been told to work on developing an express.js API which interacts with a flask analytics app(which I also have to create).

Only problem is that I've never touched javascript in my life, and I don't see myself becoming an express.js expert in 2 days. I'm kinda panicking.

From what I understand, the API has to respond to the flask app's GET and POST queries, and has to return JSON data. I think I've got the returning JSON part down. Here's a small code that I think is how this is supposed to work: http://ideone.com/iFUCO

The problem is that the JSON is at api.domain.com/me of every user. How can I make it return JSON for every individual user? How could I integrate the flask app with the API? Is there any way I can use the JSON to get total number of active users at any given time? 

I know routes work in express.js, but they also work for flask, so how am I supposed to use them?

I know I could probably do this stuff if I sit down and start learning from scratch, but that'll probably take more than a week or two. I know it's not a lot to go on, and I'm not looking for anyone to solve these problem for me. I just want some help in figuring out how do I go on about this. I have no clue how I'm supposed to complete it. 

Thanks a lot."

I've just finished up my first wave of actual IT classes that went over network security, java programming, html, and css. I’ve started learning a little c++ on my own and I'll be taking a class on android application development in the fall.  I plan on spending as much free time as I can picking up either php or javascript and getting into more advance concepts in java during the coming semester.  I've been using photoshop for over 8 years and love designing things for organizations at school whenever I can such as flyers, business cards, banners, websites, and whatever they want as far as advertisement goes.
 I've been looking for internships or jobs where I can get some solid experience programming or doing anything really that is computer related. I have spent hours upon hours scanning craigslist, monster, and even physical newspapers o_O looking for jobs in the field and I do not qualify for what seem the most basic of positions.  Everybody wants people with experience, and many of these part time jobs require experience in things that I'm not even sure I will get taught by the time I graduate and thus I have turned to reddit for advice.
I realize that my degree program itself will not teach me everything I need to know to get a decent job right out of college and that I will just have to teach myself the things that are missing. Fortunately I am well acquainted with the methods of online learning and have no problems figuring out where to go to learn what I want. The problem is I don’t know what I need to learn exactly and don’t want to waste time on stuff that won’t really add to my “hire-ability”. I know that a strong foundation in any language will make picking up other languages easier but as I said what I want to learn now is basically whatever it takes to get my foot into the door so that I can get some experience and maybe something worth putting on a resume.  
What are the things that I can pick up that will help me land that first job in the field? Is there some place that I’m not thinking of that can help me find a job that is computer related?
Thanks for any advice you can offer. 
TL;DR IT major with basic programming skills, wants to know what to learn/do to get that will help get that first job.

vh0ik,28,2012-06-23,For those contemplating law school - someone who decided not to go (and still respects people that do),cool_irl,LawSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/LawSchool/comments/vh0ik/for_those_contemplating_law_school_someone_who/,"About a year and a half ago I was right in the thick of the law school application process. I put money into testmasters, took the LSAT, applied to about 12 schools, got accepted to a few schools, and was telling friends and family how excited I was about it.  I had been working as a paralegal since the end of undergrad (2 years), and thought this was the logical next step.  I even went to a spring orientation weekend in a different state (on my own dime).  My GPA was somewhat low, LSAT good but not amazing, and I was destined to go to a school within the  30 - 50 range.  

Then, in April 2011, I balked.  I decided to make the decision and not go ahead with the law school aspiration.  I realized that I was doing it because of the situation/job that I fell into after school - which was not what I had wanted.  The cost and the seemingly infinite reports about diminished job prospects freaked me out.  

The hardest part was... telling people.  ""Didn't you spend ____ on an LSAT course?  Didn't you apply to x amount of schools?  That costs a lot of money too, right?""  It wasn't a great feeling - especially coming from a successful family that expects a lot out of their kin.  Or friends that are already knee-deep in law school and are doing very well.

Instead, I immediately applied to do a post-bac in computer science at a state school in a cheap area - a 2 year program.   My original degree was in economics.  I'm a geek at heart, had done some hobby programming, and wanted to 'do what I actually want to do' before I got too old.  Quarter life crisis, I suppose.  

Fast forward to now, and I somehow pulled off a 4.0 in both semesters, obtained two undergraduate research positions, and am doing a summer internship at an international, market leading microprocessor manufacturer (well, they may as well be the only one) doing software development.

I'm not coming here to say that law school is always the wrong choice.  It's not.  I know many, many people who are and have been successful doing just that.  I probably don't have what it takes to be a great lawyer, and envy certain qualities of people that do.  

But - I want to remind those of you who are contemplating law school because there's ""nothing else you can do with your degree"" that you are still young.  If you find yourself having to remind yourself of the benefits of law school because you're on the fence, give it more thought than you normally would.  You may find that it reinforces your aspirations about law - great!  Or, it may guide you the other way.

My experience might be an outlier, but I am so incredibly relieved that I changed paths when I did (even with the sunk costs) because it allowed me to remember that I'm not bound to some 'logical' career path just because family/society/myself expects it to happen.  You have a lot more control than you think you do.

What made you start a website like this? what was your inspiration?  What do you think about the current Reddit community? Is Reddit now as exactly as you imagined? or do you expect anything more from the current community?  How do you think the future of Reddit will be? and what do you expect the future to be? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vfosl/iamalexis_ohanian_startup_founder_internet/c542dso?context=5)|Thank you. But to be fair, this thing has grown *far* beyond what Steve and I started in that Medford apartment with. Sure, we can take credit for starting the planter box, tilling the soil, adding seeds, and watering, etc, but it's since grown into a freaking ecosystem.      We jumped at the chance, took the next train back to Boston and met with him for about an hour. He pushed us to drop mobile (it was 05) and think about a web app that we'd personally want to use every day. We left that meeting with a phrase in our heads that PG crafted ""front page of the internet."" Then it was just up to me and Steve to make it.      At the time, we were intrigued by delicious/popular, which was an interesting byproduct of their bookmarking service. Incidentally, we didn't learn about digg until weeks after we launched. It goes to show how much our ignorance helped, because you may remember all the blatant digg-clones that came and went before digg did -- Steve and I weren't trying to just copy, we were thinking about solving this problem from a clean slate.  I need to get better at distinguishing between the many varied reddit *communities*. The culture &amp; community on /r/NBA is very different from the culture on /r/aww and reddit is just the platform that enables such varied discourse. Steve and I always debated about subreddits vs tagging and I'm happy he won, because although it's taken longer to grow and develop, it's resulted in this marvelous variety in communities all using this common platform. So in a way, all of these varied communities are what we'd hoped for, but we've still got a ways to go until the reddit platform really is the ubiquitous way online communities share and discover content.
[Out of curiosity, what was the idea with tagging?

[Now that subreddits are established you should introduce a system that allows the same post to be submitted to a number of subreddits, but only appear on someone's front page or /r/all once.

[What are your thoughts on the subreddit SRS? I know most people will view this from a ""lost karma"" perspective, but I don't care about karma, I mean from the perspective that a lot of thoughts and ideas are downvoted and never seen because this group doesn't agree with their thoughts. In my opinion, it kind of kills the spirit of reddit.  Also, what are your thoughts on subreddits like /r/picsofdeadkids and /r/beatingwomen (or whatever its called\)? Do you feel that these are ruining the credibility of the site?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vfosl/iamalexis_ohanian_startup_founder_internet/c542fn4?context=5)|I, like most, find people who use the reddit platform for awful stuff to be awful people. Just like [@deadbabygoon](https://twitter.com/#!/deadbabygoon) *(I didn't spend much time looking but this is rather offensive)* doesn't ruin the credibility of twitter, I don't see why these awful reddits would ruin the credibility of the reddit platform.
[Do you feel like there is enough sexism/racism/homophobia etc on Reddit to warrant a subreddit like SRS?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vfosl/iamalexis_ohanian_startup_founder_internet/c5433pp?context=5)|I think there's enough sexism/racism/homophobia in the world to warrant people calling it out when it happens.

[You would be well received in /r/nfl my friend.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vfosl/iamalexis_ohanian_startup_founder_internet/c5430kk?context=5)|Oh, I'm there. And trying so damned hard to get [/r/redskins an RG3 appearance](http://redskins.reddit.com).
 |Also, [Chris Berman once made fun of me and my buddies](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oETDSh9ojro). That was awesome.
[When I found out about /r/upliftingnews yesterday, I felt like I had been living behind the moon. Good to know that that's where the Reddit founder lives, too.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vfosl/iamalexis_ohanian_startup_founder_internet/c543558?context=5)|We should get a duplex together. Or be space roommates?
[Just to let you know Romo will get his ring this year. So...^suck ^it.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vfosl/iamalexis_ohanian_startup_founder_internet/c543it5?context=5)|I hope so. [He gets awfully upset](http://sportzandstuff.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/tony-romo-crying.jpg) when he doesn't get what he wants ;)
 |Edit: OK, [one more video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1uEyZKJ0o8). I have this saved on my laptop and watch it literally every week when I need a boost.
[Alexis just 'fuck the Cowboys'd. Serious god damn hard on.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vfosl/iamalexis_ohanian_startup_founder_internet/c54a9na?context=5)|You really don't want to see me on gameday at FedEx. One day footage of that is going to get online and it'll be the end of me.
[Hey I was at that game! I can confirm I didn't see you doing that. But now I did.  Go skins HTTR.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vfosl/iamalexis_ohanian_startup_founder_internet/c543khz?context=5)|Woo! Look for me. Always with the Sean Taylor banner.

[Can we get a rule, in honor of A.O., that allows Cowboy losses to be posted to upliftingnews? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vfosl/iamalexis_ohanian_startup_founder_internet/c545m98?context=5)|LOL. What have I done....
[Now that I think about it, pretty sure I ALWAYS see you guys being awesomely fannish. I'm usually opposite side club level. Beware I will be shouting narwhals at you from afar. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vfosl/iamalexis_ohanian_startup_founder_internet/c54483x?context=5)|We're being insane, that's what we're being.

[The founder of Reddit owns Karma. You heard it here first, people.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vfosl/iamalexis_ohanian_startup_founder_internet/c5434ge?context=5)|She definitely owns me. But owning Karma was the best decision I made right along with investing in reddit gold!
[The founder of Reddit doesn't take many pictures of his cat. My world has just been shattered.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vfosl/iamalexis_ohanian_startup_founder_internet/c5432lq?context=5)|I do talk to her in a weird higher-pitched voice, though.

[When she behaves badly, do you look at your gf and say ""Karma's a bitch""?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vfosl/iamalexis_ohanian_startup_founder_internet/c544pwi?context=5)|LOL. Nice. Only if she were a dog ;)
 |I do say ""Good Karma"" when she's good, which she always is. And sometimes ""Bad Karma!""
[What is this ""reddit"" you speak of? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vfosl/iamalexis_ohanian_startup_founder_internet/c542g63?context=5)|Just a pinterest clone.
[Who was your favorite coworker at reddit? (don't worry, I won't tell anyone your answer\). ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vfosl/iamalexis_ohanian_startup_founder_internet/c54393l?context=5)|The intern.
[What are your thoughts on the whole Funnyjunk/Oatmeal ordeal?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vfosl/iamalexis_ohanian_startup_founder_internet/c542i3h?context=5)|The whole thing is ridiculous. And just when it can't get any more absurd - it does!
 |[So what I'm saying is this.](http://imgur.com/tCp90.gif)
[In your opinion, why did reddit succeed and digg fail when digg had such a huge head start?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vfosl/iamalexis_ohanian_startup_founder_internet/c542kfb?context=5)|Basically, we always moved toward the best interests of users and they  went the opposite way.

[What are your thoughts on the Reddit Enhancement Suite? And what do you think could make it better?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vfosl/iamalexis_ohanian_startup_founder_internet/c5432yh?context=5)|It's nifty. I don't actually use it anymore, but mostly because I'm content without it. (and lazy?). That said, I don't have any good feedback :(
 |The biggest product enhancement reddit needs atm imho is subreddit discovery, which we're working on. That'll be a glorious day when we nail it.
[The day that reddit becomes totally homogeneous.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vfosl/iamalexis_ohanian_startup_founder_internet/c5455i4?context=5)|No no! People will subscribe to the subreddits they want to follow, not unlike how people use twitter to pick &amp; choose to follow the communities they're interested in.
[Hey Alexis! When you initially started the website, what were your hopes for it? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vfosl/iamalexis_ohanian_startup_founder_internet/c543boo?context=5)|Steve and I just wanted to create a place where we could always come and find something new &amp; interesting online.
 |Oh, and cats. Please spay &amp; neuter!
[I recently read about how you and Steve made hundreds of fake accounts at the beginning to get the site going. How much of your time was consumed with gathering useful links and posting them and how exciting was it to start seeing the site grow and people other than you and Steve upvoting those links?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vfosl/iamalexis_ohanian_startup_founder_internet/c543lfj?context=5)|Not hundreds. Maybe tens. I don't have a good enough memory. We submitted links (there were no comments back then) for the first month or so while we bugged friends into helping. The day about a month an a half in when we didn't have to do anything, submit a link, or even vote, was awesome, because we'd set a tone and apparently people didn't hate. it. I'm always telling people about the [1% rule](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture)) and why it's so important to treat those first hundred users well.
 |Remember, there was no 'social media' to speak of back in 2005, so all I had to spread the word was begging small bloggers to do writeups about a company they'd never heard of with a misspelled name and silly mascot.
[You know one thing I've always wondered is, how much work went in to the website on a daily basis back when you were CEO?  And another question, how did it feel when the website made it this big? You must've had some bragging rights. :D.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vfosl/iamalexis_ohanian_startup_founder_internet/c543uca?context=5)|Fortunately, most people don't know what I look like. I even got taunted by a guy at an /r/NYC meetup a little while back because he asked how long I'd been using reddit and I said I'd been a user for quite some time, joking that it was ""before reddit was popular.""
[How long did it take you guys to reach 10k users? Is there a chart somewhere?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vfosl/iamalexis_ohanian_startup_founder_internet/c5443ke?context=5)|Oof. Hmm.. you're in luck. [I found an old pdf from keysersosa that he hacked together back in the day](http://imgur.com/mrKGt).... You can see when we launched a little less than a month into YC.
 |Also! If you enjoyed this, you should email chris AT hipmunk.com right now and DEMAND that he do an AMA. He's our first hire at reddit and pretty close to that at hipmunk -- chief scientist and smartest dude in the room. He's a Physics PHD from that safety school, Harvard.
[Well I guess the anger could come because of hipsters really. I met a hipster not too long ago in the nearest city to me, complete with ironic hat &amp; glasses, and I found him ridiculous. But yeah I mean some people are just irationally angry I guess.  Also I can't believe you replied to me.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vfosl/iamalexis_ohanian_startup_founder_internet/c5445dv?context=5)|But I don't have hat or glasses :( I was wearing a plaid shirt though. MFA would be proud?
[If you were to do it differently, would you? Or has the journey so far been worth it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vfosl/iamalexis_ohanian_startup_founder_internet/c542gbo?context=5)|There are plenty of things I'd do differently, but I wouldn't want to fuck anything up ;)
[Alternatively, did you ever see yourself getting to this point?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vfosl/iamalexis_ohanian_startup_founder_internet/c542gbo?context=5)|I expected to be President of the Universe and wielding a real lightsaber by 25, so really everything has been a disappointment.
[I've actually have been hoping you were going to do one of these! I have a lot of questions for you!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vfosl/iamalexis_ohanian_startup_founder_internet/c542fq9?context=5)|Barev!
[Do you think you have become an inspiration to many young      Armenian and Armenian-Americans.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vfosl/iamalexis_ohanian_startup_founder_internet/c542fq9?context=5)|I don't know. I did an interview with [Yerevan Magazine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEAsrMzjnu0) and another [Armenian publication](http://www.haytoug.org/1755/alexis-ohanian-gains-perspective-in-yerevan). I grew up in a suburb of Maryland where I didn't know many Armenians so I was rather isolated from that half of my identity. I knew the history (and food!) of course, but I grew up far from Glendale. I actually know the community in Yerevan better from my 3 months living there. But if I can inspire, that's awesome. I get inspired by people I don't even know on reddit every day.
[What type of influence did the Armenian Culture have in your career.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vfosl/iamalexis_ohanian_startup_founder_internet/c542fq9?context=5)|I hate to bring it back to the genocide, but knowing what sacrifices my relatives made was incredibly motivating. As is the case with many immigrant stories, it creates invaluable perspective. I got to go out-of-state to UVA ($$$) without a single student loan because my great aunt, Vera Ohanian, saved money all her life for my college fund. She had no children of her own and wanted to be sure that I could go anywhere I wanted for college. So you can be damned sure that when I got to UVA, I took full advantage of the tuition. That's why I double majored in business and history (with high honors) and minored in german. I was told by deans that they'd never seen anyone complete a distinguished majors degree in the college *and* a degree in the business school and a minor to boot, all in 4 years.
[What is the greatest thing you experienced when you visited Armenia?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vfosl/iamalexis_ohanian_startup_founder_internet/c542fq9?context=5)|But maybe they didn't meet many Armenians ;) we're tenacious.
[Do you like khorovats? And if you do, how does it compare to most American Foods!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vfosl/iamalexis_ohanian_startup_founder_internet/c542fq9?context=5)|Fresh lavash. Oh, and apricots.
[You are a huge inspiration for me! I hope I can do great things as an Armenian just like you! ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vfosl/iamalexis_ohanian_startup_founder_internet/c542fq9?context=5)|I must've eaten it every other day in Armenia. I don't eat a lot of meat these days, but as a general rule I wish 'the typical American diet' were less based around packaged and fast food. [The long-term effects of this](http://www.cdc.gov/obesity/data/adult.html) are going to be awful.
[Here's an interview he did about the story of reddit, and some of his personal life. One of the best interviews I've seen. Really hit me hard for some reason.  **Edit:** Here's a text version of the story written by Alexis himself. It's really a touching story.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vfosl/iamalexis_ohanian_startup_founder_internet/c54373y?context=5)|Ah, thanks, that was the first time I was ever asked about my mom. I don't talk about it a lot. The whole thing was pretty cathartic. I was happy I did it.
[Having been through ""mom has cancer"" and ""daughter has cancer"", dude...you are an inspiration.  Thanks.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vfosl/iamalexis_ohanian_startup_founder_internet/c543za1?context=5)|Fuck. I'm so sorry. I couldn't even fathom... but for what it's worth, I'm wishing you all the best. And if she's old enough to like reddit I'll send her  something cool, just email me contact at alexisohanian.com.
[That's a lot to go through, especially when rolling out a huge site like this. You've got my respect for sure! Also cancer sucks.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vfosl/iamalexis_ohanian_startup_founder_internet/c543kcj?context=5)|It does. I'd had such a great, stress-free life until that summer. I knew it would happen, just not all at once ;) but so it goes. I know I'm still 100000x better off than most. But it sure makes you appreciate things. And fuck cancer.
[Also, fuck cancer.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vfosl/iamalexis_ohanian_startup_founder_internet/c5451ab?context=5)| 
[Do you get a lot of pressure to more effectively monetize Reddit? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vfosl/iamalexis_ohanian_startup_founder_internet/c542lfo?context=5)|I'm the one putting pressure on our CEO, Yishan :)
 |In all seriousness though, we never want to sacrifice the community for revenue. We've grown (costs) slowly by having a small team and I believe we can keep that up while also responsibly growing the business.
 |Stay tuned. Yishan and the team have some nifty ideas...
[When it started did you ever have any wild ideas in how you might monetize or was it really all about creating something people love?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vfosl/iamalexis_ohanian_startup_founder_internet/c544zl2?context=5)|We thought if we could in fact become 'the front page of the web' it'd be valuable real estate to advertise on. Little did investors know we'd want to be so good to our users and not have obnoxious ads ;)
 |But sponsored headlines have been a not-awful way to make money in that they both make money and it's not an awful user experience (sometimes actually kinda fun with commenting).
[How have you seen reddit gold play in to this monetization? Is it an actual source of revenue or is it more like a fun optional ""proudly show your support for reddit"" kind of thing?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vfosl/iamalexis_ohanian_startup_founder_internet/c54be3h?context=5)|More of the latter. But it's given us some great ideas because of how it's gifted. I totally stole the idea from Drew Curtis btw (Total Fark) - he's a gentleman about it.
[When I visit Drunken_economist in NYC, you want to grab a beer?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vfosl/iamalexis_ohanian_startup_founder_internet/c542npd?context=5)|Let's just tie it to a /r/nyc meetup?

[I imagine thousands of people reading this AMA disagree.  I am not one of them.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vfosl/iamalexis_ohanian_startup_founder_internet/c545572?context=5)|They've all mistaken me for Ted Mosby :)
[What's the most disgusting thing you've seen on the internet? or Reddit in general?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vfosl/iamalexis_ohanian_startup_founder_internet/c542dox?context=5)|I used to occasionally visit rotten back in high school. It's a shame you can't un-see things, but I'm not sure what I'd say is *most* disgusting.

[Thanks for making awesome things for all of us to use and enjoy. My questions-](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vfosl/iamalexis_ohanian_startup_founder_internet/c542sac?context=5)|Sorry for the delay!
[In your role as YC ambassador, you probably read a ton of applications from hopeful startup founders.  What makes an application stand out? Conversely, what sort of things on an app would cause you to hesitate in moving it forward in the application process?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vfosl/iamalexis_ohanian_startup_founder_internet/c542sac?context=5)|Quite a few. And it gets harder each round because quality and volume go up. I'm not actually the best person at YC to ask because I don't have nearly as much data as the partners. But we want to see a team we can believe in, which we largely gather from what they've built together in the past. It's not a science, though, and it continues to impress me that YC has had consistently great rounds of startups (FD: I'm an employee of YC and [investor in a bunch of startups](http://alexisohanian.com/pages/investments))
[Do you think it's necessary to move out to the bay area to be successful in today's startup world? What are some other great places to work on a tech-related startup?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vfosl/iamalexis_ohanian_startup_founder_internet/c542sac?context=5)|Definitely not! We started and sold reddit from Medford and Somerville, MA! And I live in NY now not just because I was born here and family is close and I love New York, but it's also a great place to do a startup. Only downside is our Mexican food isn't as good as SF, but I'm dealing with that.
[Question: have you ever tried pizza with ranch dressing?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vfosl/iamalexis_ohanian_startup_founder_internet/c542csi?context=5)|I have tried pizza with ranch dressing. My girlfriend enlightened me. Did you know: Papa John's has a bunch of other random 'dipping sauces'? Not just their butter/garlic stuff, but also ranch, and then some really random (not good) stuff... cheese sauce.... 
[Had no idea -- but then again, I've never eaten Papa John's in my entire life. I've had Dominos more times than any human should. Their deep-dish pizza is disgustingly good. Also, their cheesy bread, holy shit.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vfosl/iamalexis_ohanian_startup_founder_internet/c542gk3?context=5)|I was a Pizza Hut dishwasher/cook/waiter through most of high school. After I left, I never ate there again. I'd always been partial to PJ, but recently tried the new Domino's - everything went better than expected. I might give it a second go. I live in Brooklyn, though, so it's my guilty pleasure to order delivery PJ's from time to time. Please don't tell anyone or post this knowledge on a public forum.

This is a real concern.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vfosl/iamalexis_ohanian_startup_founder_internet/c542n94?context=5)|The commenting system Steve built is a thing of beauty. Yes, pun threads win the day in the more mainstream subreddits, but take a look somewhere like /r/askscience. It's pretty awesome.
 |With that and better subreddit discovery, I'm hopeful we can continue to grow this vast network of varied subreddits an communities all over the internet can continue to share and discuss great web content.
[Do you wear long socks or short socks?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vfosl/iamalexis_ohanian_startup_founder_internet/c542v7i?context=5)|Long socks. I love bizarre, colorful dress socks and wish I had [more of them](http://redditgifts.com/exchanges/socks/).
[Do you think it is harder to start-up a project than it was back in 2005?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vfosl/iamalexis_ohanian_startup_founder_internet/c542v7i?context=5)|Easier! Launching hipmunk compared to reddit was night and day because of all the different ways people can now share awesome things. Granted, there's more competition, but it's only gotten cheaper and easier to get something going (e.g., we had to order servers from newegg, build them, and install them in the colo facility back in 2005 -- now just AMEX the AMZN EC2/S3 account or just heroku it!)
[I tell people all the time that I graduated with the guy who co-founded Reddit, as if we know each other. We clearly do not. But thanks for giving me some cred, dude :\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vfosl/iamalexis_ohanian_startup_founder_internet/c54387o?context=5)|Oh hai! Nicely done. Feel free to namedrop.

She wouldn't last long outside - she was maybe a month or so old when the shelter found her and she hasn't been outside since. I thought about getting a leash though....
[Yowza that made the tears stream pretty freely, it does lead to another question though, had circumstances been different and your mother health not been an issue would you have held onto reddit longer?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vfosl/iamalexis_ohanian_startup_founder_internet/c543lcm?context=5)|Maybe. But the benefit of hindsight and experience would've had even more of an impact. Ultimately, I don't spend a second wondering. I've been really fortunate with the way things turned out (and continue to turn out). No regrets.
[Ignoring the internet drama portions, you have to admit that ""witchhunting"" is a rather serious flaw in the community and site. The fact that users can be targeted and effectively silenced with a sea of downvotes solely because the community hates them (because of legitimate reasons or misunderstandings\) is a violation of redditquette on a massive scale.  Do you have any idea of how to fix this issue? Do you think it's an issue that even *needs* fixing?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vfosl/iamalexis_ohanian_startup_founder_internet/c5439v3?context=5)|Witchhunting is a flaw of human behavior, which admins can only do so much against. I have no idea of how to fix it from a software pov, beyond what we're presently doing.
[One thing I really admire is that you've seemed to stay so level-headed throughout all the media coverage and success that you've had- is this difficult? Your public image is unique- you're painted as a jokester yet still taken very seriously.  How often are you evaluating your statements and making sure you're words aren't being interpreted the wrong way?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vfosl/iamalexis_ohanian_startup_founder_internet/c542hn2?context=5)|Interesting. I don't think too much about my public image but what you're telling me could be a lot worse ;)
 |All of the live TV coverage SOPA/PIPA brought was a great education in how to deliver a message in a short time period to a distracted audience. I was pretty awful at first, but I dug through feedback in reddit/HN/twitter comments and rewatched tape of masters in the medium (e.g., Hitch) to figure out craft soundbytes that the format craves.

I got a card and the freedom to get whatever I want, whenver I want, is fucking with me. I really need to stop and reset from all of my vices.

If I keep smoking hardcore like this and caving in I'm going to really regret this summer even more.

I need to motivationally reset myself or something."

I look for safety schools for a CS PhD in the US that is good for theory. I lean toward algorithms kind of theory, especially computational geometry, but complexity is also ok.

If I was asking for general CS, I would expect to see lot of answers. CS Theory is so ignored in this subreddit, I have seen so many questions about what to do to get internships, but none about how CS theory undergraduate can progress to their next destination.

I have a [cv](http://chaoxuprime.com/files/cv.pdf) if it helps one determine what level is a safety school for me.

Here is a list of schools I have considered:

1: MIT, Cornell, CMU (5% chance)

2: Georgia Tech, Berkeley, UIUC, Brown (20% chance)

3: UW–Madison, Rutgers (50% chance)

Safety: Stony Brook, Clemson. (90% chance)

vj25s,1,2012-06-24,America to (almost) Anywhere,Hollow_Hills,IWantOut,https://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/vj25s/america_to_almost_anywhere/,"I've been kicking the idea around for years now and I've realized I really need to start forming a real plan if I'm to actually ever get out. 
Like most other people it seems, Western Europe/Australia/NZ are the top choices but I'd definitely consider other options.

Relevant Info:

Age : 27 (female if that makes a difference)

Education : Bachelor's of Science in Nutrition and Dietetics, recently returned to school to get a Bachelor's in Bio-Molecular Engineering. 

Real Job Skills : Extensive customer service work (i.e. retail and fast food peon). I do have basic computer skills like Office and Excel but who doesn't these days. I can pick up necessary skills pretty fast but obviously I don't have anything to really set me apart from most people in the 15+ age groups these days. You can see part of why I'm back in school!

Language Skills : Very basic French- I'm willing to learn more of it or any other languages if it will help. I can also sort of guess at written German and Dutch if it's very simple stuff for whatever that's worth.

Criminal Convictions : None

Alternative Destinations: YES

Temp. or Permanent: Permanent

I'd also like to mention that though I'm in school for Bio-Molecular Engineering, I've only just started so I'm at a point where switching majors to something more likely to help me get out would be considered. Most specifically I'm nursing as other engineering disciplines don't really grab me as much and healthcare workers are always needed. (I don't get very excited about the idea of being a nurse though. But if it gets me out....) A general Chemical Engineering degree (what I'm going for now is an offshoot of that ) would be ok but I'd need to switch schools and I can't really afford to live on my own right now. I could commute but it'd be harder to have a job and still keep up with school that way. If necessary, I could even just have my degree as a back-up and teach English in SE Asia or something. I'm willing to be somewhat flexible if it can help me get out!

Another thing I feel I should mention, as I don't know how it may or may not affect my chances is my health. I have asthma, but am otherwise in good shape. Would something like that hurt my chances or are there any precautions I would need to take with it while getting out? It's something that I need to make sure is taken care of because without medicine to control it my asthma can become a problem.

One more thing: School outside of the US is likely not feasible for me at this point. It's cheap enough for the school but the money required to travel over is not something I have. If I found something that was essentially guaranteed my family *might* help but as it stands they're in some weird mindset that leaving America is harder than walking to the moon. Even trying to talk to them about it seems to get them irritated and they go all doom and gloom and I just get frustrated.  I do have the option of an exchange program next summer in France but I don't know how much that would help me in getting out unless I was able to make some awesome connections in the space of a month. (Or if  an exchange program would be helpful to this goal at all). I'd consider an overseas internship, but I don't know if such things really exist. (If they do I imagine they aren't easy to get either!)

Anyway, I hope my post makes sense and that at least a few of you can give me good and useful advice.

vip4r,0,2012-06-24,"Stuck in an internship job I hate, trying to get unstuck.",kevtice15,needadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/vip4r/stuck_in_an_internship_job_i_hate_trying_to_get/,"So on Monday, I will start the 4th week of a 10 week internship I have at a big tech company (by big I mean global, 10s of 1000s of employees, jobs for people to do in pretty much all areas of CS) that will remain unnamed.  I graduated with a degree in Computer Science in May and I will begin a graduate program in the fall.  The company sent out a spreadsheet to all the interns a few months ago with a list of all the groups in the company taking interns and asked us to fill our top 7 into a survey.  I get an email the week before the internship starts saying I'm going to be in a group that isn't even on the list, so I can't even check to see what the group I got placed in does.  But I figure, whatever, I'll see what happens, maybe I'll enjoy it.  A bit of backstory: &lt;backstory&gt; in my last semester of my CS degree, I took a class about data communications and network programming.  I learned a lot about networks themselves, but the biggest and most important lesson I learned is that I don't like network programming, and I'm not very good at it.  The class was a struggle and I praised Turing when the class was over. &lt;/backstory&gt;  When I arrive on the first day of my internship, my manager, after thanking me for picking this group, begins to explain to what it is I have to do.  Of course of all things, this group deals HEAVILY with network programming (if you're familiar, specifically the Data Link and Network layers of the OSI model, so pretty low level stuff).  My heart drops. I can't help but wonder how this has happened.  Firstly how the internship coordinators could not place me in any of my SEVEN choices.  And secondly, even if I really, for some reason, just could not have one of my SEVEN CHOICES, how did I have the intense misfortune of being placed in a group that deals heavily with one of the only topics in CS that I could not bring myself to enjoy in any way.  Even after this meeting, I try to have a positive outlook. Having a job isn't class, so maybe network programming in the real world could be fun.  They proceed to have me read documents to get me up to speed on what I'll be working on.  So I read ... every day ... 8 hours a day ... for 3 weeks ... about network programming ... in which I have utterly no interest.  Then at the end of the 3rd week, I have another meeting with my manager and he gives me my actual assignment (which I'm purposely not going to explain), and it sounds like the 5th circle of my personal hell.  I feel like I made a big mistake not trying to get transfered to another group in the first week because 1) I don't know what other managers would be willing to take an intern for 6 weeks, and 2) I don't know how good of an internship experience I'm likely to have even if I switch.  I wake up everyday with a huge sigh and struggle to get myself ready to be at work on time. I really feel like I'm not going to be able to do this and I don't know what I should do.  Should I tell my manager that I hate my job so he can at least know even if I'm unable to switch?  Would it be worth it to switch?  Any insights into a course of action would be much appreciated.

tl;dr - Lost the internship lottery at a big company, hate my job, 6 weeks left, should I try to get them to switch me to a new job?"
vii6m,7,2012-06-24,THE MANLY ADVENTURES OF ABNER DEGGENT: Island of the Toroga,magwier,libraryofshadows,https://www.reddit.com/r/libraryofshadows/comments/vii6m/the_manly_adventures_of_abner_deggent_island_of/,"The decade after the second world war was a period of unlimited prosperity. For a rugged few individuals it was also a time of unlimited adventure and the manliest of those adventurers was the mercenary, treasure hunter and unlicensed electrician named Abner Deggent.

It would be fair to say that he fascinated me from the very first. As an amateur writer I had become an avid observer of humanity and I knew from the very first glance that this was a man that lived life on the edge.

It began in the summer of 1947, once I had been one of the most decorated chefs in the navy but I had recently been dishonorably discharged. You might think a man like General McArthur would be more forgiving of a few tapeworms but you would be wrong.

My aimless wanderings had brought me to a bar in Singapore that was owned by a retired trainer of fighting chickens, which was why he had named his establishment ‘The Brutal Cock.’ This was an establishment that catered to the jaded desires of soldiers of fortune and modern day pirates.

Everyone looked up when the man strode into the bar; some noticed his whipcord muscles, others noticed his steely eyed expression, many more noticed that when he kicked the door open it hit a waitress and knocked her unconscious.

He walked up to the bar and began talking to the owner, his mastery of the Malay language was clumsy but he spoke with the kind of confidence only a man that doesn’t realize he’s accidentally ordered a Shirley Temple with Tabasco sauce can have.

I left my table and introduced myself.

“Deggent’s the name,” he shook my hand with crushing force. His was as deep and rich as a good souffle, “Abner Deggent.”

I introduced myself, “Ralph Brooks.”

The owner brought over his drink, Deggent sipped from it contemplatively, then coughed for a few minutes.

When his eyes had stopped watering I ordered him an expensive beer.

He smiled thinly “Much obliged Brooks.”

“Please, you may call me Ralph,” I paid for our drinks, “and if you don’t mind my saying so it looks as though you are either coming back from an adventure or are about to set out on one.”

“Everyday is an adventure for me Brooks,” he took a long swig of beer. If the mustache of dripping foam bothered him he gave no sign.

“Really? I’d like to hear more.” I said.

Deggent explained to me that he had recently undertaken a mission to help recover the twin idols from the natives of Togora Island.

“I’m sorry if I’m a bit confused,” I interrupted, “but you said you were recovering these idols.”

“Yes,” he grunted, “those artifacts were solid gold, they were priceless. Better to have them in a museum than to have them being worshiped by a bunch of savages for another two hundred years.”

I nodded with understanding and he continued his story. The expedition, he explained, had been organized by Professor Eisenhart working from the notes of a previous expedition that had disappeared without a trace. Other men might have been scared off knowing something like that but not Deggent!

Besides, no one told him anything about it until they were already on the island of the Toroga The expedition consisted of Deggent, Professor Eisenhart and their translator, a lovely native girl named Weena. They lacked the funds for native bearers and bodyguards but the Professor got around that by recruiting a small force of unpaid interns.

Occasionally Deggent would pause in the telling of his tale to place another drink order on my tab and try to entice our waitress into having sex with him for money. He started out by waving a ten dollar bill under her nose and worked his way up in increments of five.

My narrative skills could never fully capture the tale of their journey through that savage land. They encountered quicksand and ravenous beasts, clever deathtraps and rock slides, the crossed swords with another group of treasure hunters and wandering Toroga warriors. Our heroes braved it all, venturing deeper and deeper into the jungle leaving nothing but a trail of mutilated unpaid interns in their wake.

When they reached the village of the Toroga they were immediately set upon and captured, their translator having betrayed them. Deggent could only speculate to her reasons but he suspected that the check he had prepaid her with bouncing had something to do with it.

The chief of the Toroga spoke perfect English and he explained that his people were weary of one group of adventurers after another raiding their quiet village. He meant to make an example of our heroes by subjecting them to the Death Of A Thousand Screams.

Abner Deggent laughed fearlessly at this causing the chief of the Toroga to re-sentence him to the Death Of One Really Big Scream but before that could happen Deggent challenged the man, infact he challenged the honor of the entire Toroga people.

“I told him that we would have our champion fight theirs, if we won we would go free, if they won they would go forward with the executions,” Deggent explained, “luckily he fell for it.”

“Well, what happened?” I asked.

Deggent shrugged, “Damned if I know, we told them the last surviving intern was our champion and we made our escape as he battled the tribal champion in a pit full of flaming vipers.”

Of course there was more to the story? Did they ever find the treasure? How did they escape the island?

Before I could ask the owner of the bar appeared before us waving a rusty machete. It was only then that Abner Deggent discovered he had been propositioning the man’s daughter for sexual favors all night.

What happened then? That is a story for another time."

I'm just finishing up my second year (at community college..) and transferring to a UC to continue. 

Currently the CS-related courses I have taken are: Intro to C++ (two quarters), Data Structures &amp; Algorithms in C++ (one quarter). C as a second language (one quarter), Intro to UNIX/Linux.

I don't currently find any of these skills useful as no one is looking to pay me to create a program they can run in a console... 

I also noticed that most employers of interns are looking for either Python/Django experience or Java/Javscript experience... So what the hell am I doing with C++??

Furthermore, what can I work on this Summer, and which courses should I sign up for (this coming school year) so that next Summer I will be able to actually flex my CS muscles and get a powerful internship?

Some other ideas I have thought about was diving into Android App development. Where do I even start with this? I know it doesn't use C++ (I believe its Java based?), so would I need to start learning Java? What else? How long will learning this take? 

Also any other idea on how I can make money with my major before I graduate?

I know the basics of AdWords and have worked with GoogleGrants but I am not certified. I also know the basics of Facebook ads and a bit about promoted tweets. 

In addition to internships, I managed to hold down several jobs on campus (all marketing and social media centric) while maintaining a 3.7 GPA. I have also worked on several accounts through NSAC, a national student marketing competition via AAF. 

Beyond that I'm an energetic person that loves meeting new people and learning new skills. I can (and WILL) teach myself any skills necessary to my job. I have a passion for media and knowing what makes people tick/ why marketing works.

Maybe you know the feeling too. I had never consciously seen my possessions as something that was causing me some level of inner turmoil and stress. Throughout my childhood, I had acquired various things from my hobbies. Over time, those items had to travel with me as I moved for university and then internships. Packing and unpacking was always a stressful activity. You know the story.

When I came across minimalism applied to living, it was as if a light switch was thrown and the mental straps that was bearing down on my mind was illuminated, plain to see. I immediately became aware that my happiness derived from experiences, and if my possessions didn't contribute to positive experiences then they were an anchor of my spirit. I started throwing away and giving away a lot, but not all, of my things. Each time I removed something that I didn't need from my life, I became a little bit calmer, a little bit more tranquil. You know the story.

After a while, I'd made a lot of progress. I was much happier with the state of my living. I started thinking a little bit deeper about why exactly I was feeling burdened my possessions, and why I felt the way I did when I lived with less. It came down to this for me: the possessions are just an intermediary in the chain of anxiety, and at the root of it, fear.

What is this anxiety? It's not the normal kind, it lays hidden in your subconscious without you realising it. It's the chain being dragged behind you as you live your life, little by little taking parts of your spirit and time. It builds up, and when you realise it, it becomes unnerving just how long you've spent in this state. The anxiety builds because when I attach parts of my identity, of who I am as a person and my life experiences, to my possessions, I become responsible for them. I become a responsible guardian, because if who I am and my worth is in possessions, then the possessions must be protected as a part of myself. The fear simply results from the fear of losing parts of yourself, and the knowledge that you're more empty inside because of it.

So here I am yet again. The temptation to accumulate more comes with occasion, and the demons in my mind want me to put value, personal value, into them. It's easy. All you have to do is buy and store, and you feel like you're a bigger person for it. You temporarily feel like you've grown, because your possessions are part of your identity, and you have more. More is always better isn't it? We know of course this isn't true, yet this is another one of those battles that we fight with ourselves quietly, unknown to anyone, even ourselves sometimes.

The battle will be won eventually, but what's next? Minimalism was a necessary and valuable step in my journey of self discovery for who I want to be, and finding our how to live the life I want to live. Myself, I don't know where my own story goes. Perhaps you do."
vld6m,1,2012-06-25,I need to rant about the completely oblivious previous generations.,Jazztoken,lostgeneration,https://www.reddit.com/r/lostgeneration/comments/vld6m/i_need_to_rant_about_the_completely_oblivious/,"My story is long, but it's summed up by the fact that my personal goal is to return to college and become a computer scientist, or possibly some form of engineer. I can't do that right now, so I have to listen to a constant barrage of ""what are you doing with your life?"". Both are very useful, profitable, in demand and realistically, not more expensive (as I already have a couple years of college under my belt) that going to trade school. For the record, I'm already a programmer.

Yet, every single time I talk to my family, they harp that I need to become a welder, plumber, or electrician- careers that have median earning of roughly half of my intended career; careers that also can't expect decent paying internships during the education. Regardless of how many perks I bring up, they seem to be brainwashed into believing the only profitable way to succeed in life is to do back breaking and dirty work. For the record, I don't think there's anything wrong with it. I've done construction most of my adult life. I just want to be *successful*.

Furthermore, I just spent 30 minutes arguing with my mother, who seems to believe that it's possible to begin a Civil Engineering apprenticeship after a four-month training program. No degree necessary.

Is the media feeding this impression that bad? I cannot understand where they're getting their information.

vl5qs,12,2012-06-25,Need advice for getting an entry level finance position,someguy82,finance,https://www.reddit.com/r/finance/comments/vl5qs/need_advice_for_getting_an_entry_level_finance/,"I have been looking for an entry level finance position for almost a year now with out any success.  Initially I really wanted be on the investment side of analysis, but as time passed I became less picky and at this point I am willing to take anything at all that has to do with analysis.  

I graduated in the top 15% of my class from a well known University, but every place I apply is the same story: ""We need someone with more experience.""  These aren't upper level jobs I am applying to either.  They are entry level positions asking for 0-2 years, and there aren't very many of them.  Of the few entry level positions that do get posted, there are generally about 150-300 applicants per job(based off what several interviewers have told me).  

So how do I differentiate myself from the pack when I don't have experience?

Things I have tried:

Internships-  This is a dead end.  I applied to approximately 30 different internships, but I have been told by multiple recruiters that they cant hire you for an internship position if you are no longer in school, so this option is out because I already graduated.

Networking-  I contacted all my friends and family about my job search.  My family is very small and I am somewhat of an introvert so my network is not terribly large.  I ended up with 6 informational interviews and got a lot of good information(including multiple HR people reviewing my resume), but ultimately no job prospects.  I see ""networking"" mentioned frequently here, but I feel that I have reached the end of my personal network.  If you have any advice on how to improve my networking it would be much appreciated.  

Temp agencies-  I tried contacting the three agencies that specialize in temporary finance positions in my area, but they haven't returned any of my messages.  While I don't know why this is the case, I would imagine it has to do with the fact that they are looking for people with experience.  If their clients want people with experience(and I am sure they do) then the agencies are only going to hire people with experience.  

Applying to as many places as I can-  I check my schools career website, go to job fairs, and check the websites of as many local companies as I can think of(Amazon, Boeing, Blackrock, allstate, parametric, becu, ubs, Russel Investments, etc).

CFA program- With all this spare time I have not working, I decided to start on the CFA program in order to keep my mind sharp in the areas of finance.  I find out if I passed at the end of July.

Can anyone help me with my plan moving forward?

So I had been talking to this girl for the past 4 weeks or so but we hadn't hung out in 3 weeks due to conflicting busy schedules (or so I thought). So this past Thursday we finally got a chance to see each other by meeting at a bar with some friends. Now I know that the thought of seeing her got me anxious and whatnot, but I didn't think it would make me overly anxious/nervous. Long story short, I didn't eat sufficiently, I drank a little bit, and made frequent trips to the bathroom to throw up. Of course she didn't know that because she was playing me the whole time, but that's beside the point. The point is, was it the nervousness that made me nauseous or was it the lack of food I had mixed with slight drinking? 

Now move on to Friday. Right before I left for the bar on Thursday, I got the number of one of the interns I work with and it seemed that there might be something there. So the interns had already planned a trip to a brewery after work and I knew that since I wasn't talking to the first girl anymore, I could focus my energy on the intern. But this thought made my anxious/nauseous feeling come back. Not to the point that it was Thursday, but just enough that I could feel it. I didn't end up throwing up Friday, but just the fact that the feeling was still there was troubling to me.

And now, to Saturday. Some of the interns, including the girl, went to Athens to celebrate someone's birthday. I knew that I was going to actively pursue the girl, but I also could still feel the nauseous feelling...after two days. I disregaurded it becasue I knew that this was the day I had to make my move. So I drove to Athens, met up with the girl and everyone else. We pregamed. We went out. I drank a decent amount which surprised me becasue I honestly felt if I drank anything I would throw up on spot. Then towards the end of the night I ended up at her place and we made out a bit. In the middle of it I did have to excuse myself to the bathroom but I attributed that to the drinks. It was fine and we went to bed but I couldn't sleep becasue A) I was exremely hungry, and B) I was still kind of nauseous.

Woke up on Sunday. Woke her up with a kiss. Immediately excused myself to the bathroom to throw up (maybe hungover?? idk). Came back and talked a bit, then I left. Once I left I felt slightly better but I still had that anxious feeling. Tried to get rid of it all day with Tums, soup and rest but it didn't work.

So now it's Monday, and i'm sitting at work with the same nauseous anxious feeling that I just can't get rid of. There's nothing anticipatory about today other than going back to my hotel room and sleeping. I'm not gonna see intern girl until I get back in town which isn't for another 4 days. I honestly don't know where the feeling is coming from anymore. I'm wondering if I need to actually go to the doctor? I just want to feel normal.

Your input is appreciated. This is me kind of letting my gaurd down because this whole ""getting nauseous after hooking up"" thing is not fun at all and is kind of embarassing honestly. So yea...help me out please!

**TL/DR: Lately i've been getting nauseous after hooking up with someone. It happened this weekend but the nauseous feeling is still carrying over into the week. Do I need to go to the doctor or am I just overly anxious about seeing her again?**

vkn1c,5,2012-06-25,Not Enough Bits,notenoughbits,MyLittleSupportGroup,https://www.reddit.com/r/MyLittleSupportGroup/comments/vkn1c/not_enough_bits/,"Well, I guess this is a problem almost everyone encounters, but I'd like to get it off my chest so I'm not tossing and turning at 3 AM again thinking about it. 

Basically, my lack of bits is due in part to personal irresponsibility, part in due to circumstance, and I'm conflicted about the entire thing. 

It feels like everyone I know has money. Everyone goes out, has cars, spends time traveling, whatever. Maybe that isn't the case, perceptions aren't always reality. 

And it also feels as if everyone's parents are subsidizing them except my own. While growing up we certainly weren't poor, my parents were shit financial planners and haven't really helped me out much in terms of college. A few bucks here and there, help with a few major jams, but damn, they did not plan. Oh, and the best part is my family, after convincing me college was a great plan, likes to now talk about how college isn't a good investment. Thanks for the heads up once I'm 50k in!

It wouldn't be fair to put it all on them, though. I spend too much money. I want to keep up with the Joneses, to look cool - to do what I thought everyone else was doing. My friends have nice things and go out, why shouldn't I? That attitude isn't really good torwards saving money. And while I consider myself well-educated and I'm getting good experience with my internships, they don't really pay enough. I've considered getting a weekend job, but I don't want to cripple my social life. I think about how much money I've spent on going out I could have saved - great experiences, but damn, I feel kind of stupid and I definitely need to tailor that back. 

Then it's just unfortunate events. Car breakdowns. Parking tickets. Traffic tickets. Computer breakdowns. Etc., etc....all these compounding things kind of suck. Bad planning! My car broke down, predatory cops giving out stupid tickets, my car not selling for as much as I hoped for. I barely have any money for merch at Bronycon (the ultimate in first-world problems, but still)

I know there's people much worse off in life, both in terms of parents, student loans, education, work experience and bad luck. But I still feel alittle cheated. It's probably just me feeling entitled, and I need to shake that. But when everyone else around you seems to be doing fine, you do get abit jealous. 

I really wanted to just write this out and get it off my chest, but advice, maybe your own stories, anything like that is appriciated too. Ideas on making extra money would be awesome, too. I'm saavy with computers and know abit about web design, maybe I could do simple computer repair or website design on the side for extra cash. I liked working with people, so going back to retail is a possbility. 

Thanks for listening to this first-world-problems rant. "

vk0a2,4,2012-06-24,Suicidal Thoughts. Thought a reddit post might help.,AlmostBreakingPoint,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/vk0a2/suicidal_thoughts_thought_a_reddit_post_might_help/,"**TL/DR  college graduate. No job, no call-backs, loans about to default, stressed out too much, looking for advice** 
So, here's the gist of things, and this may or may not be a throwaway account. I have graduated from college with a Bachelor's Degree a year ago. After an internship, I stayed at my sister and her family's to help watch her kids while I searched for a full-time job. I would like to point out her husband works full time, she worked and took college classes, and she was pregnant. Now, after baby complications (sick baby) the kid is doing allright, and I have had several decent interviews. 
However, here are the biggest problems. I am not getting hired, anywhere. My nest egg for rainy days has now reached near empty, loans (90k at least) are near defaulting, I am basically mooching off her and her family, and I can't even get a minimum wage job.
I would like to point out that I love my sister and the rest of my family. I am beyond appreciative of how she has been willing to put up with me for this long. She, however, doesn't think I am looking hard enough, despite looking for both jobs for my degree and any minimum wage job I can get in the mean time. I can see her point of view of all of this. If I had the money, I would move in with my brother and hope job prospects are better where he is.
Here's the thing though. I can put up a good front, but I am psychologically fragile. I have no close friends, and barely keep in touch with anyone, besides random Facebooking. Nobody realizes how often I think of suicide. Wrists, drowning (convenient river nearby), car accident, window jumping, I've thought of ways and ways. and my sister has passive aggressive down to an art, so I end up talking to my bro-in-law, who is waaay too understanding, and has it rough being between the two of us. 
I know the reasons not to. Mostly, right now, it's that my sister's kids are used to their uncle and I wouldn't want them to see it, let alone deal with it. I also don't want one of my bros being stuck with the loan they co-signed for (+4k).  I've always told people, but I do't think they realized how serious I was, that one of the reasons I haven't gone through with it is that I'm too curious. About what's happening next in a book, seeing a new movie, wondering if I might actually get a date sometime soon. *sigh* and it doesn't help that whenever I start to get too upset after thinking about all of this, I get physically ill. I get flushed and heated, nauseous, and my throat burns. Sometimes it gets so I have to leave and go walking around at night to get tired enough to rest.  
So there you have it. Any advice, beyond the obvious ""don't do it!"" ? I've had thoughts like this before, but never this strong and this sustained. I'm not good with speaking about my feelings, especially with family. We've never been that type. And mom and dad passed away a few years ago. I've thought about joining the army but not sure how much that would help me out.
I should be on for another hour, and will probably check this again in the morning.
*edited in* I should also point out that along with all this, I have no health insurance and am currently getting teeth pain. I probably have a cavity or two, despite dental hygiene, which occasional pain doesn't help me much either.

**1hour gone**
So, not sure how to add the new little post below this, so just editing in here. I'm tired and my eyes are heavy so I think I will sleep now. Will respond to anything new when I wake... I should also point out that the past two nights I've had nightmares... and I haven't dreamed anything before this in several months. So this doesn't help my mental health much either. Thanks for the current responders, even if I can't yet and am unsure how to post this in the SW subreddit. Hopefully I will feel a little better in the morning."

I do currently have the banfield wellness plan but everyone knows they dont do shit when it comes to situations like this. I do happen to have an appt on tues for his bi-annual check up but I would rather go to a real vet. I heard an abdominal x-ray alone would be around 200$ according to a banfield estimate and who knows how much surgery would be. I know this sound really irresponsible but I am really trying to help my kitty and the last thing I want is to him to suffer. :(

I heard I might be able to call local animal shelters around asking for help - is this true? 

EDIT* Hey thank you guys! :) my kitty is back to being himself (eating and happy) but he is struggling to poop and left two little dropplings in his litter box! Definitely still going to take him to see whats going on though!

I currently have a Bachelor of Arts from The University of Toronto (in Philosophy), and I have the option of doing a second degree in only 3 years from the same school.  I am trying to decided if the extra work and money of a BSc in Comp. Sci. is worth it over a 3 year college degree program.  While the college diploma would help connect me with an internship and help me enter the work force faster, I feel that it might limit me in my career growth.

Most of the 'good' job postings I have seen all require a BSc which makes me lean towards that route.  There are a couple of large companies in Toronto which could be potential employers (Ubisoft &amp; IBM off the top of my head)

Any input is appreciated!"

I'm really hitting a brick wall with my classes, and it's not because of effort. I came into university at age 20 with a severe lack of math and science skills (no substantial knowledge of math past algebra I), but somehow made it through the first 2 years on time for the most part. I was able to pull off a lot of A's and B+'s in the Calc sequence, in some of my Chem classes, etc. I've always worked hard. But I feel like i'm falling apart as I move into the actual engineering courses. I have gone from a B- to C+ and now a D in the ChemE classes i've been in (the D is a class I am currently enrolled in, Thermo). Last semester I get an A- and B+ in Multivariable calc and Diff Eq, but the C+ in energy balances. If you look at my GPA outside of engineering, it is wonderful (outside of Orgo 1, but i'm doing great the second time around, i'm taking that as well this summer).

I'm trying, i've readjusted my study patterns. My notebook is filled with notes in completely logical manner, split up by class notes, quizzes, online notes, etc. But I always fuck up on the quizzes that make up most of our grade, and it's just starting to eat at me. I basically have to start getting consistent 10's or I might fail... which will set me back a whole year with regards to graduation since the fall class is already full. I've been just as confused and frustrated in Calc and Physics before, yet found a way to get a good grade. I somehow got a B+ in Physics I while simultaneously learning Trigonometry. In the actual engineering courses, I never improve, it's like I have 600 puzzle pieces and i'm always missing a few pieces to complete the puzzle.

I feel guilty beyond all belief for so many reasons. My mom is paying for my college, and I went to community college for two years before university (tried accounting, my mom forced me to go). I feel like if I am able to graduate, it'll take 7-8 years at best at this rate. I also have a lot of stress in my personal life since I am transitioning from male to female, and have no idea how I am going to actually come out, or when, and how to correlate that to my classes. Or if my internship will even want me to stick around if I came out.

Am I just not intelligent enough to master engineering? Uhg. =("
vnkup,1,2012-06-26,Success story (and advice if you want to take it),fromcj,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/vnkup/success_story_and_advice_if_you_want_to_take_it/,"Sup dudes and dudettes,

This is a story about how anyone has a chance to beat depression. Seriously, anybody. I know some of you are like ""I've tried everything. This can't help."" but it might. So give it a shot. I promise not to offer bad advice like ""Just believe in yourself!"" or to ""take it one day at a time"" because I've been where you guys are, and I now want to see you guys get to where I am.

I had been getting more and more depressed since...December of 2009 or January of 2010. At first it was just me being totally broken up and lost after a split with my girlfriend of two years. Then I found out that she had been sexually assaulted at a party and that's what led to her retreating inwards, pushing me away, and ultimately no longer being interested in dating me at all. Then it sort of didn't cross my mind all summer, I was away from home for an internship so it was pretty relaxing.

When I got back to school in September though, it was right back down into a hole that was getting deeper and deeper. Girls didn't want to date me because I had 0 self-esteem, and I had 0 self-esteem because girls didn't want to date me. Then I started to do worse and worse in my classes. I had always had a tenuous relationship with alcohol but I basically went off the deep end at this point. I was drinking heavily. Like handles of vodka (100 proof, not 80 proof), everclear, anything that could just get me drunk super fast. And I was doing this basically every night.

So anyway, I'm gonna fast forward cause we don't need to hear all these stories about me making a fool of myself and making bad choices which all led to me becoming extremely depressed. I was pretty much thinking about suicide all the time cause I just couldn't deal with being this sad for the rest of my life.

Then one day while I was trying to get through some homework that I just had like, negative interest in, I put on an album by a band I had heard about all the time but had never tried. The band was called The Wonder Years and the album was called The Upsides. It basically saved my life because it taught me to fight. The whole theme of the album is that the guy who wrote it was too young to be this defeated by life. I'm not saying that people who are in there 40s and 50s and beyond should be okay with being depressed, but feeling totally beaten down by the world when you're still college-aged? That's the kind of stuff that leads to kids killing themselves.

I went to a therapist on campus, she recommended some guy to me, it didn't really work out. He kept trying to find a problem to diagnose me with and didn't address the fact that I was clearly depressed. He wanted me to work on my self esteem but I was like dude, you don't get it, its not that I don't have any self esteem, it's that I don't CARE that I don't have any. It didn't work out, so I went back to the therapist and asked if she had any other recommendations. She gave me two more cards for therapists that she knew personally and said they were really good. Out of the blue I asked her if she knew any physicians as well, just so I could get a physical, which I needed at the time.

I went in for my physical and regular doctor/patient stuff happened. Y'know, weight, height, blood pressure, grabbing my balls, all that stuff. At the end he asked if I had anything I wanted to talk about and I just said I was having trouble sleeping so I was hoping I could get like Ambien or some other sleep aid. He talked to me a little bit about why I was having trouble sleeping and I explained that I have anxiety, panic attacks, the idea of facing another day is so overwhelming, all this stuff. So he wrote me some prescriptions.

I got put on Celexa (citalopram) and Welbutrin (bupropion) for a while. I think I got put on them in December, so 2 years after I first started feeling this way. That's how long it took me to get help. Ridic. But they worked a little bit, and I felt a little bit better. I didn't want to die anymore, I just wanted life to be better. I left it at that and was like ok. This must be what it feels like to not be depressed. Kinda lame. Oh well.

I basically just lived my life at that point. Barely got through school, moved to a new apartment, got a new job, all that. But I wasn't feeling better. I was actually starting to get worse again. The idea of going to this job that I didn't even really like for the rest of my life was just overwhelming. Luckily, my bupropion scrip ran out, and my doctor wanted me to come in for a check up.

I went in and I told him about my issues. Still can't sleep, still getting anxiety attacks, still sad all the time, all that. So he upped my dosage of citalopram to 40mg from 20. I was really nervous about this next part and I had to fight to get it out but I told him I was thinking I might have ADHD. We went over why I thought so, I listed some of the things I do that made me think that, and he wrote me a scrip for Adderall.

Turns out that's exactly what I needed. It turns out that almost all of my problems are also problems that people with ADHD experience. Depression, anxiety, drastic mood swings, OCD, everything can co-occur with ADHD. I never even THOUGHT about it until my roommate in college got a scrip for it and it totally changed his personality from a person who did really poorly in school and didn't really care or try or anything like that to a completely average student. He did his homework, he passed his classes, he got a girlfriend, he was golden. Now that I'm on it, I feel better already and it hasn't even been a week. I've already had 3 days free of any significant, long-term bouts of depression or anxiety, I sleep better, I do my schoolwork, it's great.

So anyway, that's my story. I am the best person I've been in over 2 years, and I want you guys to know that you can reach that place too. Here are just some random bits of advice that I would give to ANYONE with depression.

* Don't be afraid to talk to your doctor about ANYTHING that might concern you because you never know what could be fueling your depression. Never just assume that you're not being effected by something.
* Don't be afraid of pills and drugs. I was, which is why I put off talking to a doctor for so long and resorted to alcohol and hard drugs.
* Establish a support network. Don't hide what's going on from your friends. They'll want to help you get better.
* Find inspiration. Find motivation. I found mine in an album (again, The Upsides by The Wonder Years. I really can't recommend it enough, I'm not kidding when I say it saved my life.) but you could find yours anywhere. 

That's it. That's all I had to do. In retrospect, it seems so simple, but I know from experience it isn't simple. All I can do is encourage you to take that first step. You'll feel so much better when the journey is over, but it can't end until it's begun. So do it for you. Get out there and do whatever it takes to feel better, because you all fucking deserve it.

TL,DR: It's not about forcing yourself to be happy, it's about not letting the sadness win."

I have just finished my first year of University studying Computer Science in the United Kingdom, after seeing so many people on my course it's really motivated me to set myself aside from everyone else come the end of the third and final year.



From my understanding, the best way to achieve this is through Intern ships, personal projects, open-source involvement and a display of passion.



Firstly, my University is teaching us Java, I believe actual coding only goes on until the end of the second year so I am eager to leave Java behind as it's continually stapled as a bad language to get into programming jobs (my desired field).



Now, Internships - specifically in the UK, how do these work? and how do I get involved? I've also seen people mention working for your Universities research department but I don't know how likely that is to happen. 

Personal Projects - Got ideas up my sleeve, but waiting to make the change over to C++ before I start making anything worthy of showcasing.

Open-Source: With my limited knowledge set of programming as of yet, how do I go about getting involved in open-source projects? I've looked through a few and they're all very very much out of my league. 


Thank you very much for your time, appreciate any replies and comments you have."
vnj19,2,2012-06-26,Religion in Social Work Practice: Are we all on the same page?,jamminjmoon,socialwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialwork/comments/vnj19/religion_in_social_work_practice_are_we_all_on/,"I stumbled into an incredibly controversial debate with my supervisor today and I just can't shake it.

It was brought to my attention today that the CSB I am working for does not have a policy regarding religion in any way, shape, or form.  My supervisor and my only co worker are both very religious and fairly open about it.  I am not a religious person.  I work in an adult day program for individuals with severe and persistent mental illnesses.  

The conversation went something like this:
Supervisor:  I want to do a group on spirituality and mental illness and I found this great resource.
Me:  Oh great what is it like?
Supervisor shows me the website
Me:  Oh that stinks, I guess we can't use it because there is scripture in the material.
Supervisor:  That is not necessarily true.  We could take certain words out (e.g. Christianity, God, Jesus, etc.), and then it would be ok
Me:  Oh, I thought that the NASW code of ethics, not to mention the government which we receive partial funding from, would prohibit the use of religious material in this setting because it could hinder relationships with clients who would not be comfortable with this
Supervisor:  Well our accrediting agency, CARF, specifically requires that we discuss spirituality in order to address mental health holistically
Me:  Well what happens when the clients ask direct questions about their specific religion, in regard to spirituality, or anyone else's?
Supervisor:  You can say whatever you are comfortable with.  I have given religious materials to clients who I knew were religious and I have disclosed that I believe in God
Me:  I'm so confused...I was told throughout school, an internship, and a job in a non profit organization, that I was to leave myself out of interactions with clients, and when I was met with a direct personal question I should re direct the conversation and say something like, 'Why are my religious beliefs important to your treatment here?'
Supervisor:  You were not hired as a ""social worker"" (I have a BSW and am working for a CSB), therefore as an employee you are to follow agency policies when they conflict with the NASW's views

This turned into a very interesting, but emotionally draining debate with my supervisor, which led me to check out our policy manual.  Upon scanning the entire gigantic document and realizing religion was not mentioned once, I then spoke with my supervisor's supervisor (with my direct supervisor's permission) who said she would bring it to the management team tomorrow and get back to me.

I guess my question is, how is this handled at your agency, or if you are in school, what is the latest the NASW has to say in the matter? And more personally, what the hell am I to do if I find out that my agency is supporting self disclosure, and specifically disclosure about religious preferences while leading groups with clients? I would love any feeback!!

What do you recommend for Anti-Virus, Backup Software/Method. I am sure I have hardware right as my specs have been on par with what consultants are recommending. One consultant thought backup to disk was fine, and the other thought it was ridiculous and the only way to go was tape. I was thinking it would be reasonable to use our DC with raid 5, w/ hot spare, and a NAS w/ raid 1 for backup storage. I understand the want for storing data off site, but our off-site storage is only a mile away. The building is a new brick building with excellent fire suppression, we don't get tornadoes often (southwest Wisconsin), the it room is in the same room as the severe weather shelter, and if it floods 1000 feet above sea level we have bigger problems.

When I went to court I ended up paying 1200 bucks and got 6 months probation (I won't start until August, when I get back from my Co-op job this summer, and it'll be shortened because of that). I've already stopped smoking though. The misdemeanor will be taken off at the end of the probation. A few weeks ago I finally got the courage to tell my boss. I'm working a software engineering Co-op job so I was scared I fucked that up, but my boss is really chill. He was fine with it and said he definitely wouldn't fire me for it. Last week I did an interview for an aerospace/defense/tech company internship next summer, and he told me to keep in touch, said he didn't know much about the paperwork and stuff but that it doesn't start until December. When I said my boss could put in a good word he told me it wasn't necessary and that the interest is enough. I told him about the arrest since I didn't want to get my hopes up, and he was super cool with it, said he and many others made mistakes in college and it just happens, no big deal. I feel a million times better and I'm so excited. His team works on missile defense targets. Fuck yea. 

So I just want to say even when things seem to not be going so well, it will get better. I was dumb and the past 2 years of amazing friends and Reddit/other internet sites put me in a daze that anyone my age was cool with it. Not everyone is. Be careful out there. Don't trust everyone.

**Facts**

I am in the technology field, and have been working mid-level positions for about 5 years. I have about 6 months of community college under my belt before I dropped out and started working full-time. I also have a fiance and a 2 year old I am supporting. I make enough to survive, but not enough to break away from living check-to-check or save much of anything.

**Decision**

I've been feeling super stagnant the past year, I've been drowning hours into a salaried position with no recognition and falling off the cutting edge of my field do to my family demands and all around exhaustion. This led me to start looking for a new job on the side. I sent my resume out to a few places, and one of my old colleges from my first job noticed. He works for a prominent start-up in my field.

I said what the heck and interviewed. Five 1 1/2 hour phone interviews later, I got an offer. They really like me, but feel that I need a bit more polish before they can accept me for the full-time gig. Their offer, a paid internship for &lt; 6 months with the option of that full-time job I was shooting for. The job is in San Fran (re: $$$$) and I am in suburbia ($$) across the country, 2 months into a lease with 2 dependents. I haven't replied yet, but the full time gig came with a relocation package, I'm not sure if this does, and how this would be feasible or safe for my family.

Hello, like the title says I've been in a relationship for three years with a wonderful girl (Kara 20F) who I care for so much but the problem is, I'm (21M) gay and I'm unfaithful. I've known I was into guys since I was 14 and have pretty much never doubted it but I've tried to fight it ever since. I have known Kara since we were kids and we have always shared a bond and me in my naivety thought with her unknowing help I could beat the feelings I was having for the men in my life.

I asked her to be my girlfriend on my 18th birthday and since then on the surface everything has been great. About six months into our relationship I had my first relapse so to speak, I had to be in a different state for six weeks for a minor internship for a company I wanted to work for in the future and in my time there I met a guy (21 like me now) and fell for him completely. I didn't do anything sexual but we spent hours every night talking and it meant the world to me. That raised some flags because that was the first time I had truly emotionally fallen for a guy.

A year later me and Kara move to that same place because she had been accepted to a great school, and I followed her because I was able to get a job at the same company I interned for the year before. Well, you can see where this is going, I met him and 4 month later I cheated and I'm not going to lie, it was incredible. I was able to feel the real thing, unfortunately the aftermath was awful. Just an hour after the sex, the self-loathing I felt was at it's highest point, I drove around for two hours crying like a little girl.

I was raised in a very conservative home where if you are gay, you're dead. My dad is a pastor, and my mother is no worse but she repeats everything he says as it's gospel. I haven't spoken to my mom and dad or my brother since I was 18 so that isn't the problem, it's what they left in me. This apparent inherent hatred for who I am.
Anyways, I felt so bad that I didn't speak to him for a month. I told him I wasn't gay and it was just alcohol and horniness (I don't even drink) that made that happen. I decided out of respect to my gf(I know, pathetic) to quit my job and get another one.

That isn't the end, I went to a convention three months ago and he showed up, begged me to talk to him and me being still intoxicated with him gave in and we talked for hours, we cried, we laughed and on the last day of the convention; we had sex.
Since then we've met up three times and had sex. He tells me to leave Kara and I know it's the right thing to do, but I'm not ready to be out and somehow losing Kara means it may be me giving up on what I promised my self at 16, to hide the fact I'm gay forever.

The shame get overpowering sometimes not only because I'm gay but what I'm doing to the most decent human being I know. Kara is beautiful, smart, funny and understands me. I really do love her but not in that way... It's hard to explain. She doesn't know anything, I've become to good of a liar, one of the things you pick up being a closeted gay man.

I have no idea why I came here, but getting this off my chest felt good. Has anyone else gone through something like this and if so. how did you deal with it?

tl;dr: I'm gay in a relationship with a wonderful girl, met a guy and fell for him, cheated and feeling pathetic and helpless.

Edit: Thanks for the replies guys, it has helped. I'm going to try to breakup with her in the next two weeks. Again, thanks."

I have programming knowledge but I've been checking out the typical questions in interviews and Im freaking out.

The responsabilities of the job are:
Research and Development: in File transfer solutions, agile workflows, HCI design (GUI), broadcast server development, media asset management and various projects in system programming, virtualization monitoring.

They also told me that they would give me a connection (ssh) to a linux server and that I would have to do a java task which usually lasts for 2-4 hours. What should I prepare? Do you think I will have to program using the shell? I am afraid I will do nothing without eclipses help."

I want to end things.,ThrowAway89625,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/vmbm2/how_do_you_deal_with_losing_the_love_of_your_life/,"I'm honestly thinking about ending things. The love of my life broke up with me right before I went off for an internship. Things were bad, the trust was broken, and it wasn't healthy. It's been a month now. I've never met, and after trying to date again, feel like I never will meet someone who was so beautiful and a great match for me personality wise. She was just too proud and didn't handle conflict well, and us not being able to handle conflict led to the demise of our relationship. It's tragic. I'm not sure that I want to live without her. I have everything in the world going for me aside from this, but I can't convince myself that it is worth it without someone I loved so much. I'm a mess, I feel like I can never love someone again. I'm still in love with this person. She has my dog and still some of my things and we haven't talked in a month so it would be a clean break. I just want to end things. Sometimes I feel good about myself again when I'm in blind denial about losing someone I loved so much and block out that she existed, but times like now are just so disheartening that I don't want to live."

*Preface: This is a complete first-world problem, I know. Moving on:*

I have a fair bit of disposable income from my engineering internships, with no outstanding financial obligations, and I was planning on getting a new Macbook Pro Retina (RMBP).

What's making me hesitate:

1) I have a great Dell XPS 15z currently (picked it up using some lab grant money just a year prior - dual core i7, 8gb RAM, SSD + HDD combo, .97"" thick, 1080p screen, Windows8)

2) Early adopter ""curse"" with Apple - I've heard numerous times it's advisable not to get the first generation of anything Apple, even with Applecare, due to unforseen bugs/kinks.

3) Firmly Android - I have no intention of getting an iPhone anytime soon (not a big fan of the UI, as well as Apple's policies toward locking everything down, ""walled garden"", etc. - not negotiable at this point). That being said, will I lose some nice functionalities going with OS X without an iOS device? 

Will the notification center/Growl replacement and upcoming improvements in Mountain Lion not be applicable at all for me without an iPhone?

4) Waiting for Haswell (Intel's next-gen, big generation-gap architecture coming next year). I want this MBP to last me a good 3-4 years + have great resale value, but since I don't *need* it now, I'd like to get Haswell if I could. Then again, I'm not even sure if Apple would incorporate Haswell chips into the 2nd-""gen"" RMBPs next June-ish...

-----------------------------------------------------------------

I've had a fair amount of experience with OS X (my parents have an iMac, and I've hackintoshed several older computers I've used prior). No particular preference between Windows and OS X for me, I like both. I just really want a hi-res screen while my perfect eyes stay perfect :P

Please let me know what you guys think!

vm471,12,2012-06-26,"I hate to be that guy, but I need some advice.",tsr7851,gaybros,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaybros/comments/vm471/i_hate_to_be_that_guy_but_i_need_some_advice/,"So, after seeing all of the posts of people getting pissed off over the change in attitudes here in /r/gaybros I was admittedly hesitant on posting this, but I have a quick question on how to deal with a relationship problem.

There was this guy that I liked for a short while that I decided to friend on facebook even though I didn't really know him. I had no clue whether he was gay or not, but I just decided to buck up and start messaging him. Pretty soon, we were talking regularly and found that we had similar interests in quite a few things so I eventually went out on a limb and asked him if he wanted to go see a movie sometime. We went on a few dates and everything was pretty great; I hadn't imagined that I would ever actually find a bf in high school (I'm 17) let alone a hot Filipino one. 

After a few dates, however, he became more attached while I started to lose interest. We have a lot in common; he is a gaymer, he has a good sense of humor, and he is smart. However, we share quite a few differences as well- he is more of a girl's guy, while i am more on the ""bro"" side of the spectrum; he is not at all athletic, while I am; he isn't a huge music person, while I am; he is also big on partying and doing drugs a lot, while I am not too keen on the idea of doing anything that is particularly unhealthy to myself. To add to this, he can't drive himself anywhere, so I have to drive 20+ minutes to pick him up from his house and do whatever. This just makes me feel like it is a chore to be with him sometimes. I know this sounds selfish, but I can't help feeling this way. Most of the time, when I suggest that we go spend time together by going out and experiencing the outside world, he just wants to go to his house and make out, which is fine in moderation, however, I find it to be kind of a turn off when it  happens every chance we see each other.

My initial crush on this guy just sort of fizzled off and I just can't feel a strong mutual connection. Being a noob in the dating field, I'm not sure if this is a common feeling or not. To add to this situation, I have yet to come out to my family and some of my friends, which makes the process of spending time with him and finding an alibi constantly very stressful. Maybe I'm just not ready for a relationship right now since I have some other issues to deal with in addition to my busy schedule and internship at the moment.

I feel the need to break it off, but I am not sure of the best way to do this. He is a really nice guy and I really want to minimize the hurt dealt on him if possible. What should I do in this situation? Should I reconsider my feelings, or should I go with my gut? I know this all sounds very naive, but this is what I need to know and I am admittedly a novice on these stomping grounds. I would rather ask a childish question than make a childish mistake.

Tl/dr-Met a great guy, didn't make a mutual connection, he is very into me but I feel the need to break up, what do?

P.S. I would like to thank everyone here at Gbros for giving me the strength to even attempt going for a relationship right now. I am almost positive that I wouldn't have even considered having the confidence to do this had I not stumbled upon this great place. You guys are the bomb!

vlx37,11,2012-06-25,[FR] Two different worlds: Chem Girl and Earth Girl,ThrowawayPUA,seduction,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/vlx37/fr_two_different_worlds_chem_girl_and_earth_girl/,"I'm working on a contract job, high security, nondisclosure agreements, secure facility in a bunker on a big open corporate campus. All I can say about it is is there are two sides of this gig, the math side (the side I'm on) and the chemistry side. I wish I was on the chem side, it's just like all the STEM jobs (science, technology, engineering, math) the women are all on the chem, med, and bio side and the guys are all on the geeky math/quant side. There is one girl I have my eye on, she's a manager, she's hot and she knows it (note: yoga pants are not proper corporate attire, but I approve). I'll call her Chem Girl. She's a manager so she looks down on all the contractors like me. She is a tech woman who is rising to the top and she is hard as nails.

I was thinking Chem Girl was a woman I should run some game on, especially since she's in another department and it wouldn't affect my job. Then I overheard her Friday afternoon, whining on her cell phone to her girlfriends about how they wanted to go out and she wanted to work. It was most unattractive. I figured this is a woman with none of the personality traits I'm interested. Sure she's hot, she might even be smart. But her heart is as cold as ice. Still, when I talk near her, she turns around and I immediately have her attention. I don't know what's going on there.

So today I was walking out to a break, behind Chem Girl and the other best dressed woman in the facility (note: fuck-me pumps are not proper corporate attire, but I approve). I'm about 6 feet behind them, trying not to pursue, or be seen pursuing. I'm actually having to slow my pace to not overrun them, because they're chatting and walking so slow. So as I get out near the park area, under the trees where I usually hang out, there are downed branches everywhere. It was a windy day, but it couldn't be bad enough to knock down all those trees. Oh poor trees. I blurted out, ""oh man what is all *this?*"" just sort of talking to myself. Chem girl turns back, she's kind of edging around all the branches blocking the sidewalk, and she looks at me. ""Yeah, what the..? Oh, they're pruning, must be a gardener around here somewhere. Oh there she is."" Chem Girl and High Heels Girl stroll off to their car, and I see the blonde gardener sitting at the base of a tree, pruning some plants. She waves and gets up to come over and chat. She's kind of hot in a rugged sort of way. She's younger than me but still close to my age, she has long blonde hair, she's wearing khaki shorts and hiking boots, a flannel shirt, and leather gloves. I'll call her Earth Girl. 

When I'm on breaks, it is hard to decompress. I have 10 minutes, I spend the first minute calculating how much time I have to smoke, check email on my iPhone, grab one more cup of coffee, and get back in the cockpit for more math. My mind is a highly caffeinated whirl of polynomial factoring, linear equations, oh hell I need to stop thinking about it but I can't. But hey, here's a cheerful girl, even the type I like, I talk to everyone and she's a hell of a lot friendlier than the chems and quants.

So we strike up a conversation. ""I hate to cut down all the branches but they're all dead, they have to go."" I said, ""oh yeah, I know, when I was a kid, I worked landscaping. Nobody likes to think about cutting down all their nice plants, but they grow better when you cut them back."" She's instantly interested, we get to talking about plants and landscaping. I don't notice it at the time, but she's throwing me some classic IOIs, she's cocking her hip, flipping her hair and ""grooming"" (which is amusing me because she's smeared with dirt, which is kind of sexy). She's even playing coy, holding up her handsaw and hiding her face behind it when I tease her. She is pretty forward in questioning me, she asks me if I worked here long, no I'm just a contractor. She says she wishes she could get on full time, she's just an intern. I wish I was full time too, I could use the work. etc. etc. It is such a pleasant day, cool and breezy, unlike yesterday when it was 99 degrees, we are having fun procrastinating from our jobs, and lost track of time.

In retrospect, she was really interested, and I was probably one of the few people that might impress her or even have anything in common with her, on her rare contact with those mysterious people doing secretive things inside faceless corporate offices, while she wandered through the grounds, maintaining the immaculate campus, all alone.

And I wish I had noticed all that. What I did notice is that just as things were getting interesting, Chem Girl walks past me on her way back into the facility. Oh hell, break time is over, it will be bad if I get back from break later than the managers. I'm thinking dammit I didn't have time to check my email, and already my head is switching back to Euler's Formula, power series, and combinatorics. I check the time on my phone, and make an excuse, ""oh no I have to get back to work. It was nice talking to you."" And I completely eject, while Earth Girl wistfully waves and says goodbye.

An hour or so later, as I'm grabbing my 5th cup of coffee for the day and have a moment to myself to think, looking out the window of the break room, and wondering if Earth Girl was out there, that it hit me: I'm a goddam idiot. What I *should* have done was say, ""Hey we should continue talking sometime. Give me your number and we'll talk later."" I even had my phone in my hand, and turned on, poking buttons on it. I had a perfect time constraint to give her a sense of urgency in giving me her number. I knew to do all of this, and *I did not do it.* Suddenly, I could sense Earth Girl's obvious disappointment in my ejection. Yes, she wanted me to ask her for her number. And it never even entered my mind, I was preoccupied with work. I will probably never see her again. I might as well be on another planet.

tl,dr; attracted a hot girl and totally failed to realize it, or do anything about it. Well at least I'm creating attraction without really trying, I'll count it as a win.

[What does a vagina look like?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vkk92/i_have_a_phd_in_ee_and_an_mba_from_harvard_i/c55afe7?context=5)|Actually relative to the course of humanity, no question is more relevant for a man to know definitively.
 |But knowing what it looks like is less important than knowing how to get there. And if long-term enjoyment is your objective, you also need to figure out how to stay.
[Also, what do you think of Dell's announcement that they're going to move away from consumer computers?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vkk92/i_have_a_phd_in_ee_and_an_mba_from_harvard_i/c55ams1?context=5)|Every few years, Dell says they want to move away from low-margin consumer PC where they can't make much money.
[Isn't HP pretty much in the same boat?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vkk92/i_have_a_phd_in_ee_and_an_mba_from_harvard_i/c55erbf?context=5)|Yes, but they're #1 and do a lot of other things.
[But what's the long term value in remaining in that market? It seems applications and content are where it's at. A company that can support that growing sector with enterprise hardware and services has an advantage over a company that puts too much into consumer hardware, especially as Apple slowly takes that space away. Wouldn't Dell want to make that move?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vkk92/i_have_a_phd_in_ee_and_an_mba_from_harvard_i/c55fzxy?context=5)|I think so, but have to do it via M&amp;A since Dell has almost zero R&amp;D in house.
[Their enterprise services are basically being eaten away by Oracle and they are widely viewed as less competent than IBM.  They are #1 in the printer market but isn't that a shrinking market due to tablets etc? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vkk92/i_have_a_phd_in_ee_and_an_mba_from_harvard_i/c55hebt?context=5)|Services - they have some work to do, but the infrastructure is all there. Need to rebuild their bench of talent and wrap up all the bad contracts signed under Hurd.  Networking is a decent business and they are maintaining their position there.
 |Printer is in secular decline, but a very strong cash generation business in the mean time.
[Do you have any insight of the workflow how such incompetent pricks end up in the high level management of tech companies?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vkk92/i_have_a_phd_in_ee_and_an_mba_from_harvard_i/c55bw7f?context=5)|Quite often, the guy in the CEO's chair was (a) extremely lucky at some point in his career, and (b) stuck around long enough to get full credit for it. My opinion of most corporate executives is pretty jaded after having met so many of them. But doing their job is no picnic and the average tech enthusiast I meet understands less than 10% of what the CEO needs to know or do to run the company. There's actually an extreme shortage of qualified people to run big tech businesses.
[Realistically, what do you think about the so called ""talent shortage""?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vkk92/i_have_a_phd_in_ee_and_an_mba_from_harvard_i/c55bw7f?context=5)|There is a shortage of talent in markets that are new and growing fast, and an excess supply of talent for industries that are old and not growing.
[Do you base your analysis purely on public information?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vkk92/i_have_a_phd_in_ee_and_an_mba_from_harvard_i/c55bw7f?context=5)|Yes, but the amount of information I can put together on company A working full time and utilizing every available public resource is many times greater than what the average armchair quarterback can do at home working a few hours a week. Investing is an incredibly cumulative job, so the longer you do it the more you can see patterns in the data. I spend a lot of my time doing detailed models for every company I invest in, which I think can be a huge competitive advantage. Not just for knowing how a particular trend will impact the business, but also when something is announced or a company upstream/downstream from them says something, I know what it means and how to react. 
[What doing your analysis do you have  bullshit meter for each company your analyze? Which one is the worst offender?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vkk92/i_have_a_phd_in_ee_and_an_mba_from_harvard_i/c55bw7f?context=5)|Ha great question. I have had to develop an acute bullshit meter over the years. The worst offender is no longer a publicly traded stock.
[Could you be specific as to the markets that are new and growing fast?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vkk92/i_have_a_phd_in_ee_and_an_mba_from_harvard_i/c55glkk?context=5)|Smartphones, wifi, solid-state storage, to name a few.
[Ok, this is sweet. So it sounds like I'm on a good track; I'm starting research today in fact with one of my prof's, and have an internship quasi-lined up for next summer at Apple.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vkk92/i_have_a_phd_in_ee_and_an_mba_from_harvard_i/c55apcx?context=5)|Minor = doesn't matter. If you need some electives, take accounting and corporate finance. Helps when you transition to the business side of things if you can speak the language.
[Have you noticed a difference between colleagues/friends of yours that chose to go to grad school vs going into industry? Would a minor in anything in particular be useful in retrospect? Also, best and worst part of getting your EE undergrad? What made you go to grad school for your MBA and not EE/Physics/Comp. Sci?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vkk92/i_have_a_phd_in_ee_and_an_mba_from_harvard_i/c55apcx?context=5)|If you are really brave, take OB.
[What is ""OB""?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vkk92/i_have_a_phd_in_ee_and_an_mba_from_harvard_i/c55eln0?context=5)|Organization Behavior.

[How long do you think it will be before RIM is bought out or goes bust? What do you think of the rumour that they will be purchased by Facebook?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vkk92/i_have_a_phd_in_ee_and_an_mba_from_harvard_i/c55ag78?context=5)|RIM is attractive for its net cash position, IP portfolio, and long tail of BBS subscriber revenue.

[At what point does Steve Balmer get forced to leave Microsoft?  And why has he been able to stay at the head of that company for so long with so few successes? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vkk92/i_have_a_phd_in_ee_and_an_mba_from_harvard_i/c55ay05?context=5)|Ballmer should leave today, imo. He is running a terrible farce. Windows8 is awful. And as much as they like to point to the scoreboard (earnings), Microsoft has been awful at seeing and capturing technology changes.
[*Windows8 is awful.*](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vkk92/i_have_a_phd_in_ee_and_an_mba_from_harvard_i/c55fsmm?context=5)|Fair points.
[Why do you think he is so awful?  I mean not his specific failings, but why he actually has those failings?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vkk92/i_have_a_phd_in_ee_and_an_mba_from_harvard_i/c55mr6l?context=5)|Monopoly power and ridiculous amounts of money flowing in. Perfect combination to give everyone there (especially at the top) all the evidence they need to confirm they are awesome. Even when they suck.

[Do you think it'll be a platform that will spur more innovation in the future?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vkk92/i_have_a_phd_in_ee_and_an_mba_from_harvard_i/c55c628?context=5)|Tech-wise.
[Do you think APPL has now reached the level where MSFT is at in terms of growth and being cash rich?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vkk92/i_have_a_phd_in_ee_and_an_mba_from_harvard_i/c55c628?context=5)|Surface: hate it. But the non-Apple PC community will invest billions developing and marketing Win8 tablets so expect to see a lot more like this and potentially someone will make a winning device. Needs to be cheaper. Hate that WindwsRT comes with office by default. That adds $25-40 to the bill of materials. Makes it impossible to compete w/ ipad on the basis of price.
[Do you believe the tech industry has reached the peak of a bubble with the whole FB valuation fiasco and most of the IPOs current prices below offering?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vkk92/i_have_a_phd_in_ee_and_an_mba_from_harvard_i/c55c628?context=5)|Apple: still a lot of growth potential as they continue to enter new geographic markets. But agree, not a lot of innovation on the near-term horizon.
[What range do you think FB should've been priced at?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vkk92/i_have_a_phd_in_ee_and_an_mba_from_harvard_i/c55c628?context=5)|The FB IPO was an embarassment, one of the worst processes I've seen, and I have invested in or evaluated hundreds of IPOs. Good companies are reluctant to IPO now due to the FB hangover.
[What are your thoughts on the all startups in Sillcon Valley that are spurring up?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vkk92/i_have_a_phd_in_ee_and_an_mba_from_harvard_i/c55c628?context=5)|I have no opinion honestly about what people do with companies they start. If cashing out is what you want, then do it. If staying at a company forever because you're passionate, do that. But ffs, don't stay as CEO of a startup if you are holding the company back from reaching the next level. It's not about you anymore once you hire employees.
[How long till they come back down and will they?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vkk92/i_have_a_phd_in_ee_and_an_mba_from_harvard_i/c55bixl?context=5)|Now, back in oversupply. I expect prices to move down to normalized levels very quickly.

 |2) you can't do e-ink with a touch panel - it response to small voltages and the capacitive touch panel messes up the view.
[What are the main barriers to US based electronics manufacturing?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vkk92/i_have_a_phd_in_ee_and_an_mba_from_harvard_i/c55cgsf?context=5)|A few things make it hard to manufacture electronics in the US  3) Taxes are 30% here vs 0 to 15% in favorable countries. IMO the tax rate on manufacturing in the USA should be 0% since we're currently getting 30% of nothing anyway.
[Thoughts on Amazon's hardware business?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vkk92/i_have_a_phd_in_ee_and_an_mba_from_harvard_i/c55bz3a?context=5)|Amazon doesn't have a hardware business for long if all it does is sell crap at a cheap price to hopefully lock you into Prime. If they can make a decent tablet, then it makes a lot of sense to sell that at $0 profit in order to drive more of the core retail business. I'm skeptical because Amazon lacks the R&amp;D capability to move at the industry pace with compelling products. Better to stick with what they're good at.

[What country is best poised to take over America as the leading tech innovator?  America seems to be falling behind in education and IMHO it's a matter of time till it falls behind.  Any private dot coms that you think are poised to do big things?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vkk92/i_have_a_phd_in_ee_and_an_mba_from_harvard_i/c55bvce?context=5)|I don't think America will lose its spot as the leading tech innovator. Our system of free enterprise and high rewards for the biggest risk takers is unlike any other country on earth. Everyone thinks it's China, but I disagree. Too little respect for IP protection, and frankly too much corruption in the relationship between state and private enterprise. I don't think it's Japan or Europe or any other mature market.  I do agree America is falling behind where it should be in terms of education, but innovation is more about how the system encourages people to take risk by offering a huge potential reward to winners and respecting the rule of law especially around protecting IP.
[How do you see the cable business in the future?  Both the big networks (Comcast, etc..\) and the hardware suppliers like Motorola, Cisco and Broadcom?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vkk92/i_have_a_phd_in_ee_and_an_mba_from_harvard_i/c55d05b?context=5)|IPTV and over the top TV/video will slowly eat away at cable subscriptions, but that doesn't mean the cable co's are dead. Just means they will likely need to change their business model to cafeteria style as opposed to shoving over 9000 channels at you for one high monthly price.

Anders Hejlsberg is probably the greatest language designer of all time and has done amazing work on C# and .NET.  Yet in this latest version of Windows with WinRT as the foundation does not advance .NET at all.

 |Samsung is #2 in Brazil (3rd biggest PC market in the world now) and Lenovo is #1. If the battleground for growth is emerging BRIC markets then Samsung and Lenovo are potentially the prize fighters.

Too much cyclical and commodity dynamics.
 |ARM is one of the best positioned companies in the tech space and that's why it trades for such a high P/E. I wouldn't make an investment bet based on ARM failing to succeed. The stock itself is another issue and for that I'm gonna avoid giving advice one way or another.

Their Ultrabook is good too. I worry mostly that their scale and cost structure are not good enough to sustain profitability as the PC industry consolidates around much bigger companies (HP, Lenovo, eventually Samsung).

 |Some are full of assholes and don't pay well (common)
 |Some have amazing people and pay very well (rare)
 |And combinations in between.
 |If I had to guess, entry level hedge fund analysts probably make $250k/year in salary + bonus. If you do well and have a share in the carried interest, it can easily be $1M or more. If you do poorly, you make $250k for a year or two and then have to find a new job.

 |Some funds employ generalists who look at everything, everywhere.
 |Some look at specific geographies.
 |Some look at specific sectors... mine happens to be tech hardware.
 |Still others look to invest in anything as long as it fits a certain theme, such as trading two sides of patent litigation outcomes or arbitraging the risk spread on M&amp;A (basically when you buy stock in a company that is being acquired for $XX because it feels like a high probability event and you can earn, say, 6% in 3 months for holding the shares.

 |I also think it's going to be confusing to consumers that some Win8 devices will support your old applications and others won't. Who is going to explain that to your mom when she buys a notebook but can't install her 10-year old printer driver?
 |Surface to me is MSFT's way of saying their OEM partners are taking too long and something needs to be out now to challenge ipad. It's pissed off a lot of OEMs already.

For a guy like HP selling $500 laptop vs Apple's Macbook Pro in the $1200-2000 range, it makes a big difference in profitability.
 |But yes, everyone is attempting to copy Apple, and most are not doing it successfully.

Plenty of room for the pie to grow and that's good for all these guys. My understanding is VMW has the advantage. MSFT does ok in the channel with low end product.
 |Personally I hate citrix on ipad.
 |But i'm a hardware guy and for hardware virtualization is good for now (driving a server upgrade cycle) but long term will lead to longer hardware upgrade cycles which is bad.

And Rory @ AMD doesn't seem to mind focusing away from discrete cards - his attention is focused on what a few OEM customers want. I don't see that changing any time soon.  GPU computing is slowly changing things for high-performance computing. Look at the makeup of the top 10 super computers - roughly half GPUs now.

 |But I do think Intel is a threat to both since over time I think we'll see all graphics except for gaming cards move to integrated on-die with the CPU. That's about 75% of the discrete GPU unit volume that will move away from NVDA over time. AMD is somewhat shielded because they also have integrated GPU and CPU on-die now, and are driving that to become the standard.

I'm in my early 30s. This is what it's like to be passionate about something and not have it fulfilled.
  
I've spent the last dozen years working towards a single goal: an administrative role in a specific industry that I'm incredibly passionate about.
  
My city had an annual event dedicated to it.  I volunteered every year, made my connections, expressed my interest in getting involved deeper.  I met with the producer, and told him point blank, ""I will do anything, I just want to work for your organization"". 

He offered to allow me to work for him full time, for free, and all i had to do was refinance my house so I had enough to live on.  Wow, such a sweet offer.
  
That was a lesson.  I never should have let him smell my passion.  
 
I learned from that, and I worked to prove myself.  I obsessively learned more and more about this industry.  I worked in areas where I would have transferable skills.  I took initiative and created my own projects, most of which got little attention, but at least I was working towards my goals. 
  
I also ruined my credit by travelling to the industry's biggest conference every year, so I could network and hopefully find a job, even if it meant moving across the country. 
  
Years went by.
  
I used to think it was *me*.  That I wasn't working hard enough, that I wasn't good enough, that I just had to wait my turn.  People told me it would pay off eventually.
  
I needed to do *more*.  Work *harder*.
  
I uprooted my entire life to move to this industry's hub.  Traded in my suburban house and car for a mouse-infested apartment and public transit, in a city where I barely knew a soul.  All because I'm passionate.
  
Again, it wasn't enough.  Job applications were ignored, despite fulfilling 100% of the qualifications.  Networking led to nothing but requests for free work.  People younger than me were telling me I should be an intern to ""gain experience"".
  
I have experience out the wazoo.  I've worked a solid decade to prove, on paper, that I care about this industry.  I run a website about it, I've continued volunteering, I've been working my ass off just in general.  I don't have time to date, socialize, see movies, or otherwise have a life.  
  
I have no trouble landing well-paying jobs in industries that don't interest me.  But the industry that I know the most about, and care the most about, and will happily work day and night at?  Not so much. 
  
I'm realizing that gender is a factor.  And I hate it, because before at least I *thought* had some control over the situation. 
  
It's partly because this industry is male-dominated.  But it's also that women who are passionate just come across as desperate and naive.  The reason I've been able to get ""*a* job"" so easily in the past is because I walk in with skills and only skills.  It's all they see.
  
Passion is a distraction.  I *finally* landed an interview with a Dream Job employer 6 months ago.  We were talking about that industry conference, and who knows who, and what projects are hot right now.  We talked so long, that they didn't ask me a bunch of really key questions related to the job, which would have landed it for me.  Someone else, with much less industry experience, got the job. They didn't see me as capable, but as a good conversationalist. 
  
I thought I'd reached a really great turning point recently: I've been given a few dollars to work on an short-term project for a major organization in this field, and it's sad how ecstatic I am to have been thrown the smallest of bones after so many years.  
  
I've attacked this project like my life depends on it.  And I'm killin' it.
  
But I was talking to a colleague on this project about how hard I've worked, for how long, for so few returns, and that I really should've asserted myself ages ago and not let other people take the opportunities I've earned.  He responded by sending me a series of hateful, misogynistic Facebook messages, calling me ""princess"", a failure, useless, a whiner, and that he will refuse to work with me again.  I'm fairly certain he was drunk for the ones sent at 4am, but  sober by the time he threatened that ""you're done"".
  
So I'm back at square one.  Either he's going to be fired over it (unlikely), or he's going to bully me right out of the project. 
  
I don't have anything left in me.  I feel like I've proven all I can prove.  I don't think it'll ever be enough.  I'm tired.  
  
I have an open offer for a really well-paying job in an unrelated field, for a good boss, at a stable company.  I've turned it town probably 20 times already.  
  
But the thought of leaving my passion behind always comes in tandem with thoughts of suicide.  Neither are viable options. But I can't live like this anymore, and I can't not live like this anymore.
  
I hate it when people moan about how they don't know what they're passionate about.  If that's you, you are so fucking lucky.  If I could just walk away and think that *anything* else could make me happy, I would've done it years ago.  But I'm stuck with this bullshit, probably for the rest of my life, because it's all I know how to do. 
  
Suburbs?  Husband?  Mat leave?  Saturdays at Home Depot?  If only.
  
**tl;dr - Passion only leads to pain, heartache, and mascara-stained ranty posts on 2X that drone on too long.**"
vlofb,3,2012-06-25,Is a Linguistics and CS degree any help?,Mason_son_of_Math,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/vlofb/is_a_linguistics_and_cs_degree_any_help/,"Hello, I'm a college student pursing a B.A. in Linguistics and Computer Science. The curriculum includes some introductory programming classes and a few upper division courses, but has about half as many as what the full CS degree requires. However, I will also take a variety of linguistics courses, including one on computational linguistics or natural language processing.

I'm basically wondering if this linguistics will make me a more attractive candidate, or won't help me at all because employers still want to see that I've taken a ton of CS courses. Electives will allow me to take two more upper divs, and I plan to take even more CS if possible.

I want to be a software engineer/programmer because, so far, I've found programming very enjoyable. I wouldn't go so far as to say I'm a natural but coding makes a lot of sense to me and I haven't had this much fun doing something school-related since I took calculus. I'm wondering if my degree will help me, or if I'll have to work extra hard on my own to catch up to all those programmers with fancy pants Bachelor of Science degrees.

And no, changing majors isn't an option due to a good deal of red-tape bullshit. Otherwise I'd already be a full-on CS major.

Additional wrinkle: I'm in California but would prefer to work in Massachusetts for non-career reasons. Upon a perfunctory glance of internships from major companies, a few seem to have offices in Cambridge and the surrounding area. How decent are my chances of getting work there?"

Is it wrong?",WhatDoIDo92,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/vpnq2/attracted_to_someone_else_i_have_a_gf_is_it_wrong/,"I'm 19 male and my girlfriend is also 19 female. We've been dating for almost 9 months now. We love each other very much. I'm so lucky and happy to have such an amazing girlfriend. It's a LDR though, about 1.5 hours away from each other, not too bad. Sometimes she gets upset easily at small things and gets quiet with me for a little bit and when that happens I get irritated but I always keep my cool cause there's no sense in making a big issue out of a small one. But here's my problem I'm having.

I've been interning for the last couple months for summer and I have about 2 weeks left (thank god). Everyone at work is great and we all get along well. There's this one female (21) that I find interesting. I'm only PHYSICALLY attracted to her. It's odd because she's not my type at all. Different race, tattoos, she has a kid and only 21. We have small chit-chats and she's been flirty with me lately. I admit, I have a little too. I try to minimize my contact with her whenever possible but some times I still see her, like in the break room or something. I know I'm not going to let this stupid thing ruin a wonderful relationship but I feel horrible that I have this physical attraction to some other girl. I love my girlfriend so much and I just feel guilty about this. I want to be open and tell her about this but I don't think that's a good idea considering this internship ends in 2 weeks and a few weeks ago she thought I wasn't physically attracted to her, which is not the case at all. My girlfriend has a banging body. But this has also never happened to me before. 

Is it normal to be physically attracted to someone? What to do?

Sorry if it's confusing, please ask questions if have any. This felt good to write out because I've never told anyone about this and just kept it to myself.

tldr; I have an amazing loving relationship with my gf but I am also physically attracted to another female co-worker. Is this normal?

I'm looking for advice on a career move, and was wondering if anyone here had any additional information or experience with my situation. I submit to this subreddit quite frequently, but for some strange reason I find the need for a throwaway account. Below is a background about my situation.

So, all through college I was really interested in the markets. Involved with a bunch of investment clubs, extremely passionate about technical/fundamental analysis, really thought I knew what I wanted to do when I graduated. I ended up getting an internship in IB, and moved full time after I graduated. During that time, my technical skills probably doubled. The broker I was paired with was extremely helpful and resourceful, taught me a lot. A lot of my friends went to prop shops after college, but I was too scared. 20k starting salary while living in New York, while the rest of your salary is in commission scared the hell out of me.

3 months after working full time, I get laid off. This was around 2008-2009. I was pretty upset, but wasn't devastated. I was fresh out of college, pretty young, plus unemployment was sweet. I started looking for other jobs in the finance field, but was told to try different things. A lot of suggestions were to try a smaller company to get the experience. Try a different field, you're young you never know what you might like. Job offers come flying in (surprisingly) and I decided to try something different. I accepted a job at a Financial Analyst position at a Pharma firm. It was awful. Experience was really good, but I missed the markets terribly. I start trading while I work. It started off slow, but then i became pretty active. I decided a couple weeks ago I wanted to get back into the financial markets field and started applying.

So far, I've been on 2 interviews, and have a couple coming up. The ones I am particularly interested in are from prop shops I applied to. I had offers from a bunch of scam prop shops, basically 100% commission positions where you have to pay for their training course. There are a few where I can't find reviews on, Infinium, WTS, and Spot Trading. Does anyone here have any insight on those 3 companies? Can anyone offer any advice on trading desks in general? I'm still actively applying, but I really don't want to waste my time if I know the position isn't right for me.

Thanks in advance.

The last I saw of Stella was that same summer we met after graduation. Boy did we have some adventures... Endless fuckings, anals and exhibition sex. I fingerfucked her on a public bus. She blew me while at the movies. We sent naked pictures and made dares all summer. I got her to wear a vibrator in her pussy while talking to her boss. and she made me go to the midnight munch store naked. No hands. Autumn came before we even knew it and I had to go back to college and she moved out of town. That was the end of it. Or so I thought.

During my masters, I was scheduled to do my first intern job at a real laboratory. It was great fun even though the long hours, the endless cups of coffee and the boss who thought I was his personal slave. But I learned a lot and I loved every second of it. My thoughts of Stella had been replaced with telescopes, books and ramen noodles. I still remembered her beautiful hair. She colored it maroon before we left. I still remember her perfectly suckable nipples that just pointed at you once you saw them. As if they commanded you to suck and nibble at them. Her pussy and asshole that had been fucked so much by my dick it was almost engraved with ""I was here"" now. Sometimes I thought of her when I needed to rub out that easy one. I wasn't in love with her but I loved her company.

I used to spend my nights at a late café because I couldn't finish my reports at my dorm. Too loud and messy. Three cups of coffee into it and I looked out of the window, and I thought I could see Stellas red hair in the distant. ""Naah, I must be getting too tired..."" I thought and began packing my bags to head home.

I couldn't understand whether I saw her or not that night. But just the slightest reminder of our times always got me so horny. When I got home I saw a mail from Dave, an old friend, apparently he was getting married this saturday (today was thursday) in Vegas. At some fancy-for-being-vegas church. I thought ""why the hell not?! I get ramen and drinks for free!""

In Vegas, the city full of fucking, booze, gambling and more fucking, I decided that I wouldn't head home before I'd do atleast the drinking and fucking part. It is, after all, Vegas. At the reception my whole gang was here. Everyone from my old home town dressed as suave as possible as hell. Before we entered the hall I got that same feeling again, that I've seen Stella somewhere. And by instinct I got into the male bathroom, got my visitors card up of the place, placed it beside my hard cock and snapped a photo out of it. Texting it to Stella ""?"". As I exited the bathroom I just understood what I'd done... ""Fuck it.. She's seen it before."" I thought. Suddenly, my phone buzzed and I checked who it was from. ""Stella has sent you a picture."" it said. Opening it and I saw her pussy, looking just like before I left and a card just like mine next to it. ""FUCK YES!"" I thought just as I closed my phone and began looking for her. I couldn't until I saw that she had already sat down in the main room. I sat down next to her and her face lit up like a christmas tree. 

""hi stella."" I said. 
""Hey. It's about to start but come meet me after the wedding. I got something that belongs to you. But here, have these now."" and she suddenly took off her panties she had under her dress. Soaked all the way. I didn't know what I'd say or do. So I said ""oh you shoe is untied"" and went down into her dress for a quick moment. And she was, just like before, all shaved and wet as a river. It took and placed my one finger on her clit while pretending to tie her shoe with the other hand. She was wet and ready. 

The couple had wed and everyone was getting drunk at the party. I met up with stella quickly and said ""Hey.. Come with me now and we'll get away from all these party-goers."" She just nodded and bit her lip that sexy way. We went out only to find a limo parked. ""That's probably theirs."" and very drunkedly I suggested ""Lets take it."" and we did. We climbed in and the driver thought we were the couple. We began laughing our asses off until we realized that we might as well give the chauffeur something for the trouble.

Like a ninja I got my dick out and Stella didn't hesitate for a second to start sucking it off. I popped her breasts out of her dress and began touching her nipples. She began moaning ""no one does like you do.. I love the way you do it"" and I just moaned ""likewise..."". Stella removed the bottom half of her dress, exposing her perfect pussy and asshole for me and sticked her upper body out of the ceiling window. She had covered her breasts but I was below licking her tasty pussy and rubbing the outsides of her asshole gently with my fingers. She was moving her pussy to match the motion of the car and its turns. She tried to maintain herself but she began moaning and suddenly the chauffeur said ""we're here"" without even caring about what we were doing. We had no idea what he meant but when we got out he had driven us to this real swanky hotel. We said ""fuck that"" and went to the next door club. 

Inside we sat down at a small booth and continued. I fingered her pussy through her dress and she was rubbing my dick. All of a sudden more booths started fucking and we hadn't noticed it but we were inside one of those shifty swingers club. People began running around naked, breasts everywhere and dicks swinging side to side. ""There gotta be some kinky shit in this place somewhere."" and before we knew it we found it. Just down the hall there were a big number of doors and we entered one of them thinking that it was shooting pornos but as we entered and locked it behind us. We put in a dollar into some kind of machine and suddenly the walls moved and a chair was on the other side. Both of us were drunk as hell and said ""whoever gets in there will be lucky. LETS FUCK!"" and we both got completely naked. And I sat down on the chair while Stella gave me a lapdance and grinded my dick with her pussy. She was so wet and we both loved the idea that someone might sit down at watch us doing it. So I couldn't take it anymore I just sticked my dick into her wet pussy and let her ride me like a machine bull. She was riding me better than ever and I got my hand around her curvy body and stuck a finger inside her ass. While fingering her clit and sucking her nipples. She moaned harder and harder. She said she was going to cum but I didn't let that bother me. Instead I just kept on fucking her and she understood what I was doing. So as she came, I felt her twitching her body. Shaking it uncontrollably and her pussy was so creamy it was almost a creamy squirting coming out of it. Her pussy got so tight from her orgasm that I could bare fit my big cock inside. Instead I took it out and stuck inside her ass instead. She didn't seem to mind and she was riding my still as she was getting it anally. ""I've never had anal while riding before."" she moaned as I kept going and I just saw how it opened a completely new world for her. She was moaning and  could keep on fucking me eventhough she just came. But I couldn't resist to start playing around with her pussy with my fingers. She began moaning harder and higher now. I looked past her and a couple was inside the other side and was fucking too like animals. IT was so hot that I felt that I was going to cum and I tried to moan it but she just lifted herself up to start sucking it. But she wasn't quick enough so my cum shot right at the window instead. She didn't seem to mind and started collecting it with her fingers anyway. And I sat myself on my knees and started licking her pussy and asshole while she collected my cum. It was so hot I got hard again almost instantly and said to her ""brace yourself"" and stuck my refreshed cock into her asshole. Fingering her pussy with my other hand around her waist. She was moaning ""oh..my god..."" and I just smiled and fucked her more and more. She couldn't help herself and squirted all over the floor. It wasn't a small squirt either but a massive flood bigger than pee. Just flooding out of her pussy and I fingered her as she did, making it splash all over the floor and all over my hands. 

I sat down on the chair in the booth and she followed with my cock still inside her asshole. Fucking her like an animal. And I came once again, not as big this time but I felt it throughout my whole body. The sensation all the way to my roots of my hair from my toes.

I removed my cock from her asshole and she sat on my lap for a moment. We both sweating and smelling like sex and booze. ""maybe we should meet more often. It's always an adventure with you Stella.."" and she just kissed me for a long moment. Making out even. It was hard to say but this was probably the most romantic and loving moment of our lives. Both fucked until we couldn't walk and people were jacking off to us. We didn't care. We both loved every second of this.

""maybe you should follow me home..."" I said and she just nodded.. ""I got some days off."" She replied and hugged me hard. 

We left the place one hour afterwards. Stella had booked a hotel room where we took a bath together and spent the night with candles lit. The next day we both drove back to my place and recollected ourselves.

And I want that.  I want a man to approach me at a party and want to fuck.  Not that I would….  Maybe I would….  But I want the invitation.  

I love my friends with benefits guy as a good friend, but I can’t help but think that he doesn’t want to be seen with me in public.  That explains why he never invites me to the bars or to hang out with his friends.  He was talking about fucking me at a bar and how dirty that would be.  I want that.  But I don’t want to chicken out or be embarrassed by my weight.  At this weight I obviously would back out.  But I don’t want to.  I don’t want to back out of my life.  Of my possible experiences.

FUCK!  I haven’t even been out to the FUCKING BARS YET BECAUSE I AM SO FUCKING SCARED THAT THEY WILL REJECT ME AT THE DOOR.  21 for almost a month in a college town.  I’m an embarrassment to the 21 agers.  My bar crawl is coming up, and I just get nervous thinking about going.  What if the bouncer says no and won’t let me in because I’m fat?  I would just want to end my life right then and there.

Not that I need a man to affirm who I am, because trust me, I don't, but...  I want men to hit on me at bars.  I want men to buy me drinks at bars.  I want a long term boyfriend.  I want a guy to ask for my number. I want to shop at normal stores.  And not pay $100 for a simple dress.

God I just need to lose weight now.  What can I do to shred the weight?   I want to wear sexy dresses and high heels.  I want to flip my hair and know that any guy at a bar would die to be with me.  Seriously, I have a beautiful face, big brown eyes, long sexy hair, a killer smile, and a coke bottle figure.  All hiding under what I have built up for myself in order to protect me.

Sometimes I wonder if I have been sexually abused when I was younger, repressed the memories, and used food as comfort.  But I think pretty deeply and don’t remember anything.  But then again, why am I so obsessed with criminal justice and bringing justice to the bad guys?...

I don’t know the last time a man looked at me with wanting or loving eyes.  This weight is just tearing my life apart.  I just want to be at a smaller size, not skinny.  I’d like to be thick with curves.  As a current size 20, I want to be to a size 14.  THAT’S IT!  It’s not even that far away of a goal.  But I really need to do this for myself.  I just need to get off my fat, lazy ass and do this.

I’m also scared about my internship.  What is an obese girl doing in a police station where everyone else will be fit?  Everyone else will be fit and in shape and I won’t be.  I will be laughed at.  I won’t be invited out with them.  They won’t smile or take me seriously.  I’m really scared about this.

I’m just afraid of what may happen though if I do lose it.  Will people still like me?  Will my friends change how they act around me?  Probably yes.  But ya know what?  I shouldn’t fucking care!  I’m tired of being the funny, fat friend who people keep around to make themselves look better/skinnier/prettier.

Literally just received this message on Plenty of Fish after I turned this guy down nicely.  “Haha fuck u you fat ass bitch.  Ur such a cunt.  Go eat some fuckin ho ho’s and stfu!  Fattie!”   Then when I said, “See, I told you we probably get along.”  The reply of, “Good I’m glad.  If u loved me I’d prolly get eaten.  Goodbye chunky!”  was received.

He’s right.  I didn’t deserve to be called these names but the truth is, a complete stranger just called me some horrible names, and I’m not even mad.  I’m not even mad because I know it’s the truth.  And realizing it makes me cry.  

I often wonder what people think of me when they see me on the street.  What’s wrong with her?  She’s young, no excuse to be lazy.  She doesn’t care about herself.  They probably call me all the names that this rando on POF called me...

I think I’m coming to the point in my life where if I don’t change my body, I will forever regret it and will likely kill myself in a car accident.  Just jerk the steering wheel really fast to the right, into this big beautiful tree on a back road close to my house.   Leaving my mother devastated and guilty for not pushing me to be better.  

I always say, “Tomorrow I will workout, tomorrow I’ll not eat fast food.”  Tomorrow.  Tomorrow.  Tomorrow.

Well right now, after I’m done with this, I am going to do some sit ups.  I think I can overcome this.  I want to, need to.  

If you are reading this, and know of any way to help me, please say something.  I could really use it.

Advice to those unsure of their future?,PoochieMcPoochmuffin,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/voazj/what_was_it_about_your_profession_that_caused_you/,"I'm an undergraduate rising junior with a double major in Art and English at a small, not very well known college. I am very active at school with leadership positions in clubs, I volunteer, and I maintain a satisfactory grade point average. Out of school, I volunteer and am currently involved in two internships. I love literature, art, and communicating with people unlike myself.

I have no idea what I want to do when I leave college. For many years now, my dream was to go into writing/drawing comics and get a MFA at SCAD, but as I'm learning just how difficult it is to even get a job -- let alone a good paying one -- I'm rethinking of if an open door is worth so much debt. Not only that, but I question if I even should follow my dream. So often, I can't even pick up a pencil because all I think is, ""Make something great. If you don't, you're a failure. You'll never make it to SCAD,"" causing me to be constantly blocked by my own insecurities. If I can't do what I want as a career now, how can I expect to do it later?

Worse yet is I'm not only greatly interested in comics, but also the world of journalism and art galleries/museums. I currently work for the newspaper at my school, and I love it. Meanwhile, I volunteer at an art gallery and currently have an internship at another art gallery, and I love that field as well. While I'm actually doing things I love in other disciplines, the one I'm working towards has yet to even become a hobby due to so much fear.

All I ever wonder is what if I make the wrong decision and stick to one path and end up finding out that I'm either not good at it or that it doesn't make me happy? Is an open door worth regret later on? Worth finding out I'm either not good at something or that something doesn't make me happy?

I could just try to bury my fears and give it a shot, but sometimes going for one's dream isn't the right path. Sometimes just doing something isn't enough when it's hasty and immature. Sometimes YOLO is the worst thing to do. And that sometimes is what's causing me to be stuck even while I do my best to go forwards. 

Jumping into one job field and trying to make the transition into a completely different one is not easy in this job market. I could always try to make myself feel better by saying, ""I have time,"" but all I can think instead is, ""What am I working towards?""

My problem is that I'm an outsider when it comes to my dream. I research it, but unlike journalism and the gallery world, I have yet to actually experience the ins and outs of it, the actual industry and what it's like being a part of it. Unfortunately, no comic publishers are near me, and all of the internships provided do not work at all with my school academic calendar, either beginning a month or two too early or a month or two too late. I would really have to jump into the industry blindfolded, and the only way to even jump is with SCAD and the education it provides as well as the great networking.

Okay. Let's say I give up on comics and SCAD. My dream gone, impractical and stupid. Then what? Journalism or the art world? I'm still split on what I should do or be. I keep wondering what will make me happy? What will make me fulfilled? I keep worrying about the thought of 10 years from now waking up and realizing I should have followed one track and not another.

&lt;b&gt;TLDR: College undergrad fearful of future. Fearful of making the wrong choice in career path. Fearful of not being happy and always wondering, ""What if?"" Fearful of growing old filled with regret with a job I'm not good at or grow to hate.

I want to know why you're happy or not happy with your job, what it is about your job that caused you to know it was or was not right for you, if you always wanted to have the job you have now, and any tips for those who are afraid of their future career path.&lt;/b&gt;"
voahl,3,2012-06-27,Keyboard for work,[deleted],keyboards,https://www.reddit.com/r/keyboards/comments/voahl/keyboard_for_work/,"Spending my summer in the office coding as part of my summer internship, and I can't quite decide what to two with my keyboard situation!

I would be very surprised if I could acquire a mechanical keyboard through my company, since I'm only here for twelve weeks, although I guess it never hurts to try. However, assuming I can't, I only have my Das and my Poker, both with blues. Has anyone had problems with using a keyboard with blues (versus, lets say browns) in an office environment? I tend to bottom out a lot, although I can get O-Rings to help that (after all, I did just do that group buy...). We don't have cubicles, but the offices are fairly close together and there is generally an open door policy it seems.

I'm tempted to buy a tenkeyless MX brown filco on Amazon to add to my collection and for the middlepoint between my Das and my Poker. As the development environment is non-unix based, I have a feeling I wont be quite as comfortable on my Poker as I typically am, so that would leave me with bringing my Das in to work if I don't get the Filco.

Similarly, wristrests. I only have one... and it is a fullsize ducky wrist rest (which I love, especially considering the price, but I would look ridiculous using a full size wrist rest on a TKL, and the nearest thing I can find is $70!)

I know it is kind of a special situation as I am an intern, but anyone have any advice? Both regarding getting supplied keyboard, and keyboard/wristpad advice.

/endramble

Alternatively, how to Leopolds compare to Filco's, besides not looking as nice with the rounded, rather than clean edges?"

Now, I have been to a handful of undergrad defenses, a masters defense, and a research symposium, and I seen people get grilled on their work...but this...this was crazy.  
  
A room full of seasoned physicists and engineers trying to find every possible reason to tear up one of their co-workers results. Every single possible question was asked. No result each of each of the slides went unnoticed.  
I didn't know what was going on during this bloodbath of ""prove to me you are right or else you are full of shit"", but it occurred to me. This is the foundation of being a skeptic. Question everything that is presented to you and down it until you get enough convincing data to prove you otherwise.  
  
However, there was something else I realized, which is common sense when I thought about it, but I see this as a problem a lot when it comes to anything, be it science related, or some other field. 

You can only really have the authority to down play and truly be skeptical of something unless you yourself knows what is going on. I couldn't just raise my hand and say ""None of your data makes sense to me"" for the simple fact that I didn't know nearly enough math, physics, theory for me to make an educated judgement/question/concern.  
I see this happening all over the place when people down play scientific findings. The people that never read a single credible article on the subject they claim is wrong always seems to be more vocal than the ones who tore up the research that was done to make that scientific finding.
  
I think if there's anything I pull out of this internship, I think that one afternoon watching people that are currently spending 10-20 years of their life to develop, build, and analyze data to answer a question, changed my whole way of thinking whenever I read or hear anything someone says.  
  
If you ever get the opportunity to listen to seasoned scientists argue, take it. It's pretty hilarious for one thing, but it really makes you appreciate all of the scientific theories that are employed each day. Each one of them went through a rigorous process to get where it's at now.

vnz8k,3,2012-06-26,[FR] She just kept talking in one long incredibly unbroken sentence moving from topic to topic so that no one has a chance to interrupt it is quite hypnotic.    AKA She is really Dr. Vassbinder,Oldguard,seduction,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/vnz8k/fr_she_just_kept_talking_in_one_long_incredibly/,"background:  http://www.reddit.com/r/askseddit/comments/vltes/have_date_with_hb9_professor_now_have_predate/

Background music: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6oUz1v17Uo

Picked her up, I was about 5 minutes early (mistake 1?) and my former intern needed to get off the phone.  She walks out the door and walks right by and starts talking.   I open my mouth to speak, and she continues to explain that where we are going we will need to drive and where my car is.  I point out my car and pull it out so she could get in.    I glance over to her and smile as my RECARO seats swallowed her up.  That's when I first notice it.  **Her shoulders were raised up to her ear lobes.** You don't sit in a RECARO seat like that, you let them swallow you up.  **Is this a sign of her being nervous?**

She asked me to pull up at the CVS and she runs in to get some meds.  She comes back out and tells me this is the best parking space there is and that we should walk to the dinner.  The dinner was packed so we went to the Pub.  While walking I noticed that her **shoulders were raised and her head was lowered like she was, I don't know, nervous.  She was holding her purse over her shoulder on whatever side I walked on.**  I was stretched to my full height, shoulders relaxed and back exposing my chest.  I was also walking slowly, making her wait for me.  

And that's when **she starts talking in one long incredibly unbroken sentence moving from topic to topic so that no one has a chance to interrupt it is quite hypnotic.**  

Her topics she moved to (for those that want to know) bitching about work, complaining about the education system, how much money she makes, the economy, Obama, reverse racism, her lawsuit, Bush Jr, Bush Sr, GM, etc, etc.  **Seriously, how do you tell a woman to shut the fuck up without sounding like an asshole?**  I couldn't help it, I felt my eyebrows go up (Mistake 2?) as I tried to contemplate how she could breath.

I sat in the booth across from her (Mistake 3?) and had to lean in occasionally since she would speak quietly.  (Mistake 4?)
 
At this point I noticed that her shoulders were no longer raised.  ""Maybe she was nervous?""  So, I attempted some kino.  I waited for a topic (didn't take long, LOL) that was serious, it was about her unfair treatment and lawsuit.  I reached over and put my hand on her hand.  She stopped for a moment and then I noticed it.  She was raising her shoulders.  Sometime later she looked relaxed and I attempted again, she was talking about 911, so I reached over and placed my hand and got the same reaction.  **Is this some kind of shit test?**  

I go to the Mens room, I checked my MSG, since I was receiving a ton of texts from friends.  As I walked to the booth, I wondered if she was even there or did she run off.  I was getting bored. She goes to the Lady's room and I stealth pay (mistake 5?) the bill.

She comes back with fresh make up on.  And ask me if we could leave,  I say ""sure let's go somewhere else.""  She tells me she has a ton of work to do.  And then she continues talking...  At this point I was bored out of my mind and I say, ""Let's go.""  And we leave.

She still has her shoulders up, and holding her purse over her shoulder on whatever side I walked on.  I did a sudden stop and looked at an used bookstore.  And I stated how I love used bookstores.  She asked if I wanted to go in.  I was already inside when I said ""Yes!""  

She kept talking but she was asking me questions about my Family, where I was from.  I was answering as I was checking out some books.  We continue to walk towards the car, and she continues asking about my family.  That's when I notice it.  **Her fucking shoulder were not raised.**

We get into my car, she was telling the best way to do a U turn.  I ignored her.  I half throttle out, allowing my R-Comps to bite into the road, rotate the rear, and hear the TurboFart^TM as I shift through the gears.  She yelps but I noticed she was relaxed in the seat.

She keeps talking, as I pull up to her place.  **Short date, except she is not getting out, and her shoulders were raised up, again.**  She keeps talking about work.  I looked over her as she talked, I thought to myself, I would love to be with her, but not if she is going to be like this.  She tells me how busy she is going to be this weekend.  I mention how I was going on a 4 day trip on Thursday.

She asked for me to call her on Monday to set up another date.  I personally have a feeling she is going to Flake, but what rule was that?  Always assume attraction?  If I do call, it will be late, and it will be as an afterthought.  **I notice that as she walks away her shoulders where back up.**

Could one of the mPUA tell me what the deal was with the body language?  (see Bold) and confirm/deny my mistakes?  What did I do wrong/right?  And how can I improve.  


TL;DR She won't shut up.  Weird body language, then ask me to call her?  I have no clue what I'm doing.

Update:  She just emailed me that we wouldn't work out.  Dodged a bullet there.  I wrote back that I agreed and I hope she finds what she is looking for.

vnuv1,0,2012-06-26,"My girlfriend and I met and married in an MMO 8 Years Ago, help us finally break the distance?",kcm117,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/vnuv1/my_girlfriend_and_i_met_and_married_in_an_mmo_8/,"The Story:

Eight years ago at the age of 14 I moved to the Florida from The Bahamas.  I didn’t know a single person so I decided that I would purchase a video game to occupy my time.  I stumbled into Best Buy and wandered into the video games section.  As I gazed at my choices, Star Wars Galaxies caught my eye.  I had never played an MMO before and I loved Star Wars, so it seemed like a good fit.

I spent my noob days wandering around Tatooine on the Ahazi server, until finally one day in Bestine, someone was advertising/recruiting for a guild called -CoP-.  I joined the guild and met a bunch of very nice people, whom i played with for over a year.  I grew very close to one person in particular, a female guildmate that played along with her brother and father.  We ended up getting married in the game after a few months.

After spending so much time talking in the game, we began to talk on Teamspeak and Ventrilo.  She seemed like a really nice girl and we became friends.  At this point, we were not more than online friends due to the fact that she lived in Indiana and I was in Florida, over 1,000 miles away.  After SWG started to fade, we still kept in touch through email and social networking.  I’d regularly contact her to see how she was doing and to make sure all was well.  After a few years, Star Wars: The Old Republic was announced.  We agreed that we would play on the same server and relive old times.

Fast forward to December of 2011, 7 years later and we were back online in a Star Wars setting.  Both older and more mature, we talked constantly via voice chat and began to realize the characteristics in one another that made us come together initially.  I was coming up on my last semester of University after five long years (dual major), and would finally be able to move wherever I wanted.  The timing seemed right so after a month of catching up, we decided to start a long-distance relationship.

I flew up to Indiana after a month and a half to finally meet the girl whom I had known for seven long years.  We had an instant deep connection that I had never felt with any of the other girls that I had previously dated, this was special.  My family initially thought I was crazy for flying across the country to meet “some girl from the internet”, and that I was most certainly going to be murdered by strangers. But alas, everything went well and her family really liked me.  This may seem naive or cliche, but we both knew we had each found our soul mate in one another.

We’ve been flying back and forth over the last few months visiting one another when work and school schedules permitted.  Towards the end of the semester I started applying to jobs in Indiana to discover that even for a graduate with three internships, work experience and two degrees, finding a post-graduation job is difficult.  I’ve applied to damn well over fifty positions with nothing yielding positive results as of yet.  There is added difficulty in applying for jobs in a city that is a thousand miles away.

I thought I would share this story to reddit for a number of reasons.  To show the fact that love can be found on the internet, that MMO’s may not be a complete waste of time and to ask for the Reddit community’s help and advice.  

Does the community have advice, comments, or job leads for someone in my shoes?  For background info, my degrees were in Finance &amp; Management Information Systems.  I also have internship experience in IT asset management, wealth management and internet product management.  I’m a very quick learner, dedicated individual and overall nice guy.  Also, I’m a redditor just like you. I’ve applied to a very high number of jobs and always attempt to follow up, but it’s difficult out there for new graduates as i’m sure many of you know.
 
We could really use help breaking the distance and finally being together, any advice?

I was diagnosed after a breakdown two years ago, and upon discussion, realized it had probably been going on for upwards of 7+ years. But, this week has been one of the worst in a VERY long time. I didn't realize how bad things had gotten until today.

I have been put on Academic Probation and Financial Aid Warning for my now failing grades in college. I have zero motivation (even while on Citalopram) and have withdrawn from too many classes to receive any Withdraw Passing grades including when I withdrew from university when I had hit rock bottom before. I'm worried I'm going to soon put myself in the position that I won't be able to return to college if I fail again.

I am on an upcoming rental house lease with a good friend and my now ex-boyfriend. We broke up about a month ago, and are now battling over the lease. My friend and I can't afford the place without him, but we haven't been able to find a replacement for him on the lease. Due to the nature of the lease, we can't even terminate it. I have to fight and deal with yelling and being put down almost every day because of it. 

Today, I was fired from my job. I had an internship position at a fairly large company. However, they had very little work for me. I've automatically put in my hours at the stable rate for weeks now. When I walked in to work today, I was met with HR and my boss. They sat me down and had a discussion that I was falsifying my time sheets. While I realize I may have had a bad day here or there (not being able to get out of bed in the morning), I had no idea that it had been so incredibly bad. I am going to be liable to pay back all the hours I wasn't there. I realize it's my fault for not adjusting things. But I'm terrified of the consequences. I feel like I let my depression get in the way of logical decisions. I'm afraid that I've completely ruined my future and career by those decisions. I don't even know what to say to them either. I feel trapped and absolutely hopeless because of this.

I am waiting to hear back from a psychiatrist to set up an appointment so I can return to medication and therapy. I have been trying so hard to get a regular help solution, but have had various failures. I have had many ""no new patients,"" no returned calls, and just general blocks. I've been to physicians that treat patients like cattle, and therapists that ignore what I say. I'm tired and want to give up. 

I just don't even know what to do any more. I feel like I'm in a place I can't escape, and that I have destroyed any chance for a happy future. I have zero friends for support. My sister is too messed up to offer consistent support and my Dad thinks depression isn't an illness. My Mom is my only rock, but even she's getting tired of my lack of progress. 

I just don't know any more.

That's got me thinking - what should I expect salary wise, and do I negotiate?
I like to think I'm a pretty valuable commodity.  I've graduated from a good university, in a good, serious topic, with a 2.1 (that's a 3.0 GPA for Americans, ish).  I've got a lot of real work experience in a variety of sectors.  But I'm a recent graduate, and this is in a competitive field I'm really interested in working in.  I've also got parents who live nearby, and live there, so a huge starting salary isn't essential - but what should I be expecting?  What should I settle for?

I've asked my parents, but they both work in banks, so I'm not sure how valuable their advice is.  My dad said take anything, then try and make yourself invaluable, but my mum pointed out quick promotion isn't guaranteed in technology fields, especially in a customer service/operations position, so don't settle for anything under 25k.

So, reddit, what do you think?

A little backstory: my good friend, Katie (Des Moine, Iowa), is an ambitious animator that’s going to a very esteemed (and expensive) art school. Despites having more than her share of hurdles in life, she’s never once turned her back on her dreams, her morals, her family, or her friends. She doesn’t have much, but she’d give away her entire bank account and everything she owned if she thought it’d help someone out. She’s the type of person I look up to and someday aspire to be.

Recently she’s hit some financial hard times. Her computer, which she needs for her classes and her unpaid internship for school that she had to quit work for, has started to clonk out. She was saving up some cash here and there to buy a new computer before next semester but hit a few serious snags along the way- her commissions fell through, the internship started dumping other people’s work on her, and – most severe – her cat was just diagnosed with an unknown ailment that’s shaping up to be either diabetes or thyroid cancer. All the money she had saved up went straight into diagnostic tests and she has no idea how expensive the treatments will be.

Her other friends (Texas and Kansas) and I (Michigan) have been trying to help out but there’s only so much we can do since were all at least 300+ miles away and pretty much in similar financial situations ourselves. So I’m asking for some financial assistance in order to help cover her cat’s new expenses as well getting a new Macbook Pro for her so she can take her classes and finish her internship. Any amount helps tremendously.

Her Paypal address is kbolte@mcad.edu 

She also has some sculpture commissions open if you’d like to help her out while getting something in return. You can get more information here: http://iron-zing.deviantart.com/journal/#/d52g4v8

The intern (which I am giving him the benefit of the doubt that he was legit) kept bringing up that Raw 1000 will change the way the audience interacts with the WWE. 

I'm thinking that with Raw 1000, they are going to do something like they did the the AJ hashtag. They're going to start Raw shows off with a big segment (good idea, real in the audience) and then pose a question to the audience. They run a poll, and bam, there's the main event for the night. They might even have something like the real time polls that were going on during the E3 announcements. 

The Charlie Sheen hing is just a way for millions upon millions of people to see it live in action, and get it going in full effect. In my opinion, this is actually a very good move. Even if it's partially scripted (Like CM PUNK had 57% of that AJ poll...) it gives an interaction to fans, and gives an already huge media presence to the WWE when practically the entire roster is going to be trending topics on Twitter.

Here is a list of my relevant courses, to give you an idea of my capabilities and knowledge base:
-modern physics (basically intro to SR and quantum)
-quantum mechanics
-statics
-astrophysics (was mostly about planetary orbits,included some visual python programming)
-AC/DC circuits
-electronics (mostly logic gates and such)
-intro to experimental design
-cslculus up thru multivariable
-linear algebra
-differential equations (have to retake)
-intro to algorithmic design 1 &amp; 2 (inrto cs courses, all programming in C++)

This summer, I'm working for a different company doing something very similar. It's being billed as an ""internship"", but they're treating me like a consultant and just checking up on my progress every couple of weeks.

Given this level of experience, I'd happily call myself an expert on this kind of Sharepoint implementation.

How do I market this? Are there MS certifications I can get? I'll have my bachelors in CS with a minor in Business by next May if all goes well. Where would I start looking for this kind of work?"

I do not believe that any issues that arise here are too complicated for someone with sufficient knowledge of these things.

I really believe that a junior or senior in college in a related field would be able to handle this job without a problem. If I'm correct then this person could make some good money over the next year (or longer) by doing contract work for us. Additionally, I would be interested in discussing any other set up to assist, such as either part-time employment or a paid internship (with the understanding that it is not really an internship since you won't have a mentor).

Thanks.  


EDIT:  To all you naysayers out there, this is a real law firm that needs some IT help.  I chose Reddit because I tend to find quality people on this site, both professionally and socially.  I also find a lot of people like some of the posters below who would not believe the sky was blue unless they saw it with their own eyes and had the Pope swear by affidavit by it. 

Additionally, you can see from my user account that I'm not some bot using reddit for nefarious reasons.  I'm always reading, and I regularly contribute. 

As for the sketchy email address, that was so I don't get bombarded with resumes and emails on my work account.  Responses are coming from my work eamil address so you can do your due diligence and realize that this is an actual law firm in a real building and with actual employees.  Is it so crazy to not want to put my work email out there for solicitations?  Apparently some of you think that way.    

So for those that took a wild leap of faith by emailing your resume to someone who is offering work, thank you.  For those of you who doubt the world is round because you've never personally seen it from space, good luck to you.  



UPDATE:  I brought in someone from GT who is working out well so far.  I have disabled the gmail email address listed above.  Thanks to each and every one of you that submitted your resume.  "

I realize that most of the recruiters here aren't located in Poland, but I'm a third year comp sci student and if anyone can help me get my internship form signed and has an interesting project to work on then I'd be glad to work with you. I don't care about payment and I have a lot of spare time.

I mostly work with FlashPunk, but I've also worked with Flixel, Box2D, and AS3 without an external framework to a lesser extent. I do everything in FlashDevelop making use of classes and OOP. Other than AS3 I also love to code in C# - it's much better than AS3, imo :D

My current project is a puzzle game called Qublox, its about 90% complete and it'll be finished this week. It's already listed on FlashGameLicense.com so if you have an account [you can play it here.](http://www.flashgamelicense.com/view_game.php?from=dev&amp;game_id=24281)

**I also have a lot of unfinished prototypes that are each about 5-10 hours into development:**

[CavernDash](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/53503414/CavernDash-AKLOS.swf) - a clone of the classic BoulderDash games.

[Stickman Card Battle](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/53503414/StickmanCardBattle.swf) - a strategic ""card game"" where the player fights against an AI by using cards from a hand of 5 randomly picked cards.

[EatTheFlies](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/53503414/EatTheFlies.swf) - this is a simple tug-o-war game idea I had. Click on the screen to ""eat flies"" before the hunger bar reaches zero and click on the frog to buy upgrades.

[BoomChime](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/53503414/BoomChime.swf) - a chain reaction game based on ""BoomShine"".

[BoundGame](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/53503414/BoundGameFinal.swf) - a top down game where the player must get to the end of what is essentially an obstacle course. Press SPACE to jump, WASD/Arrow keys to move.

[BreakinBalls](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/53503414/BreakinBalls-AKLOS.swf) - a physics game where the player tries to launch a ball into other balls and break enough of them to pass a level. I used Box2D for the physics in this, as my own physics code wasn't good enough. Mouse controls.

[LDGame](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/53503414/LDGame.swf) - this was going to be my submission for the last Ludum Dare competition. Mouse controls, click to shoot.

If you want to see the source code for any of the prototypes, I'd be glad to send you it. All of the (bad and temporary) art is mine as well, so I have some basic skills with vector and pixel art.

Thanks for looking

vq5b4,6,2012-06-28,[request] Kind of a weird request - looking for someone with a Denver area code to help deceive my boyfriend's parents.  Details inside!,Mirror23,Favors,https://www.reddit.com/r/Favors/comments/vq5b4/request_kind_of_a_weird_request_looking_for/,"I'm currently in Denver working a summer internship and I'll be done here at the end of July. At that time, my boyfriend will be flying here and we will drive together to the city where he and his family live. We want to get a room at a nice hotel together since this will be the first time we'll see each other in 4 months. Just for the record, we are both 21 and have been together for 1.5 years.

The problem is that his parents are very strict and overprotective and will never be on board with this plan. Every time he spends the night somewhere, they always call his friend's parents to make sure he is where he says he'll be. So basically there's no way we can stay at a hotel without an alibi.

That's where a friendly Redditor comes in :) I need someone to pretend to be the parents of the host family I'm staying with here and convince my boyfriend's mom that we're staying here in Denver a night longer than we really are. I don't have any family or friends in Denver, and I don't feel comfortable asking my host family or any of my coworkers to lie for me. So I'm relying on the kindness of the Internet here.

I'm looking for a person (preferably a woman, because my boyfriend's mom will feel more comfortable talking to the mother of the family) who can convincingly play a middle-aged mother. How this works is that I will give my boyfriend's mom your phone number, I will provide you with all the personal information you need to carry on a conversation with her, she will call you, and you will tell her that we are spending an extra day in Denver so we can see the mountains. That's it!

I know this request is a bit insane, but I would be really, really grateful if someone could do this for us. I'm willing to pay someone $20 to help me out. Thanks so much!

vq3n1,0,2012-06-28,why is it so hard to get an unpaid internship in statistics? have you encountered similar difficulties?,[deleted],statistics,https://www.reddit.com/r/statistics/comments/vq3n1/why_is_it_so_hard_to_get_an_unpaid_internship_in/,"I apologize if the posts in this subreddit recently have taken to an undergrad trend, but i think what I'm asking is significantly different enough from the other statistics major post to warrant a new thread.

I have friends in various other majors who (with similar GPAs, which I know doesn't say much unless I specify the majors) have easily gotten paid/unpaid internships. I have applied to over 25 internships/jobs which I've found online. The majority of these were through my university's job database, but I also searched internships.com. I've contacted department heads to see if there were any need for help in the department and ""cold emailed"" relevant businesses. The only place to offer me an interview did not have a website or phone number and did not return my emails! 

I've been searching for positions for this summer or the coming fall and at this point it feels like I'm all but explicitly stating ""free work! please, take it!"". *i'm not looking for sympathy* though this might be a rant, because I'm still a college student (majoring in statistics if it wasn't obvious), but I would like to know whether other statisticians on Reddit had experienced these difficulties when beginning their job hunts? Some kind of assurance that I'm not missing a vital step to make this process easier would help as well.

I also understand that I may not be qualified to do much of anything with the education I have thus far attained. However, I feel that by applying to primarily unpaid internships I am compensating for the lack of an extensive skill set.

vq0cj,12,2012-06-27,"I, a PC/Android user was given an iPad to use for my summer internship. My thoughts after a month.",Elpants,ipad,https://www.reddit.com/r/ipad/comments/vq0cj/i_a_pcandroid_user_was_given_an_ipad_to_use_for/,"First off, a little background. I have never been much of a fan of Apple as a business. As a PC gamer, I love my Windows 7 Desktop and my small HP laptop I use at school. Last Apple product I personally owned was an iPod video I bought with my first paycheck from my first real job in High School. When the ZuneHD came out, my iPod's 2nd battery was about dead. I jumped on the chance to purge everything Apple from my computer. Been happy with that ever since. I don't know what I would do without my Android phone, I have an Samsung Epic 4G Touch (Sprint version of the Galaxy S2) that is rooted with AOKP ICS ROM. I also own a Kindle Fire, unrooted and completely stock, I don't feel this is much of an Android experience and I use it as an e-reader, nothing else. I may root it and put ICS on it in the future. I have pretty extensive use of other Android tablets such as the Asus Transformer Prime as well.

Fast forward, I am 1 semester away from graduating with a degree in Construction Management/Engineering and after 2 years of interviews with some of the largest construction companies in the world and some small local ones, I scored a paid internship as a project coordinator with a small custom home builder that builds some very large and expensive homes for some very rich people. I moved to a new town and got an apartment a week after finals to start work.

The company is small, I along with the owner, another guy and a bookkeeper twice a week are the only ones in a 1 room office. The owner had been impressed with iPads and iPhones and tries to integrate them into the business. So he purchased an iPad for Project Managers and Superintendents. When I arrived, he ordered 1 more for me. Luckily I am using the iPad 3 while everyone else has an iPad 2.

The main thing he uses it for is a service called BuilderTrend. It allows the clients, engineers and architects to keep track of building progress that we upload online via iPad or Computer in form of product selections, photos and job reports. More on this service later.

Here are my thoughts on the iPad after a little over a month of use coming from someone who is used to knowing his way around a PC and Android Phone.

* Insanely simplified. There is no denying it's easy to use and pick up on. This isn't really a bad thing, but not so great either. Customization has been sacrificed in iOS in favor for the boring stock UI. Beyond moving icons around, I can't do much. When I turn it on, I see a homescreen with a few icons, the clock up top and the ""DON'T PANIC"" background I found. I am used to useful widgets with all sorts of information and functions at my fingertips. Speaking of icons it bothers me I can't select *where* on the grid I want them, they just snap to that first available slot. I feel it's too simple and I'm being treated like I am not trusted to create my own icon layout. [My Android home screen](http://i.imgur.com/EjDU4.png) reflects what I mean and wish I could do. VS [iPad Homescreen](http://i.imgur.com/x7y9l.jpg). (Kindle Fire's nightmare of a Homescreen doesn't begin to compare to either.)

* Stock email app is absolutely terrible. Few things bother me, the first I noticed when replying to a subcontractor while on a jobsite. I had put the pdf in my dropbox folder and downloaded it to the iPad, I wrote a reasonable in length email and tried to attach the file only to realize I couldn't. I needed to open the file on the ipad then select the email option...which just opens a new draft that is not related to the current email chain between myself, subcontractors and other construction personnel. Frustrated, I drove back to the office just to reply in Outlook in the sake of being organized and functional.

* Keyboard works and does it's job fine, but where are my long press keys? I can type with 1 thumb on my phone faster and more efficiently than I can on the iPad with both hands, I gave it a month to get used to it and I have become more accurate but I feel my speed and accuracy has plateaued. Word prediction is terrible compared to many of the 3rd party Android keyboards like Swiftkey 3 or use of a regular keyboard.

* While it takes a good photo [(example)](http://i.imgur.com/FVHLB.jpg) when lighting is good, it's awkward to use. One of the things with BuilderTrend is uploading progress photos the home. I was in the crawlspace of a new home taking pictures, it was dark, dusty and tight. The lack of flash prevented me from taking the photos I wanted and I didn't like the fact to get stable picture it required two hands. I ended up pulling my phone out to finish the photos because I needed flash to get a reasonable picture.

* Certain apps are just a joy the use. I had used Flipboard on my phone, but seeing it large and in charge on the iPad has made it my favorite app when I'm not working.

* Wifi range sucks, I have seen this as a problem and people saying getting a replacement solved it, but every iPad I have used that's owned by the company is suffering from the problem. Standing on one end of the jobsite I had no wifi on the iPad and neither did the superintendent, so I pulled out my phone and had perfect signal strength.

* It's a toy, bottom line here. Everything it does for my job, I can easily do on a laptop and more efficiently. I can upload photos on buildertrend, but I can't upload spec sheets for product selections. So instead, I just do it all on my laptop. Email does not have enough functionality to make it professional and organized, I can't create folders to file emails from jobsite to jobsite, I have limited attachment capabilities. I might as well do it on my laptop and only read emails on the iPad...which I do. There are a couple of things it does pretty well, such as being able to open the engineering/architectural drawings as a pdf or with Autodesk Design Review and easily view them while walking around or refer to specific details while having a full printed version in front of me. I keep notes on it, the stock note's app is surprisingly good.

* Gaming, I'm a PC gamer, I'm not sold on mobile games being anything more than puzzle games like Cut the Rope or social games like Draw Something. Even on Android, I don't play a lot of games. Frankly I get bored of them pretty fast. iPad is no exception. I wouldn't consider it gaming, more like 5 minutes at a time entertainment. Call it what you will.

This brings me to a few things, I would like to be able to use the iPad to make myself more productive. My boss would like to know what kind of apps would be useful (paid or free). All the apps we use as a company are on the screenshot of the home page [Or here](http://i.imgur.com/x7y9l.jpg). Like I have been saying, we're a General Contractor building Custom Homes and the like, even a private airport. The only thing I brought to the table was Autodesk Design Review (PC version I can do materials take-offs). So if there is anything I should know about I would appreciate it.

I realize a few things I find lame about iOS in general could be fixed through Jailbreak and believe me, if it wasn't company property I would have jailbroken this thing 10 minutes out of the box. I'm considering offering to buy the iPad from my boss after the my internship is over, it's neat and all, I like my tech toys, but with the Microsoft Surface and Asus/Google Nexus Tablet being announced, I might just go for one of those. I'm undecided, either way, whatever I end up owning for myself will be a fancy touch screen for Reddit."

To begin, I'm a rising sophomore in college who's set on finding an internship for the next summer no matter what. I'm ready to do pretty much anything: learn a new language, a new concept, you name it.    
The thing with me is that I actually did't understand/hated programming before January of this year (talk about a bad high school experience).     
So far I have taken an introductory course to Java; will be taking a continuation to that one in the fall (basically: algorithms and data structures), also will take discrete mathematics at the same time.     
This past semester really made me like CS and I'd like to pursue the degree. I understand that in order to set up myself for a better job after college, I need experience, lots of experience. So one of my ultimate goals for this upcoming academic year is to learn as much as possible for the recruitment season (which usually starts in January/February in my university).   
**TL;DR**    
**My experience so far**: basic Java, some Android development (started teaching myself this summer), HTML (lol), and some XML.     
**What are the ""must-haves"" that I need to learn before January 2013?**     
P.S. also, for anyone in a similar situation, I found these threads particularly **helpful**: [1](http://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/rghrs/can_you_get_an_internship_as_a_freshman_in/), [2](http://www.reddit.com/r/compsci/comments/h6cfk/computer_science_internships_how_do_i_go_about/), [3](http://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/m5biu/a_question_regarding_cs_internship_resumes/)"
vpuou,2,2012-06-27,[DAY ONE] Here I go! My no-PMO manifesto. Also looking for advice on LDR and NoFap,FactsNotFaps,NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/vpuou/day_one_here_i_go_my_nopmo_manifesto_also_looking/,"Hello Fapstronauts:

So a while back I ran into this sub in a comment somewhere, and was incredibly intrigued. I have been PMOing since 15, probably, and now am 20.

I never thought of it as much of a problem, I am a pretty social guy, and was even able to get an awesome girlfriend who I have been with for 19 months now. PMO had not appeared to affect my life much at all, until probably the last year.

As much as I love her, we've had some sexual difficulty. We've maybe only had real intercourse a handful of times: I am apparently a bit too big for her (I'm nothing huge, she's just very tight and it makes it tough), but we are still very sexual in other ways. Unfortunately this aspect, combined with a very emotional year for her, have driven me to PMO on my own a bit more. Add to this that we are separated for the summer, and that she just finished college while I am returning next fall, and things have been tough. 

I was at a weird place at the beginning of the summer, seeking out new types of porn and looking up things that don't match my orientation (which I now think may be due to HOCD). This was due, in part I think, to being long distance (1000+ miles) from my gf. I recently started my internship only an hour from her, and these abnormal PMO habits slowed down.

In my preparation for my first visit from her, I decided to abstain from PMO simply so that our first time together would be awesome. During that week I seriously changed. I got a gym membership for the summer, ran nearly every day, worked out nearly every day, and was very able to make friends with all of the people in my internship (the last one isn't generally a problem for me, but I imagine my incidental NoFap still helped)

That weekend was amazing! We did lots of stuff together, and after she left I was so ready to continue with my NoFap!

Enter Chaser Effect:
The next week was a Fap-fest. Morning fap, after-work fap, evening fap. I very quickly lost energy. I changed. I was back to the weird porn. No more running, no more gym, sleepy every morning. 

I want to get back to energetic awesome me from the other week! A couple times this week I have said ""Let's do it. You don't even need to do that NoFap site, just believe in yourself. And it has never worked. I don't have expectations on me, and so I just succumb.

So here I go: I realized that a reboot is really what I need. I am posting here so that there are expectations on me. I am posting here so that I will follow through.

This summer is essential for me. This internship could be a huge in for me, if I do well. I have muscles to build, books to read, places to explore! No PMO will give me the time for this!

And perhaps most importantly, it will give me the time to think on my LDR. My girlfriend is simply incredible. But we have decided to part ways at the end of the summer, barring a huge decision to stay together. I fortunately this summer have the opportunity to see her nearly every weekend, but after that, no more. NoFap will help me to make those weekends awesome. But I will not succumb to the Chaser Effect again. I will go play sports, I will go outside and read a book, I will go buy ice cream.

So please, give me some wise words on NoFap, but also on LDR's if you have any. 

Signed,
FactsNotFaps (clearly not my main account)

**tl;dr:** The tl;dr is the same as every other day 1 post. The details are what is interesting.

vpsau,0,2012-06-27,"Got a traffic ticket for supposedly not stopping at a stop sign and mild speeding, is this worth fighting? Anyone have any advice/good stories about pleading not guilty and going to court?",ChazzyCheese,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/vpsau/got_a_traffic_ticket_for_supposedly_not_stopping/,"I was pulling out of a parking lot after buying a delicious sandwich and on the way out I accelerated a bit too much and I guess there was a cop around, because I got pulled over almost immediately after I turned right at the corner.

Well I got the feeling that the cop who pulled me over was power trippin'  pretty much the first thing she said was ""You're gonna be leaving here with at least a $500 ticket you know that?"", which is quite funny because even after writing me all that she could it only was $318. Anyway, she goes on to tell me how I was speeding and going 45 in a 25. Whatever, I acknowledge this and admit my fault but then she says I did not stop at the stop sign, which is ridiculous because I stopped for at least 3 seconds (which is the minimum at least in my home state), to which she replied that I was over the stop line..

Now wait a minute. The intersection where this particular stop sign is is a pretty big intersection, meaning that if you actually wanted to see if there were any cars coming, you would have to go a little further ahead to safely view the road. That is what I did, I actually might have even stopped fully before and inched up until I could see so I was pretty pissed that my ticket included that, so I plead not guilty cause fuck that shit, y'know?

Well fast forward a bit, my court date is here but I'm currently not in the same state (2.5 hrs away, got the ticket while at university) and am doing a 9-5 internship everyday of the week, so I can't really go attend my court date. So I'm thinking of just calling the court and changing my plea to guilty and just pay my fine and get it over with. I could however ask them if they could delay the date, as I will be back at school only 3 weeks after when my date is scheduled.

So do you think I should just pay the fine or try to get them to postpone my court date and still go try to fight it?


TLDR: Got traffic ticket, should I pay fine or plead not guilty"
vprj5,2,2012-06-27,"Nobody is interested in me.....Hell, I'm not even interested in me",[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/vprj5/nobody_is_interested_in_mehell_im_not_even/,"I just left my fb online for a full day and a half, to see if anybody would even bother to message me. 450+ ""friends,"" and nobody has anything to say to me. I'm not particularly close with my siblings or my parents, in fact, I'd say they really don't know anything about me now that I've been away from home for a while (recent college grad). I have no dating prospects whatsoever, maybe one person who I consider a real friend, ""networking"" means nothing to me and its something that I'm apparently entirely incapable of.

It makes no sense at all. I'm young, actually very good-looking (just trying to be truthful, In person I would never brag about something that I didn't work for like that), in great shape because I exercise 5 days a week, rich (although virtually nobody knows this about me as fortunately I did have a great upbringing, and I'm actually uncomfortable being flashy or drawing attention to myself for stupid reasons like that), smart (I'll be going to grad-school next year in a fairly technical field).

But no matter what, clearly something is missing. I just don't get it, I'm a somewhat quiet guy, but not anything peculiar at all, and at this point I make a conscious effort to be nice and outgoing to people, because I've been refereed to as ""intimidating"" by some of my acquaintances before. Hell, I'd say almost every time I interact with somebody face-to-face, I'm actually forced to control the conversation, because even in person it seems like people just sit back and wait for me to initiate everything. If I don't say anything, with most people I would just end up sitting  awkwardly in silence, so even truly saying that I'm quiet is a bit of a stretch.

All in all though, I'm starting to think that despite it all, I'm just not ""interesting."" I have few hobbies, and those that I enjoy I'm honestly mediocre to awful at (I've been playing guitar for about 10 years and I fucking suck lol.....can't sing for shit either ha). I'm stuck in the city with no car, so any outdoorsy activities are difficult to organize (If I could even find anybody to do them with, which I cant.) Its summer now, and I've just been sitting around doing nothing. I bounce around between different places (home and in the city and vacation) too much to get a job or internship, and even if I applied for one, I'm entirely non-competitive (my last job, three years ago, was as a summertime late-night janitor (best job ever))

God I hope grad school is better than undergrad for me. I was absolutely fine in highschool, but I went to a small school so the kids I grew up with are the kids I went to school with (they were like family then, we are all losing touch now due to circumstances). Now I'm at a huge school in a huge city, and clearly something is missing from my personality, because out of everybody here, nobody gives a shit about me.

[Is r/squaredcircle one of the sites you visit for consumer research?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c56a1ln?context=5)|I do visit r/squaredcircle, but that's just because I'm a redditor lol. I have no idea of any plans to change the set or theme but there is a chance everything will change on the 1000th episode. Also, its going to be highly interactive. Like taboo tuesday but better.
[Any word if there are plans to change the raw set or theme anytime soon? For the 1000th episode?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c56a1ln?context=5)|I do work in stamford in the Titan Towers building. I didn't see Morgan.
[I'm assuming you work in the Titan towering Stamford, correct? Did you see Matt Morgan there last week?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c56a1ln?context=5)|I talk about everything wrestling with my boss, including TNA and ROH and UFC. It's my job to know about them and talk about them =)
[Do they openly talk about TNA around the office?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c56a1ln?context=5)|I went to an ROH event this past weekend.
[Any insight as to why WWE seems to have a hardon for twitter?  Notice any changes in policy or marketing relating to Linda's campaign?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c56c9ai?context=5)|WWE is proud of its social media presence. social media is essentially free marketing so it would be foolish not to integrate.  I haven't noticed anything due to Lina's campaign. I will say that Fox News is always on the tvs in the elevator lol. I trained for a year with the IWF in NJ. They aren't around anymore but I had some of the best times of my life there.
[To what extent was your Indy career? Where'd you train/wrestle? How was WWE's attitude towards this in the interview process?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c56c9ai?context=5)|The interview process was very relaxed. They didn't ask me any ""interview questions"" such as what is your greatest flaw etc. They just wanted to know my availability, knowledge of the product, and what days I could work. The second they asked me how much I knew about the product, I knew I was in.
[Coolest wrestler you've met?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c568rkw?context=5)|Well I've only been here since June 4th and haven't seen many wrestlers. Also, I only work Mon-Wed. But Paul Levesque comes in on Wednesdays and I've actually met him. We are on a first name basis (I call him Paul) which is such insanity. For those who don't know Paul is better known for his in ring persona, Triple H.
[I am correct to assume he's a massive individual in person?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c56b897?context=5)|Yes, even in a suit. Although I'm 6'3"" so it wasnt that bad. I was mostly just shitting myself and trying not to pull an awkward penguin while shaking his hand.
[Is he still married to Stephanie?  (Vince's daughter\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c56efsh?context=5)|Yup.
[Do people actually think its real? Any funny stories in regards to that? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c568t26?context=5)|I figured this would come up. First of all, most people know its scripted.  It isn't fake though. I would never call it that. Everything they do in there from an athletic point of view is completely real. They put on a show at any costs. The pain and excitement is very real. Obviously the punches are pulled and they are mostly all friends who don't want to hurt themselves. Why would they? If they actually killed each other every night there would be noone left to fight after a month.
 |I will say that the kids do have a higher suspension of disbelief. On my first day I checked my messages on my phone because I was getting used to my office and I saw that I had a voice-mail. It was from a very young kid who must have found our number online and called and somehow it got transferred to my desk. I listened to the voice-mail and it was hilarious and cute. The kid was so upset with The Big Show and was telling me how WWE NEEDS to fire him. The message went on for 5 minutes. I still might have it. He kept saying how Big Show is bad for business and needs to be fired for what he has done.
 |Big Show is one of the WWE's top heels right now and this voice-mail just reminded me of the passion I used to have for this program when I was 11.  I still have passion for the product, but I'm much more grown up now lol.
[You probably don't know this directly, but could you work your channels and find out if Paul Wight has a special toilet? Like a special big-boy toilet.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c56c776?context=5)|He has his own bus, so it's possible.
[Are you ever tempted to get fired just hear Vince McMahon fire you?  Is that why you created this AMA?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c569uej?context=5)|2) I don't think I will get fired for this. (At least I really really hope I dont) 1) My career goals thus far are to join the ""Kiss My Ass Club"" and hear Vince yell those two infamous words ;)
[ now reddit knows you want to kiss an old mans ass...](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c56anbb?context=5)|YES! YES! YES!
[How long have you been there? Have you met all the wrestlers? and what is Vince like?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c568slx?context=5)|The wrestlers are usually on the road and don't often come to my building. I haven't met Vince, so I cant tell you, but Paul was very nice. Joey Styles also introduced himself to me. I call him Joe.
 |I started on June 4th. Everyone that I have met is so incredibly nice. It is seriously the best working environment I could think of. Especially since I've been a hardcore fan since middle school.
[So what exactly is your daily job?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c568ray?context=5)|Basically, I am the eyes and ears of the WWE on dirt-sheets and competitive analysis. I go through the internet and find out what people are saying about WWE, its programs, and its upcoming network. I also keep an eye on UFC, TNA, and boxing updates. I look at what other companies are doing marketing wise, and think of how WWE could put their own spin on it. I maintain a PPV Competitive Calendar that compares buyrates in our industry. My current big project is creating a database that contains information on EVERY WWE PPV EVERRRR!! It's taking a while, but is an important task. My work is going to be shown to the VP of something or other, so I'm proud of that.
[Please, just let them know Dolph Ziggler needs the World Heavyweight Title.  Ratings will skyrocket.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c56bg9r?context=5)|Believe me, I know!
[You sit down all day reading about MMA and Pro Wrestling, damn, that is a dream job.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c569hcj?context=5)|Pretty much! It's what I did for fun, but now its a job lol.
[Do you go through r/SquaredCircle while doing this research?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c56avkz?context=5)|Yes, and for fun. I LOVE wrestlingwithtext.
[What kind of information about the PPVs are you collecting?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c56bjh9?context=5)|Buyrates mostly. Fan reactions. Looking for any changes in our competition (injuries, contract disputes, conficting PPV dates)
[Always wondered if they look into things like what people are saying. Does that influence things, and how so?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c568wfw?context=5)|It doesn't influence things too much. Obviously I see the feedback on the dirt sheets and a lot of it is negative, but I'm used to that. Basically I'm just looking to see what our competators are doing. Recently UFC got like 3 major injuries and had to change a few of its PPV cards. Those are the things I'm looking at.
[Are you getting paid for this internship?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c56bd6m?context=5)|Nay, tis for credit.
[ was that true? I was at the Rumble, everyone was pretty much convinced Jericho was going to win, then when Sheamus won the building kinda went... ""huh"".](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c56doqw?context=5)|It would seem to be true, although I cant confirm that.
[For the fan reactions and competition info are you having to comb the web for this info, or do they already have a lot of it and you're just putting it into a centralized location?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c56bq8w?context=5)|Anything I deem reportable goes to my boss and he does with it what he wants.
[Whoa whoa whoa....you consider the UFC to be a competitor of the WWE?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c56d9gw?context=5)|Absolutely.
[Were you a big fan before taking the internship? What do you study that landed you there? What was the selection process like? Did working there change what you feel about the WWE? Is it still exciting to watch if you know the outcomes of the matches in advance?  What size are the Great Khali's pants?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c568v99?context=5)|I have been watching WWE since 2003. It's been an obsession of mine. I study Marketing and this is a marketing internship. I applied online via the corporate site and got a call from an HR person telling me they wanted to interview me. After the interview I was exteded an invite for the Summer internship and had to sign a bunch of papers and stuff.  I don't know details like the outcomes of the matches (I dont want to know frankly) but rather more general things such as which legend will be on RAW this week, who is headlining what PPV, celebrity guests, WWE Magazine stories and WWE.com articles.
[Do you live in the Stamford area or did you have to relocate?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c56ay0p?context=5)|Right now I live on campus at my college in the Bronx/Riverdale area. I commute. Usually a 35-40 minute commute as long as its not raining.
[God, that sounds exciting. I'm from Queens so if I got this my commute would probably be significantly longer.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c56b6fo?context=5)|Plus I work 10-4 so I miss most of rush hour. AND its a reverse commute (I'm leaving the city in the morning and coming back at night)
[I'm guessing you drive?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c56bajp?context=5)|Yes! WWE has a parking garage as a part of its corporate headquarters.
[As a CompSec Systems student, you've given me hope and direction. I'm going to try and do all it takes to get that internship next semester. I WANT to work for WWE's IT eventually. It'd be my dream job. Thank you, you've inspired me so much. You have no idea.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c56bc5f?context=5)|It really can happen to anyone. I'm just a guy who loves the product and applied for my dream job. Now I have it and will hopefully slowly climb the corporate ladder until I die. Our IT department has some really cool shit and is located on the third floor. Anyone who is interested should call in and see if they can get a tour, or apply for a job/internship online. If you need any help with the application process or have any specific questions about my process I would be glad to help.
[Who is your favorite wrestler currently on the roster?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c56a633?context=5)|Damien Sandow. Without a doubt. My favorite (until his recent semi-retirement) has always been Undertaker. Im also a huge fan of Punk and Bryan and Ziggler. 
[We had a conversation n the pub last week about what matches wedlike to see above all others. The other guys all mentioned triple-threats/Cage matches with Cena, Punk etc..  I just said Ryback v Sandow. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c56dnh0?context=5)|Maybe when they decide to put Ryback against an actual person that can happen. I doubt it though as they are both getting pushed and for one to put the over now wouldn't be wise. 
[Yeah! I should be moving to Vienna, Austria pretty soon and hopefully pick it up from there!  Any advice you'd like to throw my way? haha.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c56cyql?context=5)|I'm sure there are good schools in Europe. Although, honestly, I have no idea where or how to get to them. If you are serious about being a wrestler, do what the greats have done. Get in shape, spend as much time as you can in the ring. Wrestle often. Work on mic skills. Learn from everyone and everything. Always ask veterans for advise. Always improve. Don't stand still. Learn as many styles as you can, luchador, Japanese, American, European. There is so much to learn, you will never stop. Take care of yourself and the people you work with.
[I just printed that out and will hang it on my wall in a bit. Thank you for your time and all the best man! ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c56d3ua?context=5)|I am honored to have been some help.
[Is there a museum or something similar there? Also, do they let you watch any of the library they have there? One final question, who is the most famous person you have met (superstar or backstage guy\)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c56coc5?context=5)|The whole place is a museum. I walk past Andre's boots everytime I go to lunch. Every employee has acess to that week's shows and the most recent PPV. WWE programming is constantly on in the cafeteria and elevators. I met Triple H.
[Awesome! I would love to visit that place one day. I am a stock holder so.. GET BACK TO WORK YOU BUM!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c56cv1t?context=5)|I'm so sorry to hear that. lol.
[Whats your day to day job consist of? Is there any interesting behind the scenes stuff that goes on we probably wouldn't think about?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c568w9a?context=5)|I answered the day to day thing but I will say that the office building is amazing. It has a very WWE ""feel"" to it. The first time I walked into the building, my jaw dropped. I still cant help but smile when I'm walking through the halls. Im such a wrestling nerd and this is pretty much my dream come true.
 |Actually, I think its worth noting that employees have access to the roof and on thursdays there are BBQs =) The view from the roof is beautiful.  Its something I didn't know until I came here.
[Hi neighbor.  (Well, I assume you are working in one of two buildings\).  What is your favorite few places to get lunch around the office?  I'm trying to figure out where I feel like going today.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c56a0he?context=5)|As much as I hate to say it, I have no idea and usually eat in the cafeteria (yuck). Or I bring my own lunch. Sodexo did the food at my college but they got replaced. Just when I thought I'd never have to deal with them again, I come here lol.
[The dirt-sheets have consistently said that Vince changes his mind literally as the wind blows. In the short time you've been there, have you experienced this?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c569src?context=5)|Yes. That is the feeling I have gotten from the few meetings I've been to. I never have meetings with Vince, but the way others talk about him it seems like he changes his mind a lot. The thing is, I honestly think he is a genius for everything he has created. Geniuses are usually eccentric. Mr. McMahon is no exception. 
[The IWC is enamored with Dean Ambrose...whats his buzz like in the Titan Towers?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c56c1n1?context=5)|It's just awesome. Everyone's hard at work and very excited. We are approaching a huge milestone with this 1000th Raw. You didn't hear it from me, but there is going to be an awesome promo spot for the new start time.
[A promo regarding Dean?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c56c3sk?context=5)|No, I really cant tell you who. but it will be gold.
[Awesome?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c56desm?context=5)|Ah I read it wrong. I read ""whats the buzz like"". The people I work around love him also. We also like the Prime Time Players. Darren Young got his start at the wrestling camp that I trained at, so Im always pushing for him.
[No one can convince me that goldberg isnt involved now.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c56ckes?context=5)|Im sorry to hear that lol.
[The IWC will just be hoping it's Dean from this comment and then be disappointed. It will be all your fault :(](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c56cqpt?context=5)|Its actually not.
[Goldust vs cody?!?!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c56drc6?context=5)|Goldust has been future endeavored.
[Was there any proper reason why the Bella's were fired? Man, I liked those girls :3.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c56brl6?context=5)|They weren't fired. They just didn't resign.
[Is there any big angle/story/debut that you know about but you can't tell us? Nothing specific really. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c56b7j0?context=5)|Well it's one that you could all guess but hasn't been confirmed on television. I saw the promo for Summerslam last week. It is centered around Triple H's opponent. (Whoever that may be ;)  ) I knew about the new show Main Event before it was announced as well. I'm not sure about any debuts or anything but I will say that EVERYTHING will change with the 1000th RAW. It's not going to be just a 1 off show with everything going back to normal after. This show is going to change the future of MNR forever.
[RE: Main Event - Is it Superstars with a new name or will it actually have storylines and some of the bigger names in the company?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c56c4ml?context=5)|I guess we'll just have to wait and see. That depends on what the higher ups want.
[I've been a longtime subscriber to Meltzer and Alvarez's Wrestling Observer/Figure Four website, and it's amazing to hear that your job (from a marketing standpoint\) is to keep tabs on dirtsheets, especially considering the tenuious relationship wrestling journalists have had with the industry (stating they were false, lying, changing finishes based on what the smart crowd is expecting them to do, etc\).  From your position in the company, both your boss and your co-workers, what is your opinion on the dirtsheets/wrestling journalists? Do they help the product? Hurt the product? A necessary evil?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c56c88z?context=5)|I use them as a tool. They tell me all the news I need to know about the industry in one place. I could care less about the drama stories (from a work point of view) but the actual substancial news I use. I am personally a fan of the sheets and journalists. I love the bleacher report. Any buzz about the product is good buzz and I dont think they have the power to do any harm.
[Are you there to make a career out of it, or is it just a part-time temporary gig?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c5690ad?context=5)|Right now its part-time. My career goal for my life was to get a bunch of jobs and hopefully work for WWE in some respect. Instead, I am still in college and am starting my career here. I am working with people who were interns here and it led to a full time job. Basically, my goal is to hopefully be hired here full time and never ever leave haha.
[Honestly, does wwe creative steal ideas from r/squared circle?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c56axtd?context=5)|Not that I know of =(
[Now, I'm not going to say the WWE is finding ideas on SquaredCircle, but I am going to point out this comment I made 22 days ago, and well....I think you can see where I'm going with this.  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c56e975?context=5)|Holy Crap! Well done! haha.
[What is your intern position title? what are you going to school for? any special qualifications or ppl you know that got you the job? Does WWE worry about the popularity of UFC.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c569sgx?context=5)|I am an intern for Affiliate Marketing. I got to a college in the bronx for marketing. I didn't know anybody here when I applied, and this is the only place I applied to. I'm just really really lucky. Also, I go to a fairly reputable school and have a lot of knowledge of the product, which the interviewers loved. Of the 20+ interns I met during orientation, only about 2 of them knew anything about our product, which was very strange to me.
[I'm fairly certain I know who this is from reading this AMA. We go to the same school and worked together on a certain Marketing Presentation for a Korean professor this past semester? Haha.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c56akja?context=5)|The dongster!
[What does WWE mainly look for in it's talent? For example if I wanted to get into WWE developmental what would I need? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c56dycd?context=5)|To be a WWE talent you need years of experience, preferably with styles from all around the world. Watch the legends. Use what they did to perfect your skills set. Be willing and humble. After years of training you can pay for a try out at FCW the WWE's developmental territory. I believe they are 1K a try out. Good luck! PS Vince is looking for 6'2 240pounders more or less.
[Looks like I'll just have to train for a long ass time and hopefully not be awful. I'm currently 6'3 and about 175-180lbs with 15% BF at 17 years old, looks like I've still got some work to put in.  I would have thought they would just be looking for great technical wrestlers and mic workers, seen as Punk and Bryan are so over. But I guess they need a nice spread of different builds and styles.  Any idea how much they value technical skill and charisma/mic work? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c56eifo?context=5)|Technical skill and charisma and mic work are all soooo important. Mic work and charisma are the most important, but will get you only so far. Technical skill is important but unfortuantly not as valued as it should be (look at hogan, cena, miz). If you have technical skill and charisma/mic skills you should be set but McMahon is looking for someone with the skills of punk and bryan but with more muscle. He thinks the reason they aren't as over as they can be is because they dont have the ""superstar"" look. Its bullshit, but its what he thinks.
[What has been the response to the leaked pictures of the new WWE championship belt?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c569usr?context=5)|My boss and I don't like it (the pics we saw). But I'm not sure if its the real thing or if it was completed or anything like that.
[It's real. The picture was prior to it being finished.  Seems like there is a disconnect here. I was more interested in knowing how they felt internally about it being leaked, not if people ""liked"" it necessarily.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c56a1uy?context=5)|Ah, sorry about that. I haven't heard anything either way about the issue, so I just told you what I know. I brought it up in a meeting with my boss and he just sort of acknowledged it and we talked about how we didn't really like it.
[Biggest dick you've met backstage?  Literally and figuratively ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c569106?context=5)|A few of the cafeteria workers are assholes. That's it. Everyone else is very nice and made me feel at home.
[Can you explain to me why or how CM Punk is so popular? Also, what the hell was the WWE thinking in bringing back Albert as (Lord\) Tensai?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c56cbnl?context=5)|Punk is popular with fans old and new. He is fairly unique in that aspect. He entertains kids, and makes wrestling fans happy. Good on him.
 |As for Tensai. I was excited when I saw his promo videos. It was a cool idea that just didn't go over. It happens. I was just talking to my friends about how if they just brought him back as A-Train again, the fans would have accepted him as a wrecking ball and he's be main eventing PPVs. His debut was underwhelming.
[Why is the photo cropped so weird?  What is the little black divot to the right of the squared section at the bottom?  It looks like a short row of pixels have been coloured black.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c56cig5?context=5)|The answer to all of these is that the photo was taken with my iphone. I dont know what black dovot you are referring to.
[You said you can shred some light on the 1000th Raw and Summerslam.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c56a2si?context=5)|2) Things are SO crazy here because of SummerSlam AND the 1000th Raw. They are both being treated as huge events and everyone is working hard to make them amazing. 
[2\) This doesn't have to do with either shows, but have you noticed an increased workload/more frenzied pace at Titan Towers with the 3 Hour Raws coming up?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c56a2si?context=5)|1) I haven't heard anything yet but I will let you know if I do (as long as I'm allowed to share) I will say that it will be highly interactive with the fans making decisions that will ACTUALLY impact the show. This is what we've been wanting forever right?
[I think many people are skeptical about WWE being interactive because of speculation that they doctor the polls. can you speak to this at all?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c56bm0d?context=5)|If that happened in the past, it wont happen with this. With the voting PPVs, creative always had the final say. With this, I am told the WWE Universe will directly effect the outcome. There will be polls and whatever you vote on WILL effect the show.
[Fan from the west coast here:  I know RAW tapes live on the east coast.  Is there any way that they can sometimes make is so that it airs live on both coasts for the shows that are interactive?  It kinda sucks because the voting for interactive shows are over whenever I watch the show.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c56dg0f?context=5)|I have no idea. These are kinks that will have to be worked out when the show debuts.
[I first saw you post on Cenas make a wish thread.  Another Fan mentioned his brother in law having an illness and a huge fan of Cena. He stated his brother keeps himself positive through Cenas mottos.  Is there any way or channels we can get this guy to meet Cena?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c56dshb?context=5)|I will talk to my boss today and see what he says. It's possible all of that stuff is done through Make A Wish, but I will see.
[If you look at what the internet is saying, make sure to check the Best and Worst of Raw out. One of my favourite reads.  Link to withleather.uproxx.com.  Do you have to be an insider or have certain connections to work with the WWE? You said yourself you trained to be a superstar, so did that help?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c56chix?context=5)|No, not at all. I did not mention my training in my interview. As with any job, knowing people obviously will help. But I didn't know anybody nor pull any strings. I simply applied and here I am =)
[Do WWE track your calls and monitor your browsing?  Does Vince really like those steak sandwiches smothered in ketchup?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c56cn2h?context=5)|I dont know. To all of those questions lol.
[So from a marketing perspective is there any reason why UFC has been successfully running pay-per-views in Canada, but WWE has barely been coming up here at all recently?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c56cql8?context=5)|I have no idea why we dont do more international shows. An educated guess would be that most of our fans are in the US and it is cheaper to do shows here. The UFC is doing a great job expanding world wide. I love watching the company grow. 
[God... are you gonna lose your job over this?  Anyway, uhm....  New WWE title belt coming?  How'd you get the job/what did you major in?  Is it more stressful then you'd ever imagined?  Does WWE pay any attention to the internet?  Have you checked out /r/squaredcircle ?  You might get a kick out of it.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c56d4ol?context=5)|I answered all of these except for one. This job is not stressful. It is everything I have ever wanted. The office is laid back and business casual. Everyone seems friendly and respectful. 
[Ever seen Vince at his nuttiest?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c56ckwj?context=5)|I've never seen him. Or Steph for that matter, and I'm by her office quite often.
[Does the WWE do drug testing and is drug abuse a problem? Medicals, amphetamines, steroids etc.  If not, do you think many wrestlers take pills etc?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c56d4n7?context=5)|WWE has an extensive Wellness Policy. For more information, check the website.
[Any progress on WWE Network plans?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c56cwnd?context=5)|There are 4 business models being considered. With Summerslam and Raw 1000 and WWE Network everything is kind of busy and stressful around here. WWE Network plans are hush hush which actually sucks if you are an affiliate marketer because when the affiliate companies ask us for a PPV line up for next year, we don't have them as soon as we typically do.
[How did u apply for your job mate?   and do you know if wwe gives any internships?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c56ayos?context=5)|I've answered this a few times but the availability of jobs and internships is constantly in flux, keep checking the wwe's corporate website for jobs that you could apply for. They have many offices across the world. [Link to corporate.wwe.com](http://corporate.wwe.com/careers/index.js) Cheers!
[How did you get this job? What did you do to apply?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c569vs8?context=5)|I applied on the corporate website.
[What were the requirements?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c56a06k?context=5)|I had to be a Junior in College and it had to be for credit. And I had to be a marketing major, but that was because of the specific internship. Anyone who is interested should constantly look at the corporate site for job or internship info. With the development of the WWE network, they are probably going to be hiring a few hundred more people.
[Ever heard Joey Styles screaming OH MY GOD!!! ?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c56dh6y?context=5)|No, but he works near me.
[Did you have any involvement with the parody Twitter accounts being shut down? Do you have any opinion of them or anything interesting to share about the shut down/comments they make? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c56e5zs?context=5)|I have nothing to do with them. thats all the legal department. I love them.
[I have been wondering if the set design is done internally or by an outside company for a while.  If it's done internally how do they draft it?  Is it a lot of drawing, 3D modeling, clay structures, 3D printing?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c56atdt?context=5)|Sorry, but I have no idea. I am but a lowly marketing intern lol.
[No worries!  I'll substitute that question with another then.  What is Brock Lesnar's actual employment status, as well as Paul Heyman?  Will Heyman be a guest manager over the next few weeks at all?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c56b4cu?context=5)|Lesnar is contracted. He works a limited number of dates though, so Paul Heyman will be (and has been) taking his place in promos. Which I love. Look for Brock to be on the 1000th show and Summerslam.
[Are there any career opportunities available to you post-internship? when do you finish school?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c56bqnp?context=5)|I have 2 (possibly 1) semester(s) left of school. Then, who knows. If they like me hopefully I get offered a job.
[Will they send you to any of the shows, especially Summerslam or the 1000th Raw?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c56dmhh?context=5)|They are sending people, but not me. Im just an intern. But if I get a job here its possible. Employees can get ticket comps and discounts on merchandise.

[Ok, cool. I'll try and get my foot in the door. Now by ""for credit"" that means unpaid, just for credit? Because as much as I'd love to do this I don't know how I'd sustain a living there when I'd have to pay for a place to stay for the internship, afford food and such, etc.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c56e58t?context=5)|Unpaid.

(Like one site is considered more legitimate than another.\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c56a5kj?context=5)|I basically just look at 3 or 4 sites a day. A lot of them repeat. I like lordsofpain but I cant comment on any site's legitimacy.

vtfju,4,2012-06-29,"My story. 
Back to the drawing board after 8 years of confusion.",sarrybaterson,NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/vtfju/my_story_back_to_the_drawing_board_after_8_years/,"I’ve been posting for a while on here but haven’t been feeling a very strong connection with this community, perhaps telling my story will help with this.

I’m a 22 year old guy, lived in the states all my life, my username is a variation of my real name, yeah didn’t put much thought into it heh.

The main reason I started this is because like most of us I could use the inspiration and motivation to meet my goals, my love life being front and center. My problems with females started way back when I was like 14, I was home schooled, and though I have no regrets about it and it provided me with many things it also cut down many chances of a social life, combine that with being very shy, awkward, overweight, happy to spend huge amounts of time on my own, and different from the home schooler stereotype (we never really fit in home schooling groups)  I had no social life through my entire childhood and early teen years.

So when I was 14 or there abouts I became curious and blindly turned to the internet as a way to meet people, and promptly I became overly attached to a girl from a member based music site, in my youthful ignorance I found myself longing for a relationship with this girl I barely knew, it gave me something to do with all of the confusing and amplified emotions most people have at that age, also there were painful issues developing in my family that I’m sure contributed, my parents splitting, my older sister’s drug abuse, the birth of my niece and ensuing custody battle.

So one day in the midst of all this, just searching for some kind of relief I plucked up the courage to tell her how I felt over text, and of course I received a very kindly worded rejection. It was at this point that I started thinking of girls as something out of my reach, I hadn’t yet learned to handle most general life problems, so I deeply internalized anything that went wrong as my failure, or that for some reason I didn’t deserve the things that I wanted, combine this with the fact that I was very religious in those days (with no pressure from my parents or anyone) I saw fornication or anything related as dirty and evil.

It was around then I got my own laptop as a birthday present and promptly began struggling with porn, it became an extremely powerful drug, during the day I would make grand speeches to myself about never doing it again (I can’t let god down, the whole 9 yards) and then at night I’d be back in my room completely overmatched by my depressed state, my age, and the urges, I would do whatever I could think of to stop, even writing to random girls on myspace trying to get a date (yeah I was clueless) and when nothing ever worked out and I was back in my room again caving to urges, I began cutting as a way to get back at myself, or to see that justice was served. 

Fast forward to about 17 years old, as the issues with my family continued to get worse, I became angry, doubt for my faith grew and grew, I listened to slipknot, I started lifting (still a therapeutic passion of mine) I lost  like 50 pounds, joined a youth group, met my best friend, which helped me a lot but I still couldn’t get a girlfriend for one reason or another, just didn’t know what to say or how to act to get my intentions across, my teen angst continued to grow.

Fast forward to 20, I was offered a position as an intern at a youth hostel, interns would live at the building, have our own rooms, and take care of whatever business was required, such as front desk work, cleaning etc. After being there for maybe 5 months once again I found myself in another dysfunctional relationship situation, but this time with another intern, she was older than me, and even though she knew how I felt about her she would use me for a shoulder to cry on, and for physical comfort, she was mentally unstable and extremely needy which was probably the biggest reason I fell for her, one minute she loved me, the next she hated me, she was a charity case. It became very ugly, I was drinking heavily on a nightly basis, smoking, cutting like never before (I now have very visible scars I hope to get removed someday) 
Towards the end of my stay there I had a very short relationship with a girl I met online, she broke up with me after a month, never really said why.


I retuned home from my internship a changed man, still angry, still had strong feelings for both women, but even though I knew it would take years to recover I knew I learned something, I learned that throughout my experiences I was never in control, I was outraged, I was broken, but I was never in control.
I’ve learned that I was always thinking of myself as the victim, and that things would not change until I changed my thinking about myself, and started doing things on my own terms, so my friends, my journey has lead me here, I’m still learning, but now I can say with pride that I’m aware of what it’s gonna take to get the things I want, and I’m willing to step up to the plate and try my best.

“So you can lock yourself away, give up, forget, go back to sleep, or you can realize that there is so much more to life than yesterday.”

My notes are one of the biggest and heaviest things in my bag, and if I could get a note taking device I could downgrade to a smaller bag.

I've been considering either a Thinkpad tablet or an Asus Eee Note EA800. Both tablets have their pros and cons, especially with the Eee Note, as it can be very hard to find. The Thinkpad tablet has received mixed reviews and is more expensive than the Eee Note, but I feel like it may be easier to use.

 Does anyone have any experience with either of these devices and can give me an impression of them? I've looked at a writing tablet attachment for my laptop too, but a couple of my professors don't allow laptops."

I know the answer to this question is to build a pc, however, we are in college and due to the shitty job market, he had to take an unpaid internship. (brilliant guy who is working for a subsidiary for the CDC)  Therefore building a brand new pc is out of the question even with me offering to donate pretty much everything other than mobo and cpu for him.

So basically he wants to just be able to run this game at low settings. He doesn't care if it looks pretty, he just wants to be able to run it. In his system settings he told me that it says that he is running ""Intel HD"" graphics. I'm assuming that means the GMA HD Graphics. He wants this to be as cheap as possible because he is already kind of cringing at the cost of the game itself.

I tried to upgrade the desktop that he has at his mom's place and got him a 520 gt but his motherboard wouldn't support it. He is only there for another month and he can't take the desktop with him back to college, so I am trying to figure out a way that he can play this game on his laptop so he can play this game for more than a month. Any advice for my friend here? Thanks!"

My husband and I live about 8 hours away from where my mother lives. We are both attending school where we live and decided to come down and stay with her for the summer due to him getting an internship in her town. She is the only one that we know in her town that we could stay with. Plus, she would be able to spend a lot of time with her 3 year old grandchild she never gets to see during the year.

Now, my husband and mother have never really liked each other, but they can manage to get along for the most part. We have been staying with her now for about a month and a half and things have been going smooth until just the other night when my mother came out of the bathroom upset over how the toilet looked. Now, I do a lot around the house when I'm not working and I don't ask my husband to do a whole lot because he has his internship plus working a part time job for a pay check. Would I like him do do more, yes.

Any way, she come out of the bathroom upset, not yelling, but upset about the toilet. Right away my husband starts to yell back and things just escalated from there.

Now I have the both of them coming to me with the issues they have with each other expecting me to do something about it. My mother loves to tell me everything that she can't stand about my husband and all my husband does is ask me if Ive stood up for him to her or not.

I just need some advice on hon how to make the rest of our trip more bearable so I can keep my sanity.

Thanks all


UPDATE

Thank you all so much for your advice. I am glad to say that last night my mother and husband sat down together and had a civil conversation about their problems with out any screaming or name calling. There was give and take from both of them and they were both willing to admit where they had been wrong. i myself, stayed in another room with my son while they did this because this was something that they had to work out by themselves. With the advice that I had been given, I learned that if I was sitting there with them, they would put me right back in the middle of things. So, thank you again. "
vt0bt,6,2012-06-29,Keeping outdated projects in a portfolio?,[deleted],webdev,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/vt0bt/keeping_outdated_projects_in_a_portfolio/,"I'm a CS student starting my senior year this fall. I got into webdev a little over a year ago. My school sticks to traditional CS topics and doesn't really have anything specifically focused on web development, so I've been largely self-taught. I've completed a few projects, which I've added to a psuedo-portfolio that I can show employers. 


Since starting my internship doing PHP development this summer, I've been learning a lot more about good practices, design patterns, frameworks, etc. In short - how to actually code decently well, which is something my independent projects are definitely lacking.


So should I go for quality or quantity in my portfolio projects? My options at this point are basically:

-Update what I have, which would be take basically a full (albiet faster with a framework) rewrite of several projects.

-Cut the shitty projects from my portfolio entirely, leaving me with a distressingly low number of remaining ones.

-Keep the shitty projects as they are, at least giving me some content, and ideally illustrating a progression of what I've learned.


Any advice?

vsq90,2,2012-06-29,"Am I just headed in the same dead-end direction? Or worse... the same abusive direction? (Irish men, alert for you)",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/vsq90/am_i_just_headed_in_the_same_deadend_direction_or/,"I would apologize for this being long… but from what I’ve seen, ALL these relationship things are long, so you guys probably expect it by now :)
 

I’m currently in a long-distance relationship-ish thing with an Irish guy (we will call him Seamus). I’m American, 23, he is 22. We met a year ago while he was studying abroad, and had a relationship with the understanding he was leaving in a few months, and then simply parted ways. I sorta assumed that we would never see each other again, but definitely still had feelings for him. We kept talking online every day. During the fall, we kept getting seemingly closer rather than drawing apart so I mentioned that there was a possibility that I could get an externship for the next summer in Ireland (I’m in grad school). He seemed ecstatic about the idea, so I arranged it, and visited over Christmas/New Years to set up the internship. Everything went well, I met many of his friends, and so I planned out the externship. Fast forward through the spring, during which time we continued to Skype often and chat every day, even if to just check in. I’m in Ireland, doing my externship for nine weeks. Aaaand here we get to the issue.

 
What the hell are we?! And yes… I know I should ask HIM. But before I take that step, I want to make sure that I want to know. Because if he considers us a serious gf/bf relationship and we talk about it, at that point it becomes real. I was with somebody who was very controlling for 3 years, and at the end he became physically abusive enough to send me to hospital with broken ribs, followed by a massively messy breakup. I’m not keen to get into something like that again, and as such have taken to maintaining… distance… in relationships so I always have an easy out. Not necessarily healthy, I know, but it makes me feel more secure and like I can take my time to know someone and learn to trust them. His cousins and friends introduced me as ‘Seamus’ Girlfriend’ but Seamus himself never has. I think his hesitancy to ‘stake a claim’ is an Irish male trait from what I’ve gathered (Irish men, thoughts?). There have also been pictures of him on fb kissing another girl, back in the fall. I brought it up to him as an ‘I know about it’ sort of situation, and then dropped it since that happened before we planned on my coming for the externship and at that point, there were no plans for us to ever meet up again. More recently, there was some fb activity of his friends teasing him about being a player, which kinda bothered me but I ignored as he said they were just giving him a bad time. He has told me that he hasn’t slept with anyone else since we met last summer, and I’m inclined to believe him (a because I want to and b because it’s kinda hard to get laid in Ireland as a guy lol). 


The problem is, my past makes me suspicious. I’ve told Irish Guy about the past boyfriend, and how I am concerned about being hurt like that again. And Seamus is a very nice man. I’ve met his family (twice now) and stayed at their house. We spend every day together outside of work hours (I’m living at his house for the summer, with my own room but essentially just keeping my clothes there and sleeping in his) and go out together and do things together. We have differences, sure… not exactly the same in interests or opinions, but we overlap enough to have loads of fun. It’s just that sometimes he gets slightly more physically aggressive than I’m truly comfortable with. Not in the bedroom, ever (he is more laid back and hardly aggressive at all there) but in playing around and such… and I’m afraid to that I’m simply over-reacting because of my past. I mean, I used to play around snapping people with towels and it was fine, so I’m guessing I’m just trying to weird myself out. Or do I attract aggressive men and have the bad luck to find out about it later? Or is this normal and I’m freaking out? And how do I bring it up without being a bad person and basically making it sound like I think he is abusing me or I’m some damaged weirdo? GAH. 


All of that, plus us being across the world from each other and both in Grad programs makes it hard. Someone would have to leave their home country and go to the other person’s country in the eventuality of a serious relationship, which is an awful lot to ask.


So. Now that I’ve word vomited everywhere in a rather random fashion… what do you, the faceless internet, think? Should I be putting myself out there with this guy, or should I listen to my possibly broken instincts and just take this as a summer fling thing and not inquire further? Men, input on the best way to go about it without seeming like a typical girl saying “omg, where r we in this?”. Any advice in general? Seamus seems to be very fond of me, his friends and parents all seem to like me despite the fact that I feel like I’m tagging along sometimes (ah, the joys of being in a foreign country where you know one person… rofl). 


Thanks for reading all the way through :D Those of you down at the end here, have a [cookie](http://static.fjcdn.com/comments/And+you+vici+an+internet+cookie+for+it+_0056550cf610ab9cf1e50e156ed38c8a.jpg). Snickerdoodles available on request. 

TL;DR Unsure if I should take a relationship to a more serious level, and is that unsureness because of a past bad experience or because of common sense?"

vs85u,13,2012-06-29,Just need to rant; very very long,[deleted],BabyBumps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BabyBumps/comments/vs85u/just_need_to_rant_very_very_long/,"The past year has been insane and nonstop. We (my boyfriend and I) have been struggling to make ends meet since I've been pregnant. We've always struggled, but normally I'm working while we struggle. We've had to scrounge and beg, and get loans and gifts from reddit, friends, and family to make ends meet. Hell, we still haven't paid rent for this month because we're waiting on this scamming place to pay us for the work we've been doing. I haven't been able to afford the doctos bills, but I can't get medicaid because our employment has been less than legit and I can't even begin to explain how complicated it all is. It's nothing we've done. They're just completely unprofessional, and a horrible ""business"". They don't keep track of paperwork, and none of their shit matches ours as far as invoices and paystubs go. Even in the contract he signed he's not suppose to tell anyone that he works for them, share information (emails, paystubs, etc) It's just a nightmare and it's caused me so much stress. I can't even explain to his parents why I haven't gotten it yet, which has caused more stress. 

My biological mother has been harassing me because I refuse to communicate with them. (Abusive family, etc). And my boyfriends family has been crushing me with family-ness. I've never had family that actually treated me like family, and now they're treating me like one of theirs. It's not something I should be complaining about, but I don't know how to react to half the shit they do. Which puts me in an awkward position. They want to get all up in my business, and tell me how to do things, like what family does, but I'm feeling constricted; it's like I'm losing control of my life. I'm not use to people telling me what to do, or what I should do. Wanting to know everything I've done and keeping tabs on my life. And scolding me when things don't go how they want. I already know that tomorrow is going to be a fucking nightmare bc I'm going to miss my doctors appointment. (Can't find a ride). And his stepmother is going to ride my ass about missing it. But there's nothing I can do. 

Now, this week my boyfriend got hired onto a very cushy career paying him more money than I can even imagine. My whole life has been a struggle, and now we're being handed a golden goose. We're going to go from struggling to pay bills and eating on a regular basis, to making what we've been making in a month in a week. It's such an overwhelming thing for me. I don't even know what to do, or say... What should be the second or third happiest day of my life has become this horrible vortex of emotional hell. We're in this limbo between being horrendously poor (which is what I've always been use to) and unbelievably comfortable and being able to afford everything we need and more. I should feel so blessed, but I have NO idea what in the hell to do with money. And the long hours and commute means I get 4 hours a night with my boyfriend, 2 after he finishes his after work internet dates with his coworker and best friend. I'm just lonely, I guess, and things won't be as bad after we move (another stress/ blessing bc he wants to move ASAP, but there is very little that I can do as far as packing and moving atm. Not to mention it totally fucks my pregnancy plan bc I'll be two hours away from the doctor I'm currently seeing) 

There's just so much going on, and I feel like I'm being pulled into every direction imaginable... I really don't have anyone to talk to... I just feel so overwhelmed. Maybe it's just the pregnancy making this all seem so much more extreme than it is... I dunno. I should feel happy, but I honestly just feel miserable and exhausted with no sense of direction or control over anything. 


Edit: I was so afraid that everyone was going to down on me for being upset and call me crazy; but y'all totally get it! Thank you for all of your kind words and advice!

 I'm going to sit down and have a serious talk with him about the money situation, again, because y'all worded things much more clearly than I can atm :P I'm not concerned that he won't spend on baby, bc he's VERY excited about that, but I think he's just getting FAR too excited about it all. (ie: wanting to go from spending $400 a month on rent to $1000+, buying the new car, and everything else) and I think he'll get it after we talk. I just want to save ourselves a nice cushion in case something does happen, so we're not completely fucked. $4000+ A month is A LOT compared to what we've been living on, but it's really not going to amount to much after we have to pay out of pocket for the babies delivery, doctors bills, and the new place and all the deposits, getting things for baby, etc. Not to mention, we live in a small town where things are fairly cheap, and now we're moving to the city where the cost of living is going to skyrocket compared to where we are now. Another daunting reality. I've never lived, nor drove in a big city, and now we're moving to the state capitol. Any other time I would be excited about the change, but trying to find a new home in a place I've never been, adjust to the idea of living in the city, on top of adjusting to the baby, a finding a new doctor and birthing plan, packing, still maintaining the household we currently live in, AND not having my sidekick beside me as much as usual to go threw all of this with me is kind of driving me mental. He's getting the awesome end of the deal. He may work the long hours, but it's in his cushy office with his interns, lack of management, and his unlimited amount of free time and fresh coffee. The stress if VERY minimal. While he expects me just to whip this all together with no real support except the financial kind. He won't even discuss this with me he just says, ""You deal with it."" or ""You work it out"" and it's damn near impossible when I have no phone, no car, and no real idea of what in the hell he's really looking for in a home or a doctor. He gives me all the decisions, but none at all because the second I mention what I want he turns it down and says that it's not what he wants. I could strangle a man. I, actually, threw a fit like a little teenager yesterday and locked myself in the bedroom for the whole night bc he wasn't listening to what I was trying to explain. Every time I would try to explain why I was upset, I'd start crying and he'd go off about how being pregnant doesn't entitle me to be completely irrational and cry all the time. He's one of the smartest men I know, and he's completely dense when it comes to things that everyone else understands. 

 I'm also going to have a conversation with his step mother the next time I go over to their place and just explain my family background into a little more depth, and explain that she's making me very uncomfortable by prying into my life and then scolding me like a child when things don't go her way. I've lived my entire life on my own, or taking care of people; having the scenario switched is very overwhelming and confusing. We (her son and I) are going threw some major changes, and on top of the pregnancy, I just can't handle the extra pressure atm. She's a very hard headed nurse, so I'm going to have to go in with complete confidence and a firm hand about it or she'll eat me alive, but I can do it :]

vs7fo,0,2012-06-29,"Am I getting a mid-life crisis? 27 y/o friends going away, no motivation, no direction in life...",nimchip,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/vs7fo/am_i_getting_a_midlife_crisis_27_yo_friends_going/,"I'm sorry Reddit, I know there are a lot of posts about this but I just need to vent. And sorry for the length.

I am 27 year old computer engineer who is employed and lives with his parents. I am a virgin, sometimes I'm sociable and sometimes not. I find it hard to make friends, or real contacts. I find it completely difficult to talk to girls.

In college I fell into a deep depression, I felt truly alone. I had friends but I didn't really fancy going to hang out with them. My high school classmates never called me like they did those friends. I suspect because I tried to be ""friends"" with everyone that I didn't actually connect but with 2 of them. Everything seems superficial at best. I was nice to everyone and everyone was nice to me, but nobody ever called me. Those that did I quickly grew tired of their antics. My neighbor started to hang out with other people that didn't really click with me. My roommates did the same.

I dropped out of college because they didn't allow me to switched engineering concentrations and thus I transferred to a different campus. This is when it hit. I had to stay with my parents because it was closest. I just spent time on my computer every single night. It was frustrating and a suicidal time.

I beat my suicidal urges by focusing on my family. I would hate to break their hearts by doing or thinking about it. That made that stop.

Then suddenly I hung out with a friend's older brother and I met some super wonderful people through him that I've hung out consistently with for about 3 years. I really learned a lot from them both socially, psychologically and from the countless discussions we had about philosophy, religion, politics and general life (also microbrewed beer and a lot of social drinking). I also graduated shortly after I met them. We traveled a lot to FL to meet with the friend that had the older brother. It was and still is hella fun.

I learned that it was ok to be alone though some of them have GFs and whatnot. Their GFs are amazing people and I can say that having female friends was something I needed after all that. I hadn't had a female contact since High School. These friends have made it easy to actually talk to their female friends, but since I've been so ok with being alone my expectations for a relationship have skyrocketed to the fact that I want someone that can actually hold a conversation with me and not be a superficial moron (while still being sort of attractive I guess) whereas before I would have been satisfied with a girl just being cute.

Then after 1 or 2 years of searching for a job I finally found one. I was hired as an intern but then grew to be a full blown software consultant. After 1 year in work, my project is finally going live.

But now I feel... numb. I feel like I don't know what to do with my life. These friends I met are suddenly trying to find work in the states and want to move. One of them already is leaving next week. I feel like I'm gonna lose them, and go back to how it was during college. I feel like work is getting stale, boring, is too corporate-y and I haven't had any real relationships with my coworkers. My friends continuously tell me to move to the states since pay is a thousand times better.... but I can't. I feel like if I do that I will suddenly be alone again, but at the same time if I stay here I will be alone because they will move away. I don't know what to do with my career. I don't know what to do with my social life in the future. I feel like I won't have as good friends as I've had for these last years.

So these past few weeks I've been having depressive episodes... but not quite like I used to have, it's just more a ""I'm bored with everything, I wish I could do stuff, I wish I could hang out, I wish I could be more comfortable at my job, or look for something that is less corporate, and more importantly I wish I could meet friends as good as they are just in case they leave"". I have absolutely no motivation anymore.


Once again, sorry reddit. And sorry for the long post. This will most likely not be read by anyone but that's ok. The point was to vent.

TL;DR - bored with everything, my friends are going away slowly and thus I will be lonely yet again, and finally just feeling numb. No direction, no motivation in my life anymore. Terrible talking to girls, etc etc SAP."
vs75i,84,2012-06-29,It's The Little Things,monkeybiziu,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/vs75i/its_the_little_things/,"While I was in college, I had an internship in the Tier 2 tech support department at a fairly well known retail management company in my hometown. Along with supporting all of our remote users (we had properties all over the country) we supported the ones in the home office as well.

Once day a ticket comes through from the Tier 1 group. Someone has spilled a drink on their keyboard, and now the computer won't turn on. I figure it's just a keyboard issue, so I grab a spare and head up to her desk.

I get up there, and she actually did a pretty decent job cleaning up the mess. I swapped out the keyboard, went to turn on the system, and nothing happened. No monitor, no tower, no nothing. I'm now curious, as she didn't spill anything on the tower or monitor.

I start checking all the connections, and everything's fine, but the system won't even power on. I had one of the other tech's bring up a replacement tower and monitor to see if I had missed something. We plugged it in to the power strip, tried to power it on, and nothing happened.

I end up crawling under the desk to see if we had missed something. Suddenly, the answer was as clear as day.

In her haste to keep her computer from being damaged after her drink spill, this lady had unplugged the power strip. Then, once she cleaned up, she plugged it back in. To itself.

I quickly deduced that this was probably the issue, plugged the power strip back into the wall, and magically everything booted just fine.

Sometimes, it's easy to get lost in obvious details and forget that the little things can be just as bad."
vs66x,0,2012-06-29,Problems with my husband and mother,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/vs66x/problems_with_my_husband_and_mother/,"At first I thought about putting this in the relationship subreddit, because I have a relationship with them both, but then thought Askreddit would be better.

So here is my story/background.

My husband and I live about 8 hours away from where my mother lives. We are both attending school where we live and decided to come down and stay with her for the summer due to him getting an internship in her town. She is the only one that we know in her town that we could stay with. Plus, she would be able to spend a lot of time with her 3 year old grandchild she never gets to see during the year.

Now, my husband and mother have never really liked each other, but they can manage to get along for the most part. We have been staying with her now for about a month and a half and things have been going smooth until just the other night when my mother came out of the bathroom upset over how the toilet looked. Now, I do a lot around the house when I'm not working and I don't ask my husband to do a whole lot because he has his internship plus working a part time job for a pay check. Would I like him do do more, yes. 

Any way, she come out of the bathroom upset, not yelling, but upset about the toilet. Right away my husband starts to yell back and things just escalated from there. 

Now I have the both of them coming to me with the issues they have with each other expecting me to do something about it. My mother loves to tell me everything that she can't stand about my husband and all my husband does is ask me if Ive stood up for him to her or not.

I just need some advice on hon how to make the rest of our trip more bearable so I can keep my sanity. 

Thanks all "
vrwxu,3,2012-06-28,Is the change to a looser immigration laws for poor refugees a fait accompli in Australia?,otterplay,australia,https://www.reddit.com/r/australia/comments/vrwxu/is_the_change_to_a_looser_immigration_laws_for/,"I've just been hearing the news about my how own country - the USA - has just solidly started down the pathway toward the practice of every other developed Western country - where it provides a socialised medicine program - with our supreme court upholding the right for the federal government to tax those who don't wish to buy health insurance from private companies.

It seems to me that the current debate in Australia about boat people is analagous, in that Australia is the only country so xenophobic that it doesn't want to let poor refugees from conflict areas into its country, even though it will at the same time welcome with open arms rich people arriving on planes who wish to embark on the immigration process.

I don't know any other Western country, or English-speaking country, that interns people who are seeking refugee status... and it would be considered beyond the pale anywhere in any of these countries for a person to argue that you should ""turn around"" rickety boats which are full of refugees heading for your country's shores.

Is this how Australia makes social progress when it starts feeling that it needs to catch up with the rest of the world? Is it so that both major parties adamantly insist that they want what the common and misguided sensibilities of the country demand - but then they just can't bring themselves to actually implement that policy?

Christine Milne made a wonderful speech on the floor of the Senate a day or two ago which brought quintessentially Australian social mores to bear on the topic.

Will her voice, along with deadlock between the right and the left, prevail? Given how modern Australian history has progressed over the past hundred years, do you think that it is likely that we're on the cusp of a huge and progressive change in policy?"

[Mr. Zerban, your opponent has gotten a lot of attention for his budget plans for the country.  Where do you agree or disagree with him and why?  If you got to introduce your own budget, what would you focus on?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vsx69/i_am_rob_zerban_challenger_to_rep_paul_ryan_in/c57c4ty?context=5)|First, I think I should point out that the Ryan Budget, is really more of an ideological document than it is a budget. It lacks numbers. Makes assumptions. Very few details.
 |I oppose turning Medicare into a voucher program. I oppose tax credits for already profitable oil corporations. I oppose extension of the Bush tax cuts. I oppose the privatization of Social Security. I oppose cutting Pell Grants.
 |I grew up in a single parent home where my mother struggled to make ends meet. I ate government cheese at home and free lunch and milk at school. I was only able to get a higher education with the help of Pell Grants and Stafford Loans. Because my government made a small investment in me, I was able to go on to start two small businesses and employ 45 people (who earned living wages and health benefits). Without my country making a small investment in me, I wouldn't have been able to live my version of the American dream. Ryan says these programs don't work - but I'm proof they do. 
[DO you oppose cuts to pell grants or not increasing pell grants (which they call a cut\) or both. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vsx69/i_am_rob_zerban_challenger_to_rep_paul_ryan_in/c57gmf0?context=5)|Both.
[How will you guarantee that you won't be swayed by special interests,lobbyists, or party pressure?  How will YOU personally guarantee that you will be transparent, no last minute, Backdoor deals Rushed through congress without public opportunity to scrutinize, and no other sleazy behavior?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vsx69/i_am_rob_zerban_challenger_to_rep_paul_ryan_in/c57bxqs?context=5)|2/3) Honestly, I don't know. I've taken strong stands and haven't always fallen into line with the Democratic establishment. If I fall into some DC trap and end up rolling around with lobbyists, I'd hope the people would vote me out of office. For me, this campaign for Congress is just as much about process reform as it is policy reform, and that's why my legislative agenda will be guided by constituent committees and not DC think tanks and lobbying firms.

 |The ACA was a step in the right direction, but the premise for its creation was flawed. We have a healthcare problem, not a health insurance problem; so we need to approach the problem by first asking how we can achieve the best healthcare outcomes, not by first asking how we can get everyone to buy an insurance plan. 
[What do you think about the Supreme Court decision yesterday? What are you healthcare plans?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vsx69/i_am_rob_zerban_challenger_to_rep_paul_ryan_in/c57c95f?context=5)|The ACA is a step in the right direction, however I support a single-payer system. I was disappointed that single-payer models were never explored.

Corporations are not people and money is not speech. 
[In your view, what's the correct way to get rid of Citizen's United?  Constitutional convention?  I just can't picture congress passing legislature.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vsx69/i_am_rob_zerban_challenger_to_rep_paul_ryan_in/c57c7ua?context=5)|Constitutional Amendment. A convention will likely be needed, but in the short-term we need to start electing candidates that support publicly funded elections.
 |Post Citizens United, more people have become aware of the influence of money in democratic process and how it corrupts our system... I hope this issue reaches a tipping point sooner than later.
[With the national recognition Rep. Paul Ryan is building for himself (budget plan, potential VP candidate, etc.\), how does this affect your confidence and ability in running against him?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vsx69/i_am_rob_zerban_challenger_to_rep_paul_ryan_in/c57d1z9?context=5)|I'm undeterred. It's become pretty clear that Ryan is going to use this district as a stepping stone to something else. People in the district see that he's spending less time in Wisconsin and more time in television studios and jetting around the country to raise money for Mitt Romney. It's difficult for him to make the case that he's working for the people of southeast Wisconsin when he's rarely here. 
[U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan, R-WI. has a ""D"" rating by the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America 2010 Congressional Report Card.  How do you feel about supporting the Veteran's?  It was in Wikipedia that Congressman Ryan was 16 years old when he found his father in bed, dead from a heart attack at age 55.  Do you know if the congressman and his family collected Social Security Survivor Benefits even though he was from a wealthy family?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vsx69/i_am_rob_zerban_challenger_to_rep_paul_ryan_in/c57ettu?context=5)|Ryan's position on Veteran care is appalling - he supports spending more money on bombs and less on soldiers and their families.
 |Ryan did collect Social Security benefits at age 16. In the past, he's said he saved the money to help pay for college. The system worked for him, so it's curious when he works to deprive others of the same benefits he has received. 
[Welcome back. Do you feel the failure to recall Scott Walker hurt your campaign any?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vsx69/i_am_rob_zerban_challenger_to_rep_paul_ryan_in/c57cudy?context=5)|I do not. Democratic performance improved in my district, when comparing the 2010 and 2012 results. My district is also home to the successful State Senate recall that gave control of the Senate to the Democrats. I think the results in the southeastern corner of the state were promising for November.

I appreciate your patience and understanding.  
[Obviously, social media has become an important tool in campaigning. I see that you have accounts on various sites (Facebook, Twitter, Apparent ""Spam Emails"" etc.\) but, so does your competitors.

I'm glad to hear you're doing well.  How's your staffing going?   What are your internals looking like these days?  Most importantly, what would you say is the number one thing you wish you knew when you started your campaign that you know now?  Godspeed, take Ryan down.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vsx69/i_am_rob_zerban_challenger_to_rep_paul_ryan_in/c57el4i?context=5)|Things are going really well and we're building momentum. We've raised over $1 million already, which is more than Ryan's last 6 challengers combined. We recently launched our field program, which we're very excited about. Lots of interns have joined us in the last few weeks, and they have been a huge help (thanks!). 
[The last time i saw Ryan do a town hall meeting he was almost run out on a rail.  basically being called out on his insane balance the budget plan.  do you conduct town hall meetings?  and how are you received? good luck to you!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vsx69/i_am_rob_zerban_challenger_to_rep_paul_ryan_in/c57cb7n?context=5)|I don't have town halls meetings, per se. We have done a campaign rally in every county and they were very well attended. I do speak to a lot of groups. I do a lot of interviews. I try to talk with everyone. I try to be available to everyone. In general I believe I'm well received.
 |Ryan's town hall meetings, which are calls ""listening sessions"" are comical. He basically gives a 30-40 minute power point presentation, and then allows his constituents ask questions for 20 minutes. They should be called ""lecturing sessions"" ...
 |Edit: spelling 
[Mr. Zerban, what do you expect to do for the young voters of America, if you get elected? Personally, I believe that the young voters (like me!\) would come out in droves for someone who ACTUALLY would be fighting for us, as opposed to just trying to keep us okay with them while they get the older vote. So, what makes you the candidate for reddit's demographic?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vsx69/i_am_rob_zerban_challenger_to_rep_paul_ryan_in/c57e4gf?context=5)|Well, I don't know. It's up to redditors to decide if I'm the candidate for them. A congressional district has over 700,000 people, so your going to need to equitably represent people of all ages.
 |It's sad but true, young people are often discounted by politicians. They have relatively little money and influence, and they don't consistently vote. But there is hope! Young people are becoming more organized online, and traditional barriers to getting involved and active are breaking down. Think about what young people on reddit and the greater online community were able to do with the SOPA protests... imagine if young people replicated that effort for other issues, imagine if they did it every 3 months.
[Just a small follow up. So what would you do to make sure that the youth know that you aren't passing them over?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vsx69/i_am_rob_zerban_challenger_to_rep_paul_ryan_in/c57gmjn?context=5)|Decisions are made by the people that show up. It's easy to be cynical and bitch about politics on the internet, it's much harder to affect change. Wall Street doesn't get the legislation it wants by sitting around and complaining - they are ridiculously organized and active in the process. If you want Congress' attention, you are going to have to compete for it. I know the playing field isn't fair, and that means you're going to have to work harder.
 |You shouldn't be asking me how or if I'll 'pass over' the youth ... I shouldn't even have that option. It should be impossible to ignore you because your calling my office all hours of the night; because you are organizing in my district; because your waiting in the lobby when I show up in the morning. The greatest asset of the youth is its energy - that needs to be harnessed and directed.
 |I think you can tell a lot about someone's character by they way they treat those who can do nothing for them. I'm willing to talk with anyone and I try to reach out to everyone in every way I can.
 |The door to my congressional office will be open. The question is: Will you come in? 
[In the event Mr. Romney selects Mr. Ryan to his VPOTUS nominee, do you think your chances get better or worse? Any contingency plans in place? Do you think he would help or hurt Mr. Romney?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vsx69/i_am_rob_zerban_challenger_to_rep_paul_ryan_in/c57j3l1?context=5)|There isn't a lot of precedent for this scenario, and I've heard it analyzed a dozen different ways by a dozen different politicos.
 |What I do know is that when Paul Ryan is spending more time in TV studios, more time traveling around the country raising money for Mitt Romney, he's spending less time here in the 1st District talking to the voters that elect him.
 |It's hard to make the case you're honorably representing the people of southeast Wisconsin when you're spending all of your time in Ohio and Florida hosting $5,000/plate dinners.
 |Right now, I'm on the ballot opposite of Ryan this November, and that's the campaign I'm focused on.
[Republicans love to attack government spending with phrases like, ""It's the spending, stupid.""  Yet their cornerstone budget proposal, Paul Ryan's budget plan Path to Prosperity, increases the size of government 30-40% over the next ten years.  Why do I not hear Democrats pointing out this hypocrisy?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vsx69/i_am_rob_zerban_challenger_to_rep_paul_ryan_in/c57e6u8?context=5)|Some do. More should.
 |It's laughable for someone like Ryan to style himself a deficit hawk, when he's voted for trillions in debt over the last 14 years. He's voted for the ""Bridge to Nowhere"" 3 times, but Pell Grants for college students are unaffordable? Give me a break.  
[Have you ever though about running a campaign with no money? Only using your free time &amp; social media to get your word out?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vsx69/i_am_rob_zerban_challenger_to_rep_paul_ryan_in/c57egm2?context=5)|Running a campaign without any money, would be very difficult. I have 7 staffers, interns, 4 offices, letterhead, postage, t-shirts, etc.  Social media is definitely changing the way campaigns communicate, but it's not at the point where you could be competitive using only social media. You still need to knock on doors, make calls, mail, TV, etc. Remember, senior citizens vote often and Facebook rarely.
[Hey Rib what kind of district are you running in demographically? what kind of things do you do to win over ryan die hards who are so fervent about his plan?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vsx69/i_am_rob_zerban_challenger_to_rep_paul_ryan_in/c57fdy1?context=5)|Ryan's most fervent supporters don't live in Wisconsin. They live in NYC and Washington DC. You might assume that Ryan represents a heavily Republican district, but he doesn't. It's a moderate district that Obama carried in 2008.
 |Ryan hasn't faced reelection since authoring his first unpopular budget last year, and for the first time in 12 years Ryan will have a competitive challenger. We are reaching out to everyone and doing everything we can to gather the resources necessary to give voters a clear choice this fall. Ryan has grown out of touch, and I think when people hear my story and hear about the things I stand for, they will decide that I'm the one who is going to fight for them. 
[I really don't understand how any American can support a candidate (or, honestly a party\) who is willing to kill democracy by limiting voting rights/abilities/information, and yet we have seen quite a lot of it, mostly from the GOP.  I understand 'win at all costs' as a rallying cry, but why do Dems not wave this around like the tool it really is?  Why do we constantly hear flag-waving false patriotism from the GOP, but this (what I call\) suspension-of-democracy by limiting voting is never flung back in their faces?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vsx69/i_am_rob_zerban_challenger_to_rep_paul_ryan_in/c57es2j?context=5)|It's unfortunate that voter suppression efforts around the country aren't getting more attention. The Republican voter ID law here in Wisconsin was struck down by our courts, thankfully. This issue doesn't share in the larger debate because the people most affected by these laws are people that have the least influence; the poor, students, minorities, the elderly.
[ I'd also appreciate a few less calls and emails, but I'm still happy to support.  Thanks.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vsx69/i_am_rob_zerban_challenger_to_rep_paul_ryan_in/c57es2j?context=5)|The GOP has been working hard to perpetuate the myth of widespread voter fraud, for which there is little evidence. In reality, we should be more concerned with fraud on the back end of the booth, especially as electronic voting machines become more commonly used.
[If  how will you deal with an idea that you agree on, but your party will not. What will you do as an elected official to make our goverment solve problems?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vsx69/i_am_rob_zerban_challenger_to_rep_paul_ryan_in/c57hni8?context=5)|Ultimately, I'll have my vote. I'll be there to represent the interests of my constituents, and if that means I cross party lines, then so be it. 
[**EDIT - It looks like you've answered just about every legitimate question in this thread except mine.  When I asked this question I wasn't holding my breath to get a reply and I'm still not. Saying you're gonna go after monopolistic banks who have committed criminal fraud in a public forum is political suicide and Rob Zerban knows who butters his bread, just like Paul Ryan  This is why we're truly screwed, no politician will stand up to power and say ""justice must be done or may the heavens fall"", instead all we hear is the same apologetic line about how we need to look forward and not backwards.**  Thank you for answering our questions Rob.  With all the financial fraud that's going on in the economy right now it seems that no one is being held criminally accountable and are only being subjected to corporate fines that are a small portion of the ill gotten gains.  Here are a few examples...  Wachovia Paid Trivial Fine for Nearly $400 Billion of Drug Related Money Laundering.  If you are elected into office, what steps will you take to make sure that the individuals who have perpetrated this fraud are criminally charged?  Will you go after banks that launder cartel drug money such as Wachovia did with 400 Billion dollars?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vsx69/i_am_rob_zerban_challenger_to_rep_paul_ryan_in/c57epk4?context=5)|If you commit a crime, you're a criminal, and you should be prosecuted.  Given that the financial service sector floods Congress with money, it's unlikely you'll see the criminal indictments many deserve. What can I do about financial crimes depends in large part on what committees I'm assigned to, but I can always bring attention to an issue, and work with other legislators who may serve on relevant committees.  Currently, when financial institutions are faced with fraud charges, they usually settle... and somehow get to keep half of the money they stole. If we let them keep half the money and no one goes to jail, why would they stop? The system for holding financial criminals accountable is completely toothless. It needs to change.  A lot of this all comes back to campaign finance, and the corrupting influence of money in politics. That is why I support publicly funded elections.  
[How do you feel about your chances of being elected with the handicap of having a ""z"" in your last name?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vsx69/i_am_rob_zerban_challenger_to_rep_paul_ryan_in/c57h0x9?context=5)|I'm optimistic that people with ""A-Y"" last names will overlook the sordid past of ""Z"" names and judge me on merits of my own character. I want little ""Z"" children to know that I too once stood at the end of every line in school, ever, and they can overcome their unfortunate alphabetically-determined position in the line to achieve great things as well. 
[General question for anyone in the political world.  But aren't you sick of politics? It drives me insane just reading about it. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vsx69/i_am_rob_zerban_challenger_to_rep_paul_ryan_in/c57c6dm?context=5)|I hear ya...

It would create jobs (at a time when we need them the most) and it would reduce our dependence on foreign oil.
[Last November, your state legalized concealed carry with no major issues (and even some lives saved\).

vukua,4,2012-06-30,"Working university student looking to pay for the rest of my tuition; Harrisonburg, Virginia",[deleted],Assistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/vukua/working_university_student_looking_to_pay_for_the/,"**Update down below**

**What I need: $3,000**

**Situation**
I'm going to be a 5th year student in the fall and I received my award notice for my financial aid three days ago. I'd only be receiving $6,000 for the year, meaning I would only receive $3,000 per semester. Tuition for this school year is $4,404.

$4,404 - $3,000 = $1,404. I'm asking for $3,000 ($1,500/semester) in the high chance a class has some extra payments/lab fees that might be incurred.

**Factors/Situation**

- My parents have refused to assist in paying for college. According to my FAFSA, my dad makes too much for me to receive any grants or need-based scholarships. My mom isn't a full US citizen, never went to college and works as a seamstress. Recently, my was in the hospital for heart failure. He's out now, but those medical bills just deter me further for asking for financial assistance. He even refuses to cosign a private loan. It's always harder to ask for another working adult to cosign a loan than a parent. 

- I am the only child in college as my siblings have decided not to go. My younger brother found government assistance to get his GED and is training to be a nurse. My younger sister has been going from job to job trying to figure out what to do with her life.

- My GPA has been in good standing. I received a 1.9 my first semester (issue from both sides), and I've brought it up to a 2.9. Considering I work 30 hours a week, that's acceptable. With my first major, there was a GPA requirement I needed to be in the 300-level classes. When I didn't get into it the first two times I applied, I took more classes to boost my GPA. The GPA requirement changed, but I had ""too many credits"" to get into the class. I switched majors.

- I've been working at a dining hall on campus to help pay for tuition and other expenses. Because I work 30 hours a week, all of my shifts give me a meal. I've also worked with my managers and they sometimes offer to give me free meals when I'm not working that day. As of now, I've moved up to being a student manager. I get paid $12/hr but that only covers rent and bills. Over the summers, my normal location is closed and I have to work catering. My hours went from 30/wk to 10/wk and that's only if they have shifts available for me. July I am only working two shifts.

- I pay my own rent. I live in a four-person apartment. Each person has individual leases so I only pay $380/month, all inclusive

- I do not have a driver's license, so getting a second job off campus is practically impossible. At least this way I don't need to spend money on a car, gas, or insurance

- There's really not much for me to sell, if I could. I need my computer for school. It's better to use my computer at my apartment rather than staying at the library so late where the buses won't go back to my side of town. Most of my furniture came free or extremely cheap from craigslist. I don't buy clothes often since I'm almost always in my work uniform. Yes, I do have a smart phone, but I'm paying for that myself and I get a discount from my job.

- I can't drop out/take a year off because I would lose my job (""student"" manager), losing my job means I can't pay for my rent (I'm my own guarantor and I'd be evicted), and I'd have to start paying back loans with money I don't have.

- I have been able to pay the rest my tuition in the past, since it was only $500-$700 out of pocket. This year, the aid I'm receiving has been lowered, possibly because I'm a 5th year.

- Next school year, I should classify as an independent, so I won't need outside assistance except for loans. This year is the only year I really need the help.

- I have a plan for a job after graduation, and a backup plan if it doesn't work out, but that's later on. I need to pay for school to even get to the internship.

Any other details I haven't answered, I'll be happy to answer your questions.

**UPDATE:**
I tried to ask my mom if she could cosign, but it looks like she can't be approved. My dad still absolutely refuses on the basis of ""can't afford it."" I really feel like I'm out of options and at a dead end. "

(I will be taking classes here in Berlin and I will be getting my degree eventually)
I will be able to obtain a German citizenship fairly easily due to my grandmothers status as a prisoner during WW2.
I am wondering what the average salary for a junior designer in Germany was. I tried googling it but I received mixed results, I thought hearing some personal anecdotes from those on reddit would help me immensely. Those that live in Berlin, how much of a salary / benefits should I be asking for to live somewhat comfortably (for a 21 year old...very low maintenance) in this city?

I have 100% decided on living in Berlin, I have never in my life felt so comfortable and welcomed by a city. It really is magnificent.

Thank you very much in advance!"

I'm looking to drop back down to a size 3 from a 5, so I spoke to the personal trainers at my gym and they said my target body fat should be 13%. What they didn't supply me with were efficient methods to achieve this (but for a mere $250 a month, they will!). 

Herein lies the problem: I'm a full time intern and I attend MBA school full time (14 hours) at night, 4 nights a week. I all of my meals away from home. I always bring my food (Greek yogurt, salads, fruits, vegetables, never anything too bad except for creamer in coffee), but since I'm away from home from 6:30 AM to 10 PM and then have homework, I'm really struggling with a proper workout routine. I'm not opposed to going to the gym at 5 AM, and I've done it, but I need to maximize the hour that I can spend there. Any advice/links/anything on exercise, diet, or motivation would be great! "
vtz7m,10,2012-06-30,How does one get a CS job?,computer_engineer,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/vtz7m/how_does_one_get_a_cs_job/,"I just graduated with a degree in computer engineering and I can not seem to get any momentum with the job hunt. I finished my degree in 3 years by taking classes over the summer, because of this I did not do any internships. Last spring I applied for developer positions at microsoft, apple, and amazon, had some phone interviews and was ultimately rejected by all three. I went to my school's job fair, searched on craigslist, and replied to /forhire/ postings, but so far I have only heard back from 1 out of ~50 companies. Unfortunately I haven't heard back from that one company in two weeks, so I assume I was rejected from that also.  I signed up on roberthalf and another temp agency and have not gotten anything from them. 

My resume is very empty because I have only worked at my father's company, where I basically make/update excel spreadsheets for a few hours a week. So to fill the space, I just wrote about all the projects and relevant courses I did to get my degree. 


Is there anything that I should do to help me find a job? Should I apply to jobs that I am not necessarily qualified for? (C# jobs when I have little to no experience) Should I apply for other jobs not related to my degree at technology companies and hope to get transferred?  It just feels very frustrating not to have any control and to just wait around.

Here I am, finally can say I'm an adult graduated from high school. Heres the thing, I need a little push or guidance from those who have done it. Who've pushed through it. Here is my story!

I had an internship my senior year of school with a web design company and that helped a lot. I was developing websites from hand (HTML/CSS with the newer stuffs involved) since 10th grade and a tech nut since 8th grade. I've got a (what I think) is a pretty good resume built along with a portfolio site. I can hand code sites from nothing in a text editor, and build it into a wordpress site/blog.

How would I go about marketing myself? I've applied at as many places as I could in my area and none are hiring. I got one interview, it went to a second, and I haven't heard back since the second. I just want to be able to use my skills and do something that I enjoy more. Currently I'm a bus boy and would much rather be developing websites or ANYTHING technology related. What can I do?

If it helps at all, in my area all the school get together and create an event for all students to enter their sites and designs. Out of 400 entries I won best of show. 

Oh! How forgetful I can be... I'm going to a local community college in the fall for a CS Associate degree.

Any pointers? Tips? Heres my portfolio: http://robertdelu.ca

The equivalent Mac would cost an unruley amount. This computer can also be used strictly as a Windows or Linux machine. I'm looking to get around $1200 for it so that I only have to eat a couple hundred dollars, but I am willing to negotiate. I am also willing to trade this desktop for a Macbook of some kind (preferably a newer, higher end MacBook Air). PM me. "
