t2c4f,1,2012-05-01,Internship application criticism.,AwesomeKasper,gamedev,https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/t2c4f/internship_application_criticism/,"Hello /r/GameDev. I'm looking for an internship in a game studio as a programmer for my final semester of school. I've compiled a list of companies I'm going to send an application to but first I'd like some criticism on my cover letter to give myself the best chances of being hired. Mostly I'd just like to know if this would get the attention of the reader and generate interest in an interview.

The letter:
---------------
Hello &lt;company name&gt;. My name is &lt;NAME&gt;, I'm a 22 year old student of Computer Science and Game Design in Denmark.  
I write to you because I am searching for a company to intern in for 3 or more months this fall of 2012. This internship is part of my 2½ year education which I will complete in February 2013. The goal is to gain real world experience in software programming and game development.  


  I send this application to you because... &lt;Something specific to this company&gt; I'm interested in your projects and the technologies your company work with etc...  


  But why me? Why am I so special I'm worth all the trouble?  
The answer is because I'm a highly motivated, self sufficient and reliable young man with a broad range of skills both technologically but also socially. I have a curious mind and enjoy challenging myself to push my own limits. I believe I can make a meaningful contribution to your development staff and I'd love the opportunity to learn from someone well established in the industry. Frankly I feel you would miss out by not hiring me.  


  I'm mainly interested in working either with specific gameplay features or AI design. To a lesser but still significant extent I am also interested in working with the GUI, backend systems, engine tweaks/optimizations, netcode and the like.  


  If you are interested in hiring me I would love to set up a Skype or other form of video call for a “face to face” interview. Barring that a phone conversation in the least.

t283z,1,2012-05-01,Drupal modules or AJAX?  I need advice.,chibling,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/t283z/drupal_modules_or_ajax_i_need_advice/,"Hello!  I recently started an internship and they want me to take information from a database and make some representations (charts, maps, timelines, etc) for a website that will dynamically change as content is added to the database.  They are using drupal, which is something I have not used before, and which I will not have full access to as a mere intern.
I can get access to the straight XML printout of the data I will need, but I'm afraid I don't exactly know how I might pull helpful information out with XSLT or something more traditional (for example, ""of these 500 entries, 30 individuals have written more than 10 books..."").

At the moment it looks like I have two options:
1.  I get somebody higher up to install a module on Drupal that can do data analysis type stuff (in which case I would love suggestions of which module to choose), and hopefully I'll be able to do everything in good old SQL...?
OR
2.  I parse the XML data and pipe it through to one of the google analytical tools, like GeoChart, etc.  But if I choose this option, which language should I use?  JQuery?  Ajax?  I don't know either, but I'd be willing to learn if it was for the best!

I know this is not the specific type of question this forum is probably used to, but beyond some pretty basic PHP, SQL, Ruby, XSLT, and Pure Data, I do not have a strong programming / database background and I need any advice I can get with this particular problem.  What do you recommend?  Thanks so much!"
t27rh,3,2012-05-01,Need help getting through to my manager.... Any tips?,bmxludwig,engineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/t27rh/need_help_getting_through_to_my_manager_any_tips/,"Currently I am employed at an injection molding company that specializes in short production runs. I am currently using this job as my ""internship"" and will finish my manufacturing engineering degree at the end of the summer.

The company I work for does not employ a single process or industrial engineer and it is very obvious at times. My manager is not an engineer, but rather a guy who has worked at this company for 20+ years. Currently he handles setting up productions runs, managing raw materials, oversees shipping, and pretty much knows ""everything"" about the factory as far as the presses and robots go. He does not however seem to care about how his product flows throughout the factory and it seems like I find inconsistencies daily. For example this happened today....

While finishing up my duties for the day I was walking around checking machines and verifying that the 2nd shift workers knew what was planned for the evening. While making my rounds I noticed one employee was boxing up some finished parts. The parts he was boxing up were pill crushers. The part can be seen [here.](http://www.google.com/imgres?um=1&amp;hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;sa=N&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=661&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbnid=mkyYy3ikBql9iM:&amp;imgrefurl=http://www.amazon.com/CM-70071-Crusher-Pill-Pulverizer/dp/B000KL1N3C&amp;docid=rIRGLOmh5nbkfM&amp;imgurl=http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31kSXnJpy-L._SL500_AA300_.jpg&amp;w=300&amp;h=300&amp;ei=JVygT5rVD4PO9QSghJCoAQ&amp;zoom=1&amp;iact=hc&amp;vpx=643&amp;vpy=141&amp;dur=1738&amp;hovh=225&amp;hovw=225&amp;tx=129&amp;ty=118&amp;sig=116293943106777695476&amp;page=1&amp;tbnh=148&amp;tbnw=139&amp;start=0&amp;ndsp=20&amp;ved=1t:429,r:3,s:0,i:78) As you can see the crusher consists of three separate injection molded parts. The clear base, the white cap, and the blue center cap. Upon realizing that the worker was taking fully assembled parts out of one box (they were just tossed in there) and placing them into another box (in rows, so the box count is consistent), I came to the conclusion that somebody wasn't thinking very clearly when they set up the work station. The parts could have easily been placed properly into boxes and shipped instantly. I counted 190 boxes of these parts that needed to be reboxed today. 

I did not understand why we were essentially redoing what has already been done. So, because I was intrigued. I sat down and filled a couple boxes up with crushers while timing myself. Turned out my average time was about 10 minutes to fill and place a box on the finished pallet. Using that number, I calculated that 10 minutes per box for 190 boxes is 1900 minutes. 1900 minutes in hours is about 31 man hours of work. 31 man hours at roughly $10.00 per hour works out to $310 dollars. 

Now, I know $310 is not a considerable amount of money to a company, but its the principle of the issue that bothers me the most....

So, I asked my manager why he decided to do it that way and his response to me was, ""The workers at the machine don't have enough time to put them into boxes."" Yes that is what he said. Somehow he determined that there was enough time to put them in the box in no particular order, but not enough time to just set them in the box so they are ready to ship.

This basically rubbed off on me as ""I don't really care, they are getting done and my boss is happy."" 

My manager is one of the worst, ""Well, we've always done it this way..."" type of people I have ever met. 

Keep in mind that this is not the only case of inefficiencies happening on this shop floor. There is not a single VSM, time study, work procedure, or setup diagrams anywhere in this factory. It is really making me question whether or not these people have anything to teach me that is pertinent to my major. 

Now, my question is... How do I go about convincing my manager that Lean Manufacturing is definitely something to look at? I need to somehow convince them that an investment in some process engineering would be a beneficial investment. 

Also, If you would like more stories about how ridiculous some of the factory dynamics are at this place, I can indulge you.

One company has offered me a co-op position from May to December, which will interfere with my fall semester. However, they seem flexible and will allow me to work under 40 hours per week when school starts back up.

Another company has offered me an intern position for the summer, possibly with the chance to continue through the school year.

Both companies were very nice to me, and are similar in terms of the industry. The positions are similar as well. I've yet to receive information on pay, etc. though.

I feel somewhat bad for making them wait on which offer I should take.

Some say co-ops are the better learning experience. What does everyone else think?"

Growing up I was always the ""trouble"" child, medicated into submission until I turned 16 and decided I didn't want to take my multiple ADHD medications anymore.  Since then I have gone to college and while it has taken me longer, I have never failed a class and I have a solid 3.2 GPA.  I have worked 1 or more part time jobs while in college that pay my bills and a car payment as well.  I take care of myself and I take care of my personality quirks.

I'm gearing up to tell my parents that I have been living with my boyfriend for about 5 months now.  I haven't been back to my apartment in ages except to pick up a few things.  I love him, I want to marry him, but we are waiting to get engaged until I get a career figured out and we start pulling in some money.  Also, my brother is getting married next year so I wouldn't want to get too close to that.  I want to pay off some of my student loans as well.  Ideally, I would want to pay for my own wedding and not be a burden to my parents.

My parents constantly treat me like a child due to my difficult upbringing.  I got in an argument over Christmas over the fact that my dad laughed at me when I said a preferred one food over another.  (Seriously?  I know what foods I like to eat!!)  Another time I was talking about having difficulties with coworkers at my internship, and my parents laughed and laughed, telling me that that was just my first job and I should stop complaining.  Really?  I have been working since I was 16!  I have worked hard to make myself marketable and have had over 5 internships during my academic career.

I'm struggling to find a way to show them that I'm an adult now.  I'm not an unruly child, I'm just trying to find my place in this world right now and I make decisions for myself.  I love them and I desperately want them to accept me and the choices I make but I can't find a way to do this.  I have incredible anxiety before telling them about any decision I've made and it's eating away at me.

Any advice for someone who wants to be accepted as the adult that they are by their parents?  I don't even know how to tell them that I live with my boyfriend!"

My S.O. is trying to get into animation and California seems like it would be the best option for both of us. I have a full time job lined up here in Kansas that is a good opportunity for a new graduate, but I still want to relocate as soon as possible.

The main questions I have are these:

I know living expenses are much higher in CA, so what should I be asking for in terms of salary?

What resources, websites, etc. should I use to find a job?

I don't expect to get hired anywhere crazy amazing like Blizzard, Google, or something along those lines right away. The pipe-dream is to try to get into game dev after a couple years of refining my skills. Can anyone recommend any companies in CA that I should look into?

Thanks for any help you guys give. I really appreciate it =)"

[Can't wait to start work again, so I can afford the sequel to one of my favorite games this generation!  The ending to Borderlands wasn't too hot. Not that it was terrible (citation: Lost, Twin Peaks, 24\), but it wasn't quite the payoff I was expecting. I like how you basically amended that with the Robo-Revolution DLC, though. That felt like a much better ending to the game.  Will the ending to Borderlands 2 give a much better sense of closure and reward, while still leaving room open for DLC? Or will the ""true"" ending be locked behind DLC, as is a trend slowly popping up in the video game industry?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t0qch/iama_chief_creative_champion_for_gearbox_software/c4ijrb1?context=5)|The ending to Borderlands 2 will be much better yes.

Also what is your honest opinion on Anthony's writing for Boarderlands 2 compared to your own on the original?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t0qch/iama_chief_creative_champion_for_gearbox_software/c4im8jk?context=5)|I've met all of them and I'm lucky to call them friends. They are all brilliant.
[What's something that you've put into one of the games you've worked on that you don't think people have noticed or picked up on, that you wish was appreciated more?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t0qch/iama_chief_creative_champion_for_gearbox_software/c4il89y?context=5)|I know people noticed, but the path of Baker's father's gun in the Brothers in Arms series. Every single person that touched it pretty much died.
[No question, just wanted to comment that I adore your writing. ASTW is one of my web series inspirations...  OO I thought of one. Who thought up the puppet idea for ASTW?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t0qch/iama_chief_creative_champion_for_gearbox_software/c4ikcn5?context=5)|I think we both did, actually. I have a friend named Sarah Nolen that makes puppets and performs puppet theater in Dallas. She was into the idea and we just went for it! (And then I totally hosed the audio for that episode and destroyed the world.)
[What was the overall budget for ASTW as a series and per episode?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t0qch/iama_chief_creative_champion_for_gearbox_software/c4ikeyp?context=5)|Not cheap -- but it was all equipment with no budget for people to run it. I pretty much directed, edited, sound edited, and did the special FX on all the episodes -- while having a full time job. Just doesn't work, heh.
[Do you know Paul Hellquist? He plays hockey with some friends of mine. Tell him a redditor says hi. I'm also a Plano, Texas local, Comp Sci student and game dev, hoping to get that testing internship over the summer :D.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t0qch/iama_chief_creative_champion_for_gearbox_software/c4iltbz?context=5)|I know him very well. I also adore Paul. One of the smartest people I know.
[I'm a bit torn about buying Borderlands 2 on PC or 360. My brother has it for the 360 and the visuals seem to be a bit.. jumpy at times; Just not too smooth, whereas my computer runs it pretty much flawlessly. I'd love to be able to play with him (I live away from my parent's house, he doesn't yet.\) but having the screen freeze up in the middle of a fight for even a second just throws me off. Any chance that will be fixed for Borderlands 2 or should I just cave and buy it on PC?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t0qch/iama_chief_creative_champion_for_gearbox_software/c4im1ff?context=5)|Way too specific for someone like me. Do whatever lets you play with people you love. Having said that, we've improved a lot across all platforms.

I know Borderlands had a couple Firefly references in it (what sci fi story doesnt nowadays\)  Did you guys at Gearbox ever try and get a hold of him to do voice acting for BL2?  Just curious.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t0qch/iama_chief_creative_champion_for_gearbox_software/c4im2iv?context=5)|Uh, we have definitely brought it up as a pie-in-the-sky thing.

[Thanks for the advice,  I mean I would love to end up in your shoes someday but I know a lot of things have to happen to get there and a lot of other things could happen that could bring the whole thing down.  How did you get started in the industry?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t0qch/iama_chief_creative_champion_for_gearbox_software/c4ir52o?context=5)|By buying as many shoes as possible and seeing which ones fit the best (are we still on the shoe metaphor? I seriously have a lot of shoes.)
[Will you do another series with Anthony Burch in the future? What is your suggestion for writers who want to break into the games industry?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t0qch/iama_chief_creative_champion_for_gearbox_software/c4ipu1y?context=5)|Find the place you want to work and figure out how to do it. Breaking in as a writer is tough -- I started as an artist and learned everything I could about building a game to marketing it.
 |And I'd love to do another show at some point but ASTW was just way too much work to pull off -- I'd put together a crew this time. For now, I'll focus on the online book stuff.

t18a1,3,2012-05-01,"Wish I could change my family's situation, but can't.",sajeonogi,MMFB,https://www.reddit.com/r/MMFB/comments/t18a1/wish_i_could_change_my_familys_situation_but_cant/,"I live in a pretty nice, Southern, small town/suburb. Not filthy rich but the kind of place where people get their kids brand new cars for birthdays/graduations, and they don't usually have to worry about money. I'm a high school senior who may not be able to afford to graduate.

Due to school policy, I can't walk the stage until I've paid off everything I owe to my school. Which is about $400 with various costs. The same graduation I am supposed to speak at...I still find that wryly amusing.

In total, my mom brings in about $20,000 a year. Including what my dad pays in child support, which is about all the financial contribution he does. I knew we were struggling, but I never realized just how little money we have to spread around. Before I got access to her tax returns, I would get mad at her for telling me to put our income on applications because I thought she just wanted me to look more needy so I could take advantage of the system. I didn't realize we actually were living off that kind of money. She's got a steady teaching job, but of course, it will be a long, long time before we can live comfortably. Her salary  supports my two sisters and I, as well as my aunt. 

Obviously, finances have always been such a problem in our household. I'm constantly calling different companies whom we owe bills to, asking for extensions so I can have some internet to finish an assignment or whatever. My mom knows what minimum to pay where so nothing gets shut off, or which expense we can cut out this month to carry over somewhere else...

She is trying so hard to make things work for me though. She bought me a $200 prom dress, which I couldn't believe, since it was so far beyond my budget...but she insisted, and told me I deserved it after working so hard and not getting to have any fun all these years. And I thought it was crazy expensive until I realized everyone else at my school had budgets of ~$500 or so for dresses...She's trying to spoil me right now, but I know she's paying for everything with credit cards because the money just isn't there and I can't help but feel so guilty.

I was lucky to be chosen for a full-time paid internship this summer, and I thought this was finally it, and that it was going to be enough. I'm realizing now that I'll probably have to pick up a second job in the evenings.
Needing to work = needing to learn to drive = $350 driver's ed so i can get my license (which we've put off until I am now 17 because I could never afford it...still can't, but it's a matter of necessity now) = needing to buy another car to get me to work ~30 minutes away since the only one we have is my mom's ancient one. But it's all about money!!

I'd been doing some tutoring on the side for some money, but for the next month, I have absolutely no spare time between 8:30 am - 7:00 pm, cutting into all the time I would be spending doing that. I can't work anywhere else until I can drive (I don't live in a walkable place and I can't depend on others for rides, since they have their own lives too), but I'm not even sure I will even be able to finish paying off my driver's ed.

Through scholarships and amazing financial aid, my parents will not have to pay a penny for my $60,000/year east coast private college. Not for books, room and board, nothing. No loans either.
Too bad applying for more scholarships is not helping my current living situation though, since most of them award money directly to the college, not the students, therefore, only reducing my financial aid package from my school, not putting any money in my pocket to fix my situation.

Even after I've gotten myself out of the red, the cost of replacing my four year old laptop, buying clothes to handle the East coast weather after living in the South, even pocket money for going out to dinner or a movie...it's adding up. Yes, I may not have to pay anything to go to college, but that also means my family can't afford to help me move in and I can't fly the 2,000 miles home any time except for summer and winter breaks.

This is incredibly long, but I just wanted to let it all out. I mean, every time I think we're finally making progress, it feels like more obstacles get in our way. I've long given up on waiting for God or anyone else to help me. I do what I can to help my family, but it's as if the world has other plans. Nobody in my life knows how bad it is, and I try to forget about it, but some days everything just feels so futile and I feel like resorting to the lowest measures to make a quick buck so my mom can stop wondering how we're going to make it...This life thing isn't very easy to handle.

TL;DR: Can't catch a break. Money's great...Too bad there's not enough of it. Feeling generally hopeless and useless right now."

I already have a bit of experience under my belt at a small company but I'm looking to move on to an enterprise setting.

Also, I already have my CCENT (ICND1) and I'm planning on getting my CCNA soon. Would it be better just to focus on that for the time being? Exactly how important are certifications in the field compared to experience and college GPA and/or major?"

If I remember correctly, when I went to an OSU college meeting, the speaker said that there are paid internships that pay up to $40k/yr and around 40% of those that apply are accepted (I swear to god that's what I remember her saying; it seems crazy to me). Is that true? Could someone that is attending OSU confirm this and explain what the process is like.

What variety of internships (what fields of study do the internships pertain to)?

What company is doing the internships?

How hard is it to get accepted?

What do the internships pay if at all?

What is an average week for someone involved in an OSU internship?

What is the average working day for someone involved in an OSU internship?

t0s0v,4,2012-04-30,Deciding between two IT job offers: Fortune 500 company and small non-profit. ,Arcanis888,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/t0s0v/deciding_between_two_it_job_offers_fortune_500/,"So I am currently in a pickle deciding between two jobs in the IT field. This is my first job out of college, and I would greatly appreciate your input Reddit.

Job #1: Fortune 500 company, currently I am an intern there. Better pay, better 401k employer contribution, more vacation. The work is not very interesting though and is mostly non-technical (I'm more of a technical guy).

Job #2: Small non-profit organization. Lower pay, less 401k employer contribution, less vacation. The work is very technical as I would be the primary IT guy for the organization mostly doing DBA type work.

I know I would enjoy the second job more, but I don't know if taking the first job and dealing with it would prove beneficial in the long run (larger 401k, Fortune 500 experience, etc). I have asked my manager at job one for a different position, but all of the company's internal IT positions tend to be non-technical as we contract out most technical work. I was basically given a ""maybe"". That of course could mean I get pigeonholed into doing non-technical work, which I absolutely dread. The employees at job 2 tend to be closer to my age and since it's such a small organization, there would be a great sense of ownership. I have no idea what to do.

Any thoughts/suggestions?"

I keep hearing about how it's going to get better, I just have to believe.  My friends are either tired of hearing from me, or they're gossips and this message will get places I don't want it to.  

I'm just gonna throw the story up here, but a very short version. Maybe because it will be cathartic to finally type it all out, like I'm telling a stranger.  

I haven't been happy with my life in a long time.  I own my part in my current misery.  I get bad panic attacks and I let them stop me from making necessary changes, or confronting my ever growing to do list.  

When I graduated with my undergrad in 2001, I couldn't find work in what was then my chosen career path, so I ended up stuck in a go no where job for 5 years until I finally got fired a month before I was going to quit so I could move to Colorado to go to grad school.  I went to get my MBA so I could finally have a degree that wasn't completely worthless.  At the end of my first semester, my Dad got diagnosed with Brain Cancer.  He died 3 months later, 5 days before my birthday.  That sucked...  But I tried really hard to see the upside of it, I used the inheritance money to finally get out from under crippling debt, and went to see my best friend get married in Korea.  I started to see a future for myself, where I wouldn't be constantly ashamed of the direction that my life was headed.  I got engaged to my girlfriend of 7 years, and finally let myself feel hope.  I graduated may of 2008, right during the housing crisis.  Once again graduating from college during an economic collapse.  I moved back to Texas and did an internship at an ad agency, where my work was praised, but apparently thanks to the economic collapse, they were on a ""hiring freeze"".  My boss told me that no matter when in the future, if he had a job he would contact me.  I took responsibility and stayed in touch with him, and he answered my emails for the next 2 years, but not anymore.  

So i got another job, that I felt was beneath me (which was a huge problem that I had to cope with, but I eventually did, we'll get there, and I came to discover that no job was beneath me, if I treated them all like a career, I could go far.... HA).  I worked in a call center in customer service, for 2 years, before my Fiance said we should move back to Colorado.  We were still unmarried, because we couldn't afford to have the wedding that she wanted.  So I up and moved back got a job at another call center in customer service.  

2 months after moving here she broke up with me.  Which time (11 months) has helped me realize was an amazing thing, but it did force me to move on.  I had some friends a fellow redditor/lurker who let me live with him for a while, until I could get in with another friend where I could bring my dogs.  In November we got a new manager on our team, and he took a shine to me.  He seemed to be impressed with my credentials and told me that he was making me his project and he was going to help me move up in the company.  This is when the aforementioned revelation came about and I worked my ass off, so I could move up.  i helped on other teams whenever requested, I was always there to help on whatever.  I got great scores, and good grades on my calls so I could continue to be an example to my coworkers.  I got fired in February.  Still unemployed now, I was trying to use this time to find a dream job, something that would finally let me use my degree and get my life going in the right direction. That doesn't seem to be working out, as every day is a new slew of rejection letters for jobs that I have applied for.

Now here comes the part where if I haven't already, I'll start to sound like a little bitch.  I met a girl when i was working at my last job.  She was funny, and I had fun hanging out with her.  We did that a few times while I was working there, mostly with other friends, but once together alone.  Although I was always to chicken shit to make a move.  Well after being unemployed for these last few months, I finally asked her out.  I wasn't sure if it was a date, because to be honest I've never been on a date before I got separated from my fiance.  (She and I just kinda happened).  Well I took this girl out last friday.  We went downtown to a couple of bars, we went to this really fun bar that has old school video games, which I thought would appeal to her, b/c she has every video game system ever, almost.  And we talk about games a lot.  We went out to get dinner and talked and laughed and seemed to have fun.  We both got a little buzzed and even rode a free bus downtown,  just to people watch, which was a hilarious event for both of us.  I drove her back to her car, and almost chickened out again, but finally went for it and we kissed.  I held her face, and she mine, I thought we shared something.  She said we would hang out again soon, and she texted me when she got home safely.  I texted her the next day, little innocent things like how did you feel this morning when you woke up, because I woke up with a full on hang over.  And she responded to that first text.  I asked if she was having fun that day, because I knew that she was at a party with some friends, but she never responded, and I didn't want to end up as one of those crazy text stalkers, so I stopped for the night.  On sunday I texted her and said I would love to see her again.  I haven't heard from her since she told me that she woke up feeling ok on Saturday.  (keep in mind I texted instead of called, because during our date, she said she hated getting phone calls, and preferred to communicate through text)

So now here I am adding one more thing on to my list of shit that I am waiting on, I am waiting on a job, hopefully my dream job, or at least a job that will allow me to use my degree and perhaps make payments towards my student loan.  I am waiting on this girl to text me.  I know probably both of those things are unlikely.  I'll eventually get a job, but I'll probably have to settle and go back into customer service, where I'll end up working for the rest of my life.  I'm not saying there is anything wrong with customer service, some people are made for that, I can't tolerate idiots, and I am very sarcastic,  I should not be the front of any company's customer interaction.  I probably did something on this date that turned the other girl off, and I can accept that.  The thing that is killing me, is the constant rejection that my life has become.  I am trying to use this time wisely, this is the first time I have ever been unemployed, and it's only been 3 months, but I still hate it.  I have a work ethic.  

But instead I just sit here everday waiting for things to happen in my life so I can participate, like a animal that you leave at home, I used to get excited when my roommates came home, because I could interact with people, and maybe they would want to do something, but I think they're sick of my depression, and I hate being in the way.  
I am trying to get my life on a plan, add some daily structure into my life, so I can get out of the house, and loose weight, and stop hating every part of me.  

However for the past few days, I have just been staring at my phone, needing this girl to text me so one more thing in my life doesn't end up in rejection.  I've also been staring at my pocket knife, and it doesn't help that I heard on a tv show that slitting your wrists is like drifting off to sleep.  One of the reasons that I haven't yet, (ignoring that I am to scared to, and I don't want to do that to my friends/family) is that I know initially it will hurt like hell when I cut myself.  and when I can avoid pain, I try to.  So I don't think I'm truly suicidal, but I don't know where else to go, and r/helpme isn't really a bustling forum.

I'm going to leave my reddit up for a while in case anyone decides to pm me, it'll just be one more thing that I'm constantly staring at.

This was a little cathartic and the panic attack abated for the time being."

I have been running into many issues (such as automation) when it comes to GPO's and how some computers are under the AD and some are not.  

There are two main offices that are both separated by  hundreds of miles.  The office which I work in has the company's server, which hosts the internal website and controls the AD. The AD only affects the computers here locally, so I am only able to edit the GPO's of this office and not the office that is miles away. The other offices computers are just set up and connected via a router and what not, but they are not apart of the AD. 

I asked my boss if it would be possible to add the remote offices computers to our AD,he said while technically possible, it would be too slow since they are to demanding on the network. 

Is there anyway to mirror AD from here to the remote office using a cheap computer or something. So I can still have the other computers under the same site GPO's that we have locally? Buying another full blown server is not an option.

t40r0,5,2012-05-02,Could use some career advice.,atromic,engineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/t40r0/could_use_some_career_advice/,"I graduated in 2008 with a B.S. in Environmental Engineering. I took the first position that came my way as an Environmental Technician (all field work with zero design, modeling, or project management), and worked with the same company until recently when I left to travel for my honeymoon.


I've been looking for work for 4 months now with almost nothing to show for it (a couple interviews that went well, but no job).  I've decided that I don't want to work in the contaminated sites field again, but with my previous experience it's the only area I feel that I'm qualified for.  Right now the only positions I can find that are in my experience range don't include design, and have less responsibility/pay than my old job... I feel like I'm actually moving backward with respect to earning my PE.


I recently found out that a local community college offers a 2 year AAS degree in civil engineering technology, for under $12,000.  I think this would open up a lot of doors for me, and looking at the course requirements I see that it would fill in a lot of blanks in my skills, as well as allow me to put more effort into some important topics I blew off the first time around.  I'm one of those people who coasted through school and barely made it out.  I'm a smart person and a quick learner, but I simply didn't have my priorities straight the first time around... I feel like I'm much better prepared to jump head first into my studies in a way I should have been doing in college.


This seems like a great option for me not only to increase my marketability in a crappy job market, but also as a chance to build some essential skills I'm lacking and grow a professional network in the area (just moved to the other side of the country where I know no one). I plan to keep busy with internships for the entirety of my studies (something else I blew off while getting my first degree). Possibly the most important thing is that it will potentially keep me from getting pigeonholed and chronically underemployed in an industry I hate.


I'd love to hear some comments, criticisms, experiences, etc from engineers who have been in my place. Any obvious holes in my plan? Other options to consider?  Thanks.

t3lhg,2,2012-05-02,Was I being scammed?,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/t3lhg/was_i_being_scammed/,"It's my cakeday, and this is my first post, so I apologize if anything is incorrect, but yesterday was a very odd day for me.  I'm an actuarial science major that hasn't been able to find an internship, so I decided to find some part-full time work during the summer to try to at least make a little money.  I drove around filling out apps, and submitted my resume to a bunch of craigslist posts.

Around 6 p.m. I got a call from one of the people that I apparently submitted my resume to on craigslist.  The guy told me what his company sells credit improvement programs to people after signing them up for the HAMP program.  He interviewed me over the phone and then told me that he liked my personality and that his company was starting a new training session tomorrow and I should join.  The company sounded somewhat legit, and although I've never really wanted a true sales position, I figured I'd give it a try and at the end of the day if I didn't like it, I could bail before I was in to deep so I went.

That day, I pull up to the address that the man on the phone had given me.  It's a small office building, and as I pull into the parking lot I realize the name of the company isn't on the sign in front of the office building.  I park my car and there is a woman waiting for me with an open door up a wooden fire escape.  Once I got inside, I joined 2 other guys: one older Indian gentleman, and another older white dude with a hearing aid.  I'm not one to speculate, but he looked like he might have had some problems.  I was greeted by the man that called me over the phone and soon afterward his ""boss"" came into the room as well and introduced himself.


The entire day of training was just off.  Judge Judy was on the tv during our info session, Loud.  I was taking notes as they were explaining what it is exactly that they do, and how they make their money.  They then started instructing us on how to manipulate people over the phone.  Upon further information about the HAMP program that they are signing people up for, they tell us that you are actually not legally allowed to charge people to sign up for the program, and that we should not use the programs name when talking to people because they might just try to go sign up themselves.


After lunch, the two guys I was with didn't come back.  Instead there was a moderately attractive blonde girl, my age, that showed up instead.  At the end of the day, I left without really thinking much of it until I went home, hit a bowl hard, and got on xbox live with my dudes.  And then it hit me, that nothing the entire day felt right.  There was no sign on the office building, anywhere.  There was a woman waiting at the door to let me in.  The collection of people I was training with were characters.  The entire time I was getting training and answering questions, the boss kept telling me how smart and charismatic I am, contrary to my own image of myself.  The semi-cute blonde was suggestive when it was just us in the room.  The boss kept iterating that when we call people, they are going to think we are a SCAM, screaming scam every time he said it, making me skeptical.  And then it hit me, as I was looking at the employment contract and w-9 that they allowed me to take home to bring in today, that I could be the one getting scammed for my identity.


I decided just to not show up to the job today, mostly because I'm just really unsure as to whether or not I was getting scammed, or I guess the other possibility is that I got way to high and psyched myself out of a decent job.


Am I crazy, or does this look awkward to anyone else?

TL;DR I went in to train for a cold calling job, and left feeling like I might be the one getting scammed."

I do not know anything about the city, especially where I can find to live! Any tips about the best areas for college-aged people or specific sublets would be really appreciative. Also, I am wondering if it is okay to be without a car, or is it a necessity for getting around.

EDIT: I'm looking for a furnished apartment, as I'll only be in Sacramento June-August. I'm also not particularly keen on biking, but it seems to be a common suggestion. Is that a problem?"

Entered by: Detective John Eveanclear

--------------------------------

They say that everyone has their demons, that everyone has some sort of creature inside...but some let their demons rule a bit more than others.  
My mother once told me that I was a special boy, that I was her little champion.  As survivor of leukemia, I was held in a higher esteem in my family, told that I was more capable than other kids in my class and I should be treated as such; however I disagreed, I was just a normal boy given a second chance by some higher power.
Despite my protests and argumentative actions, my mom seemed to believe that I sought approval from the family, and constantly reassured me.  As I passed from a child into adolescence, I was driven to my fullest potential, forced into higher classes, given positions in sports that secured my future college success.  No one seemed to ask me what I wanted, always claiming that if i could survive impossible odds, that I would also make something of myself.  In my opinion, there is a difference between fighting to survive, to cling to life and to pull through an impossible situation, and making decisions that drive you to your own success.  
At age 22, I was lined up to graduate early from college, given every scholarship in the book and was offered three separate internship positions with priority choice in each of the companies;  I was offered full benefits, decent pay and work expenditures to hire on immediately at a fourth company and, without hesitation, accepted fully.  I met my wife at age 24, married her within two years and had our first child on the way by age 27.  
Now, you maybe asking why this is relevant to the situation at hand...I just want you to understand the humanity behind it.  I'm no less human than you or anyone else, in fact, i believe I maybe MORE human than most men.  The only thing that sets me apart from you, are my actions, my choices I've made, the happenings I chose to follow.  Detective, you and I are not much different...we just have different ways of expressing creativity. 
There was no trigger for my turning point, and at no given moment did I turn and decide that I would become a monster.  In fact, I had no issue looking myself in my eyes until the day that I first got my hands dirty.  
Her name was Kelsy Denner, a pretty blonde girl who had lived across from me.  Her smile always present, she drove a beautiful car, and maintained her home pleasantly.  My wife couldn't stand her, always claimed she was ""putting out too much and trying to hard"", not that it was any of her business.  Kelsy liked running every morning at 5:45AM or so; she would come out in tight running shorts, her blonde hair pulled into a tight bun, her blue eyes creased with only a slight hint of her age, the corners of her mouth began to whisper hints of her true age, but I would never believe it.  I was always out when she ran, watering the lawn, getting the mail, warming up my car, something.  She always waved a pleasant hello as she jogged past, and i always returned the pleasantry.  
On December 10th, 2010 Kelsy Denner disappeared, never to be seen again alive.  Not a single soul would say eyes on her angelic beauty again...well not a single soul besides myself.  Then again, I'm not sure it was my soul doing the looking.  
I only remember snippets of the brief time we spent together, a time she would spend gagged and blindfolded.  I don't actually remember why I did it, I just remember something telling me that it would be fun, and that same part of me urged me to.  Grabbing her was easy, she was on a jog as par her course, and I conveniently had gone for a drive.  She was about half way through her morning routine when I pulled up along side of her, as a neighbor often would, and offered her a ride home as it was looking like rain.  She agreed and thanked me for my generosity.  It began to get hazy after that, and I only remember looking down on her, hands bound with rope, tied to a metal pole in the depths of the storage facility I had rented through a friend of a friend.  No one would venture here, nor would anyone hear her screams for mercy as my many tools did their work on her...
They claimed that her body was found mutilated, I can confirm from my memory that I recall cutting her throat with a razor blade, I definitely carved symbols into her skin, and I remember the one thing that labeled me as a serial killer:  the routine that I began calling my signature....gouging out her eyes before sewing them shut.  
It gave me the feeling of an artist at a canvas.  Nothing gave me that rush besides this, but I could easily have done without it.  When the crime finished, I packed her body into a bag and dumped her in the riverbed, waiting only 26 hours for the police to bang on my door asking if i knew anything about her ""disappearance"".  
There was a part of me that wanted to yell, to tell them my crime...but there was that voice, the same one that told me what to do and how to do it, it took over.  ""No, I didnt even know she was missing really...to be honest I didn't really know her!""  A blatant lie that would seal my fate, and begin my drive to push the boundaries without being caught.  
Nathan Polestrom was a business man, someone I was not too close to, but knew in passing.  We always got coffee together and on occasion exchanged information about the weather, a game or maybe a show on television.  He was an unmarried man, no children, parents long since dead, no siblings.  In fact, he might as well have painted a target on his head, no one would miss him until they found his body on January 4th 2011, four days after I shot him, slit his throat and again gouged out his eyes, watching the pain and agony in his face as his life slipped away. 
I once heard from a wise man that the eyes hold the soul...that drove me to see how many souls i could pierce, a personal challenge that would be my eventual downfall. 
You know, the needle pierces the eyelids much easier than most think, it's actually like sewing a shirt together, or maybe a pair of jeans with a hole.  The hard part is getting them to stop squirming as you do it, they don't like it much.  
Patricia Hart, a sexy college girl.  She went to the university library often and always sat by herself, sipping coffee and typing away on her laptop.  She never stood a chance, especially when i walked up, offering a professor's guidance.  But the only profession I knew better than engineering was engineering the perfect method of termination.  That voice that drove me to kill the first two pushed me to do the same for her; but this time her body took a few days to wash up...the storms you see.  
Victims four, five, six and seven are a little hazy, i believe I may have been on some sort of narcotic and gotten sloppy, because when I looked back on the pictures I took, the needlework was a bit shotty.  I was not happy with myself and i had to find a better methodology; a more productive one....
It was sometime around June 2nd, 2011 that I picked up steam, taking five more lives in that month, all of which were a range of ethnicities, genders, ages and sexuality; all of which were practically alone, invisible to the average man.  I had no specific group i was after, just that drive to see how humanity would weep if someone so invisible would disappear; yet no one seemed to mourn their passing.  I felt like my little social experiment was going no where, no one gave a shit about the innocent...just because there was no one close to care.  
Detectives passed the cases around, looking for some connection, but failed miserably, no one would find me with the way they were looking.  Granted, I didn't look the part, a mildly flamboyant white man, thick rimed glasses, short cropped hair with a Doctorate degree in engineering, married to a beautiful young woman who had pressed for a Masters in theoretical Physics.  Who would begin to suspect a man who was almost as invisible as his victims?  No one...no one at all.  
My thirst for blood got deeper, I needed to find a way to crank up the intensity, so i began to abduct multiple victims, often pulling from multiple cities and counties.  Holding people with no connections, no commonalities.  CSI and Criminal Minds had taught me to leave no trails, though with my IQ i wouldn't have done so anyway.  
Towards the end of 2011, my death toll was holding up to 28 or 29.  I wanted a nice round 30 before Christmas, a time when I would have to go with ""family"" and spend endless hours in doors celebrating the birth of a man I could barely remember the story of.  
The determination, the perfection, the need for number 30 before I would be forced to recede for the holiday. It drove me to the brink of self destruction, i wanted it to be a special kill...not the average pull, slice, and drop...i wanted something memorable that would leave the country shivering, contemplating my next move...And i knew just the target....
Police Chief Quincey Davis Jr. was a perfect victim, but he didn't meet my criteria.  I was used to making the invisible disappear, but I would have to change my tactics to get a man of such high profile and notoriety without being caught.  Picking up a jogging girl is one thing, getting a heavily guarded police chief is another.  
I knew i could get him from a distance, but I had to leave my signature for everyone to see...I had to get his soul....
I slipped into his home late at night, cutting the power before doing so.  His confusion and frustration made him irresistible to my generously devious hands. 
The woman was a pain in the ass though, slipping in and out of the rooms, wandering in aimlessly, looking for the fuze box, hoping to find some way of reinstating the lights.  She found none, but bitched anyway.  
When he went outside to take a gander with the incoming power lines, i grabbed him, holding a rag of chloroform to his face. 
He awoke in my clutches, a dark room with chains binding his hands and feet.  Something was different about him, he was not the typical victim.  Most screamed, begging, fearing...he simply looked around, glancing up the walls, looking for something...but when i emerged from the shadows, he simply nodded.  I informed him of my intent, telling him my master plan, his response was a simple nod of understanding; as if I were a mastermind of a Batman comic about to have his ass kicked by the dark knight himself.  
My frustration mounted as he calmly told he that I was misunderstood and needed counseling.  Who the fuck did he think he was?  Misunderstood?  I could give a fuck less about being understood, i just wanted the city to understand that my little social experiment was about to hit the mainstream.  
We bantered back and forth, his calm voice attempting to sooth a demon within that was bursting with aggravation, telling me to shut him up and end his life.  He told me he knew all about me, talking about my ""cases"" and the many files he had on me and my victims.  He said he just couldn't find the once piece of the puzzle that would lead him to me, and yet if that were the case, why had they not come knocking more often?  Could he be bluffing?  
I heard a shuffling from outside, i turned to investigate and the man wouldn't shut his mouth, i needed to find out what i had heard...was i being paranoid?  
He continued to blather about my ""mental instability"" and my ""need for attention"" when i finally had enough, i taped his mouth shut and relished the silence.  
I'm sure you're aware of what happened next, because it's what put me from a local PD killer to the FBI FRINGE DEVISIONs #1 most wanted man...
I felt them....Like they were on camera or something, i knew they were there...I dont know how, and i dont know why, but I knew they were around me.  Police, lots of them...the damn Chief had obviously been bugged or something, tracked by some method...I should have thought this through more carefully.  I turned to the chief, demanding his explanation, he just smiled and said ""what did you expect?""
The rage in me build up, and i saw red.  My hand quivering in rage, I unsnapped the gun i wore on my hip and cocked it...I heard the voice in my ear tell me to do it, but for some reason, i couldnt listen...
My head started spinning when i tried to force myself to stop...I felt a force of overwhelming anger, horrid aggravation and contempt for this  man who, in his own self righteousness, had become a police chief and was simply doing his job.  
I collapsed in hysterics on the floor and blacked out...but not really...I felt and heard everything, like a projection of myself only I wasn't in charge.  Red, everything was red, i felt my hand rip the door open, a quick voice to my left said ""danger close""...danger close my ass, I was DEADLY CLOSE.  His face filled with fear as I grabbed his throat.  
""WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT? SHOOT IT!"" The SWAT team obviously had issue with me...and my appearance?  
I could not control what happened, but i remember throwing this man to the floor, breaking his neck on impact.  Storming down the hallway, I crushed another's skull in a matter of seconds, turning to another who had begun retreating.  I followed him, running at an accelerated pace, faster than humans should.  
His death was an easy one, he simply collapsed to the floor at my feet as my hands tore his flesh away; his face parted from his skull and his lifeless body fell limp.  
Three more fell victim to my hate-filled rampage, each torn to shreds with what i can only describe as super human strength...It was then that i returned to my nest.  I faced the captain who was now shaking in fear,  his voice began slightly and broke into stammered nothing...I felt his soul crush in on itself...How could such a potent man fall to such a lowly fear?  
As I raised my hands to his face, I caught a glimpse of myself in the mirror; a reddish tinge to my flesh, steam rising off my body.  My torso was splashed with blood and my chest was rising and falling extremely fast...I approached the mirror, the only one in the room;  i kept it for my victims to allow them to feel less alone between the moment of abduction and execution.  It always helped them to know they had a friend in the world...one whose fate would be the same as theirs...but this friend, MY friend was not a friend at all...it was, a monster...
I recoiled in fear as the face of true evil stared me in the eyes, i tripped backwards and fell to the floor, the image so horrible my words fail to describe it.  I passed out permanently, waking to the sound of a heavy metallic door slamming; hands bound in shackles, feet zip tied together...I looked into the now stern eyes of the Captain as he stood over me.  His mouth formed a deep frown.  
He asked me to recall the events of the previous night, but I could not...he then informed me that I had brutally murdered a squad of SWAT members that had been dispatched to protect and recover him.  He demanded I speak for my crimes, and I looked into his eyes, fear filling my soul, a shattered fragment of my once so firm self, and said: ""Help me...""
Some demons remain locked in the hearts of their captors, victims in a sense; caged animals that whisper temptations into the ears of the warden that keeps them...Others are free to roam, the wardens themselves...pushed out by traumatic experiences, forced to take over and given the rights of a human being, and in those we find the truest evil mankind can muster.

I trusted you.
When my boyfriend told me he was going to San Francisco for a weekend with his dad and staying with you for a night I was nervous, but he assured me I had absolutely nothing to worry about. I emailed you, tried to get to know you. You said you would connect me with someone who could help find me an internship there in case we both moved. I even told you that you were a good friend to him. I thought we were cool.

Then what did you do? Tried to get him to cheat on me. Tried to sneak up an kiss him because you knew it was your best shot of getting one. Pathetic. Maybe nothing happened, but you made him question things with me. When he broke up with me the day he came back on Halloween it was out of left field and broke my heart. 3 weeks of misery I endured until he realized he had made a mistake and wanted me back. Then he confessed he was talking to you and potentially there were feelings. That did not last long.

We got back together and you sat there, a thousand miles away, thinking you had successfully stolen another girl's boyfriend. You texted him, tried to send him cards, meet up with him. But he didn't go for it, did he? No. 
I could understand if I was some horrible bitch. But I'm not. I'm a social worker! I dedicate myself to helping others as a living! I may have flaws but I am a GOOD person and I never did ANYTHING to deserve this! I love him with all my heart. I support him in everything he does. I take care of him. I give him all of my love and care. You couldn't share that bond with him that I do, you couldn't go through everything with him that I have. I have stayed by his side through the worst moments of his life, moments that would have sent other girls fleeing. Even so, you tried to take that all away from me, like I'm nothing. You caused the worst three weeks of my entire life (really, the worst 3 months since it didn't stop even after we got back together). And the pain lives on. I feel it every day.

You stupid whore. I tried to establish some kind of friendship with you because I wanted to be supportive of him. AND THIS IS WHAT YOU DID IN RETURN?!?!? What kind of person are you???
I've tried again and again to forgive you, but I can't. Every time he checks his phone, his email, I think of you. Those LATE nights you tried to call him recently? I was with him. He told you we were back together but I guess you have no respect for either one of us. You are disgusting.

I hate this, I hate where I am. I've never had trouble forgiving anyone for anything, and here I am with you. I've never even met you and I despise you. You have caused me to have feelings and thoughts that make me feel disgusted with myself. You shattered my confidence and made me feel like a worthless piece of shit.
Please. Leave us both alone. Let us move on with our lives and our relationship. I care about him more than anyone else does, more than you ever could.

Leave us in piece."
t2w1e,7,2012-05-02,Is it too late to get a good internship?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/t2w1e/is_it_too_late_to_get_a_good_internship/,"I applied to many companies for a summer internship, but the only interview I got was an on-campus interview with Google (which I felt went okay, but I didn't get the job).

I recently sort of turned my life around, dragging myself out of the swamp of underachievement, 8 years at a community college after HS majoring in everything with a minor in procrastination, but I got my act together and am now doing extremely well in my CS program, 3.96 GPA... I know I could excel anywhere, now that I've learned how to put my nose to the grindstone, but I can't seem to get any interviews.

I'm guessing it's because of my lack of projects, but I've been focusing on academics since I needed to bring my GPA up to transfer to UCI, and was worried about maintaining that once I got here.

Should I give up, and just take more classes over the summer, or is there something else I could do?"

I think I'd like to find a sublet in North Charleston/Downtown Charleston, but unfortunately there doesn't seem to be any way to bike from there to Daniel Island.  While I couldn't find anything, I was wondering if any of you guys new of any special shuttles or carpools that I could maybe take advantage of.  Also, any information on getting around Charleston with just a bike would also be really helpful.

I'd also be interested in anyone who wants to carpool to Blackbaud and has a sublet available (or maybe I could find a sublet nearby).  Hopefully I'll figure something out with one of the other interns, but everything is starting to get a bit close for comfort.

t2tob,26,2012-05-02,Katharine,jaegersmith,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/t2tob/katharine/,"She looked positively darling in the early light of the grey London morning. Skin, peaches and cream, flushed rosy with fever, and he tsked in disapproval as he brushed blonde hair away from her face. The skylight didn't do her justice, he thought, knotting his silk tie around his neck. But he couldn't take any chances; he didn't want anyone else to see her.

""Goodbye, love,"" he whispered to her as he left, shutting the door firmly behind him, locking it with a twist of the silver key hanging around his neck, pulling it to make sure it is secure. On his way out the door, Emilia, his new maid, stopped him.

""That lady must be very special, Mr. Rivers, to make you forget your briefcase and miss breakfast,"" she said, smiling slyly. 

He laughed, brushed it off. ""Oh, Emilia, she is. She's one of a kind.""

""You should bring her around sometime. The house could use a lady's laughter and cheer,"" Emilia told him. She is pretty, with dimples in her cheeks and straight black hair. Her smile was infectious, and her hazel eyes crinkled at the corners as she grinned at him.

""We'll see,"" he promised, smiling back at her.

------------------------

Business was excellent as usual. He had a croissant, drank a cup of coffee - black, no sugar - as he designed yet another brilliant marketing ploy targeting the rich and famous bankers of London. He smiled at his pretty new intern, insisting she call him Neil. 

Several people stopped by his office, popping in for a little chat and a few compliments about how precise he was, how thoroughly and subtly he presented the company motto: ""Your trust means everything to us.""

Everyone said he was trustworthy, definitely the man they would trust with their money, their homes, their wives and children. Neil Rivers, an excellent man with an excellent image. He could make anyone smile.

-----------------------

On the subway on the way home, he hummed a little ditty to himself as he read The Times. ""Lots of depressing stuff,"" he commented to no one in particular. ""Lots of wars and environmental crises and disappearances.""

The lady next to him briefly nodded before turning back to her novel and loosening the collar of her white button-down. He wondered if she was reading something nasty, wondered what she would look like half-naked in his bed, her curly brown hair falling about her face, her mouth falling open with desire - 

But he couldn't think about that. He loved Katharine, and he would be faithful. He had promised her he would.

-----------------

""Emilia,"" he asked at dinner, ""would you please ask Justine to fix an extra plate of food? There's been a stray dog coming to the library porch and begging."" 

Emilia nodded. ""But of course, Mr. Rivers. Will the meat trimmings be fine?""

""That would be excellent.""

She nodded again and disappeared into the kitchen while he sat at the dining table, chewing his medium-rare steak and staring at the lovely portrait of Katharine that had arrived two weeks ago. She looked gorgeous in it - she usually did - but the portrait didn't seem to bring light to her golden hair or a blush to her fair skin.

-----------------

""Please, Emilia,"" he said after dinner, ""I am not to be disturbed. If any urgent or distressing calls come in, please forward them to the phone in the library.""

""Very well, Mr. Rivers.""

""Thank you, love."" She smiled; she liked it when the older gentleman wasn't so formal with her.

-----------------

He carefully shut the door behind him, and her eyes lit up. 

He sighed, a smile hovering around the corners of his mouth as he set the plate of leftover potatoes and meat in front of her.

""Oh, Katharine,"" he said, sitting down beside her, ""you should really eat something. I'm worried about your health.""

She ate ravenously and he clapped in delight. 

""That's a good girl,"" he crooned, running his hands through her hair. ""Oh, look, your picture was in The Times today. It appears they mislabeled the caption, though. You're not missing. You're right here with me.""

She nodded vigorously, as if to say 'Of course.'

""Well, I'm certainly glad you agree."" 

She butted his shoulder with her head. He smiled. ""How is your fever, darling? Broken? That's excellent, but we really must be more careful. You have such a fragile immune system.""

---------------

Business was excellent the next day. 

The new intern greets him like an old friend. He sits on the subway and makes more comments about natural disasters. When he gets home, he tells Emilia not to bother him and he shows lovely, lovely Katharine her picture in the newspaper again. 

Mr. Rivers is always careful.

----------------------

Emilia worries about the dog Mr. Rivers talks about. There are cars and bikes and cruel children who throw rocks at poor defenseless animals, and she wants to make sure the dog is alright. 

That night, Mr. Rivers does not smile at her, does not call her ""love."" Says he is disgusted by the corrupt morals of the bankers he works with. He does not ask for food for the dog but stomps down to his library anyway. 

She follows him after a little while, carefully holding the plate of food. It is pork chops tonight. 

Mr. Rivers is not in the library, so she sits down in a comfortable chair, sets the food on a nearby table, and waits for the dog. 

----------------

That night Mr. Rivers is not careful. He gets angry with Katharine for not answering his questions. He does not notice Emilia sleeping in his favorite armchair by the fireplace. He does not give the door a reassuring tug to make sure it is closed. 

------------------

When Emilia wakes up it is just past six in the morning, according to the softly glowing LED numbers on the mantelpiece clock. She stretches, yawns. Wonders where the dog is, is horrified when she realizes the stray will be waiting outside the door, whimpering, hanging its head and wondering why its savior is not there to feed it. 

She picks up the food, cold now, and rushes to the porch door. 

The plate clatters to the floor and she claps a hand to her mouth as the door swings open toward her. She wishes she didn't recognize the girl in the corner, bundled up in blankets and lying in a puddle of her own blood. Wishes she didn't recognize her classmate, Audrey Williams, who recommended her to Mr. Rivers, who was supposed to be in Cambodia helping orphan children, smiling back with a Glasgow grin. 

She hears a disappointed tsking behind her. 

Whips around to see Mr. Rivers, knotting his silk tie around his neck. 

""Dear me, Katharine, I thought I told you not to go poking about in my library. It's nasty business, books and numbers."" 

She doesn't have a chance to scream.

------------------

He informs job agencies that he is looking for a new maid. He tells them that Emilia quit, went to pursue a fashion design opportunity in Shanghai. Very daring, very ambitious. 

Everyone loves Mr. Rivers, is dying to be his new maid. 

He chooses one at random. Shelly Bartlett, her name is. A feisty redhead with a smattering of freckles. He likes her already.

--------------------

Shelly asks him at dinner the first night who the lady in the very large painting in the dining hall is. The very pretty lady with the straight black hair and dimples, the pretty lady whose hazel eyes crinkled at the corners as she smiled.

He smiles nostalgically. 

""Oh, that's Katharine, my late wife. She bled out, you see. Miscarriage, very tragic.""

Shelly just nods solemnly, sympathetically, and pats his arm in reassurance. 

He wipes his mouth, stands up, and tells Shelly to ask Justine to fix a plate of food for the dog."

Questions|Answers
:--|:--
[One of my favorite little ""features"" from Titan Quest was how if you saw a little goat-man running at you with some bad-ass glowing sword of doom he actually dropped it. It was awesome how mobs would actually wear the loot that was on them; will we see something like this in Grim Dawn?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t1ljl/iama_titan_quest_designer_struggling_to_launch_an/c4irfcy?context=5)|Yes, we've tweaked the system a little so that enemies can sometimes drop things that aren't equipped (although we're still trying to keep that semi-appropriate) but if they have a magic item, that item will always drop.  If it is just a common item, it can break and you won't see it but bad-ass glowing swords of doom will always drop when equipped.
[YOUR LEAD PROGRAMMER WAS IN BANG CAMARO??](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t1ljl/iama_titan_quest_designer_struggling_to_launch_an/c4isog0?context=5)|Haha, yeah Bryn Bennett, he actually left Harmonix (where he ended up after ILE) last year and is working on his own indie game.  I'm not sure what the name is yet but his studio is called Eerie Canal.  
[What aspects of Titan Quest have been improved for Grim Dawn in your own opinion?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t1ljl/iama_titan_quest_designer_struggling_to_launch_an/c4irh5z?context=5)|The biggest are mood / atmosphere and combat.  I always felt like TQ was a little flat in terms of the atmosphere.  There wasn't that sense of mystery and danger that the Diablo games do so well.  We've put a lot of effort into developing that more and creating an interesting world with a well-developed history.  We've also put a ton of effort into combat and pacing.  We've added blood / gore effects, enemy hit reactions, special deaths for some enemies, others ragdoll, zombies can be dismembered, hit sounds are crunchier, blood spatters on the ground and pools under bodies, etc.
 |There are also a lot of cool new features though.  The more open world is something I really enjoy as a player who prefers to ignore the main story and run off exploring.  We've also added more randomized elements, dynamic weather, a faction system, destructible environments - really cool busting through doors or blowing up walls to reveal hidden areas.
[By ""randomized elements"" do you mean randomized dungeons/maps? The one thing I did not like about Titan Quest was the static areas... really killed the replayability for me. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t1ljl/iama_titan_quest_designer_struggling_to_launch_an/c4ishd2?context=5)|We have a new feature we call ""setpieces"" that can be used to spawn different sets of randomized scenery or entire enemy camps complete with monster spawners and camp art assets.  This means on different play-throughs a specific location in the world could be just wilderness, couple coffin wagons surrounded by zombies, a groble camp with totems and boiling cauldrons, a cultist shrine with a bloody altar, or a traveling merchant camp.  We also use this technology to create randomized barriers in the levels that can change the slow of gameplay, so you fight through it a little differently each time.
 |Add to that, we also have new tech to randomly spawn dungeon entrances that can lead to different dungeons, which can also have randomized enemy spawns and randomized barriers. It is sort of middle-ground between totally randomized levels and the more appealing look of hand-crafted environments.  It is a bit of the best from both worlds.
[Haven't heard of this game before, but checking out your website it reminds me of that NWN and Baldur's Gate/Planescape esque style and I love those games! So I'll keep an eye out and donate to your kickstarter. :\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t1ljl/iama_titan_quest_designer_struggling_to_launch_an/c4irmh0?context=5)|I think you'll enjoy Grim Dawn then as we're going for sort of a blend of ARPG and old-school style RPG.  As a kid I loved the TSR Goldbox AD&amp;D games like Pool of Radiance, Curse of the Azure Bonds, Eye of the Beholder, etc.  I want to advance the core gameplay of ARPG while bringing some of the magic of those older games into the mix.
[Two questions, how hard is the journey from concept/idea to actual substance, IE, a working game model? I see a lot of people who start with these excitable ideas but eventually they loose steam and the idea is just vapourware.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t1ljl/iama_titan_quest_designer_struggling_to_launch_an/c4irmh0?context=5)|It is a huge challenge and one that I think inexperienced developers often totally underestimate.  The only reason we can be doing what we're doing is that we started with the sourcecode from Titan Quest, which represents about $3m worth of past development.  I've also built up a massive tolerance for working long hours, over the course of multiple years, from the development of Titan Quest - that was a brutal project.  ; )
[ secondly, where the heck do I find little indie studios? Is there a bar? A small watering hole on the web that you meet so I can see what sort of indie games people are working on? At the moment I rely on word of mouth from friends and Destructoid. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t1ljl/iama_titan_quest_designer_struggling_to_launch_an/c4irmh0?context=5)|Honestly, I'm not really sure I have any better idea than you.  I mainly only find other indie studios when read about them in articles or bump into the developers at conferences and such.  I think it is tough though to really compile any sort of list since indie can range from larger more established studios that are technically independent from publishers but not really ""indie"" and, on the other end of the spectrum, inexperienced developers right out of school or may or may not ever finish a game.
[Assuming your funding needs are met how do you intend to implement the expansion of your game studio? Will you set up offices or continue to work remotely with the new employees you intend to take on? If you choose to work remotely how do you think you will overcome the need for regular contact with all the team to ensure you maintain good momentum and direction?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t1ljl/iama_titan_quest_designer_struggling_to_launch_an/c4irivw?context=5)|It depends on where we end up with funding.  If we just barely scrape by our goal, we'll probably do a mix of working remotely and having a few people local get together at someone's house daily or at least a few days a week to help improve collaboration.  If we end up feeling like we can afford it or if we end up in a situation where we don't have quite enough to hire another full-time person, we could consider getting a small, totally ghetto office.  There is a nice abandoned building down the street that I've been eyeing.  Put a tarp on the roof and its probably good to go!
 |We've gotten pretty good at working remotely though over the past couple years.
[Grim Dawn sounds really interesting. Any info if it will be on Steam and/or when it will be released..? I realized you recently started the Kickstarter for it, but any idea what year? Are you working on your game/ game studio full time now?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t1ljl/iama_titan_quest_designer_struggling_to_launch_an/c4irljb?context=5)|We fully expect that people will be able to redeem their keys on Steam as Valve has done that with many other indie studios but, of course, they have final approval.  We think we may be able to release the alpha end of this year / early next and then are shooting for a release in August of next year.  The more people we can get helping to build out the content, the sooner we'll get the full release and the more content we'll have.
[I also bought your game Titanquest  while it was on sale on steam, and can't build up enough determination to play it. Can you think of anything that will convince me to?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t1ljl/iama_titan_quest_designer_struggling_to_launch_an/c4irljb?context=5)|Yes, I've been working on Grim Dawn full-time for about 2.5 years now along with our programmer.  Other guys, mostly friends from Iron Lore, have been helping out part-time but have to keep day jobs at other studios to pay the bills.
[Edit: typos.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t1ljl/iama_titan_quest_designer_struggling_to_launch_an/c4irljb?context=5)|Hmm, I don't know, depends on your thirst for ARPG loot goodness.  You should go talk to the folks at titanquest.net or maybe find someone to play with on the  Grim Dawn forums.  ; )
[Anything you can tell us about classes? I always felt the biggest drawback of RPGs is the facts that they have the standard Mage/Archer/Melee characters. If like titan quest, awesome, I liked that variety.  With that being said, I loved titan quest and cannot wait to play Grim Dawn. Best of luck!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t1ljl/iama_titan_quest_designer_struggling_to_launch_an/c4irrp8?context=5)|It will be similar to Titan Quest, as far as having classes that loosely fit into certain archetypal gameplay roles but with diverse themes that aren't just cookie-cutter RPG classes.  I'm also trying to build each class with more options for active, big-impact skills that are fun to use and more flexibility in terms of weapon-types.  So, for example, soldier is mainly geared toward melee but you can use all the skills with a gun / crossbow if you want, which makes for a lot more synergy with, say, the demolition class.  We also have an occultist, that is a summoning / debuff / DoT class, an arcanist that is more of a straight sorcerer style class with lots of high-damage and AoE skills, and a ""nightblade""...  names aren't quite finalized.  The last class is sort of a blade throwing assassin / illusionist.  Then we hope to keep adding new classes through expansions.  I'd love to get up to 10-12 skill masteries, or more!
[In which other game development positions did you work before Grim Dawn? You started as game tester and became lead designer for Titan Quest. What was inbetween?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t1ljl/iama_titan_quest_designer_struggling_to_launch_an/c4irgh3?context=5)|I only briefly ""worked"" as an external multiplayer tester for Ensemble and then wrote a couple chapters for their official Age of Kings strategy guide.  Talking to some of the designers there, Bruce Shelley and Ian Fischer, is what opened my eyes to the possibility of working in the game industry.  Before that, I sort of had this notion that games magically appeared and never thought about the possibility of a career in making games.  From there, I landed a job as a designer at Stainless Steel Studios working on an RTS called Empire Earth.  I was only there for about half a year then went to finish my college degree.  I only had half a semester left, so it seemed ridiculous not to finish.  Then right after graduating I was contacted by Brian Sullivan who remembered me from Ensemble and was looking for a designer.  So, I started out as the only designer at Iron Lore, moved up to lead gameplay designer on Titan Quest as we hired more designers (they felt Brian Sullivan needed to retain the lead design title for marketing purposes) and then later was promoted to lead designer on our new project.
[What happened when Iron Lore studios shut down? How and why did you guys decide to start a new company without any funding etc?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t1ljl/iama_titan_quest_designer_struggling_to_launch_an/c4is49k?context=5)|Iron Lore basically fell victim to what most often kills smaller independent studios, for various reasons, they just couldn't survive the gap between projects / line up the next paying project fast enough.  It was probably mostly insanity that promoted me and a couple others to try to launch a new studio.  I think to take on a task like that, you need to know just enough to be able to get started and make educated decisions but not enough that you fully realize how much work / challenge you're taking on.  On a personal level, I really wanted to be able to keep working on more complex, traditional games that I love and I didn't see a lot of job opportunities to do that.  I also didn't want to just sign on at a big studio where I'd have to work within all of the constraints handed down to me from above.  I'd already had enough of that at Iron Lore, despite it being a relatively small studio.  I wanted to be free to make games according to my own vision.  We also wanted to find a way to break out of that traditional publishing deal treadmill of signing a deal, losing ownership of your IP, getting funds as an advance on royalties you had to pay back before you earned any profits and always being at risk of going under if you couldn't line up that next paying deal fast enough.  It just didn't seem worth it.
[There is that ""open-world action role-playing"" statement in Grim Dawn description on Kickstarter. I have a few questions about gameplay - will there be multi-leveled dungeons with a bad-ass boss on the last floor? How the game world is made -  is it one seamless place or many different locations with loading screens between them? Are there bosses fixed to every locations or just in key scenes? Is gameplay divided on acts like in Diablo? Oh, btw, supported.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t1ljl/iama_titan_quest_designer_struggling_to_launch_an/c4irydy?context=5)|Whoa, this is a very question-dense post! ; ) We're trying to create a fairly randomized.  The terrain isn't randomly generated but we want to try to randomize the location of important content like enemy camps, boss locations, dungeon entrances, as much as we can to boost replayability.  Some bosses will occur in most fixed locations, like the bottom of multi-level dungeons but others will appear more randomly.  Most of the above-ground world is seamless and actually a large, connected expanse of land that makes geographic sense.  We've developed a new system that allows us to randomly place  entrances or portals to dungeons and different regions, some extra-dimensional realms.  Entering one of these portals nearly instantly pops you out in a new location, so there isn't really loading but it isn't quite seamless when you enter these types of semi-random side-areas. We're not planning on having acts, the game is a bit more free-form where you can access regions in different orders and sort of progress in different directions at your own pace.
[Thanks for answering, Arthur! It's a good news there's no acts 'cause it really boosts replayability from the very start. Of course, if the world is well-planned and balanced. And it's a lot easier to make expansions, just extending the world map and adding new locations with new content. By the way, how is enemy levelling going to be realized? Will player meet monsters of his level wherever he's gonna go from the start or enemy levels will be fixed for every location and if player attempts to visit high-level location, he's going to get his ass kicked in so brutal and unbelievable way he'd want to cry? And will high-level locations be open for player anytime he'd wanted to visit thenm just for the hell of it and try his luck or will they be locked until some conditions met?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t1ljl/iama_titan_quest_designer_struggling_to_launch_an/c4it4aj?context=5)|Enemy levels for each area have a min and max level.  The max level range is generally a lot higher than TQ, which allows you to play through areas at a different pace (exploring everything vs. running through) or play them in different order.  Although, there is a max, so if you run through the starting area, then come back at level 40, it will be underleveled for you.  However, if you run ahead to higher level areas, there will be a min enemy level, so that the world doesn't completely scale with you and you can encounter enemies too high level to safely take on (although you're welcome to unsafely take them on). To gain entrance to some higher-level areas, you'll do things like gather resources to repair bridges or defeat enemy checkpoints.  You can attempt to do this as soon as you manage to get the resources or are able to overcome the enemies guarding the entrance.  
[When going to school, do you recommend getting a game design degree or something more open ended like a software developer degree? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t1ljl/iama_titan_quest_designer_struggling_to_launch_an/c4irqvs?context=5)|Honestly, I don't even really know what people do in game development courses and I think most of the industry shares that feeling.  The game programs have a few schools seem to have some merit but most just seem like a quick attempt for schools to cash in on students hoping to get into game development.
 |So, depending on what type of game development career you want to get into, there are different options.  If you want to be a programmer, get a CS degree.  That is, of course, very useful in or out of the game industry.  If you want to be an artist, think about a traditional art or graphic design course but you're probably better off learning 3d on your own (go to places like polycount.com or gameartisans.org for help).  If you want to be a designer, please learn how to write!  Haha, seriously, I can't tell you how many applications I get for design positions from people who can't even write a cover letter.  I'd suggest a degree in history, English, Business or really any traditional degree, especially one that is writing intense.  Being able to think analytically, organize thoughts, and communicate effectively on paper is critical.  Plus, if your game career aspirations don't pan out (there is enormous competition now for a relatively small number of jobs) at least you have other options.  It is probably difficult to get a job outside the game industry with a degree in game development.
[I'm going to study Digital Arts and Entertainment in college over the next 3 years, I'd also like to start up a Game Development company after a small career of developing for others. I'm more interested in programming than art, but also like designing levels, mechanics and lore. If I ever get to do an internship, I'd love to go to Blizzard but chances are low anyone can get in. Do you have any suggestions before I start? How do I impress a big company like Blizzard? And how did you start off?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t1ljl/iama_titan_quest_designer_struggling_to_launch_an/c4isy3o?context=5)|One thing I can't stress enough, is make sure you take some writing courses.  It is extremely important that you're able to write clearly and correctly.  If I get a cover letter than starts out ""I'm not sure weather or not...""  it generally goes in the trash (actual example, that really happened). There are so many people applying for entry level positions that if you can't do the basics properly, I don't think anyone will read any further.  Of course, this is more important for something like design than programming or art. Another important thing is to work on something that you can use to demonstrate your ability.  If you're aiming for a programming position, develop a small game.  If you're shooting for a level design position, grab a free copy of a toolset like Unreal and create a badass level or an entire mod.  If you're specifically aiming for Blizzard, create a Starcraft II mod or something else relevant to them.  Best way to get into Blizzard though is to start at a smaller studio and do impressive work while your're there.   As an actual example, I was asked if I'd be interested in talking to Jay Wilson about the lead gameplay position on D3 about a year and a half ago.  It was extremely temping of course, so much so that I declined to even talk to him because I felt I had a commitment to see Grim Dawn though and didn't want to be lured away from that goal. How did I get started, well as I wrote above, mostly by accident.  Back when I was in college, there weren't any game development programs and few people really thought of it as a possible career choice.  It never even crossed my mind.  However, I ended up getting sucked in Age of Empires competitive ladder play and wasted away enough hours at it that I ended up as a top ranked player.  The game's maker, Ensemble Studios contacted me to help with play-balancing Age of Kings multiplayer and then I ended up writing a couple chapters of their strategy guide with Bruce Shelley.  Talking to Bruce and Ian Fischer, I started to realize game design was something I might be able to get into.  I applied there but also at a local studio called Stainless Steel, which was founded by Rick Goodman, the brother of Tony Goodman who founded Ensemble.  I got an offer from them and left college for that first design job on Empire Earth.  Eventually I returned to finish my degree and then was hired on at Iron Lore.  So for me, it was a bit of a fortuitous series of events that changed my path in life dramatically.  
[Do you code at all? What skill/experience do you wish programmers you work with had/need to be better at? And what kind of tools do you find important to the project or what kind of tools do you wish you could just pick up for a reasonable licensing fee that really aren't out there?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t1ljl/iama_titan_quest_designer_struggling_to_launch_an/c4is8la?context=5)|No, I'm just a designer who also meddles in art.  My coding skills are virtually non-existent except for the occasional crude attempts at scripting.  Rhis is our programming master-mind and could better answer this than I.
 |I think the main thing I'd wish of some of the programmers I've worked with over the years is that they'd put more thought into how they implement features.  I've found some programmers will just do the bare minimum, exactly according to the specs, and call it done.  To create robust features or tools, you really need a programmer who, doesn't necessarily deviate from the design but who has the good judgement and initiative to to take things to the next level.  It is always awesome when programmers or artists get back to you with finished work that is better than you envisioned.  That's what makes someone a real pro and a pleasure to work with.
[How much do I have to put in to get Giraffes in this game...?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t1ljl/iama_titan_quest_designer_struggling_to_launch_an/c4is24d?context=5)|At the $1k reward tier you could name something a giraffe, which isn't an ideal solution but gets you partway there.  At $4k you could request that we create a giraffe armor set and at $10k you could design a giraffe-based quest, for which we'd have to actually build a giraffe.  Of course, we reserve the right to veto inappropriate quests but giraffe's seem like a go!
[I was to ask a question in the same direction: how do you imagine the immediate future of crate (even if only vaguely\)? guess i'm more concerned with what comes after the strenuous effort that will birth grim dawn, that is... ...both if there'll be and if there won't be a zombie apocalypse...](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t1ljl/iama_titan_quest_designer_struggling_to_launch_an/c4irmjf?context=5)|Assuming there is no zombie apocalypse, which seems overly optimistic, our hope is that the profits from Grim Dawn will finally allow us to get down to proper development, with the whole team together in one place, working on awesome traditional games.  The immediate thing would be to continue work on Grim Dawn.  When you work with publishers, you don't generally own your games, so there isn't much incentive to keep working on them since you'd basically just be doing free work to for the publisher.  In owning our own game, there is a huge incentive to keep it going as long as people want to play it.  So our main focus would be expansions and improvements for Grim Dawn.  At some point further down the road, I'd love to work on a strategy game, maybe even set in the Grim Dawn universe.
[I really liked Titans Quest and will be looking up info on your new game once I get out of work. Will it include multiplayer? Co-Op? PVP?  What were your inspirations for designing he game? Any particular books  or other games that helped give you ideas?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t1ljl/iama_titan_quest_designer_struggling_to_launch_an/c4is9iz?context=5)|Yes, we'll have all the same multiplayer options at TQ and will more easily expose the PvP option for those who want to host PvP games.  If Grim Dawn is a success, we'd like to add to it with other gameplay modes, like co-op survival and possibly a battle arena if we can build closed servers. One of my biggest inspirations has been New England, the region I live in.  In autumn it is the quintessential Halloween location, complete with creepy old farms and colonial houses.  I've also been re-reading a lot of HP Lovecraft, who set many of his stories in New England.  Btw, the ""Chthonians"" are actually not directly borrowed from Lovecraft, it is derived from a Greek word Chthonious, which roughly mans ""under the earth"".  [Link to en.wikipedia.org](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chthonic)
[I'm an aspiring game developer looking to open up my own studio soon. Any tips would be nice :\)   What engine do you use for the game? or previous games?  How many people usually work on your games? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t1ljl/iama_titan_quest_designer_struggling_to_launch_an/c4ivr6p?context=5)|My top tip would be to get some experience working at an established studio so you can learn how they do things.  Aside from just building games, there is also a whole business component that goes along with running even a very small studio and for me it has been massively helpful that I was able to get involved in and was privy to some of the business end of things at Iron Lore, specially learning how to plan, schedule and budget projects.  Having an understanding of the costs involved beyond just paying wages, how to go about outsourcing, how to talk to publishers (if you decide to go that route) and how to manage a team is critically important and tough to just learn while you're doing it without making a lot of potentially disastrous mistakes. In terms of engine, Iron Lore developed their own proprietary engine for Titan Quest and we were lucky enough to be able to work out a deal to acquire it. Depends on the game, your funding and the number of talented people willing to help you out on a voluntary basis.
[A bit daunting but honest. I think many of us have a great ideas but there's so much effort that needs to be put into it... usually it's too late when you realize certain mistakes have been made and you just need to make the best of the situation. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t1ljl/iama_titan_quest_designer_struggling_to_launch_an/c4iwiki?context=5)|That is really what separates those who make it from those who don't.  I mean, talent is a factor but there are a lot of talented people out there and the ones who will succeed are the ones who are willing to put in that extra effort.
[Will Grim Dawn have a secret \[Animal name\] level?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t1ljl/iama_titan_quest_designer_struggling_to_launch_an/c4is70f?context=5)|I can neither confirm nor deny this.
[I am very interested in game development myself. What programs do you recommend to get familiar with? What classes to take? I do not know where to begin to start my path towards a career in game development. What advice can you give me?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t1ljl/iama_titan_quest_designer_struggling_to_launch_an/c4irubm?context=5)|I'd start by researching as much as you can about the workings of game studios and the different development roles.  Gamesutra is probably a good place to find articles.  Step one is to really figure out what career path you're interested in.  I sometimes get applications from people who have finished a game development course and just want a job in any position available... I'm usually not really sure what to make of those.  So, figure out where your interest lie, be it programming, art, design, production and then work on developing the relevant skills.  
[When I moved away to college, TQ &amp; TQIT is what kept my brother and I united. We were probably the only ones who pre-ordered TQIT in my town (they looked at me funny\). It really had the gameplay we liked of Diablo II, with a well-researched greek mythology theme. I really hope you guys continue your success and will be looking forward to Grim Dawn. My question is, what are the chances of making a TQ2? If there is a possibility, will it have dedicated servers instead of P2P multiplayer?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t1ljl/iama_titan_quest_designer_struggling_to_launch_an/c4is50o?context=5)|TQ2 is extremely doubtful as THQ owns the rights to the game as we'd have to cut a deal with them to work on anything TQ related, which doesn't really seem in our best interest.  Who knows though... If we can't do secure servers, I'd at least like to add the functionality for dedicated servers.  We can't do it prior to release but I think we could add this in down the road if the game does well.  I'm a big multiplayer person myself, so it really disappointed me that we were so limited in this regard on TQ.
[Who does your sound design?  And any advice for someone who is attempting to get involved in a game from the ground up?  My husband is a sound designer trying to make a break from advertising into games.  Just wondering if you had any tips.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t1ljl/iama_titan_quest_designer_struggling_to_launch_an/c4itim0?context=5)|The comment below offers some good advice - create a solid portfolio.  There are a lot of sound people trying to get into gaming and a lot of freelance sound designers looking for work, so it is a very competitive job market. One of the audio designers from Iron Lore, Dan Crislip, who now works at Harmonix and another guy, Steve Pardo, who works with him are doing out sound and music.
[Loved titan quest, but one of my two concerns (the other being the nonexistant gore\) is the difficulty level being to easy. I was blasting through the whole game running and gunning pretty much without dying until level 30 or something.  So what I'm wondering is will the difficulty level be more like titan quest or diablo 2, were I was dying pretty often and had to plan my moves for just about every encounter?  Also how is your approach to boss monsters? Any unique original abilities? Will they pack a punch (kinda like rakanishu from diablo2\) or are they more like slightly stronger monsters with better loot?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t1ljl/iama_titan_quest_designer_struggling_to_launch_an/c4iwh9e?context=5)|Death comes a little quicker in Grim Dawn.  I've balanced the combat so that you can basically kill or be killed a little more quickly if you don't watch out.  If you get surrounded, for example, you'll die a lot faster than in TQ, so tactical movement is more important.  There are also some enemies with pretty hardcore ranged attacks that you need to keep an eye out for and avoid.  We've also created a number of enemies with high-damage attacks preceded by special animations, so if you're paying attention, you can quickly get out of the way. No, the bosses definitely pack a punch.  They tend to have an array of skills that can quickly prove deadly if you let them land a couple on you or don't dodge the big attacks.  We've put a lot more effort into creating encounters where players have to think a bit and keep moving around. Finally, we've balanced ranged and melee better in terms of their relative survivability and also created enemy skills that are particularly challenging to one or the other.
[I liked a lot of things in Titan Quest, but one of my least favorite things was how LONG and grindy the game got - levelling up slowed way down, and trying to play through on all of the difficulties was an exercise in patience to say the least. Will Grim Dawn work to change this difficulty/reward curve at all beyond the open world structure, and if so, how?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t1ljl/iama_titan_quest_designer_struggling_to_launch_an/c4isdxh?context=5)|Yes, I myself was displeased with that in TQ.  I felt a sort of tedium set in on multiple play-throughs of Greece.  For one thing, the combat in Grim Dawn just feels a lot more exciting / satisfying and helps to pull you through the game.  The open world does a lot since it allows you to easily cut through areas to get ahead, instead of having to run up a long, linear road.  Grim Dawn is paced out more by increasing difficulty than the length of world you need run through.  I also feel that an issue in TQ is that the spawning system wasn't accommodating enough for different players rate of progress.  It was easy to end up out-leveling the monsters spawn, which resulted in a drop of difficulty, leading to mindless, boring combat.  The way we handle spawns in Grim Dawn alleviates that problem since there can be a wider range of enemy levels in each area.  I've also worked to make the experience curve a little more consistent so that you don't hit that wall around level 30ish.
[Are you good friends with Brian Sullivan? He was my professor for a game design class, and told us a lot about his experiences with Age of Empires / Titan Quest.  He seems like an awesome guy.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t1ljl/iama_titan_quest_designer_struggling_to_launch_an/c4is31y?context=5)|Yeah, he was a cool guy to work with.  We often butted heads on game design but I respect him and miss our long philosophical talks.  I haven't talked to him in a while and hope he is doing well.  You're very lucky to have a teacher who actually has real game industry experience since it seems like most of the teachers in these programs don't.  
[I have noticed that there is a lot of talk about the ways Grim Dawn intends to improve on Titan Quest in terms of environment and combat etc.  Titan Quest was a lot of fun for me and am interested to know what aspects of Titan Quest if any do you think are most valuable and don't need improvement for Grim Dawn?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t1ljl/iama_titan_quest_designer_struggling_to_launch_an/c4is9p5?context=5)|The thing I like most in TQ is the skill system.  I think some of the skill design could have been better but I really liked the way the system worked and we're carrying that forward.  A lot of the basic stuff will remain much the same as well and many systems are just getting minor tweaks, basically improvements that are the result of feedback from the Titan Quest community.  We don't want to go crazy and completely change the game, we just want to build on it and improve it in target areas identified by fans.
[I JUST WANTED TO SAY I LOVED TITANS QUEST. ONE OF MY CLASSIC FAVORITES ALONG WITH BFME2.  So my question. How closely do you think grim dawn is, compared to titans quest. is it a lot different? For better, or worse?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t1ljl/iama_titan_quest_designer_struggling_to_launch_an/c4isb07?context=5)|I think it is quite similar in many respects since we were building from the same sourcecode but I think we've made a ton of improvements.  Personally, I'm proud of what we did on TQ but I never found it nearly as fun to play during development as I do Grim Dawn.  So, I think people will be really pleased.  
[What is your absolute favorite game of all time?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t1ljl/iama_titan_quest_designer_struggling_to_launch_an/c4is6ko?context=5)|Oh man...  tough call The game I probably spent the most time playing was Ultima Online.  The level of interactions possible in that game were crazy and no other MMO has ever surpassed it in that respect.  Where else can you rig a poison trap in your personal tower, hide in the shadows and laugh as would-be burglars open it and then jump out to loot all the items off their corpses and put them for sale on your NPC vendor? ; ) I also loved Diablo / Diablo II, which probably played hundreds of hours of, going so far as to complete it in hell difficulty with two hardcore characters.  Also, the original Age of Empires, Warcraft 3, old TSR goldbox games, pirates on the Apple2GS, a totally obscure strategy game called Ultimate Domain: Genesia, and I could probably go on forever...
[As a lead designer, who implements the easter eggs? Are those completely last minute, or are they well thought out?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t1ljl/iama_titan_quest_designer_struggling_to_launch_an/c4iryph?context=5)|Hah, well, it totally varies.  Sometimes individual developers or small groups just sneak them in.  This can sometimes be very bad if they don't use discretion and insert something that is offensive or could result in a copyright infringement.  At one point we discovered someone had tried to put the ThunderCats emblem on something and that is a big no-no since it could result in a copyright lawsuit if it got out.  Larger, more well-orchestrated things like the secret Overlord dungeon in TQIT are group efforts that the studio knows about and lets the team put in, assuming it isn't interfering with getting the game done.

My heart goes out to everyone who's lasted long enough to see their loves once again! Indulge, have fun, but play safe, if ya know what I mean ;) I truly am happy for all you happy redditors as I owe you guys a lot. I read LD every day but I haven't posted anything yet, so here I go...

I wish I can share the joy some of you redditors are currently experiencing. My SO (20F) is coming home (Toronto) from her placement in Amsterdam, but it won't be happy times.

We've been at it for 3 years now, she moved away for university 2 weeks after we started dating (I came close to just letting her go without her knowing how I feel). Our distance factor started off at 500km. It was tough, but we managed. In January of this year, she took an internship in Amsterdam (6000km, 6 hour time difference) and talking to her became damn near impossible. We could only manage a Saturday/Sunday Skype call. This seemed to take a greater toll on her than me, I was much busier with school and work. I barely got a moment's peace during a typical week. Her schedule was more more regular, and often left her alone with nothing to do.

It begins to turn sour when I find that she's completely gone from Facebook and Twitter. I try emailing and calling but to no avail. When I do manage to connect with her, she says that she blocked me these sites to help cope with my absence. I wasn't a fan, but I mustered up enough understanding to accept it; she simply doesn't want any reminders of how lonely she is there.

One day, I was upset for some reason and needed to talk. She listened, but I would've got more consolation from a wall. This is very unlike her. She said she has **suspended her feelings for me** to make the LDR easier for her. Another large pill for me to swallow.  

Time goes by and she seems well, she manages to stay positive from what I can observe. I'm a wreck though, I look at her and think about how staged and superficial our conversations are. She doesn't get upset at my absence anymore but there is no more compassion in her. She used to call me, in tears, in the middle of the work day to say how much she misses me. It broke my heart but I felt we really bonded in those moments, as short as they were (supervisors don't can smell a non-business call from miles away).

We talked about having to make sacrifices but I would never stop loving her. She seems okay with me knowing she ""doesn't love me right now."" :'( 

So. In two weeks or so, I'll have the opportunity to visit her at the 500km location, she has completed her work-term. I'll be in the same room as her for the first time in 8 months but I'm not excited. I plan on having a very serious talk with her. I've decided to put everything on the line.

A humblr request:
Help me prepare for this pivotal weekend because my feelings are all over the place. Is it possible for someone to simply suspend their love and get it back later? Or is it wiser to just end things things with her while she doesn't reciprocate my feelings? 

**TL;DR my SO ""Suspends"" her feelings for me to ease LDR pains, I don't like that, she seems fake now. I'm visiting her soon and I may break up with her. Please advise.**

t2fml,7,2012-05-01,[FR] The key to getting better? Going out and pushing yourself consistently. (long),[deleted],seduction,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/t2fml/fr_the_key_to_getting_better_going_out_and/,"This is a bit long. Scroll down if you want a recap of lessons learned at the end. It's been a while since I've written anything here. School's been insane, but I'm in New York for an internship and decided that I want to take the opportunity to develop myself as much as possible. I've been going out with a group of sedditor, all of whom are great guys and much better than me (but I'm catching up). I'll refer to them by their reddit accounts for privacy sake: Red_Alt, Mr. Blond, and solonyc. My sticking points are many but I will highlight them, along with any other salient points, for your edification and discussion.

**Saturday Night, Clubbing in New York**

I met up with Red_Alt and a couple of his college friends in the Meatpacking District, New York's clubbing area. Red's friends aren't into pickup, but seem like decent fellows. Red is on his last night of 59 consecutive sarging days, and the progress that he has made is phenomenal. We can't get into the usual place because the usual bouncers that we're friendly with aren't there, and we have too many guys. Instead we go a nearby beer garden and meet up with Mr. Blond, who is also at the end of a 30 day challenge, and generally kicks butt. 

**Brazilian Beer Garden**

We break after Red yells at us to open, looking for sets. He's charging through the place opening left and right and I need to get my ass in gear. I sit down with a mixed 4 set, 3 girls 1 guy, and talk for a minute before I get blown out pretty hard. Red points out a lone HB6.5 and I sit down and introduce myself. She must have had the prettiest damn eyes I'd ever seen, we're talking Jack Donaghy shit here. She doesn't know what to make of me at first, but I word vomit my way through and she eventually hooks. Her HB5 friend comes back with their drinks and is really confused by my presence, but I draw them both in, especially when I find out that one's a law student in Brazil, and the other just graduated from there. I get really excited because I just found some lawyers to network with. Their HB 7.5 friend sits down next to me and I've found my target. She's also Brazilian, in college here. 

Red_Alt and Mr. Blond join us and we have a good rapport going with the group. However, we're not locking in or isolating, so some of the energy is wasted. For instance, Mr. Blond and I are alternating between talking to the 5 and the 7.5, so I'm not progressing as quickly as I could have. I am however getting good kino with my arm around her shoulder and our legs and hips touching. By the time I get to kinoing around her face I know I need to isolate. I straddle the bench and face her and put my arm around her. She's still facing perpendicular, which is far from ideal, but at least her eyes are locked in mine. I ask her, as a communications major, what my body language says about me at that moment. She basically says I'm very open, and the fact that I'm looking her in the eye means I want to see her naked. I jokingly ask what she looks like naked (Red thinks this was a mistake, he's probably right). We start playing at a scenario where we're going to have a one night stand in the bathroom and eventually I take her hand to isolate (this is still a game, F-closing in the bathroom wouldn't have been feasible in this venue). She must have given the signal to her HB6.5, because she suddenly says she needs to go to the bathroom too. So much for isolating. I joke that we're going to have a 3-some and take both their hands. HB7.5 jokes that we're going to do it in a photobooth, so I lead her in, but as soon as we get in she hugs me, pecks me on the cheek, and runs off to the bathroom. I should have just grabbed her hand, pulled her in and kissed her, but frankly I had no idea what I was doing and was scared shitless up to that point. When we get back to the table I get the lawyers' email addresses because I genuinely do want to expand my network. I try to time-bridge with HB7.5, but she won't give me her number. 

**Rub-a-dub-dub**

I collect Red's 2 friends and go to meet Red, Mr. Blond, and solonyc who had previously bounced to a club. They'd managed to BS the bouncer into letting them in by saying they knew the DJ. I try the same line but they say we need girls. The sedditors come out to help us out, and I leave Red's friends to wait for them while I look for girls to get us in. I hook with a 3 set sitting in a lounge/bar but they don't seem like they're up for clubbing. I get blown out HARD by a Japanese 2-set on the street. Eventually we see a two set going towards the club, and at Red's urging I run after them and catch them in line. They don't think they can get in, so I propose that since I need girls, and they need to know the DJ's name, we team up. They're not going for it, but as we get to the front of the line I put my arms around them and say to the bouncers, ""you said I needed girls right?"" They look at me, look at them, ask who the DJ is, and let us in. I'm thrilled, and the girls are very impressed. I introduce myself but let them go so I can get in touch with the guys. The sedditors get back in because they're stamped, and Red's friends are able to BS their way in with 1 fewer penis holding them back. 

My night is fairly uneventful after this. I open a bunch of sets, get blown out of some, have good interactions with others. In just a few weeks of sarging with these guys my AA in the bar setting has mostly melted away. I used to be afraid of not knowing what to say, but now I know I can just word vomit until I find something that hooks. If the set doesn't hook and I get blown out, it doesn't bother me in the slightest. 

The other guys are having very good nights. Red's friends jump in the large hot-tub that is in the corner of the dance floor and start a wave of chodelier dudes and topless women in after them. The sedditors are opening any sets we can. Mr. Blond is feeling really low energy but pushes through like a champ. When we're up on the rooftop bar, at least 2 sets open solonyc for a cig. He eventually escalates with one so far that he picks her up and starts making out. Red proceeds to make out with her friend. 

We eventually go to the dance floor. Remember how I said I have very little AA at the bar? Well it turns out that confidence is context-specific, because I feel fucking *uncomfortable* on the dance floor. Like I just don't belong there. It ruins my state, and generally sucks, but I know I need to *make* myself comfortable there, so I force myself to stay in, just dancing by myself. And in a way, it works, because at the start of the night I couldn't imaging grabbing a girl and dancing with her on the dance floor, but by the end I was at least contemplating trying. By focusing on the short term goal of just being comfortable with myself in that setting, I freed myself up to make progress. 

Solonyc is dancing with basically anyone he pleases, makes out with at least 5 girls, and gets a ""double make-out"" (not entirely sure what that is, 2 consecutive?). Red_Alt is grinding up on girls, and by the end of the night is making out with one against the wall while solonyc works her roommate. It's 4 O'clock and I'm exhausted. Mr. Blond and I head out, Red and Solo follow with their girls in tow. I hear there was no F-close, but damn did it look like it was going to happen. 

**Executive Summary**

Lessons learned: 

*Confidence is context-sensitive and you need to develop it in contexts where you don't have it. If you don't like the dance floor, get on the damn dance floor. 
*Worry about developing skills, not outcomes. I don't get down on myself when I get blown out or don't get a number, because I at least I got to develop my skill set further. Now that I can approach and transition I can worry about isolating and escalating.
*Word vomit.
*Push yourself. I'm still self-conscious when I talk to girls who are taller than me. Both the girls who I got into the club with were at least 3 inches taller than me, if I hadn't talked to them I would have spent the night putzing around on the street. 
*Lock-in and isolate as soon as you can. If you fail, oh well.

tl;dr: Tried to isolate with a Brazilian college student, BSed my way into a great club, felt awkward on the dance floor, saw boobies.

Apologies. 

I've been working at my job at a major university medical center for 2 years (+ internship) and this was my first job after graduating with my bachelors degree. Even as an intern, I began taking on leadership responsibilities in my department because there was no one there taking care of them and that is just my personality to organize and get things done. The department manager/lead had left about 2 years before I was hired and they never hired or promoted a replacement. The other people in the department had basically been ""sharing"" the management load, and it was basically complete chaos when I came into the picture. 

In the time that I've been there I've taken on pretty much all of the roles of department manager (including managing a bunch of medical equipment, computers and databases which isn't even in my field of study but I have worked so much with them over the last year that I am more qualified than anyone else in the entire institution to work with them, and I'm thinking of even going back to grad school to get a degree in IT just for the extra qualifications) while still making starting ""just out of school"" salary. I do the work because it needs to get done, it makes me feel better to be organized, and this is my career and passion and it makes me feel good, damnit. I love what I do. However while everyone in the institution regards me as the manager when it's convenient for them to, in the end I have no authority so I get undermined fairly often when trying to accomplish things, which sucks.

The people I work with directly know exactly how much I bust my ass on a daily basis to keep that place up and running but unfortunately the administrators and the people who count do not. I think they may be a bit put off about having a specific manager for my department because of the person that left 4 years ago. They have another manager ""covering"" my department but she doesn't have a clue about anything that we do, and doesn't really do anything to manage us at all, except dictate when we can take our vacations...

So I'm looking for advice from professional people about how I can go about this situation. Obviously I feel that I deserve a promotion and a raise (did I mention I'm nearly drowning in student loan debt? yeah...) We just recently got a new Chairman (of the department - this is a medical center, so he is the main doctor overseeing the entire department) Obviously we have an HR lady as well, but she's not exactly approachable. I have always gotten weird vibes from her, like she never really wanted to hire me in the first place, and that she sees me and the rest of the staff as not very professional people. There is also a practice manager, who is my highest superior manager. I'd like to go direct to the chairman, but won't if people tell me that is inappropriate. Like I said, I am completely new at all of this. 

 **TL;DR: I work REALLY hard at my job at a university medical center and want to ask for a promotion to manager, since I basically do all of the work of one. Halp?**"
t5vvk,3,2012-05-03,Questions about switching into CS from a BA in technical theatre,randiculous,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/t5vvk/questions_about_switching_into_cs_from_a_ba_in/,"A bit of background here: I'm about to get a BA in Theatre Tech, but the job I've applied to come fall is a no-go.  I haven't been having much luck so far finding a job and I'm really starting to think the Theatre lifestyle might not be for me.  I hate the idea of traveling from job to job all over the place all the time with no time off and only barely being able to make ends meet.  

My ""back up plan"" was to gtfo of my hometown area where I've been going to school, and try and get a BS in CS (or something that would make me just as knowledgeable and marketable in the CS field).  My theatre background is in lighting design, and I've taken a few math courses while in school so far that I think will help me get a start in a CS degree (Applied Calc, Calc I and II).  

I'm very self-motivated when I have time to learn new things (which once I graduate, I cannot wait to have) and I love problem-solving, math, and would some day like to work in engineering the software behind lighting technology (consoles, automated lights, etc).  So far, I've already figured out that I'm also a pretty quick learner when I put my mind to it, so I'm hoping to see if I can get the training I need quickly.  

I was wondering if there was any advice out there for what I should do?  I'm hoping to also relocate in this process to Seattle or Silicon Valley / Bay Area (especially as they seem to be good places to get into CS).  I apologize if this seems a little rambly, I'm not even sure what questions I should be asking, but any advice would be helpful:

*What degree program would be best? CS, Computer Engineering, Software Engineering, Some sort of combined program with Math and CS?

*Good / reasonably affordable schools? (preferably Seattle or SF Bay area)

*How hard will it be / how long will it take to get a BS if I already have a BA and a few math classes under my belt?

I'm also interviewing for a summer internship with a major lighting console manufacturer, ETC, next week.  The position is in sales, but I'd do anything to someday work in their R&amp;D department developing consoles and such - any advice on how I can maximize my networking within the company if I land the internship?

What happend was me and my friend were working together to complete one of our student interns impossibly long homeworks (a usual, he gives us too much homework for an student to be able to do, and im not just saying that because he wrote us up). So we were working together like everyone in the class does and we had a few lines here and there that were similar. He feels this is enough to write us up. This occured 1 day after me and my group of friends was called into a meeting with us, him, and a principal. In this meeting did he not only act like a 5 year old by saying ""they never listen to me when I talk"" but blatantly accused us to make us look bad. Also, in the message my mom recieved regarding being told of my referall it said this is the third (keyword: THIRD) time we have been in trouble for this. This is the second. What was the other? A 1 line similarity in an essay between me and the other kid. Not only did he lie about the amount of times he has blamed up for this but the first case was dismissed after resolving it with our regular teacher because it wasnt enough to consider plagarism. How can I deal with this disgusting intern teacher or mine? He is clearly out to get me because he has nothing else better to do.

The friend of hers backed off and told my GF to also. Whilst nothing is, or was, going on he had my best interest in heart. This BFF told my SO that he couldn't maintain friendship with her because he was worried about me. (My perception, interpretation, feelings, jealousy, threat... you get the idea.) Which upset my partner. He had inferred that because of my irrational and unjustified animosity, he had to sever ties. This intern upset my GF. 

He is one of her closest and only, (no malice intended,) friends. They're close and admittedly, i felt threatened. So going against all my fibres, and my pride... I drunk dialled him tonight. I laid it out.

I have to be honest. I couldn't be more at peace with the dude. Legitimately charmed. Though my hang up is should I have called? I wouldn't take it back though is it justified?

As we got to know earlier, Diablo 3 is launching for each zone at a different time. For Europe, its going to be at midnight (central european time). The asian release falls together with the opening of the US servers, which is several hours later.

Seeing as European servers open up first, does this mean that I can immediatly login to these when they open, in my case at 6am? If that is the case, wouldn't that mean that the European servers will be flooded with people from the US? Anybody got any information about this? Much appreciated!"

",nonquistadora,lgbt,https://www.reddit.com/r/lgbt/comments/t4i2j/i_am_a_23_yr_old_queer_woman_doing_an_18000_mile/,"As the title states, I'm 23, queer, and a woman.  I traveled to West Africa two summers ago and was very aware that being queer/out/open was not as casual or safe as I am used to.  Though my muslim host in Togo was very open and accepting, I am unsure about what to expect on my upcoming trip.  

My trip is an 18,000 mile solo ride from Vancouver, B.C. to Ushuaia, Argentina.  I'm doing it on my KTM 690, opting for campsites and couchsurfing hosts over hostels and hotels.  I'm looking forward to CSing in Latin America because it's easy to find LGBT friendly hosts.



About me:  I recently graduated from Arizona State with a BA in Global Studies and a BA in Political Science.  I'm doing this 18,000 mile trip to research and develop a sustainable bike coop that integrates permaculture food systems, malaria prevention, and easy and affordable access to transportation to alleviate poverty in rural communities (primarily focusing on developing countries).  I've traveled a bit before.  My first time outside the US was my internship for my Global Studies degree in Ghana and Togo.  I was in a group of 8 women, 4 of whom identified as queer. No one was out to any of our Togolese counterparts (30 young men from the University of Kara and University of Lomé), but there were a few occasions where I had conversations about being accepting towards all humans (recognizing common humanity) and  there was an implied acceptance of homosexuality on behalf of my Togolese friends. 

My ex girlfriend is a women and gender studies and justice studies double major.  I am really into feminist discourse and queer theory as a result of endless nights spent helping her with her homework.  I want to keep an eye out for transborder queer issues - I am actually hoping someone reading this could point me in the direction of some academic reading on this topic - and document my own experiences as a traveling queer woman.  

So, I want to open up some dialogue about what to expect/what issues to look out for...

I'm not as concerned with personal safety, and am not looking for advice on that.  I am more interested in queer theory, transborder identity, etc. 

As a general rule, I value safety over pride.  I am planning on passing as straight when I don't see a big gay presence, and being myself when I see other out queer locals.    I plan on wearing a ring, as my experiences with suave young men in Costa Rica last summer showed me that a ring is much more effective than a million ""No, not interested"" letdowns. 

 
Also, please feel free to ask me anything.  I need feedback and I appreciate new things to think about

t4ch7,44,2012-05-02,"Having a rough time, need to vent to those who understand.",[deleted],gamedev,https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/t4ch7/having_a_rough_time_need_to_vent_to_those_who/,"Hey Gamedev, things have been pretty rough for me in the last few years and I really just needed a place consisting of like minded people to really hear me out and give any advice they think they can. Sorry if some details are vague, don't exactly want this everywhere. Here goes...

I got my start in the game industry a couple years ago doing some mostly free game testing. I thought ""Hey! I like to break games! This will be totally awesome!"", I loved working at my job, and I loved the people I worked with, including my boss.

I used to go home every day and tell my friends and girlfriend how awesome my boss was, how much positive reinforcement he gave me on everything I did and how he went out of his way to tell me how good of a job I was doing no matter how easy I thought it was. Turns out I was pretty talented in learning the game engine and picking up technical knowledge I didn't previously have after being told just once. As you can imagine I felt pretty good about this. Not only did I get my break into the industry, but It turned out I was actually really good at my job!

After even just a few months I moved up in the ranks at the company, acquired my own interns, began to manage more, took on more responsibility, and started to give design input. Things were great.

Little did I know, things were about to take a turn for the worst.

Like most small studios, funding was always an issue. Late paychecks, no pay for months at a time, half-checks, IOUs to backpay. All that is fine, but the person in charge (lets call him Chris) didnt understand that when you dont pay people, you have to back off a bit on what you expect from them.

Chris started threatening jobs the moment he got wind that people were unhappy about our financial situation. One employee only said that he didn't want to work on the weekend like he was asked to and Chris became irate, pulling him into a conference room and yelling at him about his job security.

What were we to do? Everyone was afraid for their job, no one was getting paid, and they owned us money. Why should we work 50+ hour work weeks for a Tyrant? What happened to the boss that I enjoyed talking to? The one who told me how good I was doing at my job. Its as if he completely changed into another person in a flash.

Our crunch time was about 10 weeks working 70~ hours a week, sometimes more for the testers. There was zero sympathy towards anyone, no promise of bonuses, only fear for your job. For most people this was their first title, their opportunity to break in, and this is what they were faced with. Fear.

We got through it though. But not without several emotional breakdowns not only from myself, but from others. I blame this forced labor for the failure of my last 6 year relationship simply because I was no longer able to live outside of my office. 

There is no way to describe my dedication to the project more then one particular situation. We were coming up on a very important deadline (they were always important to Chris) and I still had a good bit of work to do. I got the news that my very close first cousin had died and he was having his ashes spread in the coming weeks. I was so afraid for my job, and being verbally abused that I did not ask for the time off to attend my cousins funeral. I never told Chris about this, and I keep it in my back pocket for when I want to let him know just how fucked up he is and how much I hate him for making me feel that way at that time.

Fast forward some time... The game is out, it did really well, we made a lot of money and got great scores across the board. All the while Chris still demanded 50 hours work weeks post-release. Where was our bonus? Where was our time to relax after all that hard work we put in? 

I have no problem moving on to DLC or the next project, but why do I feel like I am still crunching? Why are you setting unrealistic deadlines months and months after the game has been out and even our post launch DLC racked in stacks of cash!? Why are you so oblivious to the fact that everyone at your studio is unhappy, angry, still in fear, stressed, and more importantly unhappy with wages?

At one point after release some people left the company. They didn't like the direction the game was going and were very unhappy with the business practices of the company. In that time Chris seemingly realized that he was breaking his studio apart. I was not there for the meeting that day, but I listened to the 2 hour recording where Chris told everyone on the team to not worry, that things were going to get better. Hours would go down, wages would go up, and that if anyone had any concerns to issue that he would openly listen to them.

This was all a lie. And everyone knew it. But again, what were they to do? For most this was their first project, they still had resumes to build, years of experience to gain, families to feed. They could not simply up and leave.

Fast forward to today... 7 or so people have left the company all under the same understanding that it was simply because they hated Chris, his way of running the company, and the way he treated people like dogs and not human beings. I was one of them.

After I left the company I left like a new person. I not only had my life back, but I was healthier, happier, and stress free.

I readied my resume and started scouting for jobs a.s.a.p! After applying to 10-12 studios as either a Associate Designer or Senior QA (what I was most comfortable doing) I began to also setup meeting with HR personnel on LinkedIn for the upcoming GDC in San Francisco.

I had never been more excited to meet with companies that seemed interested in bringing me on to their teams despite only a few years experience and only a few shipped titles. Big companies too, ones whose games I've played all my life.

I went to my meetings, scowered the job pavilion, gave out tons of resumes and business cards, spoke with big names that loved the game I had help create. Although I did not get any direct offers while there, I felt like I was really on my way to a new job.

But with every climb up hill, there is always a downward slope on the other side...

I emailed just about every person I met at GDC, thanking them for meeting with me, making sure they knew I was interested in working with them, and stressed that if they needed anymore information from me or just wanted to talk with me more that I was always available 24/7.

I waited... and waited... and waited... then...

""I'm sorry but we have decided to go with another candidate.""

""We have decided that you were not an exact fit for the role we are looking to fill.""

""While you meet all of the qualifications that we are looking for, we have decided to wait on filling this position.""

""We had a great time talking with you and want to thank you for attending our private mixer (that we invited you to) but at this time we are looking for someone with a more defined skillset.""

""We will keep you in our database in case something comes up.""

""We will keep you on file.""

There was one company left that I had not heard back from yet. I had attended their private mixer, talked the talk, walked the walk, had every one of their employees introducing me to another one saying ""You got to meet this guy!"" After GDC I was still casually in conversation with some of their leads via email, I didnt think it could get any better.

""This is the one... I got this one... Its in the bag..."" I told myself as I waited patiently for that email telling me to pack my bags and start the rest of my life.

I got the email. It was long. Much longer then any other email I had received in this whole journey. My eyes began to water, my heart began to pound, and I put my face to my desk and cried.

(Literal Quote) ""Your experiences and qualifications are impressive.  After much deliberation in considering all of the candidates, the team has decided to move forward with another applicant.  This was a very difficult decision.  Your extensive skill-set was not a direct match to the current needs of the team.  Please know that we respect your many talents and sincerely appreciate your time and consideration.""

My girlfriend came into the room and I wept for hours. I really thought I had it. I did everything right. This was my last chance.

My savings were almost depleted, I had no job, and had no choice but to return to the company that I left to seek greener pastures.

I told my self that this time I wouldn't let things get to me. I would just do my job, go home, and forget about work. Work for the paycheck, nothing more nothing less. But that's simply not the case... I still feel exactly how I felt when I left the first time... Stressed, angry, resentful. I still get verbally abused, watch others get abused, and continue to hate every day that I have to be in that office.

I've still been applying for new jobs. Nothing has come of it yet, but I have my chin up. I have plans to attend E3 again and will hopefully get another opportunity to really get myself out there and meet more people like I did at GDC.

Thanks for taking the time to read this, its great to get it off my chest."
t48fz,1,2012-05-02,I NEED ADVICE REDDIT!!! What do you do when you have feelings for a father and his son?? ,oops_imtardy,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/t48fz/i_need_advice_reddit_what_do_you_do_when_you_have/,"So I have been racking my brain over this for weeks and I honestly do not know what to do. I met both of them about a year ago doing an internship, I've always had a crush on the father but he is 21 years older than myself and I never acted on any of my feelings. Then I met the son about two months later and he was like a miniature version of his dad and I really started to like him the more I was around him. Anywho after I left the internship and came home I only talked to the dad occasionally about general stuff until around February. He came out and said he'd had feelings for me and he wanted to see where they went and stuff. We started talking a lot and when he came down for his birthday I went to stay with him for about 3 days and we had sex. I was fine with all of that until I saw the son and I felt like I had been sucker punched and my feelings for him came back. After that weekend I've talked to the dad almost every day and I do have feelings for him and I love him. However on the flip side of that I do have feelings for the son and I love him too. I've gone back and forth with this and talked to friends about what to do but no one really has solid advice and it's driving me crazy. So I figured I'd try reddit since I've seen the advice you've given to people before."

t7hgq,9,2012-05-04,Tren Bastion Birth Story (Planned C-Section w/Complications),Kibure,BabyBumps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BabyBumps/comments/t7hgq/tren_bastion_birth_story_planned_csection/,"As previously posted I have several complications that really limited my choices on what to do.  I could have had a natural birth but if there were any complications at all the likelihood of serious consequences for both my son and I went sky high.  Especially if I needed an emergency C-section.  So to ensure the safest delivery for both my son and I we chose to schedule a C-section for April 27th, which was my 39 week mark.  

One of my complications is two stainless steel harrington rods in my back that cause my spine to be immobile from my neck down almost to the bottom of the spine.  The fusion ended just above the area where a spinal block would be placed, so we risked an X-ray and prepared for the anesthesiologist to attempt a Spinal Block.  My husband and I arrived at the hospital at 10:30 to begin the preparations for the surgery.  An omen of how the day was going to go should have been when it took four sticks to get the IV in place.  

Now before I continue, I want to say that the hospital I was at is brand new and extremely well staffed.  There was no time that I didn't feel like I was in very competent hands.  After all of the drama earlier about which hospital was going to accept me I am very glad I ended up where I did despite the 3 hour drive each way.  

About 12:30 I was taken back to the operating room, with hubby waiting outside in the waiting area for the time when he could come in.    I sat up on the OR table and had to lean forward and try to arch my back. With the two metal rods there was no chance that was happening.  As the anesthesiologist tried to set up the spinal block we find out that the x-rays were never received by the hospital despite setting up to have them sent several times in the three weeks since they were taken.  After about 30 minutes and multiple attempts we finally had to face the facts that a spinal block just wasn't going to work.  

So on to General Anesthesia!  This was something we wanted to avoid due to the breathing complications I had during the pregnancy.  They laid me down and started the prep.  I remember them placing the oxygen mask over my face, and that's when I started having breathing problems.  I tried to tell them that the mask was not letting me breathe enough, and that I felt like I was suffocating.  They insisted I was fine because my pulse ox was 97%.  They turned on the dream gas and I started choking.

Now, I was out for this part so I didn't know what happened except what was told to me.  With General Anesthesia the husband isn't allowed in the OR until a specific point at the hospital I was at.  Apparently an Intern did not get the memo and he brought my husband in too soon.  I was laying on the OR table cut open, pale, and barely breathing according to my husband.  It only took seconds for the doctors to realize my husband was in the room and yell at the intern to remove him.  From what I understand at one point my husband tried to  punch the intern for showing him that and he had to be watched by security for the rest of the operation.  Unfortunately when he was being brought in at the right time apparently the anesthesiologist was busy trying to keep me breathing (breathing treatments and oxygen I have heard) so he was ushered out quickly again.

Despite all the breathing problems I had during the procedure my son Tren Bastion was born at 1:53pm weighing 7lbs 12oz and 20.5 inches long.  I finally got to see him just after 3pm, and was able to start breastfeeding him then.  My prolonged time in getting treated after the surgery kept me from him but we still managed to keep the nurses from jumping the gun and feeding him.  Mostly because he is one of the sweetest and most well behaved babies I have ever met.  He is easily soothed and wasn't even crying or upset about the wait when they finally let me have him.  

I was kept in the hospital for four days, and they were considering keeping me more but I drew the line because there wasn't really much of a reason to continue to keep me.  During the whole time Tren has behaved so well.  The only issue we have had is that Tren is more adjusted to a night time schedule, but I believe that is because during the pregnancy I worked as a Night Auditor.  This really hasn't helped my husband though because we have a hell of a time keeping him asleep at night.  He normally latches and feeds well but during the late night/early morning he will often refuse the breast or refuse to sleep in his crib.  So far most of the nights I have ended up holding him for a good portion of the night as it is the only way he will sleep and not disturb hubby.

TL;DR: Had a planned C-section that didn't go as planned and ended up with breathing complications during the surgery.  Baby was delivered healthy and happy anyway."
t7bjl,14,2012-05-04,How to motivate oneself in searching for a job? (wall of text inside),TraceDicky,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/t7bjl/how_to_motivate_oneself_in_searching_for_a_job/,"Ok reddit, I need some input and or/advice on motivating myself to actually seriously start looking for a job. I am aware that what i am about to write might seem immature, that i am a somewhat spoiled and selfish condescending prick, and that there are people out there who would jump at the chance to get any work, especially these days. Before you critique the hell out of me however, keep in mind that i do not want to remain in the mindset which defines me now.

First, some background info. If you aren't interested in this, please skip the next 5 paragraphs.

 I am not a native speaker, and live in a shitty little country. I have degrees in sociology and cultural anthropology. I am 26 years old, and if you don't take into account the kids I've tutored, some odd translation jobs i did etc. i have one year's worth of job experience. 

Financially, i was never demanding - during high school and college i had scholarships which helped my family make end's meat. Here  academically successful students do not have to pay college tuition fees, and apart from that i spent every day commuting from home to college (about an hour there and another back) so i didn't have to pay for housing and stuff like that.

This is perhaps the source of my first problem - lack of tangible college experience. Sure, i went to all the classes, turned in my assignments and passed my exams, but never participated in extra curricular activities or various other small opportunities which might have given me more insight into the practical side of things. I thought that fulfilling my obligations, as well as not being a financial burden was enough.

I graduated fairly quickly, and started looking for work. Honestly, i never broke my back sending away resumes, or going on job interviews. I did send out some, but for the first couple  of months i thought i was entitled to  vacation after busting my balls at  completing college. 

The months turned into a year, that year, and after some time, i got offered two jobs at the same time, well, both were internships really. So, i took one working as a curator in a local museum. After working there for a year, i was supposed to gain insight into the workings of the place, get some job experience and go job hunting again. I am sad to say that, in spite of my real initial enthusiasm, the attitude of my coworkers and my mentor there left me disappointed - i was  perfectly willing to learn first hand, and they obliged themselves to provide me with what i would need. They didn't deliver, leaving me disappointed at having spent a year there and not learning enough in that time about a job i wasn't that keen on anyway. 

Here i am, 5 weeks after the end of that year, need to start looking for a job again, and am just sick and tired of it before i even began. In a nut shell, i take offence with how the ""real"" world works in regards to this. Now comes the whiny rant.

I am an introvert, and am a bit socially awkward, so it irritates the hell out of me how people expect you to be super excited, motivated and grateful at the prospect of actually getting a job doing something which you do not want to do, or where you can't seem to get ahead. It insults me as a person to be expected to be excited at the prospect of working not for pleasure or for insight, but for the ""privilege"" to rinse and repeat this every day for god knows how long. If i am to work, i wish to do so in order to provide a better life for myself and my family, and not so i can come home feeling like complete and utter crap while the best i have accomplished is maintaining status quo.

Now, i don't necessarily have to have a dream job in order to be content. I have three criteria for a job i would deem acceptable, any one of which would be enough. 1.) a collegial, cooperative and helpful working environment. 2.) a job where i can grow as a person and as a specialist, or if all else fails 3.) a job that offers enough monetary compensation for me to put up with the crap. Presenting this to some people i know resulted in looks of confusion and/or veiled condescension, along the lines of “how dare you have demands such as this” I seriously doubt that any of the 3 is unreasonable or unrealistic. 

A big part of the problem is that i feel mentally burned out. There are certain tensions within my family which stress me out on an almost daily basis, and if you couple that with bouts of depression, inertness and apathy, you have a recipe for stagnation.  That is not to say i am doing absolutely nothing about my situation – i talk with friends and acquaintances about looking for a job, i search the wanted ads on a semi-regular basis, I’ve set up an interview with one of my former college professors for next week seeking guidance on what i can do in regards to a potential career in sociology.
 Still, i can’t help but wonder why i bother doing this, at the same time chastising myself for not doing more. 

Speaking of pursuing a career in the fields i have degrees in, i feel that, in spite of being “successful” as a student, i have gained little in ways of actual competence. Basically, i would need to enroll in a post graduate program, which i do not have the funds to finance. Even if i did have the money, i don’t have any clear direction to pursue, and i feel i would need to get some real life experience on some kind of a research project to get the feel for everything.  The interview will probably boil down to “hello professor, i have no competences, no tangible idea how to pursue my career and a somewhat lackluster will to stick with it all – do you have any advice for me?”

I think that the gist of my frustration with everything is that i don’t feel that going out on the limb is worth it. I studied and was successful, but no one gives a crap in the “real” world; after that I was eager to learn, yet was treated with neglect and a lack of interest. How, pray tell, am i to feel enthusiastic about yet another endeavor after that kind of (limited) experience?

I’ll draw this to a close since I’ve rambled on long enough for now. I still have some money saved up from the last job i had, but that will dry up soon. I won’t exactly go hungry, but the family budget will definitely start to feel the strain in a few months. I am aware of this, yet feel mentally shackled in doing something about it  I don’t believe i am a lazy person, as i tend to pull my weight when what i do has significance, or when push comes to shove. Mostly though, I just don’t see the point.

 If you have stuck with the post for this long, I thank you for your perseverance. Just a couple of questions for the end:

How do i motivate myself to actually do something tangible about all of this?
Are any of my… reservations and attitudes justifiable, or am i just full of it?


TL;DR Some jerk ranting about how he's too damn inert/insecure to do what everyone else here is trying to do.

t779p,6,2012-05-04,Can't ask for help because I don't know what's wrong with me or how to explain [very long post],esbtoedrdy,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/t779p/cant_ask_for_help_because_i_dont_know_whats_wrong/,"This is going to be tl;dr. Sorry about that. But I've been watching you nice SW redditors being kind and supportive of people far worse off than I am, so perhaps somebody will be bored and looking for something to read. And even if nobody reads it -- it's been good to write it out. 

First, I don't technically have depression or whatever, because I've never been diagnosed with it by somebody qualified to diagnose that stuff. I'm personally pretty sure that the way I feel and act aligns very closely with depression or one of its close cousins (borderline personality, bipolar, etc.), and I've taken the stupid screenings online and read up on the conditions and can conclude that my behavior and feelings are consistent with them... But I won't claim to *have* them. Because you only *have* a condition if you're diagnosed. That's why my descriptions may seem a little odd through this post. 

So, I've been acting depressed/suicidal for a while in a way that's scaring my roommate. More on that later. He's trying to be supportive and trying to support me in getting help, but it's not working. Our university offers free counseling, where all you have to do is phone them to set up an appointment on the same day as you want the appointment to be, so cost and convenience shouldn't be an issue. I'm fine with agreeing to go in on a certain day a few days before, like on Wednesday I'll say I'm fine with the idea of going in on Friday (though I might already be at the point where I only make those promises to get him to stop trying to help), but on Friday I'll find some excuse why it can't possibly work out that day and I should go another time instead. The excuses vary, but the basic reasons for them are the same: 

 * I feel like others deserve the counseling services more than I do, and like I'd be wasting their resources
 * I have no idea how to explain what's going on to a complete stranger -- like, where to start
 * Appointments have to be made by phone, and I've detested speaking on the phone for as long as I can remember

It's the second of those points that's the biggest problem right now. I've felt this bad for a pretty long time, so I've gotten really really good at hiding it (well, I've just always been the kind of person who hides things), and my instinctive reaction when asked how I'm doing by anybody who isn't super close to me is ""I'm fine :)"". I feel like it'd be unfair and unkind to them to describe how I actually feel, because there's nothing they can do to change my mental state and the only outcome of telling them my problems would be that now two people would be sad instead of one. And I really really really detest the kind of people who get diagnosed with something and then brag about it and use it as an excuse to behave in ways that would be considered unacceptable otherwise. Yeah, I tend to be extremely judgmental of myself, and it spills over into judging others when I see people in situations similar to my own who prioritize themselves above others in a way that I'm jealous of but would never allow myself to do. 

One thing that keeps me from talking to strangers about my problems is that I have a really well-crafted persona of being the funny, strong, independent one-of-the-guys who takes care of everybody else around her. It's what's kept everybody else from noticing how mean I am to myself inside, and I'm even crueler to myself whenever I consider the possibility of breaking that facade. Like... when I imagine trying to detail my problems to a shrink, the _only_ thing I can imagine myself saying is along the lines of ""Why hello there. I'm a whiney little bitch who can't grow some balls and deal with her own made-up insignificant little problems. Yay, you're giving me attention! kthxbai"". 

Yeah, I really piss myself off sometimes. The reasons I've constructed as excuses to hate myself could be drawn out into a post twice as long as this one will end up, and it probably wouldn't do much good to go into them because they'd sound stupid to a mentally healthy person anyway. And there's times when I realize how stupid I am, and how I'm not really making a meaningful contribution to anything (or, I might have sometimes made meaningful contributions in the past, but when I get obsessed with my own problems like this, I hardly do any homework and don't show up to work... [1]), and I kind of get convinced that it'd be better for me to be dead. 

However, the people I judge the harshest and hate the most (again, because I'm jealous of them having the nerve to try it at all) are the people who attempt suicide and aren't successful. Inside my head, anyone who admits to being suicidal or attempts it and fails is just an attention whore. That's why I won't attempt it until I find a method that I'm very, very sure will work the first time. I know that if I call some hotline, if I ask for help, it'll be taken as a sign that I don't actually want to kill myself, and everybody would respond accordingly. By my logically flawed but emotionally convincing perception of the world, going to see a shrink and admitting to being suicidal would constitute failure and attention whoring as well. Going to see a shrink and pretending not to be suicidal would waste both their time and mine, and probably make them feel bad ifwhen I eventually find a method that's available to me at one of the times when I really want to die and have the initiative to follow through on it. Wanting to die and having enough energy to do something about that desire haven't lined up yet... but they might eventually. 

So, what're my actual problems? I don't even know. I know that I see myself as being hated by a lot of people (because if I were them, I'd hate me) and I see myself as having fucked up every worthwhile friendship that I've ever had, but both those things are simultaneously causes and effects of despising myself.  

One of the precipitating factors for this particular episode of hating myself worse than usual has been that one officer of a committe that I serve on resigned with the excuse that ""I went to the counselors and they said I have depression, so that's the reason I didn't feel good and missed a couple meetings"", and now I get all of the really freaking easy work that she was too lazy to finish dumped in my lap. This has made me really really angry -- way angrier than I usually get -- I think because I'm so jealous of her ability to just go off and be self-centered and say a huge ""fuck you"" to being responsible or considerate to the people who are counting on her. If that was an okay thing for someone to do with no consequences, then I would've done it years ago and maybe be happier now, so I really want it to not be an okay thing to do. If it's been acceptable all along and I've been too stupid to realize it, then I'm dumb enough to not deserve to be alive or _anything_. My response to this is to try to prove that her behavior is unacceptable by getting really really angry at her -- to the point where I'm seriously scared that if I have the means and the opportunity, I'm going to do her some serious harm. The only reason I haven't replied to her resignation email saying the kind of hurtful cruel stuff I say to myself to force myself to keep working is that I can't figure out the best way to express my feelings, and I know I'd only get one shot before she blocks all emails from me or whatever. 

Oh yeah, and whenever I'm mad at myself and feel really stupid, I've gotten in the habit of hitting myself in the head with a textbook or the battery part of my laptop (yay for thinkpads being indestructable) or a wall or whatever else comes to hand. My reason was initially that if I'm going to act like an imbecile then I should attempt to cause myself an excuse for it (it's okay for brain-damaged people to be stupid), but now it's just the only thing that I can think of to do when I feel bad. So when I have energy, I try really hard to hurt myself, and I stongly desire to hurt others. This is why I've hardly eaten anything for two days -- I might not think straight when I'm exhausted, but at least I can't follow through on any of the things that I feel like doing when I have energy.

------------------- 

[1] Yeah, this stupid post is so poorly thought out as to need footnotes. See, I actually have a really good job for a college kid (pays almost twice minimum wage) that'll get me the connections and portfolio of code and work experience that I'll need to have a successful career, and everybody there is nice to me (though I'm never sure if it's because i'm worth anything, or just because I'm the only female other than the secretary) and understands that school sometimes demands a lot of time... But I'm constantly scared because I'm working with a bunch of guys who've been coding way longer than I have and always know more than I do and I'm pretty much the least competent person there. Sure, I'm ""smarter"" than a lot of the silly derps in my 3rd-year college CS classes who can't so much as FizzBuzz, but that just means that I'm expected to do way better things and I know I'm not actually as smart as anyone thinks and I'm dreading the time when I have to explain that I don't actually know anything, because I'll be letting everybody down... But I'm a college kid with a really good job and a good internship and everything she needs to have a good career, which is way more than most people have, and half the redditors on here would be jealous of me for that alone, which just seems like further proof that I don't actually deserve to get help.

I'm an almost college grad that will be starting an internship this summer that will likely be a full time job when I graduate. The job also happens to be in the same city that I'm going to school in, so I'm looking for a new bank that I can put my money into. Does anyone have any suggestions from personal experience? These are the things that I'm looking for:

* I'm in Ann Arbor, MI, which has a lot of the major banks. I would like one with an ATM network.
* I want to get a credit card, preferably with a competitive APR, possibly a student rate and/or rewards/cash back.
* Any student programs would be a plus.
* I've heard and read horror stories about Well's Fargo, so I'd like to avoid them.

Is there anything else major that I should be looking for? I'm fairly new to this! Thanks!

*EDIT:* Also what would be better, a fixed APR of 14% or an introductory of 0% for 12 months then a variable of 10.99%-23.99%  after that? This is assuming that I don't pay off my balance every month."
t6w7i,12,2012-05-04,Two and a half year college relationship is stagnant and I'm ready to call it quits,slipferd51,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/t6w7i/two_and_a_half_year_college_relationship_is/,"Requisite information: I am 21m, she is also a 21f. We have been dating for two and half years to the day.

**Warning: Long wall of text incoming.**

Since I started college as a freshmen, I have dated my SO. We literally met three days after school started and haven't been apart since. This is my first serious relationship, and the first person I've had sex with as well; I was also her first serious relationship. In the beginning, our relationship was really good. It was healthy, we each had time to ourselves, but we really just enjoyed being together. Relevant to mention now is that I'm a really frugal and careful person; I like to plan everything and save money, and I started college with significant personal finances. More on that part later.

About mid way through freshmen year, in January, my SO began to say ""I love you"" and I began to repeat it back. I was a little unnerved by this at first, but I was starting to genuinely believe that she was the one for me. We had so much fun together, and being a little opposite, I was and still am crazy attracted to her.

In that February, my SO revealed to me that she felt that was she was depressed, and that she might have been for a long time and only realized it after meeting me and seeing how positive and driven I was to succeed in life. Her semester completely took a dive as a result, and she simply stopped going to classes, eventually flunking them. I spent the rest of the semester spending all of my time with her, including going to counseling with her and trying to help her as best as I could. It was through counseling she was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder; they prescribed medications, but due to having no insurance, she could not afford them. This was the first red flag for me.

At the end of the year, against my better judgement, I convinced my family to allow her to live with us, the rationale being that there were a lot more jobs for her here in Chicago than back in her small town in Wisconsin. My family was aware of her semester break down, and beginning to question if the relationship was healthy, but I just shrugged them off. For two months, things were okay, but as the summer wore on, I began to discover her dark sides. I couldn't see my friends like I wanted to; she was insanely jealous of any significant attention I paid to  my family or friends, and I spent the summer locked in a bedroom with her watching movies everyday. For a go getter like me, it was like I had died.

At the end of that August, we began to have blowouts and she would state that she wanted to break up, but then an hour later come crying for us to get back together. At this point, my mother wanted her gone because she was disrupting the house, but I kept defending her. Eventually, it came to the point I told her she needed to go home too; her dad was really ill and her family needed help, but she refused to go home, so I kind of kicked her out.....three times. Each time she packed up, it was a crying mess on both our parts, and each time, after an hour, she wound up returning and I defended her to  my  mom. After the third time, I finally packed up her stuff with her and actually drove her home up north, and for the last three weeks of August, we were separate, but still together.

Beginning sophmore year, her previous friend/roommate decided to change living situations, and I am unsure if my girlfriend had a role in this. Being the only other friend she had at school, I was now her sole emotional anchor to the school. The year started okay, but as it wore on, I realized she wasn't attending classes still; she would do one night class okay, but fail all the rest of her classes. At the same time, she lacked any motivation to any field or job, flirting with environmental science, business, music and biology.

This pattern continued into the Spring semester too, unbeknownst to her family and mine, as I played a willing accomplice in hiding her flunking everything. All this time, she began to push our relationship further; against my wants, she wanted to get engaged and eventually married. We began to have blow outs every week over engagement. Like an absolute idiot, I started going ring shopping with her, because I thought maybe it would mollify her. Nevermind that I could not afford that at all, I was just stalling for..I don't know.

At the end of the year, we began to fight over the direction for the summer; I wanted to go home and work my old job, but she wanted me to come live with her for the summer without any job prospects. At this point, my family wanted nothing to do with her and wanted me to break it off completely. She began applying for jobs all over  the Chicago land area. I thought that if maybe she didn't get a job, she would go home peacefully and I could maybe distance myself to the point that I felt strong enough to break it off. Boy was I wrong.

What consistently amazed me was how much motivation she could have to stay in my life rather than improving herself; she found a job downtown that could barely  support her living in the area during the summer. I went home for two weeks, and she did as well before her job started. During this time, we had a ton of blow outs, including one right in the middle of my family moving apartments. I abandoned my family on moving day to spend time talking and crying with her, and in my depressiona and confusion, almost ran back for the summer to her house that day, abandoning my job and family. 

That night ended with me pleading with her to go home, in the rain, at 9PM at night because she had nowhere to go. Eventually, she did arrive home at that midnight after I had several calls with her family with neither of us knowing her whereabouts. I thought this was the end. But...she showed up in Chicago a week later living at a extended relatives house, to work the job she had gotten.

We reconnected, and...I lied to my family about being with her the whole summer. I would see her every single day, driving twenty minutes south every night after work to have dinner with her. My entire summer income supported her; I basically fed her the summer because she never worked enough to pay rent and feed herself. My family was in the dark  this whole time. I began to sink deeper into depression.

Flash forward to the beginning of junior year. Again, both semesters, she has basically flunked everything; her family is still in the dark. I lied to my family  and told them I had gotten back together with her in November, in a very dramatic fight where I abandoned my family for Thanksgiving to go to her family's house. I did that the year prior, and then at Christmas I almost did the same again before gaining common sense. Despite staying with my family Christmas night..I drove six hours roundtrip to spend five hours sleeping with her at her family's house before returning to my family and lying about my whereabouts.

During the Spring semester, I won an extremely valuable and prestigious government internship in Washington D.C. this summer, and even after agreeing to possibly being apart for the summer so I could go  do this internship, she has now begun to demand that we go together, and that I find us a place to live and money so that we can spend the summer out east together. I  have subsidized housing; if I tried to bring her, I would lose that,  and I'm basically unwilling to do that.

Now, on top of every event, two other things have convinced me that I need to get out of this: one, she has completely changed my spending habits. As a result of the relationship, I am in some serious credit card debt, to  the tune of $2k; my family has little money, and scholarships are all that have paid my way through school. My school job barely covers these bills, and yet I still spend hundreds of  dollars every semester eating out and buying her things. She also eats of my meal plan, even though she has an apartment to cook food in; her family basically cannot financially support her completely, and so myself and my family's money has picked up the slack.

Secondly, I have become an absolute chronic liar since starting this relationship. I lie to  parents, to friends, to teachers, to everyone. I  hate myself so much for it; I'm completely depressed over the state of my life. I feel absolutely trapped, and I know  I need to get out, but I  feel like I don't have the strength; I keep giving in to her, spending all of my time with her. Partially I'm worried I'm codependent, and I also am constantly worried about her depression and her possibly being suicidal. Like I said, she has no one but me; absolutely no one.

Basically...how do I end this /relationship? I know everyone says clean break...but I feel like this is going to ruin my life trying to extract myself from this. Any advice or words of encouragement would help me a lot.

**TL;DR**\

* Girlfriend is depressed and previously suicidal, borderline disorder and no meds.

* Relationship has constantly broken down and destroyed my familial and friend relationships.

* She has made me broke and depressed as a result, and I need to get out, but I'm weak and I can't bring myself to do it.

t6rgx,10,2012-05-04,ISE Majors..,fukyeahISE,SBU,https://www.reddit.com/r/SBU/comments/t6rgx/ise_majors/,"Don't ever let anyone tell you that your major is useless or a waste of time. I've seen it all too often on campus and on this board. This CSE/ISE holy war has got to stop because I fear that it is seriously turning people in the wrong direction; And while normally I wouldn't give two shits about everyone else's business, I'm in an extra good mood today. So here we go (from my 4 year point of view).

The facts about SBU's ISE program:

* ISE provides a broad **background** in topics relating to programming, networking, linux, databases, hardware, customer support, and ethics. That's all. You want to learn VM's? Set up an eSXi box on your own. You want to learn AD and GPO's? Set up a DC. You want to script? Do it on your own.
* Difficulty is relative, but if I had to compare ISE to CSE I would say ISE is much easier. Really.
* On top of that, ISE is a degree that is extremely easy to coast through. I have news for you; If you put little/no work into this degree you will not find a job. Absolutely will never find work. In an interview it is painfully obvious when someone doesn't know material they should. In this sense, you wasted your time. 
* ISE is a **completely different degree** than that of a CSE degree, and lead to very different jobs. 
* The average ISE student will end up doing Help Desk/Desktop Support after school. The average starting salary will be between 42,000 and 49,000. However, Help Desk/Desktop Support is only a starting point. After Help Desk your opportunities **will** explode and paths will open up to more lucrative jobs like Systems or Network Administrators, Consultants, Executive Support; the list goes on. **However,** while doing Help Desk you must be working proactively in a way that helps you achieve your end career goal. Nothing is impossible.
* An ISE degree is not a pigeon hole - Not working hard enough is a pigeon hole.

By now you're probably thinking who the fuck I am to tell you about the ISE major. I'll tell you, damnit. I'm graduating this May with a degree in ISE and I have worked my ass off. In my junior year I found an internship off campus which lead to an on-campus internship in my senior year. I began applying for jobs in November and finished up all my interviewing in April. I've been through more than 30 phone interviews, have been invited to interview on site at 7 very successful companies, and received 5 job offers. The job I eventually took pays well above the ISE average and includes a bonus structure that will blow some starting CSE starting salaries out of the water. That's who I am.

Some final thoughts,

If you're an ISE major that is putting in little/no work - please stop, you are making us all look awful.
If you're an ISE major that is working hard - **continue to work hard**, and please reach out to me if you want help with resume writing, interview help, or career path questions.
If you're a CSE major that is down with the ISE program - Stay cool playa'.
If you're a CSE major that is a pompous ass - Fuck off.

I'm turning 21 in about a week, and I'm a miserable failure.

I'm studying computer science at a pretty damn good institution, and I passed my first two years easily due to prior knowledge and good habits. However, I'm about to finish my third year, and I've dropped a class and am failing another one.

I simply don't give a shit about anything anymore. I spend all my time playing videogames and watching anime, I don't go to classes, I barely turn assignments in. I just for some reason find no purpose in anything right now.

I've got a summer internship working with a company that does software development, and it will be fun, but for some reason school itself just makes me want to gag and turn off my brain completely. I feel like there's some creative gene in me that could do some really cool stuff (I love cooking, for example) but my current degree and studies have just become an absolute theory-ridden slog.

Hell, I could honestly see myself dropping out and going to culinary school or something, it would be a hell of a lot more interesting than this, and I'd meet people who actually enjoy what they're doing instead of slogging through to a degree.

I was wondering if anyone's been in a similar situation and what you did to get out of it."
t6nqo,729,2012-05-04,Travis's List of Interesting Facts (Beta and Rioters Edition),Tnomad,leagueoflegends,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/t6nqo/traviss_list_of_interesting_facts_beta_and/,"Hey Everyone, 

As someone who has played since beta, and been around Rioters and pro players for a long time, I've learned some interesting facts. None of these are NDA bound and not all of them are terribly important, but I think some might be interesting, so here's a post. I'm sure a lot of you know some of these already and that's fine, but not everyone does =)

I'm not sure if I'll do these regularly, I guess it'll depend on reception. Either way, in this edition I've broken it up into two different sections. Beta facts and facts about awesome Rioters (nothing personal or negative, just things that are already public but not widely known). 

Beta Facts
----------------------------------------------

* There were a lot of broken things you could do in beta at level 1. There were level one barons, level one dragons, and five promote and five rallys to rush down middle lane.

* There used to be waaaay more brush on Summoners Rift back in beta. Like in front of dragon and stuff. 

* Here's a [list of the top 500 players prior to the reset at the end of beta.](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=20721) Familiar faces like Takashix, Reginald, and Dan Dinh at the top. Also note that these players are supposed to get ""master beta player"" and ""grandmaster beta player"" icons. They've yet to get them.

* Here's one of my favorite League of Legends videos from back in beta, [Rammus vs the World](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy3wmLbNPdc). Take a look at dat UI and some familiar names.

* When League was first in beta, it was only available to play during the weekends. At the end of each weekend, everyone would get on a Riot owned vent and chat about what they thought of the most recent build with Steve Snow, the lead producer. This usually devolved into everyone arguing about something specific: gold card locking, philo stone, and more come to mind. 

* I think when I started playing in the beta, I would guess there were less than 200 outside the company playing it. Now there are over 32 million at last announce. Still blows my mind.

* ~~You used to be able to stack sunfire capes. A friend of mine used to always demand team sunfire games, where everyone got a ton of sunfires. Dat AOE damage. I forget if you could still do this out of beta, but if you could it wasn't for that long I believe.~~

* For a long time, no one knew what the business model for League of Legends would be. I remember when they announced it would be free to play. 

* This is a [hilarious thread from beta](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=17475) featuring some well known players and edrama.

* Towards the end of beta, there was a little tournament called the Baron Cup. It was one of the coolest things about the beta, [you can see the thread about it here.](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=4522)

* [Brackhar hired me back in 2009 after hearing my brilliant ideas.](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=3265)

* The first game of League of Legends I ever played was on the winter map, 1v1'ing a friend. I was Nunu and they were Annie. Nunu's passive confused me, because I came from Dota where there weren't passives. I think there were probably about 15 different champions to pick from at the time.

* I'm pretty sure human Ryze is one of the rarest skins in the game. You had to get it by preordering League of Legends at retail. Remember that League was a sleeper hit, and that they were offering preorders through their site, so very few people preordered through a Gamestop or whatever. I have human Ryze =)

* Rammus had an actual voice with regular lines, but it was pretty bad. They took it out and what was left is what you hear today. They had planned to change it, but it just kind of worked out that it was *okay.* 

* Everyone from Beta talks about how much cooler we are than all of you in [the adjudicator forum.](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/board/forumdisplay.php?f=11)

* There were exclusive IRC channels back in beta for adjudicators and stuff. Guinsoo would frequently leak stuff there. =)

* If you couldn't get to the login screen on the launcher because it said servers were down, you could Konami code past it. 

Rioter Facts
----------------------------------

* Phreak used to be a WarCraft 3 professional player, [here's him doing commentary for WarCraft Replays.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZE_PI1BhdQ) Be sure you stick around until 2:36.

* I know of several different Rioters who worked on well known titles before coming to Riot. [Christina Norman](https://twitter.com/#!/truffle) was an important designer on Mass Effect 2. [OhMikeGoodness](https://twitter.com/#!/ohmikegoodness) was an animator on Bastion. Tom Cadwell (Zileas) was actually a professional Starcraft player when it first came out, and is well known for inventing reaver drops. After that he worked on some lesser known games, such as Warcraft 3 and World of Warcraft. There are a lot more, but those spring to mind.

* Lulu is voiced by PrincessAura, a Rioter who works in player support. PrincessAura was [also on a show called WCG Ultimate Gamer,](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6Vdu6hezsE) a show about pro gamers. She played Super Smash Bros.

* Also on above mentioned show was Hatperson, Justin Wong, Rachel Quirico aka Seltzer. Yes, that Hatperson and Seltzer.

* Rivington the 3rd was a backup for the show, and knows a lot of people from that as well. Rinoa was in a clan with Seltzer. It's weird going to places like IPL 4 and being around all of these guys that have crazy connections with each other going way back.

* Maokai and Veigar are both named after Rioters. Maokai is an artist. Veigar started off as a QA intern in beta, and now he's a high up producer. He and I were friends before he worked at Riot, so it drives me SO INSANE when people pronounce the champions name ""V-eye-gar"" because his name is ""Vay-gar"", prounounced like ""ray"". He's also a giant, unlike his champion equivalent. [An Icelandic Giant.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iuQ1IjlHYE) I don't feel bad for him though, because long ago he mocked my 61 point frost build in WoW. 

* [Ironstylus](https://twitter.com/#!/riotironstylus) and OhMikeGoodness are both named Mike IRL. They're also INCREDIBLY hilarious individually, but dangerously hilarious when they're together. They're also amazing artists. Here's a [look at some of Ironstylus's work before Riot.](http://gallery.me.com/mmaurino)

* Guinsoo gets a lot of flak for the neckbeard he sported in the first video patch preview he was ever in, but I met him in Vegas during IPL 4. He's a really, really cool guy and incredibly stylin' and good looking. Ladies looking for a designer, track down this dude. I introduced him to Doublelift and Guinsoo told him he needed Vayne lessons from Doublelift because he doesn't know how to play her. Doublelift replied by telling him he didn't know how to play her either. 

* On the first floor of Riot HQ there's [this big room where they do presentations and stuff.](http://riot-web-static.s3.amazonaws.com/images/riotgames_images/large/ShowAndTell.jpg) I went there for a non-Riot event last Christmas that they happened to be having there. It's cleverly called the Urf Memorial Lounge.

* I think I've interacted with every member of the Riot eSports team by now and I can tell you that they're all amazing. Mad props to all of them, but I want to give special points to 
[Lykaeus](https://twitter.com/#!/RiotLykaeus) and [RavenBeauty](https://twitter.com/#!/BridgetDavidson), both of whom never see any camera time, but work together to make sure every event goes smooth. I really mean EVERY event. When I was in Vegas, they would spend all day making sure things were going okay with IPL 4, AND with the European event that same weekend, and then they would stay up and make sure the Korean tournament went well later that night. If you're happy with how smoothly tourneys have gone lately, they're the unsung heroes and they deserve crazy praise. 

* There is no such thing as a ""lore team"" -- just a creative design team. There never was a lore team, so they didn't all get fired like some people say. They're also not just sitting around not doing anything. The creative designers work alongside game designers on every champion. While someone like Ezreal (the designer) will decide what abilities Vlad might have, the creative designer will work with artists to decide what he'll look like, they'll write all of his punny lines, etc. They're basically responsible for how the champion ""feels"" thematically. If you like the abilities a champion has, you can thank the game designer. If you like the personality, you can thank the creative designer.

* There are several Rioters who have told me (and I believe them) that Riot could form one of the best NA teams with people from live team and QA including Jatt, Classick, Statick, Milkcow, Roku, etc. 

State of the League Gaming House Bonus Facts
-----------------------------------------------------------------

* While I was writing this Doublelift walked by me and told me he was going to make a ""Doublelift's Fun Facts thread"" that will ""destroy your fun facts thread."" When I asked him what he would put in it, he told me he had no idea, and that he ""just liked to talk shit"". He then continued to mock me. 

* Shortly thereafter, he informed me that he forgot the nice chopsticks I got for him last Christmas in Korea. He then consoled me by telling me that all of CLG got to use them, and that he bragged to his teammates about how they were such a nice gift, and that I had given them to him for his birthday. Again, I gave them to him for Christmas, we didn't even meet until three weeks after his birthday. Peter uses all of his brain power to make da big plays, and none of it to remember normal things. "
t6nj8,0,2012-05-04,University practice...waste of time or a necessity?,trifoi7,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/t6nj8/university_practicewaste_of_time_or_a_necessity/,"So, this year i'm finishing my 3rd (out of 4) year at a technical university in my country, specializing on electronics, telecommunications and programming. During the summer vacation, i'm supposed to be doing 3 months of practice in my field. 

The problem is, however, that the practice (i guess it would be called internship) the university sets up is lackluster and from what i've heard, it won't be that useful or productive, so i'd basically be stuck in the capital (i'm from a smaller town) wasting my time.

My other option would be to find another firm to intern at, preferably in my own town, but again, i don't know how useful that could turn out. 
  
So, i'm basically looking for some advice here, from people more knowledgeable than i. What's the best way to go about this? What other option do i have?"

Background:

- I'm a junior in college, studying computer science, and I'm on my way to becoming a software engineer out of college.

- I have successfully completed two Coursera courses: 1) Software Engineering for Software as a Service and 2) Design and Analysis of Algorithms 1

- I am currently enrolled in three Udacity courses: 1) CS212 Design of Computer Programs, 2) CS253 Web Applications Engineering, and 3) Programming Languages


Question:

- Aside from the additional knowledge gained from taking these courses, how valuable are they when looking for jobs? Do employers care if potential employees have taken these courses?

- Should I put them on my resume? If so, how/where would I do so?

- If you have any stories to tell about coworkers or employees that you've hired that may relate to this, please share! If you've taken these courses and found better success finding jobs because of doing so, even better!


Note:

- If you are unfamiliar with these courses, they don't count for credit, and they're very informal (they don't require identity verification, they can't really prevent you from cheating, etc.).

- For the record, I am not relying on these courses to get a job; I have an internship with a well-known startup in NYC this summer, and I've got prior experience as well. I'm just curious to see how big of a resume boost these courses are, if at all.

- Shameless advertising: If you're interested in/skeptical of these courses but haven't taken any, read my [blog post](http://grardb.tumblr.com/post/21996722846/udacity-and-coursera) about why I like them so much :D"

Me, not being a Mac enthusiast and being a total and complete dumbass, responds ""Well, I'm not really an Apple freak, but I have used them in the past."".

Questions|Answers
:--|:--
[Could you describe the writing process? like when does it take place and how? Who selects the topics and how much influence does Jon have on it?  I hope my questions make sense since i really don't know how stuff like that works...](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t5555/i_was_an_intern_at_the_daily_show_ama/c4jmapg?context=5)|The writers got a few hours, say if the meeting was at 10am, they got about until 2ish to get scripts and jokes to the head writer.  Then they start putting the pieces together.  Which jokes make it in, which don't.  Then they have to match stuff up with video footage.  Then Jon takes a look at it.  It's about 4:30 now.  Around 5ish they have a full run through of the show.  Just Jon at the desk and any correspondents that are needed, and the writers, who are sitting in the audience seats.  It takes about 25 minutes to go through stuff.
[What was Jon Stewart like off camera?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t5555/i_was_an_intern_at_the_daily_show_ama/c4jm2tf?context=5)|He's the same as he is on camera.  Just the nicest guy.  The first day there, when they were showing the interns around, Jon popped out of his office.  We all froze, cause it was Jon Freaking Stewart standing in front of us, and he just goes 'Hey guys, thanks for working for us for free.'  Then he went about his business.
 |In fact, the day after the story that I was in aired I was working reception, and Jon comes in, sees me there stops by and said 'Hey DarnJester, good job last night.' 
[Explains why you chose the user name you did. I'd cherish a nickname from Jon Stewart above all.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t5555/i_was_an_intern_at_the_daily_show_ama/c4jmbpz?context=5)|HA!  Nice.  
[How exactly did you become an Intern, what was the process like? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t5555/i_was_an_intern_at_the_daily_show_ama/c4jm4w2?context=5)|It was actually really easy.  I found out they had interns from their website, submitted a cover letter telling them about all the work I'd done in college, I worked at the student run TV station and had a show called 'The Weekly Show' (get it?), and how much it would mean to work at the show that inspired me.  They called me up to NYC for an interview and it consisted of one question 'Do you want to be an intern here?'  To which I emphatically said yes.  And then the hired me.  It was pretty simple.
 |Turns out, and I found out about this just as my internship was ending, that they floated my cover letter around the office.  There was a contest to see if I was a stalker or not.  Apparently my cover letter came off, to some, as a little intense and I-want-to-wear-jon's-skin-as-a-coat-ish.  
[What does John Stewart do during commercial breaks? I've always wondered about that...](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t5555/i_was_an_intern_at_the_daily_show_ama/c4jm9w3?context=5)|Oh, well actually when they cut to commercial they actually cut to commercial.  Meaning that the DJ, yeah there's a DJ, puts on music and plays it real loud, and they go for how ever long the commercial break is.
 |While that is happening, a script guy will come up and hand Jon the next segment's script.  A producer will come up and talk to Jon about something, they're always tinkering with stuff.  Then the stage manager will call 10 seconds, everyone walks off stage and here we go in 5, 4, 3,.... (They never say 2 or 1)
[How much writing does Jon and the other on-air hosts do?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t5555/i_was_an_intern_at_the_daily_show_ama/c4jmakr?context=5)|A lot actually.  He's in on the meetings, and obviously during the run through. 
[I've never understood it when people joke on people like Jon, Colbert and Conan about how they'd be nothing without their writers.   It's completely uncalled for. Yes, the writers are important.   But the hosts aren't mindless loudspeakers.  They're intelligent.  They have to be.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t5555/i_was_an_intern_at_the_daily_show_ama/c4jtfc2?context=5)|I think what the guys went through during the writers strike, legal or not(however they did it), proved that they could handle it on their own if they needed to.
[Come on, you can tell us the truth. They can't hurt you now.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t5555/i_was_an_intern_at_the_daily_show_ama/c4jomyg?context=5)|I am telling you the truth.  Jon's right there.  In fact, the Wayne Gretzky part of the package that I was in (in the OP) was Jon's joke.  He's involved.
[ yet they still say it.   Of course, it's mostly the extreme right wingers that do it.  And by mostly, I mean 100% of the time.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t5555/i_was_an_intern_at_the_daily_show_ama/c4jugpt?context=5)|Haters gonna hate.  Remember when they tried to have a right wing version of the Daily Show?  It bombed, big time.  Not sure what my point is, maybe that right wing comedy isn't funny.  But then again Fox News in it of itself is comedy...either way, it sucked.
[Did you meet any of the ""correspondents"" or guests, and if so...were any of them a jerk?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t5555/i_was_an_intern_at_the_daily_show_ama/c4jm1am?context=5)|I met all the correspondents, at the time.  And they were all great.  Ed Helms even pulled me aside a few times to give me pointers on stand up.  He was super nice.  I don't remember any guest being jerks, or if they were I wasn't around them when it was happening.  I did meet Joshua Jackson and Sir Patrick Stewart, Josh is tall, like 6'2"" and Sir Patrick, well he wasn't a Sir at the time, I think, but it was just awesome to be around him.
[As a super-huge fan of ""Fringe"", I kind of hate you now for meeting Joshua Jackson, you lucky SOB, even though  this was pre-""Fringe"".](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t5555/i_was_an_intern_at_the_daily_show_ama/c4jmk13?context=5)|Dude, at the time it was a) Charlie from Might Ducks, and then b) fucking Pacey Whitter from The Creek.  The man was already awesome before Fringe, and continues to be awesome.
 |I'm also glad for season 5, short as it is.
[When they do the segments where they go out and interview people, are those people always real, or are they sometimes actors? Do the real people know what's going on and are playing along, or do they actually think it's a real news show? If the former, why do people agree to be on the show when they know they'll be ridiculed?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t5555/i_was_an_intern_at_the_daily_show_ama/c4jmksx?context=5)|Real.  I know.  Back when I was there I couldn't believe it either.  But people still haven't seen the show, or understand what's going on.  So for the most part it's real.  Though most politicians have gotten wise to it.  But at the same time I think the correspondents have also gotten better at being subtler with the questions.   
[Kind of a digression, but I think the new guy, Al Madrigal is *outstanding* at subtle questions that trap people in absurd positions. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t5555/i_was_an_intern_at_the_daily_show_ama/c4jyhko?context=5)|Al Madrigal is amazing.  He took to the show almost immediately.  I really enjoy his work on the show.
[*But people still haven't seen the show.*  They're even told that it's the Daily Show? I would have at least thought that they request interviews under the name of a parent company.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t5555/i_was_an_intern_at_the_daily_show_ama/c4jug6p?context=5)|No, they tell them the name, but if they ask what it is, for the people who really have no idea, they say it's a cable news show.  At least that was one of the things they said back in '03.  Now it seems like either people understand what's going on, or the interviewers, and also the writers and producers of the segments have gotten extremely good at crafting the questions.  Giving the interviewee, if that's the purpose of the piece, enough rope to hang themselves.
[How many people do they have working there who's sole job is just to watch the news channels? Also, The Daily Show seems so good at pulling up random news clips from years ago, how do they keep track of everything? I've always guessed they have some an enormous database.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t5555/i_was_an_intern_at_the_daily_show_ama/c4jmkpr?context=5)|You're right, they have a giant database.  When I was there the video library was a bunch of book shelves, maybe 8 or so.  And they have a system that logs what's on every tape.  So, lets say that we need to pull up a sound bit of Romney flip flopping, you go to the computer type in Romney healthcare and a list of videos with clips of Romney talking about healthcare pop up.  Then they just pull the tapes, find the clips and edit away.
 |I've been to the new building a few times, the tape library is now enormous!
[Did you ever get used to the daily beatings?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t5555/i_was_an_intern_at_the_daily_show_ama/c4jm3yx?context=5)|Yes.  I used to say 'Thank you sir, may I have another!'
[How long did you intern?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t5555/i_was_an_intern_at_the_daily_show_ama/c4jm8l4?context=5)|I was an intern for 5 months.  Jan to May. It was the best 5 months of my life.
[What was the educational objective of interning at The Daily Show?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t5555/i_was_an_intern_at_the_daily_show_ama/c4jm8l4?context=5)|As for education...well I learned what it was like to create a comedy show daily.  There are dozens of people working there butts off every day to make the show.  Someone is always working on the next thing.  Editors are always editing for tomorrow's show.  There's a bunch of stuff that's required that you wouldn't necessarily think they'd need.  I learned a whole bunch, and I loved every minute of it.
[How many takes does Jon or any of the correspondents need on average? Do you have any stories of goofs that made it on air? Thanks! ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t5555/i_was_an_intern_at_the_daily_show_ama/c4jmjb8?context=5)|One.  Seriously, these guys are good.  And honestly, I wish I did have a story of them messing up, but even if they do, they cover it well.  You've seen the show, they laugh at themselves sometimes when they slip up but they keep on going.  I like it better than way, it humanizes the comedy.
[Is Jon Stewart really as short as he seems on camera? I always feel like it is Frodo talking with Gandolf whenever he is interviewing someone over 6 feet tall.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t5555/i_was_an_intern_at_the_daily_show_ama/c4jmeqa?context=5)|He's not Seacrest short, but he's short.  But you really don't notice it when you're around him.
[What was your best experience working at The Daily Show?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t5555/i_was_an_intern_at_the_daily_show_ama/c4jmaap?context=5)|Making Jon laugh.  Check out the link in the OP, for my OP.  By far one of the greatest accomplishments of my life.
 |In fact, I hope that I do 'make it' in my career, just so one day I can be interviewed by Jon and tell him the story.  Jon is like my Carson.  Carson was responsible for a lot of comics first big breaks, and they owe Carson for their careers and they've been able to tell him so.  I'd like to be able to tell Jon the same.
[Were you involved in the writing?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t5555/i_was_an_intern_at_the_daily_show_ama/c4jm3uz?context=5)|I wish. The only thing I got to do by the end was help in pitch meetings and the some of the producers asked for my help on research for there pitches.  But honestly, I wasn't that good of a comedy writer back then.  Now though....
[Who's funnier off-camera -- Stewart or Colbert?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t5555/i_was_an_intern_at_the_daily_show_ama/c4jmltp?context=5)|Hard question.  Stewart is a stand up at heart while Colbert is sketch and improv.  So two different disciplines at work.
 |That's my way of being a pansy and not picking a side :)
[Who is the coolest or rather friendliest correspondent that works there? Where you able to have extended conversations with Stewart or maybe Colbert? How are they in person?  Also, what did you actually have to do when you worked there?  Finally, the obvious question, did you get paid? :D ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t5555/i_was_an_intern_at_the_daily_show_ama/c4jmbsj?context=5)|Helms.  He wasn't as busy as the other guys, cause he was still newish to the show.  We'd talk about stand up, and how he got started.  He's really awesome.
[How do we know your not really Wayne Gretzky? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t5555/i_was_an_intern_at_the_daily_show_ama/c4jm8fn?context=5)|If I were the real Gretzky I wouldn't let my daughter post pics like she's been doing of late.
 |Speaking of which, have you seen Gretzky's daughter...damn!
[Since you were there with some of the greats (Colbert, Helms, Carrell\) which one did you think was the best?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t5555/i_was_an_intern_at_the_daily_show_ama/c4jmkz9?context=5)|Thats like picking your favorite child.  They were all great in there own way.  Helms was closer in age to me so we got along great.  Colbert was a rock star, just the nicest guy you could ever meet.  And Carell, well Carell, and this is the about the time he was leaving, he was being pulled between both coasts, so I didn't see him as much as the others.  But he is the nicest, humblest guy.  But when he's on, god lord don't make eye contact because your face will melt, he's that funny.  He doesn't have to say anything and you're already cracking up.
[Also, any funny stories about these guys? I always imagined hilarity ensues wherever these guys go. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t5555/i_was_an_intern_at_the_daily_show_ama/c4jmkz9?context=5)|They were/are all awesome. And yes when they get together it is hilarity.
[When it goes to the correspondents, they're in front of green screens right? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t5555/i_was_an_intern_at_the_daily_show_ama/c4jmm25?context=5)|Yup.  They are literally 10 feet away from Jon.  
[How does Jon Stewart take his coffee?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t5555/i_was_an_intern_at_the_daily_show_ama/c4jmhpe?context=5)|Honestly, I have no idea.  In my five months there I never once got anyone coffee.  I bought the supplies to make coffee, but actually made it.
[How long was your average work day? Was it a standard 40 hours or did they get as many free hours out of you as they could?  Also, what was an average work day?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t5555/i_was_an_intern_at_the_daily_show_ama/c4jmmc9?context=5)|I was there 3 days a week.  I had to get there about 9am and I left after the show was done taping, which could be anywhere from 6:30-8.  But usually I stayed later working on stuff.  Like I mentioned before, I loved that place and the people there so it was never really 'work' to me.  
[Jon Stewart is great, no doubt, but I think the real heroes of that show are the folks who dig through all the media archives to find video from a few months/years prior in which the jackass du jour contradicts something s/he said recently. Can you give us a little insight on who these Daily Show employees are and how they keep ALL THAT MEDIA archived and catalogued, in order to pull it up within a day or so of current events? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t5555/i_was_an_intern_at_the_daily_show_ama/c4jmicc?context=5)|You're right, it does take a team to get the show on the air every day.  I answered part of this question somewhere on here, but to go into it a little more:  the library is huge, so they have a few PA's, probably, maybe a intern or two, helping catalogue new video and updating the database.  And digging through said database when needed.
 |After they find it, it's up to the editors and the segment producers to put it all together.  It's a big undertaking and one that doesn't usually get done until very close to show time.
[Does Jon delegate the reading of all those books?  Because there's no other show on all of television that does book reviews, and reading all those damn books must be a task for 10 people. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t5555/i_was_an_intern_at_the_daily_show_ama/c4jmnel?context=5)|I think so.  They also had a lot of book give aways.  At one point they had one hall just lined with books and a sign begging people to take them.  
[Can you show us a dated picture from today so we can see that it is you in the video?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t5555/i_was_an_intern_at_the_daily_show_ama/c4jm1v3?context=5)|Working on that right now, should be done shortly.
[Who was your favourite former co-worker?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t5555/i_was_an_intern_at_the_daily_show_ama/c4jm586?context=5)|Most of them are still there, but, honestly, if I had to pick one, it was/is Rory Albanese.  He was a segment producer (he's now the EP) when I was working there, but he was the one that really pushed me to do stand up.  He went so far as to tell me 'If you don't get on stage in the next two weeks, we're no longer talking to you.'  And so I did, and ten years later I'm still doing it.
 |But everyone there was great. 
[So where's your tour schedule already?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t5555/i_was_an_intern_at_the_daily_show_ama/c4jtcxc?context=5)|If only I had one.  How about this, Aug 3rd-26th, 2013 Edinburgh, Scotland, Fringe Festival.  That is on my tour schedule.  The rest is TBD.  
[Why have you failed at getting Jon to run for President? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t5555/i_was_an_intern_at_the_daily_show_ama/c4jmk9m?context=5)|I'm so sorry that I worked there in a non election year :(
[Sometimes Stewart seems to use his comedy to cover up a deep anger about the world we live in and political squabbling, did he ever off camera just get really angry at politics?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t5555/i_was_an_intern_at_the_daily_show_ama/c4jms4p?context=5)|Not that I ever saw.  But I was there during the run up to Iraq, so the frustration was only really starting then.  
[I read in a Colbert biography that interns at the Daily Show were responsible for supplying the writers with Lucky Charms every day. What were your daily tasks like?  I hope to intern with Jon or Stephen next summer. I applied too late this time =/](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t5555/i_was_an_intern_at_the_daily_show_ama/c4jmwh8?context=5)|You are correct.  Everyday I was there I had to make a run to the store to resupply the kitchen.  There was a list of all the stuff that was needed, and Lucky Charms was the number one cereal on the list.  Which was good because I ate a lot of it too :)  
[Did they give you any cool Daily Show schwag.. or books/videos/etc that guests gave to them? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t5555/i_was_an_intern_at_the_daily_show_ama/c4jmki7?context=5)|I have a picture of me sitting behind the old desk.  It's on my parents fridge and there isn't a digital copy or I would post it.
 |Speaking of, I need my parents to make a digital copy of that photo.
[If you get the picture digitalized, post it on Reddit, you would hit front page easy and earn a shit ton of karma.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t5555/i_was_an_intern_at_the_daily_show_ama/c4jthzg?context=5)|Thank you for the tip.  I'm not much of a Karma whore, but when I get my parents to send me a copy and I'll post it for you guys to see.  
[Can you use your inside connections to get them to fix the direction of the earth's rotation in the opening?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t5555/i_was_an_intern_at_the_daily_show_ama/c4jmrjp?context=5)|If the great Neil DeGrasse Tyson can't do it, after repeatedly tell Jon, on air mind you, then I doubt an old intern from long ago has much pull.  But if I could make it happen, I would.
[How were you qualified for the position or what were you told was your defining quality that made you the obvious choice?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t5555/i_was_an_intern_at_the_daily_show_ama/c4jmkpd?context=5)|Well an intern is really just a person who does the crap jobs; answering phones, making calls, getting food, transcribing video (that was the worst).  I think it was really a desire to work there.  There were other interns that were there that, for them, from my perspective, it was just an internship.  For me though, it was the chance of a lifetime.  I think that's what they saw in me.  Or, at least, that's the story I tell myself.
[Sorry if it's already been asked, but where did you go to college?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t5555/i_was_an_intern_at_the_daily_show_ama/c4jmhi3?context=5)|I went to Virginia Tech.  Go Hokies!
[Yeahhhhh! I go to Tech, we have exams right now. Party in the empo right now, shots of knowledge.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t5555/i_was_an_intern_at_the_daily_show_ama/c4jnya3?context=5)|Blah, I know what that's like.  But good luck.  I'm trying to get down there to preform for my fellow Hokies sometime this year.  
[Not really that relevant, but I'm about to graduate from Tech next week! Woooo!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t5555/i_was_an_intern_at_the_daily_show_ama/c4jvzgh?context=5)|Well done.  Welcome to the real world, it sucks :)  Hope you have a job lined up, at least you have your parent's health insurance for a few more years.  
[Hokie, Hokie, Hokie, Hy!  Tech, Tech, VPI.  Sol-a-rex, Sol-a-rah.  Poly Tech Vir-gin-ia.  Ray rah VPI.  Team! Team! Team!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t5555/i_was_an_intern_at_the_daily_show_ama/c4jqg7c?context=5)|I wish I had more up votes for you fellow Hokie.  When I get down and perform at Tech, soon I hope, I hope a hive five and a bunch of jokes shall suffice.
[Fuck yeah! As a current hokie and long-time daily show fan I must say this brightened my day up a little bit.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t5555/i_was_an_intern_at_the_daily_show_ama/c4jpmgf?context=5)|Glad to hear it.  Always happy to help a fellow Hokie :)
[Did any of the guests get upset after an interview or just act like a prick all around?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t5555/i_was_an_intern_at_the_daily_show_ama/c4jm7cd?context=5)|Not that I saw.  Everyone seemed to have a great time.  
[How many hours/week would you say Stewert works?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t5555/i_was_an_intern_at_the_daily_show_ama/c4jmnmk?context=5)|He's there everyday working on the show and other things that I wasn't privy too.  But he's a hands on guy, he's right in the thick of things.  He has a lot of demands on his time but I never heard him complain about it.
[How does TDS find so many archived footage to use in their segments? How many people do they have that go through those video archives? Is there some sort of database or search function setup they have that allows them to find the quote they need easily?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t5555/i_was_an_intern_at_the_daily_show_ama/c4jmlty?context=5)|I answered the video archive question above.  But for video they don't have they go to the AP and other video sources and their libraries that are vastly more huge than the already huge TDS library.
[Does Jon Stewart generally ad lib the interviews or are they more scripted? I ask because I'd like to know just how much of Stewart's analysis of current events about his guests is his own opinion and knowledge as opposed to the collective writers. For example: the Jim Cramer reaming. How much of that was prompted by the writers or the producers?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t5555/i_was_an_intern_at_the_daily_show_ama/c4jp6a6?context=5)|I can't speak to the Cramer interview.  But they're a combo of both.  Jon's very smart, basically everyone at the show is, so they do their research, they read the books, and then come up with questions depending on far they want to go with a guest.
 |Granted, they didn't do that a lot when I was there, but, lately, you've seen Jon refer to his cards when he's quoting or trying to make a factual point that he wants to make sure he's getting right.
 |So in the end, it's a team effort.  
[Did you ever get high with Jon?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t5555/i_was_an_intern_at_the_daily_show_ama/c4jmtr5?context=5)|No :(
[So are Ollie Williams, Wyatt and the other correspondents also writers for the show? Also how often does Colbert drop by. And how awesome was the Avengers?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t5555/i_was_an_intern_at_the_daily_show_ama/c4jsute?context=5)|Seeing it 3 hours, will report back.
[What is your favorite color?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t5555/i_was_an_intern_at_the_daily_show_ama/c4jt5tj?context=5)|I like green and blue equally.  
[Sorry, but one more question? How old are you? you seem so young!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t5555/i_was_an_intern_at_the_daily_show_ama/c4jwo27?context=5)|Thanks.  I got lucky with genetics and I stay out of direct sunlight.  I'm 33, but I do look younger, which is awesome.

We hung out and talked for about 5 hours while we worked but eventually separated to do other jobs. Conversation was natural and I felt a slight connection. I wanted to ask to see if she wanted to hang out later but got a little flustered and didn't. Later that evening, I kept trying to figure out who she was and tried searching for her online. I did not know her last name so I searched everything I knew about her, where she was from, where she is now, where she works etc. I eventually did find her but I think it is a little creepy to befriend her online, especially since we only just met and I sort of found her in a stalkerish way. She's currently an intern and will be leaving in June so this may be my only chance to see her. I couldn't find a facebook profile for her but I did manage to find a LinkedIn profile.  My question is, would it be weird/creepy (assuming you were her) to receive a friend request online from an acquaintance?"

Anyway, I am a (somewhat) recent college grad, and I am at a point where I really want to start focusing in on a career path that will utilize my skills and that I will find fulfilling. I've been a ski bum in Wyoming for the last two years, which has been awesome, but I'm not exactly thrilled with the prospect of working at a ski shop for the rest of my life. I’ll be moving to Chicago and I want to use this opportunity to break into the industrial design/product design field. I applied to the School of the Art Institute of Chicago's product design graduate program but I didn't get accepted, and I think my lack of practical experience in the field was really to blame for this. I was a visual art major at a liberal arts college, and I did as much work in the realm of design as I could. I only really had access to a table saw and my own hand tools for a woodshop, but I really enjoyed making furniture. 
Here’s some of my work-

[**More of my portfolio is online here of you're interested**](http://chgarrett.wordpress.com/work/)

So here’s where I need some advice from my fellow redditors: my plan now is to work my ass off to become a better applicant and ultimately get accepted to an ID graduate program in Chicago, and I was wondering if any of you had some advice/comments on what would be the best way for me to proceed down this path.
Here’s what I’ve got so far:

1. Take community college courses to learn Solidworks and Autocad (Maya? Any other programs?). I’d like to start this during the summer, but being in western Wyoming kinda limits me in terms of community education resources. Any suggestions for good online courses?

2. Try to get an internship with a design firm or a design consultancy firm (any suggestions here would be super helpful, since I don't really know where to look)"
t8hys,7,2012-05-05,Help! I'm dealing with some serious trust issues and anxiety in a long-distance relationship!,thisisthrowaway1234,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/t8hys/help_im_dealing_with_some_serious_trust_issues/,"Hey /r/relationship_advice,

Throwaway account here obviously. I'm writing because I'm having some serious trust issues and anxiety over my long-distance relationship. First, let me give a bit of background. Please forgive the huge amount of text; I would really appreciate it if you would read it and give me some help!

My girlfriend and I met at a friend's party in our hometown last summer. We hit it off really well and went on a few dates. She's nice, friendly, very independent, cute, and has bizarre but awesome tastes. Our first date was sushi and then we watch Jacob's Ladder (psychological horror/thriller flick) and an ISIS DVD (cool post-metal band). Second date was Interview with a Vampire and listening to Mastodon (another sweet prog-metal band). 

I had just graduated with a degree in physics and she had just finished her second semester at a good art school and was back in town for the summer. As it turns out, though, I was accepted into a PhD program for engineering at a school located only 3 hours away from her! So we talked about it; we both kind of just wanted a summer fling, but since our schools were close we decided to make this work. I will point out that we're both pretty unusual and quirky people; we are both very independent and don't need to talk to each other or see each other all the time to be comfortable. I just finished my second semester at grad school and we saw each other once every 2-4 weeks on weekends, skyped and watched movies about once a week, and only occasionally texted. Things were going very well; she had her stuff to do and I had mine, and we respected that. Our fields are very different, but I am a very creative person myself; after some consideration I chose physics over piano as a major a few years before college since I had been classically trained for most of my life. We had a lot of interesting differences but have a lot of common traits and tastes as well; she would show me cool foreign horror flicks and death metal bands I hadn't heard of, I would tell her about science and cosmology and show her color pictures of nebulas I had put together during my undergraduate career as an astronomy researcher or tell her about crazy sci-fi ideas I have.

Fast-forward to about a month ago, around April 2. We hadn't seen each other for about 5 weeks and hadn't talked too much, didn't seem like too much of a big deal as this was a busy semester for us both. We decided to skype chat; she was writing a paper, and I always offer to help her with that because I think writing is my strongest skill.

In this skype chat, she mentioned the idea of us possibly taking a break and seeing other people. I was shocked at first, but I tried to keep my emotions out of it and be rational; it's unfair to use emotions to blackmail people. I asked her frankly, ""who is it that you want to sleep with?"" She said it wasn't that, she just felt like we could be missing opportunities. While I agree, I felt really bad; she has a much more active social life than I do as a grad student, and I know that because of her quirky personality she prefers to hang around guys a lot more than girls so I figured one of her guy friends had been coming onto her. I, on the other hand, don't have any girls who I am friends with in my grad school town; hell, I only have acquaintances, which is fine since I use skype to keep up with my old college buddies and play video games with them.

I told her that I couldn't really see what she hoped to find other than someone else to sleep with. I told her that our relationship has been great, we care for each other very much (I wouldn't use the word ""love"" really, I've said it a few times but I know that I care about her a bit more than she does me which I am fine with). Still, the idea of her being around so many guys and being such a smoking hot girl made me wonder that somebody else was trying to encroach due to the long-distance nature of things.

We talked for over an hour, and the seriousness abated as she agreed she didn't want to lose what we have. I told her more than once that if she felt she needed to end it that it was fine; it would hurt me a lot, but she needs to look out for her interests, not mine. We have always tried to have this attitude in our relationship and she agreed, and we also both suspected that she may be feeling this way since it had been so long since we had seen each other and we hadn't been in touch too much. The conversation quickly turned light-hearted with us telling jokes and sharing funny videos on the internet, so I didn't ask her anything else, but it did bother me that she felt that way.

About two weeks later (April 14 or so) we were skyping again, having a good conversation, and I was a bit drunk and a tad emotional so I asked her if she still felt fine, she said yes. She told me what had happened to make her have some doubts; apparently a senior at her college had friended her on facebook after finding out she is a big metal head and she had been talking to him a lot and hanging out with him some. I told her that way okay, that I didn't want to tell her who she could and could not hang out with; that would be unfair of me unless I suspected something sinister. She also confessed that she was somewhat attracted to him; he is a pretty good-looking guy, better looking than me, dark complexion and thin and somewhat toned, plus they had a lot in common being art students and into the same music. I told her that was okay, you can't help to feel attracted to other people, I know from my angle there were times when I met other girls while we were dating in whom I found interest. Still, I always made it clear that I had a girlfriend out of respect for them and my relationship.

Finally I was done with classes so I went and visited her around the 25th for about 5 days. We had a great time; I helped her finish some papers, we watched a lot of Game of Thrones, we partied a bit together. Everything was going well, but I still couldn't get this other guy out of my head. I mentioned to her that I would like to meet him since I would like to be able to judge his character.

We got drunk and headed over to a party he was having with some friends. It was pretty rowdy but fun. I will admit to my shame that I did try to alpha-male him a bit; I have about 25 lbs on him, a good 15 of which muscle since I work out a lot, plus I have trained extensively in Judo and somewhat in MMA/Brazilian Jiu Jitsu so I can pull off the dumb monkey-brain alpha shit if I want to. At one point she and I were going outside to smoke (I smoke, she only does when drunk) and he says flirtily to her, ""Smoking is gross!"", to which I responded ""Ear Gauges are more gross!"" and tossed him a bit of a smirk and made eye contact until he broke it. I know, stupid alpha male bullshit, but I was drunk and didn't have the best judgment. We go outside to smoke, she takes a few hits and goes inside to use the bathroom. I finish my cig, she doesn't come back out, so I go back inside to see the other guy being a bit touchy-feely with her, tickling her and whatnot. He was pretty drunk so whatever. As we were hanging out I mentioned to my girlfriend that I was having fun, but I had half a mind to go up to the guy and tell him to stay the fuck away from her (more alpha male bullshit) but she convinced me not to.

So we hang out for a few more days, get drunk together a lot. I'm not a very emotional person but when I drink I can be, so I know I brought up my doubts and concerns another 2 or 3 times (bad idea I know, the last thing I want is to be repetitive). She admitted to having feelings for him and said that she didn't think she could trust herself around him and that she should hang out with him less. I told her that was her choice, but I thought it was a good idea. I was torn between feeling controlling and feeling like I had no control at all. I admitted to her too that I felt like it was a bit unfair; this other guy is an artist with a great portfolio which I'm sure she likes a lot, whereas I only have a few of my piano recordings from my younger days and other than that I have a technical write-ups a published article which are obviously dry and not as seemingly-impressive as art. I told her this and that I envied artists sometimes since others get to more readily appreciate their work than in the sciences.

One of the last things I mention before I leave (around the 30th or April) was that I wasn't comfortable with her seeing him so much. She said she understood, talked about if she was in my shoes and whatnot, so it seemed to be over with. I apologized for bringing it up so much and told her I had a great time and whatnot, so I left to return to my place (2-3 hours away) since I had some meetings. She said she would come visit me in a few days.

My girlfriend arrived in town last night (May 4) and we had a great time; we went to a cookout at a friends house and had a lot of fun before returning to my apartment. We smoked, watched some of Blade Runner, had a half-serious half-silly typical trees conversation before having some great sex and going to bed.

I always wake up earlier than her, so I begin working out and am about to go for a run when I notice her phone has a text. It's from the same guy. In a bit of bad judgment I flip it open and look through it. She and this guy have been texting A LOT. I read through a mountain of texts and saw that they had been hanging out a lot, which I knew about. However, it seems they had also been hanging out since I had left, almost every day (including the evening I left on April 30th), and they had been talking about getting together and drinking and watching movies. I read through many more texts, she seems a bit flirty and emotive (to be fair this is how she texts to everyone), using a lot of smileys, and I saw at one point he had made a pass at her, offering to come over and keep her company as she was going to bed; she had brushed it off in a silly way but had not explicitly said ""no"".

I'm ashamed at having read those texts, but I do feel a little betrayed because I had told her that I would prefer she hang out with him less and then, lo and behold, she had hung out with him about every night after I had left. I should point out that the guy does have roommates and there are always people over at his place so they weren't alone or anything.

I hate to bring it up to her one more time, but I think I should, this time while sober. How should I do it and what should I say? I want to preface it by promising not to bring it up again. I do trust her, and I know that if anything were to happen she would tell me. I would also preface it by saying that I am sorry for bringing up my issues with things with her so much and that I understand it's not fair to her, that I will start talking to my friends more about things instead of her so that she doesn't see the negative side of me so much.

I don't think I'll tell her I went through her phone, that was a shitty thing to do, but if she asks I will admit that i couldn't help it. I am going to tell her that I saw the text from the guy while trying to take a silly picture of myself with her phone to set as her phone's wallpaper (which is true) and I think I will go on to ask her if she is still hanging out with him a lot. If she says ""no' (which I doubt she will, she doesn't lie), I'll tell her she's lying and admit that I glanced through her phone some; her transgression of lying about having been hanging out with him, should she do that, is a lot worse than my looking through her phone some in my book.

I also want to tell her that I am bringing it up this last time because I am sober and collected and a sober conversation is better than a drunken and emotional one. This guy just graduated and is going to be leaving her area soon so I think I know what she was talking about with ""missing other opportunities"". Also his insistence on them getting drunk and watching movies/hanging out is not good, nor is her agreeing that they should do this. I want to tell her that if anything were to happen we would both feel rotten because what we have is so unique and works so well, and we have a great relationship where we are very open and honest; she has told me on many occasions that she really likes what she has and doesn't want to lose it over something stupid. I also want to tell her that I don't want her hanging out with this guy any more (perhaps that's a bit harsh, I might just say less often); I'll mention that she doesn't always trust herself around him, and I'll tell her that she should under no circumstance get drunk with him. I have told her before that I know he is just trying to get in her pants before he leaves and that he will bring it up at some point, probably when she is alone and vulnerable.

How should I go about doing this without seeming insecure or accusatory? Also, what else should I say? Should I talk to this other guy and tell him to stay away?

It's just really bothering be because my usual deal with girls is to be nice to them, bring the ruckus in the bedroom, and respect their choices; if things don't work out, they don't work out. That having been said, all these doubts and the trust issues are bothering me as much if not more than this whole situation; I want to be the best person I can and not try to hurt anyone else. I suspect I am a bit more emotionally involved in this relationship than she is, and more involved than I have been in previous relationships. I'm not the clingy type at all, but I can get insecure at times. I am going to talk to my friends and my sister about this for some guidance as well and I really want to minimize the trust issues.

My girlfriend and I are going on an out-of-state vacation for two weeks in a little bit over a week from now, and after that I will be working an internship for ten weeks. I can fly her up to my internship once, but other than that I will not see her for the summer, and I don't know how long she is going to be around this other guy. I just want everything to be out there in the open with her and to have a really honest conversation. I don't want to lose her over some seductive asshole who worms his way into her life despite knowing she has a boyfriend.

Please help! Any advice is super appreciated! Thanks!



Edit: **tl;dr**: Long-distance relationship, great compatibility, communication, and independence on both our parts. New guy comes along, girlfriend hangs out with him a lot, things seem a bit sketchy and I want to get the situation under control and get over my feelings of lack-of-trust and jealousy.

helpfull comments. To give an update:
I have found a lawyer specialized in international custody 
cases and have found out that California honours an 
international which would give me at least visiting rights!! 
Thanks again!!

Dear Reddit,

Thank you for reading this. I was advised to post my story on Reddit so this is my first time here, will do my best to keep it short. 

My ex-girlfriend: U.S. citizen, 31 years old, teacher (looking for a job), currently lives with her mom in California.
Our Daughter: Born in the Netherlands, Dutch and U.S. citizen, 1,1 years old, currently living with her mom and grandmother in California.
Me: Dutchman, 33 years old, physician, live and work in South Africa.
We started dating in 2009 and living together in the Netherlands in March 2010. A few months later my girlfriend was pregnant and in March 2011 our daughter was born. In September 2011 we moved to South-Africa where I started working a as doctor. In December 2011 my girlfriend visited her mother. She took our daughter with her, decided to stay in California and they never came back. In February 2012 we broke up. 

I want to be in my daughters life and be a good father to her so I started to study for Step 1 of the United States Medical License Exam, with the idea to get my diploma acknowledged in the U.S. In time I want to permanently move to the U.S. This process will take about 3-4 years with all the procedures involved. In the meantime I have renegotiated my contract at the hospital I work at and now I only work for 8 months a year in South-Africa, the other 4 months a year I will be living in California to be with my daughter.

During my study I noticed that a lot of the remarkable behavior of my ex-girlfriend fitted the criteria of a (high functioning) borderliner. In the beginning of our relationship there weren’t that many strange things. She could push me away, but I thought that was a bit of commitment fear. After a while she got anxious if I wanted some time on my own and was suddenly sick when if wanted to visit a friend on my own.  She hated her ex-husband and called him evil, but although in her stories he wasn’t perfect, it never became clear to me why he was marked as entirely evil. I didn’t read too much into that because I loved her, but just before we went to South-Africa in September 2011 she started ‘splitting’: I was a hero and she wanted to have a second kid with me one moment and then the next moment I was a villain that made her unhappy, didn’t buy her enough presents, didn’t have the right hair color and was too stupid to understand her needs. There didn’t seem to be an apparent trigger for these mood swings, they just appeared. The demands she made just kept increasing by the day, until it was impossible to meet those. She would ask for one thing, only to become angry if I did that for her – because she actually wanted another thing. Whatever I did, it was always the wrong thing. I ended up feeling depressed, on my guard the whole time (not knowing what to expect) and utterly exhausted. In the last couple of months we were together she started accusing many people around her (from the neighbor to the hair dresser) of trying to pull her leg or manipulate her. Now I understand she can’t really help it. She of course thinks that there is no problem with her, I am the problem. (And all these people trying to benefit from her.) 

When I acknowledged our daughter during the pregnancy, the public official in the Netherlands told us about an international treaty between the Netherlands and the U.S. which states that I have no rights whatsoever as a father, only duties. In case a conflict arises I have no legal rights to see my child or claim (partial) custody. My ex-girlfriend remembers this very well and is using this against me to get more and more money from me and threatens to keep me away from our little girl if I don’t give in.

In January, before the break-up, we made an agreement in case we would break-up. It wasn’t a fancy document with signatures etc, but we put things “on paper” (email).
We agreed upon:
- how to divide our possessions
- I pay $900 a month for our daughter until Sept. 2012 (which gives her enough time to find a job)
- from September 2012 we will split the costs for Julia 50/50
- Every two days I get to talk to and see my daughter via Skype
- there will be no badmouthing
- I get a place to sleep at her mom's house when I come to visit our daughter for four months

Now it is a mesh. First, my ex-girlfriend asking for an adjustment of the divisions of possessions/money. I consented. Then she started asking for more money: $500 extra, indefinitely, so the whole “we’ll pay half of $900 from September 2012” is out the window. So that would be $1400 a month. I make $37000 a year. Now I have to pay my own costs and this includes the costs for the USMLE exam and the preparations for that ánd  saving up for the 4 months I will not be working and will be visiting our daughter. So I didn’t agree with her. She got very angry and cut me off from my daughter. No more Skype. I totally caved. I now pay her $1400 and I have to find my own place to stay when I come to California to visit our daughter because she doesn’t want me to be in their home anymore. I can’t really afford this $1400 a month I pay her now.

A month ago she decided to ask for even more money per month: $ 320 for a life insurance. So that would be $1720 a month starting now. She also hired a photographer to take some pics of our daughter. This cost $260 and she wants me to pay the bill. I said “no” and again I was put on a “skype-diet”. In addition she sent me an email last week that actually the 1400 dollar isn’t enough to pay the daily costs. There is, for example, no money left for clothes and not enough for food and diapers The email was accompanied by a list (written with anger) of new limitations in regard to me seeing my daughter when I visit. The message is clear: this time the consequences will be more severe than not seeing my daughter on skype. 

From September till December I will be visiting our daughter. In September in want to start paying $700-800/month  (plus a monthly deposit into a study fund on my daughter’s name). I’m afraid she will stop me from seeing our daughter if I do. I’m also afraid she will cut me off from my daughter now because I can’t afford to pay her more than $1400 a month. I don’t want to lose my daughter. 

My questions to you (hope there’s a lawyer and/or expert by experience out there reading this):

•	How do I break the news that I can’t afford to pay more than $1400 a month indefinitely without her melting down and cutting me off from my daughter again? And how am I to tell her I actually think it is fair to reduce the amount of money I am paying every month?
•	Is it true that as a Dutchman I have no rights whatsoever when it comes to visiting rights and custody?
•	Would I have rights if I would be a permanent resident in the USA (but not yet have the American nationality)?
•	I’ve heard that it helps to do an internship or something that resembles it, so I would have a better chance as a foreigner in obtaining a residency spot. Do you agree? Any tips on how to obtain such an internship (especially as a foreigner in the process of having his diploma acknowledged)?

TLDR: I (Dutchman, 33) live in South-Africa working as a physician. Now studying for U.S. Medical License Exam to be able to work and live in the U.S. to be close to my daughter. My ex (U.S. citizen, 31, probably a high functioning borderliner) took our 1-year old daughter to California and is now pushing me into bankruptcy: she will cut me off from my daughter if I don't pay. Questions: how to break the news that I want to transfer less money and not more and more? Do I have any visiting/custody rights?

t7u38,0,2012-05-04,American Student Trying To Study In Canada,StuBickel,canada,https://www.reddit.com/r/canada/comments/t7u38/american_student_trying_to_study_in_canada/,"To make a long story short, I'm an American 20 year old going to university in the United States. I'm not doing well in school and this is largely because of my mental, emotional, and psychological being. I'm getting testing done for potential medications and such but a large part of this stems from the fact that I am just unhappy in my current situation socially and I feel like I need a fresh start. So I am beginning to explore potential options for me. 

One idea I had was to move to a school in Canada. I am majoring in journalism and I am currently the editor of a moderately successful hockey website. So I feel like my passion for hockey might make me happier in Canada. I realize there's a lot more to Canada than just hockey but I feel like it would give me a big reason to connect with a lot of people; whether its attending a juniors game together or playing on the street or watching highlights on tv together or whatever. I also have the idea set in my head that I'd be able to find an internship related to hockey much easier in Canada than I would in the US. 

So I guess I have a few questions:

-Am I being completely delusional in thinking that my interest in hockey would give me a way to connect to people in Canada? I realize that it's not as simple as, ""you like hockey and so does Canada so everyone will love you"" but would that give me a way to make friends and have a social life despite being an American kid new to the country that is transferring over? 

-Am I being completely delusional in thinking that I'd have some success gaining some sort of internship related to sports in Canada? 

-How difficult is it for Americans to get into a decent school in Canada? My current college GPA will likely hold me back but I did very well on all my exams in high school and had good enough grades there. 

-Assuming you guys think this might be an idea worth pursuing for me, what are some solid schools for me to look into for journalism that preferably aren't in the middle of nowhere (I guess that eliminates all of Saskatchewan, right)?

Feel free to call me out on any stereotypes or unrealistic claims or thoughts I have written. I'm just in a bit of a funk right now and I feel like a change of scenery might do me good. Thanks for your comments."

ta2wx,4,2012-05-06,Why can't it be my choice to live or not to live?,Finallythrowaway,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/ta2wx/why_cant_it_be_my_choice_to_live_or_not_to_live/,"Okay so finally I'm saying something, despite having ups and downs, helping people on this subreddit and suicidewatch. I feel like I have to say this in order to try and get some insight in responses from you all. I'm a twenty something male and I fear that even at this stage in life I have nothing more to give.

I've been depressed at some level since childhood, I remember telling teachers that I never wanted to participate in anything (games with others, clubs, sports) because when I did it never seemed worth it. I was almost forced to be on the debate team in high school because a teacher ""saw such potential in me"" but I refused. I just never found any of it worth the effort. People my own age disgusted me, I could not stand to be with them in class let alone in something else. I felt very isolated most of the time because of this.

During high school I became a nervous wreck, I trusted no one and I felt like I was constantly on the edge of losing my mind and becoming a zombie.  I was so spastic during my senior year that classmates asked to have me removed from class. A counselor talked to me and then I went home. I was constantly afraid, the anxiety never stopped and it made life hell.

I never believed what anyone said about ""Be confident. Believe in yourself."" It felted canned, cliche and superficial. Even there was something redeeming about me in an objective reality, what good was it if I could not believe it?

One college later, now finishing my 4-year degree after a simple AA I still have no reason to believe in myself or my future. Life just seems like a trial where people just add expectations and demands onto your shoulders and expect you to go through it. I know that is a terrible way to see things but I don't have anything else. The anxiety never got better despite professors liking me even while getting mediocre grades because I just never saw the big picture in it.

I've had a few short lived relationships with women, but I could never really get close to them and eventually they figured it out how distant I was and left. I never wanted to go out with them, or do anything on most days because I felt trapped in my apartment.

Long story short I'm not going to debt over college, but I feel no drive to do anything anymore. A semester just ended, an internship is going well, but I am completely without any motivation or future picture of my own life. People wanted me to have big dreams and do big things. But I feel like I am living an elaborate lie because I want no part in the way people see me or what I could offer the world.

I think I don't have anything for them, to meet their expectations, be a productive member of society. I've seen counselors who suggested medication, I want no part in that either, you do not alter your brain chemistry without some long term side effects. A counselor I've been seeing for a while now put the idea of graduate school on the table, I almost told him to go fuck himself despite the helpful advice he has given me over a very difficult time in my life. 

I feel completely alone, I never leave my apartment. I hate this city and I feel trapped in here, staring at the walls doing nothing. I have no friends and no desire for much of anything anymore. 

I tried to kill myself last year after losing a place to live (long story) and I realized that was really overreacting to what it was. Why did my brain tell me to kill myself when the next day I called, moved out and found a new place to live?

One year later I still feel like I'm just slogging through life with no real goals or ambition. This world is a cold and unfair place, nobody ever said otherwise, but I've never seen the light at the end of the tunnel. I can't even exert the effort to get out my apartment and try and enjoy myself, it just feels hollow.

I just dont understand what compels people to keep living. At one point in life I thought I knew, but I am so anxious and confused all the time any joy or concrete reasons have lost all meaning.

I know I ranted, left out some details and skipped over somethings but I am really tired. Please help me answer that question. Maybe there is some motivation after all, but I don't know how to reach it. Maybe I am just a narcissistic, lazy whelp and I deserve to suffer my entire life because my cowardly indecisive ways...

**TL;DR Felt out of place my whole life, no aspirations or motivation. Very detached from other people. Nervous wreck that effects every part of my life. Why should I keep on living?**"
ta2tw,8,2012-05-06,Living in Paris (yay!) means more time until reuniting with my SO (no!),jwalkins,LongDistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/ta2tw/living_in_paris_yay_means_more_time_until/,"Hey LongDistance! I'd like to be excited/vent to you all if you don't mind.

I'm studying abroad right now in Switzerland studying French and it's amazing. I'm very happy and I'm learning tons, but obviously I'm not super thrilled that my SO is back in the United States. I was supposed to come home after my finals in June, but then a series of events happened:

1. My internship supervisor offering that I could continue my internship this summer in Paris.
2. Me mentioning it to my SO and him responding that he would totally come to Paris for the summer if I got it.
3. Me deciding to apply for funding for my school and ask my boss if I could actually take her up on the offer.
4. My SO finding out he needs to work extra hours this summer to be able to make ends meet so he can't come to Paris.
5. Me receiving enough funding from my school to be able to stay, and getting an official offer for the internship.
6. Me deciding to pay for my SO to come visit in May, only for his work schedule to not allow it.

So now I will be working in Paris for 6 weeks this summer (yay!) but that postpones when I get to see my SO from the original June 15th-ish to July 25 (aw). I'm so excited for my opportunity as an individual but I feel absolutely awful as a girlfriend. I thought that we were halfway there in March or so and now I realize we're just at the halfway point because I'm staying longer. I wouldn't give up this opportunity but I hate having to postpone when I'll see my SO (though I was able to book an earlier flight home than I thought I would by about 5 days). How do you guys reconcile individual triumphs with relationship downfalls? Anyone else in the same situation?

tl;dr: Amazing opportunity to work in Paris this summer after my study abroad experience but that means I don't see my SO until far later than planned. Any advice?"

Does anyone have any experience with these Luxobarges and what it might cost in terms of repairs. Is this financial suicide for a college kid?

Our reasonsing is this the Lexii, Acuras seem to be built to last longer than the Civics and Corollas and while buying a 200K mi car it might make more sense to buy one of those as your chances of things breaking down is lower. Are we just being silly?

- 19 year old
- Very dysfunctional and clingy family that has isolatd me my whole life, and continues to do so
- Engineer, just got an amazing internship opportunity this summer so I'm doing quite well.
- I'm a complete beta male, entirely because of my family. To this day they treat me like a 12 year old, and like a dog. My opinion means nothing, they talk down to me and they act like I don't know anything. As a result I have extremely low self esteem and and heavily insecure and socially anxious. I am also very depressed and have frequent mood swing.

I have a place away from my family, but they're clingy enough that they've perturbed my entire life. I can't tell them to fuck off because I'm not allowed to talk back. I'm treated like a dog. If I say anything to them they start freaking out and screaming and act like the world is ending, while throwing all kinds of insults at me. They haven't taught me anything, yet they act like I owe them everything. 

I feel trapped. I'm a beta male. I'm out of shape, I've never had a girlfriend, I'm continuously depressed. I don't have the courage to talk out, and if I do, I start crying because of how strongly it's been drilled into my brain that I am not allowed to talk back. They have taken all my dignity.

I have already attempted suicide. I have no self respect at all. I can't leave this family because they're psychotic. If I try and abandon them I know my parents will do something drastic like commit suicide. They love me, but they're absolutely horrible people with major psychological issues, and they don't understand how it affects me. Even if they could understand they can't do anything.

Sorry, just had to vent I guess. I don't know what I'm going to do."

As the title says, I'm a BME with 2 years of experience and I feel like I'm underpaid. A full description of my situation is below. Any advice/opinions about my job and salary would be greatly appreciated.

I graduated in 2010 with a BS in Biomedical Engineering from a program ranked in the top 10 in the US. Immediately afterwards, I started working as an ""intern"" at a medium to large medical device company making $20/hr. The idea was to move to full time after 3-6 months, but that ended up not happening due to a product recall, a hiring freeze, and some other problems at that company. After a year (still at the same salary) I took an Associate Engineer position at a Fortune 500 company in Boston developing a product that will be a direct competitor to the first product line I worked on (the one upside to being an intern was that I didn't have a non-compete agreement). The new salary was $52k/yr. In my new position I perform many of the same tasks and work with the same materials that I did at my first job.

After a year in this new role my salary has increased to $53k. When I agreed to take the offer for my current job I felt that the salary was much too low (I pushed back but wasn't in a good position because my first company couldn't keep me as an intern for more than a year). 

Now that I have two years of experience I feel that should be paid much more, but I believe my manager intends to have me wait until 
my annual review (in 10 months) to move up. Am I being unrealistic about what my salary should be? Should I confront my manager and discuss my salary, or should I be patient and wait? Should I try to solicit an offer from another company? Given what my current salary is, I'm concerned that even if I get promoted I won't be making as much as I should. The money is an especially big concern to me because I have very substantial student loans and I want to get back to school for a Masters as soon as possible.

Thanks for your help!"
t9myb,0,2012-05-06,I am in a lose-lose situation. How should I proceed?,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/t9myb/i_am_in_a_loselose_situation_how_should_i_proceed/,"To keep this short and sweet, I am having a relationship problem. Although I recently started dating this girl, I left my home country to work an internship in a foreign one. Needless to say, my girlfriend became distraught. To counter this I frequently call her (despite an 11 hour time zone difference), text message her, and Skype her, among other forms of communication, in order to alleviate her sadness by any amount. She is very stressed out because I left despite having recently starting dating. Moreover, she is currently in the middle of taking final examinations, so of course she is a bit angered. 

Everything sounds well and good, ya? Here comes the real problem...

When I contact her our conversations are fantastic and we really hit things off again. However, whenever I say I have to go, whether it be for work or for my studies (as I still have to take final examinations, despite being abroad), she becomes very depressed and angry with me. She claims that I am purposely leaving her and that I do not care about her. Apparently, she does not trust me when I explain my feelings for her. Therefore, most of our conversations end with us bickering and sometimes fighting. The quarreling has escalated with each conversation, and this time I fear that we may break up unless I pull out all the stops and convince her otherwise. 

Despite having dated for only a short while, I truly do love this girl. Every time we argue I find myself shacking from anxiety and fear that I will lose her. This may seem a bit odd, but I believe this is because of my high level of stress, which stems from my internship, my studies, and my lack of sleep.

**TL;DR: If I contact my girlfriend, she gets angry because she misses me more. If I do not contact my girlfriend, she gets angry because I am supposedly neglecting her.**

Please refrain from any childish comments or unserious remarks, such as: ""Don't stick your dick in cray cray!"" This is neither the time nor place for me to entertain such foolish notions. If you have any serious advice, please assist me in any way possible."

[Sounds like an interesting job. What type of qualifications did you need to apply for it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t8sfu/iama_tree_climber_for_the_the_capitol_building/c4ki0y1?context=5)|It required a strong knowledge of tree biology (growth rates, root systems, internal tree anatomy etc..) but mostly a developed climbing skill set. I needed to come on board knowing large array of knots, how to set-up a system for my to ascend into the crown of the tree, how to maneuver within the crown efficiently and know how to set up rope and pulley systems to safely lower larger limbs to the ground.
 |Basically the office is made up of 4 old tree guys, another guy with a landscaping background and me. They needed a dedicated experienced climber who could do the work and required very little or no training, and take over so the old guys can get ready to retire lol! 
[For strong knowledge of tree biology, do they require a relevant degree? Or does job experience work? Do they just have interviewers ask knowledge-based questions to see if you know your shit?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t8sfu/iama_tree_climber_for_the_the_capitol_building/c4kivzp?context=5)|Basically the latter. It would be really easy to tell if someone didnt know proper terminology or procedures. Example..where and how to make the best pruning cut on the tree..or which tree has a faster growth rate.. an oak or a poplar. stuff like that.
 |I have a degree in Biology fron University of Massachusetts so that helped me getting the job.
 |Ironically in the private industry, having a college degree was a negative thing. The older tree guys who went to the school of hard knocks looked at you as a young hot shot, know it all type. I was so craving all the knowledge and experience they had but they were affraid i was coming in to steal their jobs. :(
[Holy fuck that's amazing. Is there any specific tree that's really hard to climb? One that's too easy? One that has any weird quirks?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t8sfu/iama_tree_climber_for_the_the_capitol_building/c4kiete?context=5)|I love climbing white oaks! the wood is super strong so I can tie into small wood (3"" diameter is as small as I will tie into)
 |The ABSOLUTE WORST is American Elm. -They have a VERY vase like shape..or V shape. So Ideally I will tie into the highest most central branch in the tree. This allows me to move around very easily if my rope is in the high center. but Elms dont have a central leader..most limbs go up, then grow horizontal..huge pain the butt.
 |And the larger limbs always always grow tons of moss. They are very slippery. I have slipped and got thrown into the trunk more then a few times.. obviously i was tied into my rope and didn't fall out of the tree because I was tied in..but fell to where the rope was pulling me.
[Pallet Town: 1 New Bark Town: 0 Checkmate Jhotoians!  Seriously, congratulations!  Professor Oak: 1 Professor Elm: 0.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t8sfu/iama_tree_climber_for_the_the_capitol_building/c4kiuch?context=5)|Oh man i love you! thats an awesome reference!
[What kind of hours does a job like this entail?  Are there times when you need to do emergency pruning because of incoming visitors? And what is the most surprising tree that you have found? (Gift from someone, or dedicated too\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t8sfu/iama_tree_climber_for_the_the_capitol_building/c4ki90t?context=5)|I go in at 6:30am and leave by 4pm. I will get called in for emergency storm damage though. The occasional hurricane in the mid-Atlantic causes lots of damage. In the summer in this area of the country it gets REALLY humid and Boomers (very severe, fast moving thunderstorms that come out of nowhere) are very common. Micro-burst wind sheers do lots of damage to.
 |Coolest trees I have worked on so far in the couple weeks since I started have been..
 |A. Original gift Cherry Blossom trees from Japan. As in the actual trees the country gave to us as a gift.. not clones or re-plants.
 |B. I got to work on a tree that was over 200 years old! While employed by a private company I worked on a Tulip Poplar that was planted by George Washington himself in 1785! This was on a trail on his estate in Alexandria, Virginia.
 |C. I get to help set-up the capitol Christmas tree this December!
[I hear you all chopped down the old/new Whitehouse Christmas tree today. How did that go?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t8sfu/iama_tree_climber_for_the_the_capitol_building/c4kjjri?context=5)|I work specifically for the capitol building. Architect of the Capitol to be specific. That must have been the White House crew.
 |Yeah the National Christmas tree was a transplant. Mature trees very rarely survive a transplant. AoC gets a new tree donated every year. 
[*I was looking for a job, and then I found a job*  *And heaven knows I'm miserable now*](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t8sfu/iama_tree_climber_for_the_the_capitol_building/c4kjnd3?context=5)|LOL.
[That sounds pretty cool! How long have you been in this career/ industry? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t8sfu/iama_tree_climber_for_the_the_capitol_building/c4khx77?context=5)|I learned chainsaw skills and felling techniques in Alaska during an internship in the summer of 2008. When I moved to Washington DC in 2009 I started  my tree climbing career. So going on 4 years now. 
[Ever tried rock climbing? Or is tree climbing in a different skill set?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t8sfu/iama_tree_climber_for_the_the_capitol_building/c4kij00?context=5)|I tried to rock climb at a Ren. Fair. If you made it to the top you got $20! but i couldnt even get half way. :D.
 |Could have been all the Sam Adams though lol.
[So how much does one get paid to climb and prune trees?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t8sfu/iama_tree_climber_for_the_the_capitol_building/c4kilzj?context=5)|Well I make enough for a decent living. We will say someone with my skill set and comparable qualifications could make anywhere from 18$-24$ per hour. Some companies/agencies will give time and half for the time you are actually in the tree or doing a large removal as..""hazard pay.""
[I hate to say it, but can you provide proof please?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t8sfu/iama_tree_climber_for_the_the_capitol_building/c4kippi?context=5)|I dunno if this counts. lol it is my work baseball cap with AoC logo.

 |([Link to i.imgur.com](http://i.imgur.com/T1WDX.jpg))
 |Not sure if this counts as proof..My baseball cap from work with old school logo on it. hand me down from one of the vets.
[Congrats! I'm a Congressman and work at the Capitol so when u see me around come say hi and show me a good tree to climb so I can escape from all the craziness! My only question is, what do I have to do to get a tree named after me?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t8sfu/iama_tree_climber_for_the_the_capitol_building/c4klszu?context=5)|I would be glad to sir! And you might want to donate some new equpiment to the Tree Care Division if your in the market for a memorial tree ;)
[I have a 12yo son who simply loves climbing trees.  If we're at a park with trees &amp; I'm not sure where he is, I know that I just have to walk around looking up in the trees until I find him.  I'm thinking 'tree-climber' would be a dream job for him, at least right now.  What kind of education should he aim for, in order to get that kind of a job?  Do you have a college degree in forestry?  Or, does someone usually just apprentice for a tree-climbing career?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t8sfu/iama_tree_climber_for_the_the_capitol_building/c4kjazg?context=5)|Forestry is a great program... from the right school. But you have to get up in a tree to learn how to do it! On the job training doesnt even begin to describe it lol. 
[What was the job interview like? Did you have to climb trees? Can you post photos of yourself in action?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t8sfu/iama_tree_climber_for_the_the_capitol_building/c4kitcj?context=5)|Standard interview really. they wanted to know about my experiences and what i was proficient at. make sure i am actually a climber and i know my way around a tree. otherwise I could become a HUGE liability if i kill myself or..ya know.. drop a tree on the capitol building 
[What technique do you use to climb? DRT? What kind of branch saver do you use? What's the scariest thing that's happened to you while in/near a tree? Thanks :\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t8sfu/iama_tree_climber_for_the_the_capitol_building/c4knbfo?context=5)|DDRT yes. If anything for branch saver I use a friction saver with aluminum rings, but other then that I dont use one. Oaks can handle it :)
 |Saw animal's eyes while footlocking up a poplar trunk in knot hole one time. pretty dame scary lol.
[You are employed by the government, working around a government building... are you sure you're allowed to be posting this?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t8sfu/iama_tree_climber_for_the_the_capitol_building/c4kml10?context=5)|I have not said anything about the agency i work for except that i work for them, what my basic reprehensibility are and my jurisdiction. why would this be not allowed?
[If I'm in Downtown and I see someone in a tree with ropes and saws, can I yell ""Hey Sal4m4nd3r?""](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t8sfu/iama_tree_climber_for_the_the_capitol_building/c4kp4we?context=5)|Lol that would be awesome! 
[I use THIS.  What's you climbing saw of choice?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t8sfu/iama_tree_climber_for_the_the_capitol_building/c4kmop8?context=5)|Stihl 200 in the tree. the arborists saw.
[Are you a veteran? (Just out of curiosity\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t8sfu/iama_tree_climber_for_the_the_capitol_building/c4kmjxz?context=5)|No sir i am not.
[Could you possibly give a tree tour? The folks in r/washingtondc would probably love that!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t8sfu/iama_tree_climber_for_the_the_capitol_building/c4kpm6r?context=5)|What do you mean by tree tour??
[So what's up with the National Christmas tree. Why did it die?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t8sfu/iama_tree_climber_for_the_the_capitol_building/c4knk9e?context=5)|Mature transplants rarely make it. there is no chance for it to establish itself, grow the required root system in the new soil and take up the amount of nutrients and water that is required to maintain that amount of wood unfortunately. 
[**where was the job listing posted? Where did you apply for the job?**](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t8sfu/iama_tree_climber_for_the_the_capitol_building/c4l573v?context=5)|Www.usajobs.gov.
[Congrats, seriously. Do we really need Federal tree cutters though?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t8sfu/iama_tree_climber_for_the_the_capitol_building/c4kmt2t?context=5)|Umm..if you contracted it out to private industry..they would charge much more per hour then my hourly pay rate. plus there is security concerns. 
[Did you happen to work for Davey before this?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t8sfu/iama_tree_climber_for_the_the_capitol_building/c4km3gz?context=5)|The care of trees...which was bought by davey.
 |The care of trees..which davey bought.

[Fuck... in the DC area, he'll qualify for food stamps and housing assistance.  It's funny.

t9he3,33,2012-05-06,Archive File F-8112,Fringefiles,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/t9he3/archive_file_f8112/,"Dictated and Entered by Special Agent Nayana ""Ana"" Malhotra 

-------------------------------------
This was my first assignment with Fringe Devision Investigation (also called FDI).  I transferred in from Criminal Investigation and Profiling, hoping that the increase in pay would more than compensate for the rumors of the types of cases this branch dealt with...apparently that was bullshit.  
As per the request of the head director, I am writing this report and immediately removing myself from Fringe duty, stepping into my old position as a profiler.  This story will fill you in as to why my decision was so hastily made.  

April 5, 2009:  I was called to the scene of a homicide, on a mass scale.  There were at least fifteen bodies if not more, all of which were bound by the hands and ankles, a chain was tied to these binds and they were then hung some 12 feet from the ground.  This was, surprisingly, not the weird part.  The strange part was that every one of the bodies had a mark carved into the flesh by some form of a razor blade with a mismatched edge.  The victims had been killed a range of times prior to us being called in:  the earliest was killed almost ten weeks prior, but still looked like a fresh kill...another strange occurrence that would later be explained by the killer's constant use of formaldehyde to keep his victims looking as if they had just been killed.  
After a careful collection of evidence in this crime scene we packed the bodies to the coroner and I went back to the office for some reflection; hoping my team would assist me in this case and take me under their wings.  They did nothing of the sort, instead offering me little advice besides ""look for a lead...""
I made very little progress the first few weeks, noting that the victims had been a range of ages, ethnicities and social levels.  This killer had no real preference to his victims, just that they were killed, bound and suspended in their perfect preservation.  Nothing besides the marks made this killing abnormal, and for weeks I sat there at my desk, trying to find some form of pattern.  
I set out with a partner to talk to the victim's family, friends and acquaintances, all of which had a variety of stories.  Some were unsurprised that the person had died, while others were terrified and sobbed uncontrollably when the news was broken.  After pursuing several dead ends, i finally made a break when my phone rang one afternoon.  
I answered it to hear a horrified voice of a child on the other end, he had called regarding the warehouse we had found the bodies in.  He and a few friends had broken in to smoke a cigarette or some vague ""we're badasses breaking the law at 10"" story, and had instead encountered some rather....unforeseen consequences.  Despite the active crime scene tape, they ventured deep within the complex and were attacked by ""creatures...of sorts...something that hurt Charlie...they scratched him, bit him...""  When the ambulance came to claim the wounded boy(s), they found that one had died, one had become extremely violent and that ""Charlie"" had become withdrawn, responding only to yes or no questions and having nothing more to say then ""I'm fine...""  
The hospital checked this boy out for damage and when the FBI arrived, they requested that he call and tell us about the new development.  
I thanked him for his honesty and told him to keep away from it in the future and that I would go and check it out...but first i had a pit stop to make, to visit this ""Charlie"" kid and see what he had seen.  
My car pulled to a stop in the visitor parking lot of the cities largest hospital.  I entered it and informed the secretary of my intent, she was cooperative and directed me to the boy's room.  When I entered, a kid around 10 years old was sitting in a hospital gown, bandages around his legs, a vacant expression on his youthful face.  His brown eyes stared straight ahead, his short-cropped hair needed a wash, and his face was streaked with dirt...but he looked no worse for wear.  
I told him I was FBI, and asked him to be honest about what had happened...he just sat quietly.  I asked him if he had ventured into the warehouse without permission, he nodded.  I asked him if he knew where he was, he nodded and pointed at the word ""HOSPITAL"" on the wall.  I asked him if he had seen something...abnormal, he nodded again, looking at me with reluctance, before pulling up his sleeve and showing me a fresh-cut mark we had found on the victims; the blood trickled free from the wound, this one cut a lot less precisely than the original victims, though I would assume that the person who had done this one was probably sitting in front of me.  I asked him about it, he shrugged.  I asked him if he had done it...he nodded, holding up a pen dripping with blood.  I called a nurse to keep an eye on him, took a picture of his wound and turned to leave when I heard him speak for the first time:  ""Nothing will stop him you know...he's going to bring them back...""  
""Who?"" I asked.  He smiled silently and said ""The chosen ones..."" 
No more words from him, he rolled over and fell asleep.  I couldn't help but wonder what he meant...but now was a bad time to keep pressing him, so I headed out to my car, knowing my next destination would be the warehouse...

Gravel crunched under my tires as I pulled up in front of the large building.  The grass was tall and the fence was old.  Scattered metal parts covered the premises, the building itself was rusted and in need of a new paint job, something that would have taken a hand of God to complete.  I parked near to the larger entrance, exiting my car and walking towards the door.  The window had been cracked out and the caution tape pulled aside, fucking kids had not only tampered with my crime scene, they KNEW they were entering it when they did!  
I scoffed when I looked at the door handle that had been busted open by a crowbar and left ajar for the world to wander in.
I pulled on the handle and walked through into the semi-dark.  The light poured in from the glass in the ceiling of the main building, but no man-made lights illuminated the arena.  The bodies had been hanging from the low rafters under the third-floor office, and as i approached that area, I remembered noting that the bodies were hung in a circular fashion.  I looked at the ground, the chalk outlines we had left was still present where each body had been hovering.  I looked at them in sheer curiosity, pulling out my notepad and sketching a quick figure.  
From above, the circles that represented the bodies could be dots, each of them bound, tied, throat cut and filled with a preservative before being hung...almost like a sacrifice of sorts....
The circle became a clear happening, this was beyond intentional, it was almost ritualistic.  To be on the safe side, I decided to go around this area for the time being.  I walked across the length of the warehouse, feeling a cold chill down my spine as I did; almost that kind of chill that you get when someone is watching you and doesn't want you there...like an unwelcoming feeling.  
I stopped cold in my tracks and turned back towards the circle, I could swear there was someone...something bound there...I looked into my own sketch, and saw that the killer had made a perfect circle, and was in the process of creating something else...a line or something...perhaps a literal manifestation of a death-gateway?  
I felt extremely uncomfortable and decided to call for an assistant and wait in my car.  
Hours passed before the backup finally arrived.  Jason Upkins, a fucking intern...they didn't even bother sending me an agent, they sent me an intern...a trainee.  This boy was unarmed, so young he had NEVER seen a legitimate case, even a normal one, let alone these FDI ones.  And smelled vaguely of alcohol...I'm pretty sure he had been drinking when they called him in.  
Anyway, we both agreed it was safer to go in together and stick together.  He went first, I held the door as he walked in, allowing it to swing shut after me.  
As it had taken him so long to arrive, the sun was long set and in the transitional phase of twilight to dusk.  The previously well-lit chamber of the warehouse was now drenched in a thick darkness, the friendly sunlight was now replaced with a forbidding darkness; it beckoned to our souls...
He held a flashlight in front of him and led the way, asking stupid questions as he went:  ""Why did you come out here? Kids you say? why were they here?  Mischief makers...I remember when I was 10...what did you do?  Pfftt you are such a daddy's girl, I would have never listened to my parents!""  blah, blah, blah...obviously he had no respect for this crime scene and didn't even notice when his light started to dim.  
I stopped dead...a cold presence filled the room, the temperature had dropped significantly.  I looked around the mostly-dark room for some form of entity, someone, something...but found nothing.  I hissed at Jason to cut his light and he obliged with a slightly mocking, ""I wish I heard you say that in a different context...""  (A comment I would normally file as a complaint...but given the current circumstances, I obviously have to let it slide).  
He wandered forward into the darkness, unaware of the danger I was clearly feeling.  Those boys had definitely stirred up something...but what?  
I felt the eyes of something evil on me, a cold dread filled my heart and I felt my face begin to lose a bit of color....Jason kept walking.  
""Jason...you need to stop..."" My voice echoed into the chamber, but he ignored me, walking around in the darkness that only found interruption in the moonlight.  
He kept going until his hit something solid...something that caused him to scream.  My light flashed over and filled my eyes with terror.  
A human body, elongated and deformed hung from the same rafters that the others had...but something was different about this one...Fresh blood trickled from this man's throat onto the floor, a fresh wound in the midst of a cold body.  The hair had matted itself to the victim's face which was wide-eyed and twisted with fear.  The mouth was gaped open, limbs danged at his sides, the eyes were dark...and familiar...I approached the newest victim and realized I was looking at Charlie...only this wasn't the Charlie I had interviewed hours ago...this would be him if he were 15 years older...I shuttered in sheer terror and felt sick.  I stumbled backwards slightly and fell.  
Jason looked at the body in terror, obviously the realization that a fresh kill meant the killer was still around had set in.  
He looked at me and asked, ""Do you have an extra gun?""  I shook my head and tried to get up...but I felt a force holding me down.
I looked around in the darkness for something, but could not see beyond my light. I again tried to stand, and felt something forcedly push me down.  
I grunted in frustration...""Jason, I cant get up!""  As the words left my mouth a horrifying shriek pierced the room, a roar of pure brutal evil entered the chamber and filled my heart with dread and the knowledge that I was in a fucked up situation.  No firearm, no amount of aid, backup or armor would help us here.  Then I made a terrifying realization...  
""Jason..."" i hissed, ""You're in the circle..."" He looked confused.  ""The bodies...they were arranged...in a circle, and you're in the dead center...with the latest victim...""  He cocked his head to one side and began to ask me a question when I saw his eyes widen in surprise.  
He reached for his throat, as though choking and began to lift off the floor...I scrambled to get to my feet, but was again forced downwards by some force...
""Stop moving, just watch!""  A growling voice entered my mind, I cannot, to this day, shake the feeling of terror that filled my body when that voice spoke....It had no echo, no rebound, just four words that were said with complete conviction and gave me a preview of the terror that was unfolding in front of me.  
Jason was 4 feet from the floor when his back arched, this mouth opened as he gasped for air, none coming in...I watched the flesh tear off of his throat, as though an invisible knife had been dragged across his throat.  Blood spilled forth from the wound as his arms fell limp at their sides...chains that seemed to come from nowhere snaked their way up, like cobras to the charmer's song, gripping his ankles, bounding him quickly...
The voice cackled with laughter, obviously amused with its fine talent for chaotic evil.  I felt the skin peel on my shoulder as I lay there...It was as if something was slicing me open with a razor...the same mark the victims had appeared on my arm...i recoiled in pain as I felt the force lift itself off of me, replaced by the chilling voice:   
""You are free to leave now Nayana, but when your time comes, you will return to your master!""  
I sprinted towards my car, reaching it quickly.  I grabbed the radio and called for help as I heard the echo of a loud demonic roar pierce the sanctity of the free air.  
I collapsed into the drivers seat and awaited debriefing.  
When help arrived, they searched the premises, finding no evidence of Jason or Charlie's bodies.  There was an emptiness to the building that just didn't feel right.  The other agents looked at me oddly when I claimed the creature had scratched me, they claim I was nuts and ignored me...I only sat praying for some form of mercy, hoping the creature that calls himself my ""master"" would never find the time to call on me...oh how wrong I was....

---------------------

Special Agent Nayana ""Ana"" Malhotra is listed as MIA after requesting a transfer back to Criminology and Profiling in Washington DC.  Her request was approved, but come the first day she was to start working, she never showed up.  Jason Upkins, a trainee and intern in Fringe Devision Investigation is also listed as MIA, he was never found dead or alive despite Agent Malhotra's depiction of the events of that night.  Charles ""Charlie"" Pennswood was never officially released from the hospital, though surveillance tapes show him becoming extremely violent before rising from his bed, slightly taller than usual, walking down the halls of the darkened hospital before leaving through the front door...again, no body was recovered.  
This file is currently listed as OPEN and the warehouse was quarantined as incredibly dangerous...It has sense been leveled, though locals claim they hear the occasional ""roar"" or ""shriek"" of sorts coming from the now vacant lot.  It has since been placed under military control and fenced off to prevent any civilian from mistakenly entering the area. "

So, I actually live in central NJ, but I've acquired an internship (software engineering) this summer in Jersey City. Thus, I'll be spending 40 hours a week there. Starting this Monday. Scary.

For this summer's forecast, all signs point to lonely. I'd love to meet someone in the area who'd want to get lunch with me on my break or maybe dinner after I get off, sometime two weeks-ish from now. My treat! Y'know, as long as it's something not too expensive that is...all depends on whether I've received my first paycheck or not...

If you were in the Jersey City area AND also in the comp sci/engineering field it would be even better! Because I'm a bit nervous and would love someone in the field to freak out about everything to.  BETTER YET, if you also commuted there from central NJ... But now I'm getting carried away.

I'm posting this about two weeks early so we can become familiar with each other at least a little, prior to meeting in person.

Anywho, if you are of an age less than 25 (I suppose?) and greater than 18, will be in the Jersey City area and are interested, PM me! We can exchange foe-toes and all that.

I'm probably going to sleep upon submitting this, so I won't be responding until the morning. Please don't give up on me when I don't respond immediately!"

t99uw,1,2012-05-05,"Young 20's couple: she was once caring and loving, now cold and emotionally neglectful.  I need some advice for this 4 year relationship.",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/t99uw/young_20s_couple_she_was_once_caring_and_loving/,"I’ve been having much trouble with my girlfriend for the past two months and it’s really beginning to crush my emotional side.  I apologize in advance if this is slightly incoherent or long as I’m not in a very good place right now.  We are straight, in our early 20's, and have been together just under 4 years.

For some background: we met freshman year in college and hit it off splendidly.  We were each other’s firsts but she had some emotional baggage from a previous boyfriend.  I spent much of this time attempting to mitigate what he had done to her and tried to restore anything in her that was broken.   Later in our first year together we had both developed an alcohol problem and during one particular drunken night I cheated on her.  I have since been forgiven and certainly had to pay the price for what I did.   

We spent the next 2 years extremely close to each other and truly developed as partners/best friends/lovers.  There was a rough patch during one summer (we’d visit each other every two weeks or so when we weren’t at school)  where I became emotionally neglectful due to a few heavy lies regarding her past that she had told me.  We made up in a very cathartic outpouring of emotion.  

Everything was well for the next year, aside from normal, little fights and what not; typical of any relationship.  Fast forward to this past January: she had been complaining about me not being romantic enough despite everything else being seemingly normal.  I have to be honest in that I cannot justify or conjure some bullshit excuse as to why I wasn’t being romantic enough.  I wasn’t there for her in that way to the extent that she needed.  That being said, there was still romance in our relationship, just not enough.  I may have been becoming bored of her and the relationship.

Up until this point she had been for the most part wonderful; a joy to be with.  Extremely caring, selfless, and possessed what appeared to be a bottomless well of unconditional love.  But one weekend she “snapped” and couldn’t handle me anymore, leaving me for what seemed like the first weekend apart in years (we did regard each other as best friends after all) and in my drunken state of idiocy  I repeatedly called her and said some generally fucked up things.  This happened twice and another time or two in a much more mild manner.  Very bad move on my part.  I was being overbearing but my motive was to prevent this girl that I love, who had become such a large part of my life, fade from me.  Yet in doing so I had pushed her farther away.

We’ve had a few good times since then but it’s not the same.  That warm, radiating love energy is gone from her.  I’ve been trying my hardest to be as loving as possible but it’s certainly difficult when it’s not reciprocated.    Now I’ll be leaving college in a few days to go home for the summer but she on the other hand she will be interning somewhere across the country for 3 months, by far the longest we’ve been separated.  Today I was very upset with her for working an extra shift (a little part time job that is easy to call out of) as we only have this one weekend left with each other, but she insisted and I became a bit hysterical with crying as I realized that she’ll truly be leaving shortly.  The fact that she chose working this extra shift instead of being with me hurt greatly and she’ll be doing the same tomorrow.  The worst part is she is now out with her friends after I told her I really need to be with her after work, as she did the night before. 

I’ve called her and explained how this is crushing and emotionally neglectful to me as I’ve been reduced to a crying mess, which isn’t who I am!  But she just responds with anger and frustration at how I’m making her feel bad about herself.  I’ve tried to give her space but now there’s no more space to give and I’m really heartbroken that it’s becoming ever more apparent how likely it is that we will break up during her internship.  Realizing how fragile or ephemeral our relationship is makes me appreciate how great everything was in the past.  But she won’t cut me any slack.  She simply doesn’t seem to care for me or love me anymore.  It’s horribly depressing and has induced multiple panic attacks.  I know I’ve been far from perfect but I feel so worthless right now falling from whom she cared for most to something that’s so easily marginalized.  It’s as if my emotions mean nothing to her.

I ask of you reddit:  what is a guy to do?  

**TL;DR**  Girlfriend of 4 years was once loving, now doesn't seem to care about me and neglects me when I pour my heart out to her.  I feel like the relationship is falling apart and it's making me feel worthless.  She's about to leave for a few months which makes everything feel more urgent.

t93m5,14,2012-05-05,feeling really lost in life,sighfeelinghopeless,GetMotivated,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/comments/t93m5/feeling_really_lost_in_life/,"This is probably more of a rant, but if anyone does read, any advice would be greatly appreciated. This is the most lost I've ever felt in my life, but I do realize its not a hopeless situation and that all my problems are just first world yet I still can't bring myself to turn it around. I've always been a hardworking student who got good grades. I got a full scholarship studying engineering at a selective school and graduated with a good GPA with work experience and extracurricular activities. I was one of those students who had to work really hard for the grades, but managed to do very well. 

My motivation I believe stemmed from genuine belief that all of this would be paid off with a great job and a bright future. However, during my senior year, I realized I wasn't crazy about the entry level jobs I was looking at and decided to go the higher education route. I decided to do a Master's degree as the years getting a PhD seemed far too many. I didn't want to be too far distance wise from my grandparents as I am their primary caretaker and ended up attending a very expensive yet mediocre school for engineering, and what I believe to be one of the biggest mistakes of my life. 

Midway through taking classes that were barely beneficial, I interned for a company for several months to buy some time to figure out what I want to do with my life. This began my downfall. When I still didn't do anything to further my career towards the end of my internship (I don't want to return to the same company due to how far it is from home), I decided to return to school and give it another chance. Once again, every class seemed worthless and too expensive, and so I dropped all but one and figured I'll look for a job with the free time. After three failed interviews, one with a really great company that I had high hopes for, I came to a complete stop in my job search and just haven't brought myself to apply for one in months. I started to wonder if engineering was even for me, starting to doubt if I even chose the right career path for my natural abilities as it never did seem to come easily to me. I instead started using all of my free time (and as I realize what a joke this one class was, barely any time for homework) trying to learn other skills and make side money for rent and food. 

I'm at the end of the semester, and I haven't submitted my only project (days late) from what seems to be complete apathy for my Master's degree as I believe it's best to drop out since I'll need another 20k to finish. Yet I realize that I really need to get a full time job to get by and my side online job is not going to sustain me. However, I have literally spent the last few days doing absolutely nothing for my project or my job search, and have just curled up in front of the internet trying to do everything else to take my mind away from reality and starting to believe that I've just become truly truly lazy. Over these few months, I have stopped talking to people in my life, not even reading messages that I get because I don't want to face anyone I knew in my past and have them learn how pathetic I've become. I cry every night feeling absolutely sick to my stomach that I'm this way yet can't bring myself to change it. I don't know how this all happened, how I became so useless and apathetic when just two years ago I would go out of my way to get that 100 percent on my HW/exam grade. 

I want to start supporting my mom who's been diagnosed with depression for the past year and decided not to work anymore and provide a steady supply of money to my grandparents, but I'm so afraid of another rejection. I'm not even sure where to even begin my job search especially now as a Master's degree dropout (what would I put on my resume?). I can't for the life of me get my shit together and finish my project and just stop acting like a truly worthless human being. I know it's something I just have to do, and as much as I believe this, I just don't. I feel so helpless and unmotivated and angry at myself. I feel like I screwed up everything and that all my hard work in the past was for nothing. I haven't spoken to anyone in days apart from my family, and truly wish I can wither away. I hate what I've become and have changed for the worse.

This isn't the me that I imagined as a hopeful eager freshman so many years ago. I see everyone else around me (even those who barely worked in college) with full time jobs or completing their grad degree, excelling in life and wonder where I've gone wrong. I know any sane person should be able to get out of this situation alright, but why do I feel so weak? I have all the resources in front of me and healthy as a horse. I'm almost 24 and feel like I'm as mature as a 12 year old. How can I be so weak as an adult when I should have all my shit figured out by now, and be able to stand on my own two feet. Back in college, I always challenged myself and reached for goals, now I feel like I do everything possible to just be safe and not fail. I no longer have any confidence in my abilities because I have just failed so many times and only want to get by unnoticed in life. I really needed to just write all this down. I'll be damn surprised if someone actually reads this, but anyone gone through something similar?  "

tbmcw,6,2012-05-07,"3rd year and burned out, sick of school... what are the options?",[deleted],college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/tbmcw/3rd_year_and_burned_out_sick_of_school_what_are/,"After hearing for years about how most people who drop out of college do so after only a semester or two, I'm finding myself in the opposite situation. I busted my ass working hard and getting good grades for my first two years, my lightest term so far was more credits than some people take in their heaviest terms, and I'm working two jobs as well because I really want to get out of here without a whole lot of debt. 


I've been doing a ridiculous amount of school and work, and I've also been leading two student groups, but up until now I've somehow had the motivation and enthusiasm to be able to pull it all off. But over the past couple of weeks, I've started to think about things and realize how phenomenally stupid the entire situation is. I'm constantly running around doing things for other people, because I tend to base my self-worth on others' opinions of me, and I'd hate myself for letting everyone down if I quit any of the jobs or clubs. 


The main thing I used to motivate myself to do well in my first two years of boring prerequisite courses was the promise of interesting, technical courses for my final two years, and an interesting job after that. But now that I'm finally in those ""interesting"" courses and have a job very similar to what I'll probably end up in for my career, I've found out that the stupid boring classes are a much better representation of how a job in this field will be, and the ""interesting"" classes are crippled by the lowest common denominator of my unintelligent peers, to the point where I learn far more by ignoring the professor completely and reading Reddit and Hacker News. 


Now my grades are starting to suffer, because I'm not putting in the time that the professors seem to want me to, and I'm preoccupied with the idea of finding some way out. I don't know if they'd let me back if I took a gap year, and I'll have no time for vacation this summer because I have a really ""good"" internship, which I'm afraid is only going to cement my negative opinions of my field more thoroughly. I've gotten enough scholarships through the years that I could combine my internship salary and savings and pay off what few loans I have if I dropped out of college after this term, but I have no idea what I'd do then. 


I'm starting to think that majoring in the field that I enjoy (computer science) was one of the dumbest decisions I've ever made, because school and work are starting to ruin coding for me. 


Redditors, have you been here? How did you get out, and what advice did you wish you'd known when you were where I am now? 


tl;dr: Burned out on school because the ""rewards"" for putting up with stupid shit turn out to be just more of the same stupidity. Seeking wisdom from others who've been there too."
tbfkm,90,2012-05-07,"So, I used to have faith in humanity. Then I had an internship at IBM when I was 16-17.",aveilleux,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/tbfkm/so_i_used_to_have_faith_in_humanity_then_i_had_an/,"First off: anyone who's ever been a teenager and absolutely blown their parents/teachers/whatever away with tech knowledge will know exactly what I'm going to talk about. You know: ""I've been working with computers since before you were born, so I *obviously* know more than you!""

It was very difficult when I had an internship at IBM (I was 16-17 at the time) because I was a lab technician, which means I did a shit-ton of troubleshooting on the Windows and Linux servers (a few AIX, HP/UX, and Solaris servers thrown in for good measure). The developers (bless their little 40-60-year-old hearts) knew next to nothing about the proper usage of Windows and absolutely nothing about hardware.

I once had a guy email me instructions on how to reset a token ring LAN because the network was down. (Yeah, I didn't get that email until after the network issues were resolved... he was a clever one.) IBM hasn't used token ring LANs for decades.

A very common theme was a shortcut to My Computer, My Documents and Internet Explorer (needed for testing, be quiet) rather than the actual system icons on the desktop.

Another time a developer complained he couldn't find the Start menu. He was VNC'd into a Red Hat machine ಠ_ಠ

Though this still tops everything: the lab I worked in (Lotus QE test lab 2) houses approximately 750 servers. These are wired into switches, one at the end of every row, which are then wired into a massive switch running along one wall. (That switch is then fiber-linked to whatever ISP IBM uses.) The wires run along rails on the ceiling before coming down to their ports on the wall. It's all very neat and organized... until *developers* come along and mess with the cables. We have hostnames assigned by MAC address, but we have to manually refresh the system (security reasons, I guess?) every time a server is disconnected from one ethernet port and plugged into another. Right after determining that the server is turned on and plugged into the network, it became habit to check the wall of cables and make sure each one corresponded with the correct port.

This happened every. Single. Day.

For *eighteen months*.

I could go on, but I think I'll stop here. Maybe later (once I remember them) I'll tell some of my lucky break stories."

tawf1,76,2012-05-07,CHILDHOOD RUINED...,jennafoo33,Scary,https://www.reddit.com/r/Scary/comments/tawf1/childhood_ruined/,"I was an intern at Nickelodeon Studios for a year in 2005 for my degree in animation. It wasn't paid of course, most internships aren't, but it did have some perks beyond education. To adults it might not seem like a big one, but most kids at the time would go crazy over it. 
Now, since I worked directly with the editors and animators, I got to view the new episodes days before they aired. I'll get right to it without giving too many unnecessary details. They had very recently made the SpongeBob movie and the entire staff was somewhat sapped of creativity so it took them longer to start up the season. But the delay lasted longer for more upsetting reasons. There was a problem with the series 4 premiere that set everyone and everything back for several months.
 Me and two other interns were in the editing room along with the lead animators and sound editors for the final cut. We received the copy that was supposed to be ""Fear of a Krabby Patty"" and gathered around the screen to watch. Now, given that it isn't final yet animators often put up a mock title card, sort of an inside joke for us, with phony, often times lewd titles, such as ""How sex doesn't work"" instead of ""Rock-a-bye-Bivalve"" when SpongeBob and Patrick adopt a sea scallop. Nothing particularly funny but work related chuckles. So when we saw the title card ""Squidward's Suicide"" we didn't think it more than a morbid joke.
One of the interns did a small throat laugh at it. The happy-go-lucky music plays as is normal. The story began with Squidward practicing his clarinet, hitting a few sour notes like normal. We hear SpongeBob laughing outside and Squidward stops, yelling at him to keep it down as he has a concert that night and needs to practice. SpongeBob says okay and goes to see Sandy with Patrick. The bubbles splash screen comes up and we see the ending of Squidward's concert. This is when things began to seem off. 
While playing, a few frames repeat themselves, but the sound doesn't (at this point sound is synced up with animation, so, yes, that's not common) but when he stops playing, the sound finishes as if the skip never happened. There is slight murmuring in the crowd before they begin to boo him. Not normal cartoon booing that is common in the show, but you could very clearly hear malice in it. Squidward's in full frame and looks visibly afraid. The shot goes to the crowd, with SpongeBob in center frame, and he too is booing, very much unlike him. That isn't the oddest thing, though. What is odd is everyone had hyper realistic eyes. Very detailed. Clearly not shots of real people's eyes, but something a bit more real than CGI. The pupils were red. Some of us looked at each other, obviously confused, but since we weren't the writers, we didn't question its appeal to children yet.
 
The shot goes to Squidward sitting on the edge of his bed, looking very forlorn. The view out of his porthole window is of a night sky so it isn't very long after the concert. The unsettling part is at this point there is no sound. Literally no sound. Not even the feedback from the speakers in the room. It's as if the speakers were turned off, though their status showed them working perfectly. He just sat there, blinking, in this silence for about 30 seconds, then he started to sob softly. He put his hands (tentacles) over his eyes and cried quietly for a full minute more, all the while a sound in the background very slowly growing from nothing to barely audible. It sounded like a slight breeze through a forest. 
The screen slowly begins to zoom in on his face. By slow I mean it's only noticeable if you look at shots 10 seconds apart side by side. His sobbing gets louder, more full of hurt and anger. The screen then twitches a bit, as if it twists in on itself, for a split second then back to normal. The wind-through-the-trees sound gets slowly louder and more severe, as if a storm is brewing somewhere. The eerie part is this sound, and Squidward's sobbing, sounded real, as if the sound wasn't coming from the speakers but as if the speakers were holes the sound was coming through from the other side. As good as sound as the studio likes to have, they don't purchase the equipment to be that good to produce sound of that quality. 
Below the sound of the wind and sobbing, very faint, something sounded like laughing. It came at odd intervals and never lasted more than a second so you had a hard time pinning it (we watched this show twice, so pardon me if things sound too specific but I've had time to think about them). After 30 seconds of this, the screen blurred and twitched violently and something flashed over the screen, as if a single frame was replaced. 
The lead animation editor paused and rewound frame by frame. What we saw was horrible. It was a still photo of a dead child. He couldn't have been more than 6. The face was mangled and bloodied, one eye dangling over his upturned face, popped. He was naked down to his underwear, his stomach crudely cut open and his entrails laying beside him. He was laying on some pavement that was probably a road. 
The most upsetting part was that there was a shadow of the photographer. There was no crime tape, no evidence tags or markers, and the angle was completely off for a shot designed to be evidence. It would seem the photographer was the person responsible for the child's death. We were of course mortified, but pressed on, hoping that it was just a sick joke. 
The screen flipped back to Squidward, still sobbing, louder than before, and half body in frame. There was now what appeard to be blood running down his face from his eyes. The blood was also done in a hyper realistic style, looking as if you touched it you'd get blood on your fingers. The wind sounded now as if it were that of a gale blowing through the forest; there were even snapping sounds of branches. The laughing, a deep baritone, lasting at longer intervals and coming more frequently. After about 20 seconds, the screen again twisted and showed a single frame photo. 
The editor was reluctant to go back, we all were, but he knew he had to. This time the photo was that of what appeared to be a little girl, no older than the first child. She was laying on her stomach, her barrettes in a pool of blood next to her. Her left eye was too popped out and popped, naked except for underpants. Her entrails were piled on top of her above another crude cut along her back. Again the body was on the street and the photographer's shadow was visible, very similar in size and shape to the first. I had to choke back vomit and one intern, the only female in the room, ran out. The show resumed. 
About 5 seconds after this second photo played, Squidward went silent, as did all sound, like it was when this scene started. He put his tentacles down and his eyes were now done in hyper realism like the others were in the beginning of this episode. They were bleeding, bloodshot, and pulsating. He just stared at the screen, as if watching the viewer. After about 10 seconds, he started sobbing, this time not covering his eyes. The sound was piercing and loud, and most fear inducing of all is his sobbing was mixed with screams. 
Tears and blood were dripping down his face at a heavy rate. The wind sound came back, and so did the deep voiced laughing, and this time the still photo lasted for a good 5 frames. 
The animator was able to stop it on the 4th and backed up. This time the photo was of a boy, about the same age, but this time the scene was different. The entrails were just being pulled out from a stomach wound by a large hand, the right eye popped and dangling, blood trickling down it. The animator proceeded. It was hard to believe, but the next one was different but we couldn't tell what. He went on to the next, same thing. He want back to the first and played them quicker and I lost it. I vomited on the floor, the animating and sound editors gasping at the screen. The 5 frames were not as if they were 5 different photos, they were played out as if they were frames from a video. We saw the hand slowly lift out the guts, we saw the kid's eyes focus on it, we even saw two frames of the kid beginning to blink. 
The lead sound editor told us to stop, he had to call in the creator to see this. Mr. Hillenburg arrived within about 15 minutes. He was confused as to why he was called down there, so the editor just continued the episode. Once the few frames were shown, all screaming, all sound again stopped. Squidward was just staring at the viewer, full frame of the face, for about 3 seconds. The shot quickly panned out and that deep voice said ""DO IT"" and we see in Squidward's hands a shotgun. He immediately puts the gun in his mouth and pulls the trigger. Realistic blood and brain matter splatters the wall behind him, and his bed, and he flies back with the force. The last 5 seconds of this episode show his body on the bed, on his side, one eye dangling on what's left of his head above the floor, staring blankly at it. Then the episode ends.
Mr. Hillenburg is obviously angry at this. He demanded to know what the heck was going on. Most people left the room at this point, so it was just a handful of us to watch it again. Viewing the episode twice only served to imprint the entirety of it in my mind and cause me horrible nightmares. I'm sorry I stayed.
 
The only theory we could think of was the file was edited by someone in the chain from the drawing studio to here. The CTO was called in to analyze when it happened. The analysis of the file did show it was edited over by new material. However, the timestamp of it was a mere 24 seconds before we began viewing it. All equipment involved was examined for foreign software and hardware as well as glitches, as if the time stamp may have glitched and showed the wrong time, but everything checked out fine. We don't know what happened and to this day nobody does."

Every now and then, someone will delete their account noting how Reddit is their primary source of procrastination. I know how hard it is to delete your accounts and never come back, but something that's even harder (but to me, more rewarding), is making an account that only has access to a specific set of subreddits.

I decided that I had had enough of opening a picture of Reddit, laughing, and moving on to the next. I had had enough of reading story after story of someone else's great quests when I could've been out making my own. I endeavored to quit Reddit for good, but then I remembered that this site has also been an excellent source of info.

So I created this account. Through my hard work I will be beginning a very selective internship in the business-field soon, so I am only subscribed to the primary business and economics related subreddits, /r/fitness, and of course, /r/getmotivated. It was hard to quit totally, I initially left /r/askreddit in and also subscribed to /r/nba thinking I was allowed one time-waster, but really I just spent most of my time there.

I urge you to try it. Reddit is what you make of it. It can easily be a tool of procrastination and wasted-time but can also be a great asset in increasing productivity and obtaining knowledge.

I am currently in a long distance relationship. I see my boyfriend every 3 or 4 months or so, and usually for only a week to two weeks at a time. Because of the fact that I only have sex a couple weeks every 1/3 or 1/4 of a year and because of the cost, I (up until now) haven't seen it worth it to be on a continuous round of birth control pills. Thus, we rely on condoms. 

Also, I have an irregular period and I don't really keep track of them (again, because I don't have sex often and thus most of the time I don't really need to keep track. Realizing now that this is a bad idea). I keep trying to figure out when my last period was ... I know that I wasn't on my period by the time I went to see my boyfriend, which was on April 7th. Thus it must have started at least a week before that, but probably even before that. 

SO. I haven't had my period in probably at least 36 days, most likely more. The last time I had sex was two weeks ago, almost exactly. We used a condom every. single. time, and we weren't aware of any ripping. I took a pregnancy test today and it was negative. This doesn't really make me feel TOO much better, considering my period is still M.I.A 

But here's where it gets really bad. In one week I am partaking in a rural internship for my education degree and I will be spending 4 weeks in an EXTREMELY rural location (no doctor) and there is nowhere in the entire province for me to get an abortion. I already know that if i am pregnant that I will get an abortion and I feel relatively fine about it, but I really don't think I am going to be able to survive for 4 weeks in this rural place knowing that i'm pregnant and not being able to do anything about it. I think i'll turn into a lump that can't get out of bed. 

I need suggestions, or help, or just kind words, or something. I am really freaking out here. "

I have been checking craigslist regularly but there are no responses to the ads, the places either disappear too quickly or are with a roommate or too expensive. 

I am looking for a 1br/1bath somewhere near Rice University/Galleria so that I can easily commute to my work but would also be willing to stay somewhere slightly further if the situation was good and the price was reasonable. I do not know anything about the Montrose neighborhood but most people have told me to stay away :| 

Anyway, I am a SAP who plans to be working long hours archiving information, spend limited time at home browsing the internet and watching TV/movies, I am very quiet and clean and do not go out much. 

I am looking for something between the price range of 500-800 (depending on what utilities are available) but really need to keep a budget because I am going to be dipping into my savings since the internship is unpaid. 

Does anyone know of anyone that would be willing to help me out or can help me find a place that meets my needs?

I'm sure the majority of people will be wearing T-Shirts and jeans (especially my fellow interns), but I want to make an impression and dress my age.  I'm mid-20's, older than my peers, and married - for some reason this makes me want to dress up more. Not to mention I'm trying to turn this into a full time position.  Some other possibly important things: I'm 5'6"", slim but not skinny, wide/broad shoulders.

I've been reading around, and here are my thoughts so far:

* Dark, fitting jeans (Levi 511/514 seem to fit me well)
* Khaki pants 
* Blucher shoes or boat shoes (I prefer brown leather)
* Lots and lots of business button-up casual shirts (whites, blues, subtle patterns)
* A light cotton blazer (summer time, but I think I look good in jackets)

The main predicament I have is, will I stand out too much? Is there something I can do that will make me more dressed-down without being sloppy?  I have tons of nerdy graphic tees, and I have no idea what to do with them.

I'm on a student budget, but I'm willing to push it to the limit.

My availability is wide open until mid-late August, which is when I will be enrolled in classes at ODU. Therefore, I've declined some FT positions because I believe in not wasting anyone's time in case my classes can not work around a FT schedule come this fall.

tcaah,22,2012-05-07,Boyfriend and I moved to the big city together. Now I'm suddenly left behind.,Down_A_Peg,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/tcaah/boyfriend_and_i_moved_to_the_big_city_together/,"Been a lurker for some time now. I was hesitant on posting to Reddit for advice, but I've hit a brick wall and I'm not sure what to do. Any advice is welcome and much appreciated. I understand I'm about to post a wall of text, but even just one person's advice is enough for me.


My boyfriend (23/M) and I (22/F) have been together for about two years. Everything was great. We met in Ohio where we are originally from. We both had ambitions of moving to Chicago at some point, so we decided to do it back in February. It was a little sooner than expected, but eagerness reached the best of both of us.


Fast forward to the present. We moved into a tiny one-bedroom apartment together, and we work the same job in a small business for a friend. It's been about two months since this has went on. We see each other 24/7, and we started bickering back and forth about stupid things. I assume this has to do with the fact that we get no privacy anymore. We have lived together previously, but we worked different jobs and separate hours. After another pointless argument one day, the tension grows, and he ends the relationship. Just like that. I tried to rationally talk some sense into him but nothing I said worked. It was like talking to a wall.


It's been about three weeks since this has happened. We still see each other at work, but I've been temporarily living with a new friend. All of our Chicago friends are mutual as well, so there have been occasions where we'd both be invited somewhere, and both attend. A lot of times he would treat me normally and do his harmless flirting, but I eventually told him I couldn't handle that if he doesn't want us to work. 


After a few long conversations here and there, I found out the reason he left me is because he wants his ""me"" time, and that I don't inspire him.. He also admitted the other day that he's afraid of commitment and is running away. This I knew. What bothers me most is the fact that I don't inspire him. Is this fair to me? He just obtained his Bachelor's Degree in game design, and is working an internship with a game company. I'm very proud of him. On the other hand, I'm still in college, debating over what I truly want to major in. I'm not terribly far behind, I just started my college education later than most people. I'm a step away from my Associate's Degree. It's not exactly where I'd like to be. I'd like to be further, but there's nothing I can do about that right now except take classes at a normal pace. He moves at a very fast pace and needs to be constantly succeeding, which isn't a bad thing. However, I don't move as quickly as he. I do have plenty of hobbies. I know I'm not boring. I enjoy making costumes, playing video games, exercising, and I'm taking up calligraphy. My job requires traveling around the country to sell at conventions and I love it. I ride horses but I haven't been able to lately due to the time and money it takes to commit to it. I have a good head on my shoulders, and I'm very understanding and down to earth.


Another problem is that he's been chatting with a girl via texts. They met back in January, and their level of talking has increased after we moved together. Luckily she lives quite a ways away. He told me that her work inspires him. She's a talented artist. That's great; whatever. She has feelings for him, but he's told me and his other friends that he friend-zoned her multiple times. Should I believe this? I may be over-analyzing. He's not the type of person to talk to two girls at once. Then again, his mind has been kind of a mess after all of this.


He told me the other day he wants to work things out with me, to take things slowly and build back up to where we were. Instead of immediately jumping for joy, I asked him if he was sure about this. He didn't respond for a bit, and eventually said he isn't ready. Now we're (kind of) back to square one. I want to wait for him, but at the same time I don't because it's much more painful than I expected it to be. I love him. He says he loves me and has never loved anyone this way. He tells me time and time again I'm basically perfect, even after he has left me. 


Apologies for all the text. If someone could help me out, I would love to listen. Is there any hope for this relationship? I want to give him his space, and I am. He just needs to understand that I won't be waiting here forever; it just hurts too much and this isn't easy. Am I expecting things to change too quickly? Time just seems a lot slower while dealing with all of this. I don't like being in this city without him. Don't get me wrong, this city is amazing. I'm just kind of lost in it right now. It damn near killed me when he said I don't inspire him. How can I inspire him? Is he just being stupid and having trouble dealing with his stress? Or am I expecting too much too soon?



**TL;DR** Moved to Chicago with the boyfriend. Suddenly he left me due to stress, wanting to be alone, and lack of inspiration. Yet he still says he loves me dearly and just needs time. Do I wait for him? Or do I think about myself and move on? I'd rather not move on. Not yet.

I've been taking online courses to learn other languages like CSS, Ruby, and JavaScript so that I am somewhat prepared for an internship. My coding is fine, but I feel like there is still more out there to learn. I have sent out my resume to dozens of companies looking for web design/development interns this summer. I have heard back from a great deal of them and have a few interviews when I return from school next week. 


The problem that I have with these opportunities is that the employers ask that I work on the site from home on my own (No help from someone with greater experience that currently maintains the site, nor another intern to partner up with). When I signed up to work for these companies, I came in assuming that I would be working under someone who has been working with the site for a while and could teach me more about web design in general.

A few questions for you all:

* Should I take the job and teach myself how to master the site on my own over the summer? 

* Should I request to have a mentor or someone else to guide me through the stages of building the site? 

* Should I just forget it and look for jobs outside of Web Design/Development? 

* How did you get started with your career with design and/or development?

tfb5d,9,2012-05-09,A bit of advice starting an SEO digital marketing internship and the first week is not what I expected....,thrillho111,SEO,https://www.reddit.com/r/SEO/comments/tfb5d/a_bit_of_advice_starting_an_seo_digital_marketing/,"So after graduating from university and taking care of an ill family member for most of the last year, I am finally starting an internship at an SEO company that helps small businesses get an online presence and increase their traffic. I have been really excited as I have had some experience using social media as an administrator for a university society, and in my free time use it to discuss pro-wrestling and other entertainment (I would like to think I use it more and a larger set of social media networks than the average person). I also managed to write a bit about the topic for a paper while studying. Anyway, while looking after this family member and having a previous bad experience in my first job of publishing, I decided to try and make this a career and do something that has given me a lot of pleasure in my leisure time. 

So I started the internship last week. I've been slowly learning basics on my own up to now, reading Google's guide on SEO, listening to several podcasts (though I still have a lot to get through) etc. I still have things to learn, such as basic computer tech stuff like HTML but I'm getting their slowly as I can see it is quite a bit essential especially when looking at websites and advising what can be changed (I'm able to pick up things from just appearance at the moment). I studied English and Media, so I do not have a computing background (so any advice on things to read or look at to get me up to speed at a level that is at least satisfactory would be of much help). 

Anyway, in my first few days I was a bit alarmed that my boss was asking me to edit fake FB profiles to change a previous student to appear as a mature woman for the purposes of spamming. I have also been asked to use WordPress to edit a site about cash loans, which have a lot of anchor text links to cash loan providers within the articles and for tags. My boss also has a Twitter account under a different name and admitted that one of her clients thinks this is her real name. From my brief reading and basic common sense, I can tell that this isn't right and I understand that it is a slow and steady process to get results for anyone in SEO and social media.

My boss seems a bit flighty and while planning a wedding, is also taking on a few other additional projects. There are quite a lot of things that she said she intends to go through with me and she has begun doing that (like using Squidoo and Hubpages). My boss has also said she will go through Google services like Adwords and Adsense though I have done my own reading into this to prepare.

The internship goes on till the end of July so I'm confident that I still have ages to learn new things and it HAS only been the first week and a bit. I'm not getting coffee or doing many of the usual remedial tasks that an internship usually consists of, which is a plus. It is also only 4 days a week so I'm picking up some part-time work on the side.

I'm not sure what the point of this post is. I think partly to ask for advice or ask if there is something I should watch out for. Has anyone else had previous bad experience within companies who are not exactly using White Hat strategies or are kosher? Also is there anything I ought to be reading/listening to as far as starting out and keeping updated in the world of SEO and social media? I already listening to SEO 101 and SEO Advisor while I work so I am making the most of my day. I've already made up my mind that, once I get involved in actual projects for the company, that if I am asked to do something Black Hat or something that makes me feel uncomfortable, I'll make it known that I do as I don't want to be pressured into doing something that will come back to me and I'll be blamed for.

Anything I should be listening to/reading?
Anything to cover the detailed techy stuff such as HTML to get me to an OK level.
Should I be worried or is this just another case of starting out in an industry and ""paying dues""?
Anything I should watch out for?
Am I asking the right questions or is there anything I've missed?

This post is a bit all over the place I know; I guess I just have quite a bit on my mind at the moment.
Thanks in advance

UPDATE: Just a quick note to say thanks to everyone who replied or commented, and more so if you also provided recommendations for things to listen to or read. It was really helpful to listen to your own experiences. I actually had a really good day today, and I'm looking on the bright side that I have 10 weeks left and lots to learn whether through my boss or individually. I think when I created this I was having a rough day and needed a vent, and you've all responded very kindly. I'm in no means a bad situation compared to some things that are posted on Reddit daily so all is good. I'm actually going to return to a WordPress site I created in February on pro-wrestling (I'm a big fan) and use what I'm learning as I go along and apply it there, which is a pursuit which will seem actually feel fun and be productive. Again, thanks and I enjoy prowling r/SEO whenever I can :)"

Its great for what it's supposed to do but it doesn't have the most intuitive interface and features. I'm an intern in the DataCenter with a STRONG background in programming. I was talking to some of our SAs and they expressed that there seems to be a serious gap between the different monitoring solutions. For instance, ServersAlive costs $200/yr and works well but doesn't have all the features we want. A year ago we almost went with a $100,000 Quest Foglight solution but decided the money could be better spent elsewhere. I'm looking at developing a solution on my own time which will satisfy the needs of organizations which need to monitor a large number of servers but don't need to spend tens of thousands of dollars implementing a monitoring solution.

So, I ask this: What types of features are you looking for in a monitoring solution? If possible please rate them on level of necessity (IE something nice to have, or must have). What types of things are important? What OS it runs on? Monitoring from multiple points on the network? How important is support for a solution like this? Will email support with &lt;12hr turnaround suffice? What types of systems are you looking to track (ping/db connectivity/service status/etc)?

I know it doesn't seem like much but should I finish my work and am happy with the solution, anyone who provides reasonably valuable feedback in this thread will have the opportunity to run the solution for free.

I'm a to be junior in college majoring in Computer Science. I'm an active member in our campus' Epic Movement, which is the Asian American focused branch of Campus Crusade for Christ (now known as Cru). I have had many opportunities this past year when I was looking for what my summer plans were, I was given the opportunity to work at an internship, work at a [Bible Camp](http://www.camprivercrest.org), and I was accepted to the Summer Project. All of these opportunities seemed awesome to me, and it was so difficult to choose, my parents wanted me to do something where I would make money. The day before I was supposed to tell all the supervisors what I had decided, I was almost certain I was going to choose the Bible Camp.

That night, I started feeling really uneasy and didn't feel right about Camp, so I started talking to some friends about it, and ended up feeling like I was called to [San Francisco](http://gosummerproject.com/projects/424). I've been on the road of support for some time now, and I would like to share my [support letter](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/73556255/support%20letter.doc) with everyone. In my support letter, it explains the cost of the project and what we'll be doing in San Francisco. The cost in the letter says $4400, but the cost has very recently been lowered to $4000 (Praise God!).

My support raising has been tough, as until now I have been fairly passive about it, but I now understand how active I need to be for this. So why am I making this post? I want to ask Reddit for support, I need help in this, it's humbling to be here asking people I don't know for prayer and finances. 

If anyone would like to support me, you can mail me a check (address in the support letter) or send by PayPal at beeyee2010@yahoo.com. I'm very new to PayPal, so check would be the better option overall, as I don't really know what I'm doing with PayPal yet. I have seen some of those donation websites that some people use, if anyone thinks I should use one of those, let me know. To those who want to keep updated on how everything is going, I keep a [blog](http://beeyeesanfran2012.tumblr.com/) and update it fairly frequently. Feel free to contact me by PM or by email at beeyee2010@yahoo.com or beeyee0401@gmail.com.

I come to you today at the end of my rope.  I truly have no idea where to go from here.  I know what my issues are (at least I believe I do) and I need guidance from the community that the FAQ was not able to answer for me, at least in the detail I require.

First and foremost!  Basic information to help you figure me out:

-Male

-20 Years old

-173 Pounds

-6’1”

-Very limited weight lifting experience (less than a year)

-I do NOT have access to a bar that is NOT attached to a smith machine (the only gym in my area only has smith machines, and I am trying very actively to find one (a bar) for purchase, but for all intents and purposes I do not have access to the equipment necessary for Starting Strength, which I’ve most identified with)

-I have a fun little condition in which cardio causes me to erupt in painful, extremely itchy hives, and I’ve recently started taking Claritin in hopes it alleviates the wretched itchiness.  

My Goals:
Well, I have a myriad of health issues, and in attempts to prolong my life, I really, REALLY want to get in better shape than I am now.  However, it is at this junction I have been graced with an opportunity to surprise my SO.
She has currently gone away on an engineering internship in Maryland, and that leaves me 3 months all by my lonesome.  Well, as something I need to do- and because I love the gratification of lustful eyes- I have about 3 months to do as much as I can to revamp my body, with a primary focus on aesthetics, so that on my SO’s return, I can surprise her with a healthier, more attractive, version of myself.

Yes it is a bit silly to want to do this for that reason, but I’m a silly 20 year old male, and I’m asking for help.

Here are my questions:

1)	Should my main focus be weight lifting in conjunction with say, running, to lose as much body fat as possible to have the “cut” look? Or because I have such little weight lifting experience and an undefined musculature, if I cut the fat away would I just look like a tendon-y, skeletal monster?

2)	Should I just lift as heavy as I can and eat a metric-shit ton of food to gain as much muscle as I can and say to hell with cutting?  Go big or Go home?  If that’s the case and I can’t do SS as it is intended due to equipment restrictions, what program would you recommend?
 
3)	Perhaps it is a mix of both worlds?  Should I weight lift and eat big on my work out days, off days cardio and eat at maintenance?  Or something else?  Am I missing something obvious? 

4)	What would you have me do?  I have the will to succeed, strong discipline, and a time line.  

The Male inside me wants to say Strength is the priority.  The Boyfriend inside of me wants to say that Looks is the goal.  The ""I don't want to die at 40"" inside of me says ""whatever is best for my health, I'll do"".


I appreciate your time and consideration.

I'm a 22 year old male and my girlfriend is 20. We're both going to school and I'm currently doing an internship so I've got work all day. She is free all day, since she's done with school for the summer. We've been going out for around 2.5 years now and everything's been perfect, and it still really is (in my mind). We basically live together and we know each others schedules fairly well.

She went out with this guy back when she was like 15 or so, and broke up with him a month later. They're still in contact every once and a while, and he's ""never gotten over her."" She is ""over him"" and ""thinks he's absolutely gross"" and ""he's so weird"" yet she keeps talking to him. Even to this day, this guy confesses his feelings to her all of the time, and even asks her friends about her and if she ever talks about him, or if she has feelings back, how much he likes her, etc.

This guy will call/text my girlfriend constantly. She has no issue and isn't really hiding anything, but doesn't really tell me much either. This guy knows all this stuff about her, so I'm sure they talk a good amount... I don't want to be a nosy asshole so I don't really ask, but it's been on my mind recently. 

I don't really want to overreact, I just need someone else's opinion. She claims this guy is just a friend, and I absolutely know she's not cheating on me... but I just have a feeling that she has feelings for this guy again. She hangs out with him once and a while (never alone together, usually just at parties that he invites her to and she goes with her friends). I brought up that I was worried in the past and she has said stuff like ""don't worry, we're just friends, why can't I have friends that are guys"" ... and all that sort of stuff. I respond that I don't mind that she has guy friends at all, but it's just a little weird that this one regularly confesses his feelings to her and is constantly bugging her. 

Even recently this weekend, this guy had a party with his friends and invited her, and she brought me along. She later texted him ""she was sorry"" and ""she shouldn't have done that to him.""

So reddit, what should I be feeling here? I am hurting and angry inside, but I don't know what to do. "

""Okay, here goes nothing Reddit. (This may be a long one.)
(I will first off admit I am a little drunk, so things may not be grammaticality correct, spelling, etc.)
I have been in a relationship with this girl for 3 year. We have live together for 2. We had two dogs and two cats. Basically, we were on track for marriage. We have previously moved two other times, and were about to prepare for our third (and at the time final) move. On a couple of days before our third move, we had a talk about our relationship after I got out of work (I generally work late nights as a intern). We've had this talk before about where our relationship is going before - while we had both discussed marriage before and wanting to go forward with it after I had finished college (she had graduated back in December, I had a year left). It basically came down to ""We needed to take a break.""
She left that night to a friends. From there on out, I went to live at my mothers. We had many conversations that week that were emotionally charged and involved lots of crying. After the move, we met for dinner and drinks). We were both incredibly happy to see each other, with much affection from both parties. Since the break, we both managed to stay in contact, not just because of the move, but because of the obvious. After the dinner, we made plans to see a movie and just hang out at the mall (a bizarre choice on behalf of the mall admittedly), but those previous two encounters were distant and awkward. We were both tired, I from stress and her from having to take care of all the animals (I am not capable of taking care of any of the animals due to having a maximum of animals at my Mothers). Yet, in many conversations before, she had stated being sad about us not being together. She had admitted that she was sad because it was ""almost like she had lost a friend"".
Yet, I was a lot off worse.
The reason for the break was because both of us had to deal with personal habits we needed to deal with. I am generally not neat, I don't eat well, I manage my finances piss poorly, and I intern for a company that is an amazing opportunity but bend ass over backwards for the in an attempt to get a job next seamster (or at least a paid internship as my current job pays nothing and gives no hours at all). She also needed to learn how to be independent of me, as she could not carry a conversation without even mentioning me.
Or course, since I didn't want to force her into anything I obliged.
Since the break, I have become increasingly depressed. I continue to use alcohol and food as a crutch. I am no longer happy anymore. She was the only thing that kept me happy apparently, despite having such great opportunities with work and college. I try to distract myself with work, but it only works when i'm there. I've gotten back into writing music, but once I hit writers block, all these thoughts come back. I skip class frequently. I lose sleep due to the stress.
The big problem is that she can't keep her decisions straight. A week into the break, she wants to end EVERYTHING. I haven't even made any of the changes she had suggested. Her reason behind this was due to be being drunk at the time of the phone call and not having moved anything out of our previous house. Days later, we had realized we had a miscommunication about everything - she knew I was going to a beer fest and we had not discussed a date when I would move everything out.
Our previous two outings together were very distant. She had wanted to go out just ""as friends"". I obliged, just so I could see her. Yet, it hurt for me not to get any affection from her.
I have seen her once time since, last week.
Since I have not been getting any sleep due to it, I was in a daze when I saw her (I had to get her money for final bills at our old place). She had noticed I was not right, and asked twice if I was. I, of course, played poker face and lied. ""I'm fine. I'm just tired.""
Co-workers and friends have even noticed my depression. They of course help, but I am the type of person that wants input from anyone that can give it, no matter their stance, position, or relation to me.
So, I think that's it Reddit. Questions are encouraged, along with inboxes. I love this community and would love some sort of help. I still do love this girl and have invested a ton into this relationship to end it.
Thank you.""

Since then, I had learned she has been dating other people, sleeping around, and cheated on me once during the midnight hour before the break. This originally did not help my mental and emotional health, but I created distactions (like finally releasing music onto the global marketplace like iTunes and Spotify!) that helped sometimes. After finishing writing music, or going out, or working; I would still come back to my thoughts and think about the situation. To combat this, I would still drink. And I wrote out a letter. I finished this letter maybe a week ago, but never had the courage to send it out. 

I finally sent it out. Here's what it said:

""Hi,

I would have mentioned this during our phone call today, but since you were driving I didn't want to bug you: I need to get a couple of things off my chest.

I really, really miss you. To the point where it hurts me quite a lot. I know you don't feel comfortable talking right now during this period and I understand that, but it's really hurting me a lot and I find it quite, how should I put this - unfair. I know we are on a break, but it's really taking a toll on me - emotionally and mentally.

I miss everything about what we had. 

Everything. I miss seeing you, the animals (as I mentioned earlier), hanging out with you - you name it, I could go on. And I know you miss me also. 

I would love it if I could see you sometime soon. If we can, then great - let's set up a time sometime soon.

If not, that's fine too as I can't do anything about it, but it doesn't make me all that pleased. I know we want to make this work out, but for the sake of not only my emotional and mental health, but yours also - we really need to sit down and talk. 

I know we can work on what needs to be worked on while starting to date again (I have been working on these things and will continue to work on them).

Thanks for taking the time to hear me out.""

I really don't know where to go with this. I know she's not going to respond immediately. I actually went on a ""date"" yesterday. It was friendly. She was nice. I am also interested in a good friend of mine. 

In conclusion - I am hung up on my ""ex"", but still preparing for the worst. 

If you made it this far, Reddit user, you are a upstanding human being. 

Thanks. "

Questions|Answers
:--|:--
[Other than Twitter and Facebook, what modern day technology you most use to keep you informed on sports and other news? Does Reddit play a part there? Are you a redditor or just here for AMA?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lhrst?context=5)|I read the AP news wires all day at work, so I'm always informed on breaking news and stuff like that. As for Reddit: Reddit is my home page, so definitely. I don't really comment on stuff though. 
[You shouldn't be afraid to click that link unless you are at work.  It is nothing you haven't seen before.  But probably not things you really want to see.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lil33?context=5)|Jeez! There's everything on here!
[Why aren't women's professional sports more popular?  Do you find them to be enjoyable?  Will the WNBA still be here in 10 years?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4li0s9?context=5)|I can't stand the WNBA. So boring &amp; slow-paced. So no, I don't see the WNBA being around. (Sorry if I offended any fans. Do they exist?)
 |Women's soccer, however...so much better. I always enjoy the women's World Cup whenever it's on.
[Women's tennis might be more popular than men's. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lken4?context=5)|It's not, but it's very popular just like men's tennis. I just covered the Audi Melbourne Pro Tennis Classic and there was a surprisingly huge turnout. We're talking mid-ranked professional women's tennis. Biggest names there were Grace Min and Melanie Oudin. 
[I've heard there's actually a player cap for WNBA of ~$100k/year, and that the NBA pays out the rear to subsidize the WNBA.  Are you aware of this, and if its true, what are your thoughts about whether the absurdly low salaries hurt the sport.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lmg4k?context=5)|I am. I know the NBA loses money every year with the WNBA. It's kind of sad. Unfortunately, I don't think women's baksetball is entertaining enough to make a profit here in the US.
[Personally, I agree about the entertainment aspect, I was just curious as to whether you thought higher salaries could draw more entertaining talent.  I'm not sure I could name a WNBA player since Swoopes.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4ln0vz?context=5)|I think they already draw all of the entertaining talent. All of the top NCAA women's players go on to play for the WNBA. Maya Moore, anyone? 
[How many female sports do you report?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lhaqn?context=5)|I appreciate the sarcasm. But to answer: None, really. Unless if you consider NASCAR to be a female sport. Danica gets a lot of coverage.
[Yeah, but she's a really shitty stock car driver.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lhjfg?context=5)|Agreed.
[Upvotes for hearing a sports reporter that doesn't just adore everything Danica Patrick does.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lkeal?context=5)|Hahahahaha I think most reporters can't stand the attention she gets.
[I imagine your job would consist of constantly being hit on. Anyone we know?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lh9rm?context=5)|It happens (getting hit on), and it's annoying. I'm there to do my job and I love sports just as much as every other reporter covering it. Most athletes I cover get to know me personally and they don't normally hit on me. The athletes who do are usually from a visiting team.  I mostly get heckled from the fans. I understand, they're probably wasted anyways. So I just ignore them. I was sexually harassed by a mascot once.
 |Also: I was told by a female mentor - who is a well-known ESPN reporter - to wear a fake engagement ring to prevent myself from being hit on. I didn't, because I just thought wearing a pretend engagement ring was weird. I dunno. Anyways, fast forward a year...I get engaged. It doesn't prevent anything. It makes things worse. It's a target on my back. Haha.
[You got harassed by a mascot? I guess you're not a furry.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lhc9w?context=5)|It wasn't a furry mascot!! It was a Knightro: [Link to centric.cos.ucf.edu](http://centric.cos.ucf.edu/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/IMG_9910_-Rebekah-Kubik.jpg)
 |The reason why I say ""a"" Knightro is because about 10 people dress up as Knightro for UCF. So, yeah.
 |That was a few years back. Good times.
[I'm guessing it's Erin.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lkzgn?context=5)|It's not. I'm not a huge fan of EA's, to be honest. I think she's more in it for the celebrity aspect.
[Aw, you didn't answer the 'anyone we know bit'!  Good on you, BTW. in Australia we have had a few women making inroads into sport commentary, reporting and even as referees for the more macho sports. It's a nice change from the usual style.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lhe2z?context=5)|You mean, you don't know who Knightro is?!
[UCF student here, that is hilarious. GO Knights!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4m8rsk?context=5)|Go Knights!
[I can see where you might think that, over the years, she's become more ""glamorous"" and such, but when she started out, she was very sweet and nice.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4ll2gz?context=5)|Put it this way: I used to idolize her until I found out who she really is.
[Is it a Pokemon?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lhjfv?context=5)|HA.
[What qualities were needed for the job (except looking pretty, I guess that good looks is important for television\)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lhhed?context=5)|Being comfortable in any situation and being comfortable on camera. I don't think it's about good looks. I've seen plenty of ugly TV reporters. I think it's more about how you present yourself.
[Have you always been interested in sports?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lhhed?context=5)|I've always lived and breathed sports. Was always a tomboy growing up. Sports are a big part of my life. Can't imagine life without them.
[Do you have a go to question to try and break the ice when interviewing somebody new?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4limf5?context=5)|I like to ask a few icebreaker questions before, and I keep a few interesting questions in my back pocket. If I feel that the interview is going well, I'll break out an interesting question.
[Most hilarious on-air blooper (if any?\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lhbts?context=5)|Haven't had one on-air, thank goodness. I've had a lot of off-air moments like: ""Shit, my mic isn't clipped right. Are you taping this? Stop focusing on my boobs, camera guy!""
[Biggest sports celebrity you've interviewed?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lhc5k?context=5)|Michael Jordan. If you would have told me when I was 8 years old that I was going to interview Michael Jordan, I would have died. He was a hero growing up.
[Biggest sports celebrity who has hit on you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lhc5k?context=5)|In terms of biggest name who has hit on me: It's usually the practice squad guys or guys in college. Famous athletes usually aren't pigs with reporters, because they're smart enough to know not to mess with us because we'll write a story on them. 
[Oh My God, Michael Jordan! Did you ask anything about Space Jam?!!?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lhfdc?context=5)|I did, actually. I asked if a Part 2 was coming out and if Marcus and Jeffrey (his sons) were going to be in it. He wasn't amused. The reporters around me were. 
[I've heard he's not the nicest guy. Confirm or deny?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lito6?context=5)|Wasn't a jerk, but didn't exactly come off to me as good guy Greg. 
[Are you an avid reddit user?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lkt5m?context=5)|Reddit is my homepage. 
[Also, do you like hockey - which I might add is the most kick ass sport there is ;\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lkt5m?context=5)|I enjoy watching live hockey, but I'm not an NHL fan. I'll cover it if I have to. But I don't cover hockey. It's not popular.
[*Thx for the honest AMA though*](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4ll4l0?context=5)|And thanks for the question! This is fun!
[You should move  to Canada then.. eh?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lr5o5?context=5)|No.
[What was on Link to www.wwjnd.com ? It's linked from you Twitter but there is nothing up there, seems to give out ""expired website"" kind of error.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lhlwb?context=5)|WWJND.com was an NFL gossip blog/website that Fox Sports acquired from me as a parter-type venture. I had a one-year contract with them. Within that year I was hired at my current position. I couldn't keep the site because of a COI. So now it's no longer in existence. I should remove that link. Thanks for reminding me :)
[Any interest in motorsports? Being american I would assume NASCAR, Indy etc, do you follow those? How about more European series, like Formula1, WRC?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lhlwb?context=5)|I've grown to love NASCAR. That's all I really cover though.
[Do you think that they hired you because you were a girl or because you are good at what you're doing?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lhd7f?context=5)|I'd like to think that I got hired because I'm good at what I do.
 |I realize that being a female in this industry is going to make me a little more noticeable. But when it all comes down to it: I've had a passion for sports for as long as I could remember. This is my lifelong dream and I'm fulfilling it.
[Hate to break it to you honey but you're not there for your reporting skills.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lisha?context=5)|I'm sorry you feel that way!
[I've read through a bit of questions and noticed you like football. What team do you root for in the NFL?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lhrdt?context=5)|I grew up rooting for the Jets and still deep down inside am a die-hard fan.
 |Please don't hate me.
 |I'd like to think my bias doesn't show. I'm realistic about teams I dislike. For example, my AFCE prediction: I think the Patriots win the division this year by a landslide. Jets in second and squeak in the playoffs with a 9-7 record. Dolphins and Bills with 4-6 wins, 3rd and 4th.
[I would say you are actually optimistic about teams that you dislike.  I assume you dislike my team, the Miami Dolphins, because there is no way we win 4 games this year!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lnlbv?context=5)|Whenever the Dolphins are bad (which they will be this year), they always lose a whole bunch and then win the games they need to lose at the end of the season to obtain the No. 1 draft pick. It's pretty sad....but I don't mind at all!
[Yep, it really pisses me off to know that we could have had Luck or RG3 instead of Tannehill!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lns9j?context=5)|Honestly, I had Tannehill as a 2nd or 3rd round pick before the combine. People forget he was a WR in college and needs a ton of work. He's the type that needs to sit out for a few years and learn. Now..who's to say he can't do that under Matt Moore? Problem is, he won't. The Dolphins drafted him to play immediately. 
[It was a very stupid decision to pick him IMO.  He will probably be no better than Matt Moore and no offense to him but what can he learn from Matt Moore?  While we are at it, what can he learn from David Garrard?  How Ireland hasn't been fired yet is beyond me.  What does the guy know on Stephen Ross?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lnywt?context=5)|I think if the Dolphins start Matt Moore, they'll go 7-9. Ryan Tannehill: 4-12.
[Looks accurate, Matt Moore is definitely our best option at QB for now!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lsmbv?context=5)|For now. But I don't think Tannehill is the answer either. Prediction: Huge bust.
[Do you know the offside rule in soccer?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lhiem?context=5)|Why, yes. Yes I do.
[Have you seen Brett Favre's dick?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lhags?context=5)|On Deadspin. 
[Fair enough. What is your favorite sport to cover? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lhckz?context=5)|Football, without a question. I used to hate NASCAR, but now I've grown to love it after covering the Daytona 500. Love college basketball.
[Which sport has more rowdy fans (*drunk annoying aholes*\) - football or nascar?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lkrj6?context=5)|College football fans. By far.
 |I've only dealt with NASCAR fans on the inner circle of the track. Those are the classy ones. 
[Are male reporters allowed to go in the locker rooms of female athletes? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4li4uv?context=5)|I'm not sure. I don't really cover women's sports. Out of respect, I don't usually go into the locker room. In some instances, I have to because that's the only opportunity I have to get an interview. In that case, I bring a binder or something to cover my eyes. Haha.
[Personally, I have never understood why it was necessary to go into the locker room after a game.  Would you want someone with a camera near you after a shower?  I wouldn't.  I'm surprised leagues and the athletes themselves are OK with this.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4m9nve?context=5)|I'm not a big fan of it, and I try to avoid entering as much as possible. I'll only go in the locker room if it's an absolute must. I've noticed I have to go in the locker room more often when I'm covering the MLB. Some athletes purposely swing their dicks around. It's really immature and annoying.
[Hey there! As an avid sports fan myself I can't help but be happy for you! But to the questions!!!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lxfs9?context=5)|That's awesome! Thanks so much for reading and feel free to follow my work on twitter. 
[What courses did you take to get into sports reporting?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lxfs9?context=5)|I was a journalism major in college, but I never took any specific ""Sports Reporting"" class. I've always been into sports - basically since I could walk - for as long as I could remember. I wanted to be a professional athlete growing up but I realized in high school that I couldn't make a living off of that (being a female) but I could still work in sports if I utilize my talents in other ways. 
[Top 5 PG's in the NBA?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lxfs9?context=5)|The PG position has changed so much over the years in the NBA. Now, the top PGs are technically forwards who play the point position. Point forwards. So I'll give you my top true PGs: Chris Paul, Rajon Rondo, Derrick Rose, Deron Williams, Ricky Rubio (as long as he stays healthy he can change the NBA).
[I hope you take the time to respond to this and even if you don't, thanks for the AMA!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lxfs9?context=5)|Feel free to ask more!
[Awesome! Thanks for the reply. I'm going to transfer and change my major and I thought that since I love sports I might as well pursue it right? So thanks for the info.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lxj39?context=5)|I was thinking Nash, but I'm thinking as far as who will be the top 5 PGs next season. I think Rubio will be on that list.
[Being stuck in the middle of nowhere Montana, I was thinking Missoula. I have a friend that is majoring in Journalism there and she says they're good. But due to my lack of being anywhere it's essentially my best bet.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lxl88?context=5)|Being in a small market can be a good thing. I went to college in Orlando, Fla., so it was a little tougher to break into because that's a top 25 media market. My news organization is based in Melbourne, Fla., a much smaller city but still big enough to get my name out there.
 |Start small, but make a name for yourself where you're at so the people there don't forget you! If you become a reliable reporter about topics people care about, locals will love you. I can't tell you how many times I get thanked by parents for doing a report on local high school playoffs. Local news is important.
[Good to hear! Thanks for all your advice here and for doing this great AMA. I can't wait to get started!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lxokm?context=5)|Best of luck to you with your future endeavors. 
[BtW as an aspiring journalist I did really enjoy reading through your AmA, even if I've missed the party.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lv1aj?context=5)|If you have any questions feel free to ask! I love talking to aspiring journalists and I enjoy guest lecturing at journalism schools. It's my thing, I guess.
[Has the advent of social media prompted reporters to cover different stories (read: gossip\), ones that may have never otherwise been reported?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4li3tn?context=5)|As for social media, yes, I think it does force reporters to cover gossip-type stuff more. I don't mind it. I used to have an NFL gossip blog called WWJND. But a lot of other reporters do.
[Have you ever worked with Erin Andrews/hung out with her at a game? Has she ever given you any good advice? What advice would you give to a college student who is interested in this work?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4ll2fo?context=5)|I've worked at the same game with her a couple of times. She basically ignores all other reporters, male or female. Unless if she works with them.
 |True story: During a basketball game, while the game is going on...EA whips out her makeup bag and starts reapplying lipgloss and bronzer. This is why women in sports aren't taken seriously, Erin. Go do that in the bathroom.
 |Another story: After a basketball game at UF, she goes to take a picture with the Gators Dazzlers dance team. I heard her say: ""I know how it's like to be one of you girls. I used to be a Dazzler too. I know how cool it is to take your pictures with celebrities and stuff.""
 |Now, I hope she was being sarcastic. But I really don't think she was. Like I've said before, I feel like EA is in it for the celebrity. My favorite TV personality is Michelle Beadle.
 |Advice: Get involved at your campus paper or tv station and work your butt off. Always have a copy of your resume on hand.
[I've always expected her to be a nice girl who will talk to the fans, guess not. I can see her being like that with the make up though, I feel like she always wants to look her best but it's dumb to do that in front of everyone. Thanks for the advice though!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lmi59?context=5)|She'll talk to the fans and sign autographs. She's a celebrity. 
[That she is, and she's pretty good at her job. So another question, what's the biggest game you've ever been at for a report (college and professional\) for football and basketball?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lovg4?context=5)|Haven't covered a Super Bowl yet, but I will when it comes to Florida. I've covered the NCAA March Madness tourney. Covered a few collegiate bowl games..Liberty Bowl, St. Pete Bowl, Champs Sports Bowl, Capital One Bowl.
[Being at the Super Bowl for a report would be just mind blowing. Considering you'd get a field pass. Do you usually?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lpglo?context=5)|Yes. But I'm not there the entire game. With football games, I sit in the press box for quarters 1-3. 4th quarter I'm on the field. Reporters can't be on the field the entire game or it would crowd the sidelines. That's why there's only one or two sideline reporters, and they work for the network providing TV coverage (I.e. ESPN, CBS, ABC, NBC).
 |I like being up in the press box. It lets me see the game from the best seat in the house. That way, I know what I'm talking about when I tape a post-game report from the field. 
[Do you notice that a large percentage of the population is not interested in sports? Esp compared to the interest level of 20 years ago. For example,  what percent of the population know who the best batter or pitcher is in the major leagues? Accepting the premise, why the lack of interest in sports today? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4li8d2?context=5)|I don't really see that at all, to be honest. Just because baseball isn't the No. 1 sport any more doesn't mean people aren't interested in sports. It just means that people are interested in different sports, like the NFL and the NBA.
[Are you in any fantasy football leagues, and does being a reporter give you a really good ability to predict wins/losses?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4llk16?context=5)|Thanks! I love AMA's on reddit, and I was really bored and awake at 6 a.m. for some reason. I noticed no one in my profession had done an AMA, so I went ahead and did it.
[Because of inside info or general sports expertise, like a meteorologist predicting weather?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4llk16?context=5)|I usually keep about 3 fantasy football teams per year. I think being a reporter helps because you're really informed. But I don't think we have an edge because of inside information. Unless if your name is Adam Schefter.
[Also, do you like the tv show ""The League""?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4llk16?context=5)|I don't really get to watch a lot of TV. So no. My friends who watch it tell me that I'll love it. So I'll have to check it out to see if it's on Netflix or something.

[I have a tendency to be annoyed by the voice of a female sports reporter. I searched up some of your work and you actually sound like you know what you're talking about. Question is, would you ever like to be a commentator for say, ESPN?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lio28?context=5)|Wow, thank you so much. That really means a lot.
 |I'd love to work for ESPN, or any other major sporting news outlet. But I don't want to be Erin Andrews. I'm not in this for the fame. I want to make a living doing what I love.
[Former aspiring female sports journalist here. Why the hate for Erin Andrews? She may be completely gorgeous, but she's also a graduate of one of the best journalism schools in the country (also my alma mater\), and she damned sure knows her sports and has an amazing on-air personality. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lmjae?context=5)|I agree that UF has an amazing journalism school. I actually got to check it out a few months ago at a regional SPJ conference. Beautiful, brand-new facilities.
 |I used to idolize Erin Andrews until I found out who she really is. I know she knows her sports and is good on-camera. No hate on her for that. But I feel like she's changed over the years. She's transformed into a celebrity. She has endorsement deals. She was on Dancing with the Stars. It's crazy. I feel like she's in it for the celebrity. It's hard to take her seriously.
 |Also...why former?
[Do you ever cover the NHL?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4liu1j?context=5)|I don't. Different world down here in Florida. Not a lot of NHL popularity. Down here it's football, then college football, then NASCAR with some college basketball, NBA and MLB sprinkled in. 
[Is wearing low cut shirts a must for TV personalities? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lhuur?context=5)|Haha, no. It does seem that way, though.
[Just curious, what's it like to be in the media department? Well for sports anyway. Enjoy your job?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lhkt3?context=5)|I love my job. It's interesting to get to view sports from an insider's perspective. There's a lot that goes on. The best moments at my job are not moments that come from games. It's the stuff behind the scenes.
 |Like when George O'Leary drove me to my car in his sweet golf cart after interviewing him. I'm pretty sure he was drunk. Best. Thing. Ever.
[How was he?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lho7d?context=5)|A lot of people try to paint GOL as a bad guy. I don't think that at all. He means well. He's old school. I almost feel bad for him.
[With all of the concussion-related deaths of former NFL players, how long do you see the league lasting?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4li94g?context=5)|Forever. But I think the NFL will have to pay up in a lawsuit. 
[Bless you.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lhpuc?context=5)|Silly. I know what you were trying to ask.
[Do you see yourself doing what you do now for the rest of your life or do you have different aspirations than reporting?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lhpvw?context=5)|I wish I could do this forever. However, how many female sports reporters do you see over the age of 50? Not many. I just want to make a living doing what I love. That's what I do now. It would be nice to deliver sports news to the largest audience possible. That's the goal. I know that TV reporting is short-lived, though. I may go into teaching when I'm older. Would love to teach journalism.
[Suzy Kolber!  Little stretch though, she's 47.  Maybe Joe Namath will try to kiss you too?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4m9ltt?context=5)|If Joe Namath tried to kiss me. I'd drop the mic and run off.
 |With Joe Namath.
[Do you do your broadcasts while the food is cooking? I guess I don't understand... Maybe while you're cooking food you could do like a sports show/cooking show. Not really sure who would want to watch that though.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4ll6to?context=5)|AHHHHH HE MADE A FUNNY!!!! Surprised it took this long for a kitchen joke.
[How many times a day do you hear from a player, ""we're going to take it one game at a time?"" or any variation of this stock answer?  Unless something wild and unexpected happens, I imagine reporting sports would get very dull after the thrill of meeting celebrities wears off.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lk2q5?context=5)|I hear it a lot. But it's on the reporter to craft a question in a way to force the subject to answer as creatively as possible. I always ask two-part questions and ask them to elaborate. I might piss off some people, but I have to do my job too.
[You've said you don't really cover women's sports, but that you were very much into playing sports growing up. Who would be your ""top 3"" wish list of women in sport that you'd interview if you could (regardless of whether they're alive now\)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lhs9l?context=5)|That's a really good question. Abby Wambach, Kerri Strug and Mia Hamm.
 |I interviewed Danica. She was pretty dry. Michelle Akers was awesome. 
[Also: dog person, cat person, or other?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lhwmh?context=5)|Dog person. Why is this such a big deal on here?
[Did you do any print stuff, or are you only on tv?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lhgjm?context=5)|I used to do print stuff. But right now, I'm mainly web and TV. Sometimes my columns will run in print. But I'd say 80% web and TV.
[Ever talked with/interviewed Mark Martin? When I followed NASCAR, he was always my favorite driver.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4li8hd?context=5)|Mark Martin is a cool guy. Never ages, I feel like. Always very friendly to reporters. He's a veteran.
[Oh and any good stories about any Lakers (past or present\)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lhhj7?context=5)|Nothing too crazy, because I don't really cover them. Saw Metta World Peace when he was Ron Artest at a night club in downtown Orlando after they played the Magic. It was him, his posse, and a bunch of groupies all up in the VIP. Typical NBA.
[Who is your favorite reporter to read/watch/listen to?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lhhf5?context=5)|Well, my favorite writer/reporter is Jane McManus of ESPN. She's a mentor of mine and she does some great work.
 |My favorite TV personality is Michelle Beadle. Love how she's the anti-Erin Andrews. And she's not afraid to hide it.
[Also, go 'Canes. ;\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lic9i?context=5)|Awwwww come on!
[Do you cover the Magic? What's your take on the Van Gundy/Howard situation? I'm pretty sure Stan is gone, but I think they should trade Howard as well.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lhj4f?context=5)|I do. I think Howard is driving Van Gundy out of Orlando and will use that as leverage to try and stay to get a huge deal. He won't stay though, because Dwight is a psycho selfish douche. Did you see this press conference? [Link to www.youtube.com](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y08gvGpGCwA)
 |Translation: The Magic are screwed. No Van Gundy next year. No Dwight after that. It's a shitty situation. It's sad that the Amway is going to become a big, fancy paperweight downtown. Ryan Anderson is going to be the Magic's biggest name after Dwight leaves.
[Were you at that press conference?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4ljcz5?context=5)|I wish I was, but no.
[Favourite soccer team?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lk5cr?context=5)|Grew up watching Juve. Still do. I'm glad they're doing well this year. 
[Ever cover tiger woods? (or did he cover you?\) j/k..  Seriously tho, golf, do you get to cover it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4ljgn0?context=5)|I have covered golf (and Tiger Woods). First time I met him was at Bay Hill...his first year back from the crazy scandal that happened. He was very polite and cordial to all of the reporters. Supposedly he treats media differently now. I heard he used to be a jerk.
[What did you major in? Did you do any internships beforehand? Do you report all sports?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4litps?context=5)|I majored in journalism. I was an intern for Scout.com / Fox sports and worked for my campus newspaper. All that good stuff.
 |Most sports. I report what's popular in my market. NHL, for example, is not popular so I don't really do anything with hockey.
[That's nice, I'm really interested in pursuing the same field. How does the communications degree differ with the journalism degree in this field?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4ln1kc?context=5)|I'm a little biased, but I think journalism majors are more well-rounded because we can write and report stories. Communications majors know how to read off a teleprompter. 
[That's a nice factor for me to look into, thanks! Do you think a major in one of them and a minor in the other is a good idea or not necessary?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4ln4c9?context=5)|It's not really necessary, and usually they're in the same ""college"" so all of the pre-req courses are the same. 
[You mentioned that you've interviewed Tiger Woods.  What other golfers have you interviewed, and what were they like?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4m9r6q?context=5)|Got to talk to Arnold Palmer at Bay Hill. What a sweet, old man. I just wanted to hug him. Dustin Johnson was pretty cool. Those were the only other guys who I've gotten to do a one-on-one with. Everyone else I've interviewed, including Tiger, was in a group-type setting. No one really came off as a jerk.
[Also, what is your handicap?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4m9r6q?context=5)|As for me...I normally shoot anywhere from a 90-95 from the whites. I refuse to play from the red ladies' tees. Best round ever was an 88 at TPC Sawgrass. 
[If you could get a less than appropriate ""pic"" \[insert favre joke here\] sent to you from anyone in the sports world who would it be and why?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lkbfp?context=5)|Not to sound lame or anything, but no one. I don't get my jollies from that. Unless if it's Tim Tebow. Then I know that'll be a huge story.
 |AMIRITE?
[Do you play any sports/have a competitive background?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lhdry?context=5)|I played softball and basketball in high school. Was going to play softball in college. I blew out my ankle my senior year, and that was that.
[What's your opinion on soccer in general? MLS, EPL, whatever. Do you think it'll ever get the respect it's fans(me included\) think it deserves in America?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lj2i2?context=5)|I would hope so, but it would take some time. ESPN and all the other major sporting networks need to do a better job showing more games. The World Cup catches on. Why can't pro soccer in general?
[Do reporters sleep with athletes? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lnkph?context=5)|I don't know any. Such a funny, common assumption.

But now it is really starting to get in the way of my learning, and I hate it because what I am studying is something that I am really passionate about. I want to learn as much as I can, to exchange interesting idea, and work on exciting projects, but SA is making it so difficult.

I don't talk to anyone in my classes. In the two years of university, I've been to a professors office hours once, and only after spending an hour 'getting ready' to do it. If I have a question, I just either figure it out on my own or ignore it. None of my professors know me, so it was impossible to get letters of recommendations for the summer research projects I was applying for.

I've tried getting involved in clubs, but after the first general meeting when there a few dozen people that I can hide behind, I can't get the courage to show up. My email inbox just ends up being filled with information about clubs that I've only been to one meeting for.

I even tried going to my school's career fair to get a summer internship, but I ended up awkwardly avoiding all but a couple potential  employers.

I finally forced myself to email a professor about working in his lab over the summer, and I am meeting with him tomorrow. I am fucking terrified, and I don't even know why.

Anyways, that's my rant for the day."

Ever since last February when we had that AWESOME tech-connect put on my the wonderful women in Career Services, I've been submitting resumes and e-mails, making phone calls, and visiting in person local engineering firms hoping to garner favor with the Gods of job-placement and score an internship or co-op. No such luck!

Does anybody here have the hookup with any companies that can afford another intern this summer? It can't help to ask.

I've only interviewed at Gulf Power, and unfortunately for me they decided on another candidate. Oh well.

Hey, on the assumption that at least somebody else in here has been having the same difficulty as me - tell us your story, too. How hard have you tried? Misery loves company.

I'm off to go sabotage the WUWF radio towers until their engineer begs the station to let him have an intern. BRB.

I'm starting a new internship next Monday with a company I've worked with before, and they're starting a new dress code where every day is jean day. However, I don't really have ""nice"" jeans - the only pair I routinely wear have those fake worn spots that I don't think are appropriate for the work environment.

Does anyone live in the south/Georgia/Atlanta area and know where I can get nice, skinny (Express jeans are the only ones I've found to fit me so far, department store brands just won't cut it, I'm around a 28 waist/32 length/bootcut) jeans that would work in a professional environment?

Second question that I just thought of - what kind of shoes do you wear with jeans at work? I've been accustomed to dress shoes with dress slacks forever, but I think Converse are a bit too casual for work, even if it is jean day.

Thanks in advance for all the help! :)

Edit: Forgot budget - I'm looking for under $100 if at all possible, a good balance between value and style would be preferred. Definitely not el-cheapo Walmart-brand jeans, but also not $200 brand-name jeans. Keep in mind that I don't shop often and I'm not very brand-aware though, so I may be a bit flustered/overwhelmed if you start throwing out brand/store names. Please bear with me! :)"

I am working on setting up the Chipin account as well.

Hello Reddit,

I am a veteran and currently unemployed along with my roommate (a vet I served with in Iraq). We have been able to make ends meet but since being out the Army it has been difficult for us dealing with PTSD on top of school and other stressors of everyday life. We have two dogs, both are German Shepherds. The older boy who is mine, named Stanley is ~9 months old and 70 lbs while Stella is his and is~7 months and 40 lbs.

Anyways, me and my roommate were cleaning our garage yesterday when we heard yelping and ran to Stella and saw her paw was completely floppy and we freaked out. I never felt so helpless because I knew we couldn't take her to emergency (did that once... $1500 for an overnight stay for a fever. My mom helped out on that.) because we don't have the funds. So we call around to the different Vet offices and decide to go the Vet Teaching Hospital where I live near.

So we go there and it turns out to be a 7 hour hospital visit. At first we were only talking to non-specialist Veterinarians who were ""ok"" with casting. I kept asking questions however and she went and got the orthopedic surgeon and he laid out our options. He said because the break is of small bones that a cast would be a far second to surgery because the success of those small bones setting back in place was a &lt;30% chance of success based on his experiences. This could lead to a gnarled paw and then we'd have to amputate since she would develop terrible life long arthritis. He said we could go with amputation since dogs do quite well on 3 legs according to them (this wouldn't set us back all the costs of casting.) So, eventually one of the interns mentions this grant program to do 80 hours of animal oriented community service in order to get $1100 dollars. Since I was there with my roommate and we both care a lot about our dogs they allowed both of us to get the grant giving us $2200 towards medical care. This wasn't policy but because we are both Veterans they gave it to us. This was wonderful news because it made Surgery an actual viable option (and in my mind the only option I'd want for her, we both said we'd rather give her up then do the lowest cost form of treatment).

So her initial Surgery (tomorrow) will put metal coils over the bones in order to keep them in line so they don't heal together in what the Dr. called a ""malunion"" but rather straight. He said because she is young it's a double edged sword since she will heal fast but if the bones heal wrong then obviously that's not good but if in place then a very high success rate. The Surgery estimates are $3200 low and $3500 high. Like I said we already have $2200 (for the x2 80 hours of community service due by September).

I hate asking for handouts, but I am struggling to take care of myself and although I understand what a burden taking care of Animals can be but they also make me and my roommate laugh and smile when sometimes we can't find one positive thing to smile about. It is what it is. We both love our dogs and I know he would do this for me in order to help my dog Stanley.

We have to pay in full by Friday but I should be able to open a line of credit to pay 6 months no interest... and then 27% interest rate. I am asking for donations from anyone that wants to help. I will work on scanning the estimates (for you to see) and uploading pictures of Stella and Stanley. If you are located in the Northern Colorado area and you own or work with anything that has do to with Animals (pets/livestock/wildlife) and need some free help please send me a message/post since I want to knock these hours out as quick as possible. The grant program is still in a trial run and I want to make sure I fulfill all my obligations to keep this program running for others who ever happen to fall in a situation like this. I will work on setting up a paypal account as well.

TL;DR: My big dog broke my battle buddy from Iraq's little dog paw with multiple fractures. The surgery to fix this costs $3200-3500. We have $2200 on credit right for an animal oriented community service grant. Also, if you work with Animals and need free help from two able bodied 20 somethings please let me know so I may fulfill my community service obligations.

If you think this is a fraud then I please ask to refrain from posting, however I will answer any and all questions within the context of the thread so please ask away. The more people that see this thread the better.

tgooy,4,2012-05-10,Just need some advice please! :),smalltowngirl09,TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/tgooy/just_need_some_advice_please/,"Alrighty ladies, I need your advice! I am currently a junior studying mechanical engineering and was lucky enough to get my dream internship this summer! The only thing I am worried about is that it is in a big city (I have lived in a very small town my whole life) and I am the only female out of 10 interns. I guess I am just worried about two things- one that I am too naive for my own good so what precautions should I take while living in a big city that I wouldn't have to worry about in small town living? Also, how can I make sure my coworkers take me seriously from day one? Thank you so much ladies!!"
tglaw,8,2012-05-10,My story so far - a year in London,redshirt3,bisexual,https://www.reddit.com/r/bisexual/comments/tglaw/my_story_so_far_a_year_in_london/,"Hi. 21 year old guy etc.

This may be a long one, so sorry. But it may help those who are new in discovering or exploring their bisexuality. Im open to questions aswell.

So ive been with women during college and first couple of years at university and loved it, i was a late bloomer anyway so that actually made it even more exciting. But starting from about 14/15 I had blips on my radar that i might like guys aswell but could never commit to it or work up the balls to try it out.

But starting in october last year I moved to London to do a year long internship as part of uni and thought id use the fresh start to explore seeing guys with the option of keeping it secret if i needed. I've said to myself that im going to use the time here to go for guys over girls, as i am very comfortable with my 'straight side' and can work on that anytime.

Just before I moved i started talking with this guy on OkCupid, he was cute but kinda a shy type like myself. I would take regular trips on the train (didnt live IN london just studied there) we would hang out and talk for hours in random places. It was around 3 weeks in that I worked up the balls to kiss him, and it was a strange experiance - my heart was thumping so loud and I was shaking and my brain was telling me this was a weird thing to be doing, simply because 21 years of habbit is hard to break not because I had doubts etc. Skipping to a couple weeks later, we rented a hotel room in this town work had sent me too for the week and basicly this is when I had my first same sex experiance.

It felt right and I wasnt uncomfortable at all, although when he got his **** out and i had to interact with that for the first time it was abit of a mindfuck, perhaps like driving a car for the first time, or trying to work a friends shower (lol). The next day I felt both relieved and also saw a boost to my ego. I had pushed through the barrier and was a new person for it. Skipping ahead alot later now, it was after this that me and my friend agreed that we didnt quite match up for a relationship but could be friends.

By this time I was flying up to scotland during the working week then back to LDN for friday nights and weekends. This limited my spare time to just friday or saturday nights really, so I once again turned back to OkCupid. I started talking to this hot &amp; interesting guy - filipino, attrctive, fun, freelancer and open minded. This was on the monday and by the weekend we already planned to meet (we'l call him 'J' for now). We talked for hours, had cocktails, went to bars etc. He revealed that he had an 'open' relationship with someone currently in the states which confused me a little, but all the same he came back with me and that first evening was amazing and I had no trouble doing things I was still cautios about etc.

For around the next couple of months he would normally spend an evening or two a week at mine and we would have sex and talk, and start to go out for meals etc but not in a commited way. But I started to develop feelings and get quite attached. This was a silly thing for me to do and advise others to not do as it began several months of hardship for me.

The so far distant boyfriend came to the UK for a week on his way through Europe and wanted to meet me as they were going to break up. I agreed as for a small while there was, perhaps, a glimmer of hope this could clear the path for me to maybe date 'J' in the future. The three of us were sat in this pub, and it was kinda weird. The bf was asking me questions about me and why I liked 'J' and how did i feel about the situation etc and I wasnt sure what to say.

After a strange series of events they came back with me to my place, I think they thought I was after a sort of threesome but I wasnt, but rolling with the dice had been the theme of my year so far, so I went with it, and we were in my bed. At one point I was making out with 'J' while the other guy jerked him off. But I got uncomfortable and asked for everything to stop, I think it was out of jealousy seeing them together. We all ended up talking for a few hours, mostly this other guy saying I wasnt good enough and even started comparing myself to him and using this as some sort of template for all my inadequacies. It was really a fucked up situation to be in.

After they broke up 'J' went through a period of emotional uncertainty and decided to focus more on his work. I hardly ever saw him and he was basicly ignoring me. I would spend most days feeling shitty and upset, like what most people would experiance after a break up, which shows how silly I was to get so attached. 
I did at one point meet up with another guy, cute, kinda a nerd, nice accent, we went out, accidently met up with a bunch of my friends from home who i then came out to (being caught in soho with a guy didnt leave me much choice) and that night we had sex. This gave me an additional piece of experiance as we was only my third guy and it was great. He's since moved back to his home country.

Sometime in March I saw 'J' a little bit more, for a very brief patch things went back to normal, but the gap had started to widen and he wanted to be with someone more connected to his work and routine which is fine, I have mainly gotten over him now and would like us to be normal friends as he's an amazing person and was a big part of my bi development. If he can work with that idea remains to be seen but I honestly hope so.

I have since been with a couple more guys and am currently looking forward with a once again (relatively) clean slate. In what is really a short space of time I have gone from a nervous and clueless guy to someone at ease with my sexuality. And how my attitude to the sex has changed has been really great, a few years back I could never picture being with anyone other than women but now have even adapted to enjoy being with guys. 

Im starting to talk with and ask out both men and women now and consider my story a successful one, even if there were bumps along the road. Sorry for the length but I hope this will be a guide to someone out there. Thanks"

[Do you believe in god? If you do, is it because of your parents teachings or did you come to worship him on your own terms? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tf0hx/iama_son_of_two_megachurch_pastors_ama/c4m1ont?context=5)|When I did believe in God, it was 100% because of the environment I was raised in. As soon as I began to question beliefs, it was a slow movement away from that.
 |In my opinion, you cannot arrive logically at the conclusion that there is a God. Those who ""know"" there is a God are either indoctrinated, or have received a personal revelation from him. Of course you can simply ""choose"" to believe in God if you wish, but that's pretty meaningless for various reasons, the primary one being that Christianity requires some pretty radical stuff from you, which you wont be capable of unless you are either really good at deceiving yourself, or actually know there is a God. That's why so many Christians are fake. I have seen a few real Christians, but cannot tell if they are actually sure of a God or simply masters at deceiving themselves.
[Thanks for the AMA.  What are your thoughts about proselytizing?  I come from a so-called third world country, and frankly, the idea of missionaries coming into my country and uprooting tradition that has existed for thousands of years (yes, before the bible, and yes, not to be combative, even older than 6000 years\) is ... well, disgusting.  What is your stance on this?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tf0hx/iama_son_of_two_megachurch_pastors_ama/c4m969d?context=5)|Well Jesus gave his disciples the ""great commission"" where he basically commands everyone to convert everyone else. So as a Christian, there's no way to escape from this (except for those who believes that all the saved people have been pre-selected by God and there is nothing we can do about it).  Also, I do know that many people who are evangelized do not share your opinion. My dad is very involved in Africa, mostly the Congo (he goes there every summer). And he has assisted in training pastors and stuff there, and the growth has been absolutely *explosive* in the Congo. They are grateful on a level you wouldn't believe. Generally, evangelized people in third world countries tend to be more open to Christianity and tend to be more legitimate practitioners of Christianity (IE, there are less fake people) than in the US or other first world countries.
[Why can't more Christians follow the ""live and let live"" policy?  Are they really so worried about my soul?  I'm not sure I understand the rationale behind why saving other people is so important.  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tf0hx/iama_son_of_two_megachurch_pastors_ama/c4m969d?context=5)|I think genuine Christians do it more because Jesus commanded them too, but I'm sure some actually do have legitimate concern for you.
[Have you taken a look at deism?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tf0hx/iama_son_of_two_megachurch_pastors_ama/c4m5w00?context=5)|Briefly, but to me it's a little irrelevant. I'm looking for an end-all purpose in life, not so much a curiosity in how the world came to be.
 |If there is a God, I'll do whatever the hell he says. If not, I'm just going to have as much enjoyment as I can without regard to much else. If there is a God who doesn't care, then I'm still gonna do the latter.
[*Without an absolute being dictating morality, morality is whatever we, as a society, choose it to be.*](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tf0hx/iama_son_of_two_megachurch_pastors_ama/c4m8t2l?context=5)|I'm familiar with Cultural Relativism, and I have read Rachels and am familiar with him as well.
[FWIW, you don't need God to arrive at an absolute morality. What you are arguing is for cultural relativism, and there are philosophical arguments against it. You should check Rachels' ""The Challenge of Cultural Relativism.""](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tf0hx/iama_son_of_two_megachurch_pastors_ama/c4m8t2l?context=5)|Please note however, a successful argument against cultural relativism is not equivalent to a successful argument FOR absolute morality. There are other forms of relativism as well.
[I. Different cultures have different, often contradictory morals. II. Therefore we cannot establish an absolute moral code because morality is relevant.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tf0hx/iama_son_of_two_megachurch_pastors_ama/c4m8t2l?context=5)|Furthermore, cultural relativism isn't an ethical theory at all.
[ of all, (II\) does not necessarily logically follow from (I\). Some could have gotten it wrong.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tf0hx/iama_son_of_two_megachurch_pastors_ama/c4m8t2l?context=5)|Cultural relativism states morality is relative to cultures. True. Fact. Ethical relativism states morality SHOULD be relative to cultures. Debatable.
[ finally, CR is unpalatable, because if we accept it, we have no basis to judge any culture's moral code, including those from our own history. Thus we cannot say that we as a society have improved by ending slavery, etc.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tf0hx/iama_son_of_two_megachurch_pastors_ama/c4m8t2l?context=5)|All in all though, that's still irrelevant largely to the subject of absolute morality.
[Thanks for pointing out that distinction, although Rachels himself conflates those two terms.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tf0hx/iama_son_of_two_megachurch_pastors_ama/c4m9b67?context=5)|Not a fan of utilitarianism (although the concept is interesting), but Kantian ethics is pretty awesome. The main idea that Kant brings up is very golden-rule-esque, stating that we ought to act in a way whereby that action became a universal law. So it's still very much dependent on a personal basis, I think. I'm only knowledgeable about philosophy at a general level though, so you may be right.
[Aside from that, there are still ethical systems in philosophy that strive for an absolute morality, such as utilitarianism and Kantian ethics. All without recourse to a man in the sky telling you what to do!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tf0hx/iama_son_of_two_megachurch_pastors_ama/c4m9b67?context=5)|I'm not sure if there was a cut and dry moment. I think I've always had some amount of doubt that I recognized, but I slowly moved towards a progression of realizing all my evidence and reasoning for God was based on what other people told me, and as soon as I realized that, I immediately knew that wasn't acceptable. I still believed God existed, just thought I would have to backtrack and discover him myself. After all - thousands of friends I knew and trusted had come to that conclusion.
[Unrelated, but what would you say was the first instance that made you doubt the existence of God?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tf0hx/iama_son_of_two_megachurch_pastors_ama/c4m9b67?context=5)|Then after several years I realized I was as intelligent, if not more intelligent, than most, and that I wasn't coming up with any evidence for God, therefore these other people were either having a personal encounter I had missed, or they were deluding themselves.
[Do they believe blasphemy against God can be forgiven?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tf0hx/iama_son_of_two_megachurch_pastors_ama/c4m1pdw?context=5)|Well the bible says it is the unforgivable sin. So no. However, I think defining blasphemy is the tricky part. The general idea is God's forgiveness is unlimited. If you truly, really blaspheme God (with your heart, not necessarily just words) there is no hope for you, not so much because God can't forgive you, but because you would never truly ask forgiveness.
 |So if you blasphemed God, then asked for forgiveness (truly wanted forgiveness, not just saying it) then you didn't REALLY blaspheme God.
 |Edit: Someone who would fall under the category of a blasphemer would be a lifelong atheist. If God is real, he would deny them heaven because they chose to deny his existence. 
[I've been an atheist ever since I was a kid. Isn't it unfair that I would be punished forever if god was real, despite there being no real reason for me to believe in Christianity?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tf0hx/iama_son_of_two_megachurch_pastors_ama/c4m91wn?context=5)|Not really. If God is real, and he's the God Christianity tells us about, then you made a conscious life choice to disregard him. If I were God, I would have no interest in letting you chill in my kingdom for eternity after that.
[*If God is real, he would deny them heaven because they chose to deny his existence.*](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tf0hx/iama_son_of_two_megachurch_pastors_ama/c4m8yc9?context=5)|If he's all-powerful and all-knowing, he can be as petty or vain as he wants...and it's your job to do whatever he says regardless. Also if God is real, it's furthermore very unlikely that you (or anyone) has the capacity to accurately describe him, so it would be likely that your analysis of God being vain and petty would be wrong.
[If there's any doubt that god is man-made, this sort of idea proves it.  I find it funny that an all powerful, all knowing god would be that vain and petty.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tf0hx/iama_son_of_two_megachurch_pastors_ama/c4m8yc9?context=5)|Obviously the key question here is just whether or not he is real, and whether or not the bible is his word.
[This god person you speak of hasn't even risen above petty jealousy or vanity?  There's everyday people who can get over something like that, but yet your god can't?  Doesn't sound like a god worth worshipping to me.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tf0hx/iama_son_of_two_megachurch_pastors_ama/c4m9apv?context=5)|Again, regardless of if it's vain and petty, if he is God, you worship him regardless. Rebelling against the creator of the universe - not a good plan. So the question is still, is there a God, not is he worth worshipping.
 |And again, if there was a God, I would say that you probably just misinterpreted his qualities. I wouldn't know for sure, but he probably doesn't have any bad qualities, but it would, theoretically, be easy for you to make a mistake in determine what qualities God has because he is so complex it may exceed your capabilities of discernment.
[*. I wouldn't know for sure, but he probably doesn't have any bad qualities.*](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tf0hx/iama_son_of_two_megachurch_pastors_ama/c4m9z1z?context=5)|First of all, I don't have a God. Secondly, I would say that God probably doesn't have those qualities, but I wouldn't know.
[Uhh..  So you're saying that jealousy and pettiness aren't bad qualities, or that your god doesn't have these qualities?  I mean, you just compared god to yourself.  That sounds like you trying to discern your god.  *but it would, theoretically, be easy for you to make a mistake in determine what qualities God has because he is so complex it may exceed your capabilities of discernment.*  If this god is so complex we can't discern his qualities, then how are we to discern his wishes?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tf0hx/iama_son_of_two_megachurch_pastors_ama/c4m9z1z?context=5)|You wouldn't be able to discern his qualities except for what he chose to tell you. I suppose Christians believe the bible is the primary source of revelation of his wishes and qualities. If God is real though, it would likely be erroneous to attempt to extrapolate from that information his qualities. It's unlikely, I would guess, that a human would have the logical capabilities to discern that information about a God.
[How does your father justify making an income in the high six figure range?  *Edit* I'm an athiest but one of my favourite people is an elderly Patrician Brother. He's a great man, very well educated, very questioning of his own faith. He takes his vow of poverty very seriously.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tf0hx/iama_son_of_two_megachurch_pastors_ama/c4m3ii1?context=5)|I misspoke. He makes somewhere in the range of $200k if you include benefits. I'm not sure how he justifies it, but we don't live extravagantly. We live at a moderate middle class level. He does tithe/give to missions like 40% of his income though, and then taxes of course. My parents have always been financially responsible with purchases, savings, and investments. They believe their success is a blessing for their service and continue to give to God as they think they should.
[*They believe their success is a blessing for their service and continue to give to God as they think they should.*](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tf0hx/iama_son_of_two_megachurch_pastors_ama/c4mc1q0?context=5)|No, I do not think they believe in the prosperity gospel. That states that the motivation for doing things is based in God's blessing. I think they see God's blessing as an extra rather than a motivation. For example, as I stated it wasn't until my dad was like 45-50 that he actually started making a salary that could be considered wealthy.  I haven't talked with him specifically, but he would agree with the bible's perspective on it. I'm certain that's one of their motivations. They likely believe that they are living without being ""rich"" by giving away most of their money. Of course ""rich"" is completely relative.  Probably most goes to helping people. The majority of our money goes towards building buildings and increasing our size/capability/personnel. We give a lot towards outside missionaries, but like I mentioned in another question, a common idea is that you need to meet people's physical needs before you can tell them about Jesus. They would not believe in ignoring physical needs and focusing on evangelism.
[What are your religious beliefs?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tf0hx/iama_son_of_two_megachurch_pastors_ama/c4m1nkf?context=5)|They definitely believe in hell. There is a little bit of complication with regards to who goes there though. I think the general consensus is that children who haven't reached ""the age of accountability"" go to heaven if they die. They also believe that God is self apparent to everyone, therefore even tribes, for example, who have never been evangelized or taught traditional Christian doctrine can still go to heaven.
 |Really though, I don't think heaven/hell is one of their big motivations. The idea is that it's all about a relationship with Christ, and heaven is the presence of Christ and he'll is the abscence of him.
 |As for my religious beliefs: these days I'm just not sure. I deny Christianity as it is wrong to claim something you don't have. I don't have what other claim to have. I am still trying to figure stuff out, but I seem to be drifting towards atheism or agnosticism. I have met people who genuinely seem to have a relationship in some way with God, but I can't tell if they are deluding themselves or not. Either way, I'm currently on an intellectual journey to find what my beliefs are. I think short from a personal revelation from God, I'm headed towards atheism/agnosticism.
[I have been there :\)  While neither of my parents were pastors, they were both extremely active in the church.  Being the oldest of four children, it was my job to ""set the example.""  When I openly admitted I wasn't sure I believed, or rather, didn't believe the whole church and my dad disowned me.  Only my mom stuck by me.  Do your parents know?  How did they respond?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tf0hx/iama_son_of_two_megachurch_pastors_ama/c4m4xjn?context=5)|Wow that's horrible. I'm the youngest of three. Both my brothers are in their mid to late 20's and are solid Christians, which has been tough for me because they are both very real people, and I'm not sure why I came to a different conclusion than they did.
 |Also, it sounds like your dad and the church aren't reading the same bible I read. Prodigal son anyone? Christianity is based upon continually offering forgiveness to those willing to accept it. Even if you are wrong, your dad and your church will have something to answer for some day, if God is real. However, don't let them affect you either way. If you're motivated to search for God, do so. If God is real, it is not a valid excuse for you to say ""well my dad misrepresented you.""
 |As I answered in another question, my parents probably know because I tell everyone, but I've never talked to them about it directly. They try to manipulate me still into going to church and whatnot. I think they aren't very concerned because it's my first year of college, away from home, etc. They had similar experiences with my other brothers and likely expect that it's a phase. So I'm not sure how it'll affect our relationship long-term, but I don't really like my parents anyway so I'm not worried.
[Are you homophobic or in any way hating towards LBGT people?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tf0hx/iama_son_of_two_megachurch_pastors_ama/c4m5pkk?context=5)|By your standards, probably.
 |I think I have the right to dislike people if I wish. I generally find that I don't like to be around people who are clearly homosexual, because I don't really enjoy the stereotypical personality, and it makes me uncomfortable. I'm sure there are plenty of people who are homosexual but you can't really tell - and that doesn't bother me so much.
 |But on that point, I generally don't like the vast majority of people I meet. I'm kinda picky like that. But I'm not a douchebag about it, I just only choose to be friends with the people who really stand out as awesome to me. I think that's completely fair. I'm allowed to be discriminatory in my friendships, if I choose to be, without being racist/homophobic/what have you.
 |Hating? Absolutely not. I think from a standpoint of Christianity it's probably a sin, but even then it's no different from lying or stealing, or what have you.
 |I don't really support gay marriage, if I was forced to pick a side (I don't really care) because I think that religion created marriage (IE Abraham back in the day). I think the government should stop recognizing marriage. Everyone should get civil unions, and then the religious folk can get married on top of that by their own standards if they want.
 |As it is right now, if you deny marriage to homosexuals, it infringes upon their rights. If you allow marriage to homosexuals, it defiles that which is sacred to religious folk. Easiest way is to just call it something different (like civil unions) for everyone under the law. Then have marriage by religion in addition, which isn't recognized under the law.
[*because I think that religion created marriage (IE Abraham back in the day\)*](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tf0hx/iama_son_of_two_megachurch_pastors_ama/c4m91sv?context=5)|I was under the impression the first recordings of marriage came from the Israelites. I'm not too knowledgeable on the topic though, so I can't say much.
[My friend in NC lost all of his rights last night. He's not gay, he's pansexual. The law in NC doesn't just affect homosexuals, it affects anyone who's not in a straight marriage. Do you know what it's like for someones lover to be sick, maybe dying in hospital, and they're not even allowed to see their sick or dying lover? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tf0hx/iama_son_of_two_megachurch_pastors_ama/c4m6108?context=5)|No, I wouldn't know. Also, not cool to downvote me for my opinion. It's just my opinion, I'm not even claiming that I'm right.
 |I think the issue, as I said, is that either legalizing non-straight marriage, or not legalizing it both leaves one group of people with infringed rights. Therefore, the reason the NC vote went as it did, is you simply had more religious folk than non-religious folk.
 |I still think my solution is the best idea. Stop recognizing religious marriages under the law. Only marriages recognized under law are civil unions, then if you want to get married so that your church recognizes it, you can do that if you follow their guidelines. Then everyone is happy.
[But this already happens anyway. Anytime, for example, a heterosexual Indian couple has a marriage according to their particular customs, that is already not by the Christian book. Yet the government recognizes it, and I haven't heard any Christians raising a ruckus about it.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tf0hx/iama_son_of_two_megachurch_pastors_ama/c4m9dmu?context=5)|I think the difference is, there is nothing they can do about that, whereas there is something they can do about this. I don't think people are so vehemently *opposed* to gay marriage, just not willing to *support* it. So ""not willing to vote yes"" gets construed as hate or discrimination, when really they just don't feel strongly enough to support it.
 |I think if gay marriage was legalized right now, it wouldn't be a big deal, because there is no way you are getting that changed. It's just the fact that Christians can actually do something about it that is causing the slow change. It's more a ""dragging their feet"" effect than a vehement opposition, in my opinion.
[I never downvoted you, dude... ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tf0hx/iama_son_of_two_megachurch_pastors_ama/c4m67vg?context=5)|Yeah, I didn't mean to address that to you specifically. My bad. Anyway, I hope that our nation finds a way to fix this issue without hurting anybody. Sounds like your friend is getting screwed and that's too bad.
[Of course your can't.  You are 19, you aren't expected to know all the answers. :\)  Hell if anyone claims to have all the answers at any age, they are trying to sell you something. :\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tf0hx/iama_son_of_two_megachurch_pastors_ama/c4m914f?context=5)|But a *painfully* brilliant 19. ;-)
[Ok I must have been confused, I got the impression that you only supported civil unions for gays and lesbians.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tf0hx/iama_son_of_two_megachurch_pastors_ama/c4maqh7?context=5)|I do, but because I think it is the least problematic solution and the most fair towards everyone, not because I have any sort of discrimination against them.
[I thought this meant two male megachurch pastors. That would be an amazing IAmA.  HOWEVER, how were you punished as a child?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tf0hx/iama_son_of_two_megachurch_pastors_ama/c4m4mr7?context=5)|I do remember being spanked as an early child, they stopped that at some point. Usually through removing privedges from age 10 on. Once I could drive the go-to was no car. I was very independent, and they grounded me from going to school several times. Dunno if that's legal, but it worked, because I cared about my grades more than they did.
[What is the strangest thing that you've seen during a sermon?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tf0hx/iama_son_of_two_megachurch_pastors_ama/c4m1o36?context=5)|Once a squirrel ran across the stage, freaked out my dad, and then I think they had to catch it.
 |Also it's always funny when you have a shameless visiting penecostal who is the one person in an audience of 1000 who will start yelling ""Amen, brother!"" while everyone else is dead silent.
[What are your thoughts on Pascal's Wager?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tf0hx/iama_son_of_two_megachurch_pastors_ama/c4m53ut?context=5)|Well two big ones. The first being, it's only valid if you assume there is only one God (or that the God you picked is the right one).
 |Secondly, it kinda violates Christianity because if you're believing in Christ and trying to go through the motions just to get to heaven, you're doing it wrong. The motivation should be a relationship with Christ, not self-preservation. That's why heaven is a reward...because it is oneness with Christ, not because its better than eternal torture.
[Thanks for your response. The way I see it if if one believes in an omniscient god (which I believe Christians do, please correct me if I'm wrong\) than the motives behind the decision would be known.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tf0hx/iama_son_of_two_megachurch_pastors_ama/c4mdusz?context=5)|Yes, God would know about the motives of a person. Therefore if you came to belief of God through Pascal's wager, that may be a bad motive. This is tricky territory, because of course it's not a good idea to guess what god thinks.
[ question: do you believe clergy (specifically the pastoral clergy\) are necessary in this day an age (where literacy is common\)? A big issue I have with Catholicism is confession. Who is the priest to be able to act as an intermediary? Just like I said above, the belief of an omniscient god would mean that god already knows I'm sorry and wanting forgiveness, so why not cut out the middle man?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tf0hx/iama_son_of_two_megachurch_pastors_ama/c4mdusz?context=5)|Your point is correct, methodist are reformed, whereas catholics are not. Methodists and most reformed folk would agree with you completely. I don't know what the catholic stance is.
[How do you think your parents would react if they find out you no longer share their beliefs? Or, if they are aware, how did they react when they found out?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tf0hx/iama_son_of_two_megachurch_pastors_ama/c4m1umw?context=5)|Well I really don't like my parents for reasons outside the scope of this question (they had some bad parenting mistakes with me which caused some pretty big rifts). So I don't talk to them about anything personal, but I am very open with my beliefs to everyone, and as pastor's they hear all the gossip, so I'm certain they know I'm not a Christian. It's BIG news when I tell people I'm not a Christian, because of my status at the church.
 |I argue with them occasionally when they say something stupid, but they aren't nearly as logical as I am so any discussion would be pointless. They don't bother or pester me or try to evangelize me, but they often make short comments like ""God really has a plan for you"" when something good happens, and they subversively try to get me to go to church by telling my friends to invite me, etc. So they know confrontation isn't beneficial, but they are trying to get me back to Christianity.
[Sounds a lot like my parents. Do they make you attend church every week?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tf0hx/iama_son_of_two_megachurch_pastors_ama/c4m1zqv?context=5)|Yes, when I stopped going they threatened to take my car away if I didn't go. That was when I really started realizing how much my parents were invested in me being what they wanted and realizing I had been manipulated. Since leaving for college I haven't attended church. Even for a Christian, it's pretty worthless. Better to have conversations with good friends then listen to a pastor talk about a topic that may not even relate to you.
[Do you have church groupies?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tf0hx/iama_son_of_two_megachurch_pastors_ama/c4m1pe4?context=5)|Not really sure what you mean, but there is definitely a very specific type of person that shows up in Church often. I've seen some weird characters and there are a lot of strange stories. When you operate a religious organization of this size, weird stuff happens a good bit. We are one of the few growing churches in our area, and there is still a lot of drama. Usually drama leads to diminishing church size. I just realized I got really off topic, hah.
[Do you think your falling away from Christianity was a result of growing up the son of megachurch pastors? That is, if your parents ministered at a smaller church (w/ a congregation of say a few hundred people\) or if they weren't pastors altogether, do you still think you'd be a Christian?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tf0hx/iama_son_of_two_megachurch_pastors_ama/c4m60cm?context=5)|Interesting question. I think in either scenario I would have ""fallen away"" (I don't really like that term) from Christianity. However, I think it would have been FASTER in a smaller church.
 |In a large church, pretty much all my friends from school or anywhere else, also went to my church. So I didn't question my beliefs for the longest time because it was something that everyone else believes as well - the entire community. So it was like a continual, passive peer pressure that I don't think would be present in a small church.
[Can you share what exactly separates Methodism from the other denominations?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tf0hx/iama_son_of_two_megachurch_pastors_ama/c4m3t8q?context=5)|I'm can't provide a lot of info, cuz I'm not well versed in other demoninations, but I'll give it a go.
 |Methodist's are probably much more organized than most religions, we have a governing structure. They believe the bible. They believe God wants everyone to be saved (not just the elect). They do not believe ""once saved always saved."" They do not believe baptism is necessary for salvation. Gay marriage and homsexuality is a hot topic these days,  I think a lot of the liberal methodist churches are moving towards accepting it, whereas our church believes homosexuality is a sin.
 |If you had any other specific doctrinal questions, I may know, but its hard to think of everything. I think those are the main points.
[What are your life plans?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tf0hx/iama_son_of_two_megachurch_pastors_ama/c4m5hvi?context=5)|I'm currently attending UCF majoring in Electrical Engineering. I have a scholarship through the DoD which includes a contract, stating that I work for them as a civilian engineer when I graduate. I currently intern at that location. So college now, working with the Department of Defense after, and who knows from there. One of my biggest priorities in life is finding a wife, other than that I just want to keep a good job and try and enjoy my life (and figure out if life has any grand purpose or not).
[Also is there any proof/confirmation on this AMA yet? EDIT: Yes, yes there is.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tf0hx/iama_son_of_two_megachurch_pastors_ama/c4m5hvi?context=5)|Also, I posted proof to the guy that asked for it. I just edited my main post to include it.
[Defense contracts are a great way to start, but just be careful later on if you end up working for a defense contractor--when the defense budget decreases, so can your job security.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tf0hx/iama_son_of_two_megachurch_pastors_ama/c4m5q4s?context=5)|I'm definitely keeping my options open, but I'm civilian service, so for the government to fire you takes a lot. It's probably more secure than the private sector - just lower pay.
[Do they strictly adhere to every aspect of the bible? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tf0hx/iama_son_of_two_megachurch_pastors_ama/c4m4vbr?context=5)|Nope. They are the typical new testament only folk. And they don't follow the no women talking in church. 
[What kind of money are your parents making?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tf0hx/iama_son_of_two_megachurch_pastors_ama/c4m2x0i?context=5)|My dad makes in the upper six figures, I think my mom makes somewhere around 20-40k. She is part time but works full time usually. They both have master's degrees and 30+ years experience in the ministry. My mom was a missionary for a few years too, and is still really involved in that stuff.
[6 figures = $100,000+  Upper 6 figures would be $750,000+](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tf0hx/iama_son_of_two_megachurch_pastors_ama/c4m3xnf?context=5)|Duh. Dunno what I was thinking. I think he's around $200k if you include benefits.
[Anyways, does your church donate well to the local community or do a lot of missionary work? I'd sure hope so.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tf0hx/iama_son_of_two_megachurch_pastors_ama/c4m8kmh?context=5)|Our church is big for a reason. My dad brought it from 200 to 3000...so I mean for the most part we are large because people genuinely like what is going on.

[Have you ever gotten to meet anyone famous that attends your churches?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tf0hx/iama_son_of_two_megachurch_pastors_ama/c4m7xpk?context=5)|Not anybody super famous.
 |A five star general came once and told me dad he had a ""great sense of leadership,"" which my dad says is the best compliment he has ever received.
 |We live near one of the largest Air Force base's in the world, and many very highly ranked people attend, so that's cool.
 |Also my parents are very connected outside of our church with various Christian organizations, so we have prominent people visit a lot. Missionaries from various locations, etc.
 |So no-one really ""famous"" per se, but lots and lots of influential people both in our community and in Christianity. People often stay at our house so I've met most of them. 
[3,000 a week is a lot for a megachurch? The local catholic regular church gets like 8000 each Sunday.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tf0hx/iama_son_of_two_megachurch_pastors_ama/c4maidw?context=5)|A megachurch is classified as 2,000 or more a week. I think we are one of the top  Methodist churches in the alabama-florida area. Its not uncommon to see much larger churches. However, our area is relatively small, so its more impressive on that account too.
[How much money do they suck out of their flocks?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tf0hx/iama_son_of_two_megachurch_pastors_ama/c4mc0cc?context=5)|Whatever you choose to give. In fact, they aren't manipulative at all. One of the cliche phrases that's used a lot is to ""give whatever God leads you to."" 
[Do your parents make a huge amount of money? If so,  what are the odds they do it for the money like i believe many of these mega church pastors?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tf0hx/iama_son_of_two_megachurch_pastors_ama/c4m2bhh?context=5)|My dad makes a lot, somewhere in the range of $200k if you include his benefits. My mom does not.
 |They certainly DON'T do it for the money. My dad is 57 or so and has been a pastor since he graduated college. At his first assignment he made only $10k. When he came to the current church, he still didn't make much because it was small. He only made a lot as we grew to what we are now. My mom gets paid part time but works full time, just because she wants too. They definitely believe in what they do.
 |Edit: can't speak for other pastors, but I think to operate a megachurch successfully, you have to have experience. Getting experience in the ministry does not pay well. However, greed may become a factor later on (writing books, etc). I can all but guarantee you have to be pretty dedicated to be a new pastor, because its incredibly stressful and pays nothing.
 |Edit 2: Fixed an error in terminology.
[Why is your mom only paid for part-time work but actually works full time? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tf0hx/iama_son_of_two_megachurch_pastors_ama/c4m3sk7?context=5)|She was hired as a part time position (because that is what the church could offer) but she enjoys her job a lot and believes she makes a lot of an impact so chooses to volunteer the rest of her time without pay.
[Is your parent's relationship the stereotypical Christian ""wife submits to husband"" deal or more egalitarian?  Also, was your mom involved in church leadership at all or was she on salary as a church employee?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tf0hx/iama_son_of_two_megachurch_pastors_ama/c4m7iei?context=5)|Before she was on salary she was a ""deacon in residence"". So not really any formal leadership role, but she still had influence just from her status.
 |My mom and my dad do have arguements so I know that much. I know that my dad gets the final say if he wants to push something, but they generally discuss everything. In tense moments or fights with me though, it was always my dad's word that went over my mom.

I need a place to stay in the area. /r/Idaho is dead or might as well be, /r/TwinFalls never had a pulse. So hopefully someone here might be of some help.

I own a home here in Boise as I go to BSU. Live with my brother, he is staying here so leaving this place isn't a problem. But I won't be bringing much with me in terms of furniture. Pretty much the bare essentials to work, sleep, mountain bike and Diablo 3.

The area is understandably more expensive to live in, but Hailey is a bit cheaper than Ketchum so I'm looking for Hailey area as it's only 15 minutes or so from where I'll be working most of the time.

If anyone is familiar with the area and can recommend something or knows someone that can put up with a 23 year old College Senior with a computer and Mountain Bike(s) till August, I would appreciate it.

I'll be posting something in /r/Idaho on the off chance someone reads it.

Also a bit of me just venting.,smj32091,engineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/tfvnp/need_help_getting_my_foot_in_the_door_also_a_bit/,"Currently I'm a Junior in my undergraduate studies and pursuing a degree in mechanical and aerospace engineering.  This past semester I probably have applied to at least 20 open internships positions offered from my school as well as from company profiles.  I have been interviewed for about a third of those positions and still have never gotten any offers.  I'm at wits end with the situation I'm in and very frustrated with what I might be doing wrong. Over the past 5 months I've tried everything to boost my hireability and have made real progress but it just seems that whatever I try to do isn't good enough.  I'm involved with undergraduate research which I took up this semester in February, my gpa is in great standing, I've been inducted into the mechanical engineering honor society at my university and also elected a board position. On top of this I work part time with the university to manage the computer labs across the whole university.  It gets increasingly frustrating and makes me question my self worth when companies never get back to me.  So my question to you professional engineers is what do you guys look for when hiring an intern or new hire.  

I have a second round interview for one more company and am determined to try my best to get this position, but right now I feel like my best isn't good enough."
tftry,1,2012-05-09,She never wants to talk to me again :(,derpulon,BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/tftry/she_never_wants_to_talk_to_me_again/,"So my ex and I broke up in early January. I was the one who initiated the break up because I was frustrated about how little communication we had. We were somewhat long distance due to me being on an internship and her being at school (an hour away roughly). Things were good at first, but then she was generally pissed off all the time and seemed annoyed by me (I think from the stress of school). She also had groups of friends that she never wanted me to meet or know about me. I was pretty much persistently depressed. Anyway, that was in the past and I broke up with her over email.
Following the break up, there was a lot of arguing through instant messaging. She wouldn't admit she did anything wrong. Eventually we reached a point where we were able to talk online as friends... but then arguing broke it apart in the end.


This happened several times. I attribute it partially to the fact that talking over a messenger client does not carry your intention/intonation very well. There was usually a month or two between whenever we would talk again.


I became depressed as she 'seemed' okay with it. She was posting pictures on facebook of her and her friends having fun (the ones I wasn't allowed to meet). It depressed me and I resented it since my life was still pretty much dead.


I eventually unfriended her on facebook because of another chat argument about the breakup among other things. It was also partially because I couldn't stop myself from checking her facebook page and thinking about her.


This helped since I could literally not see any information about her. I started online dating and essentially forgot about her for a while.
She eventually asked me why I deleted her on facebook... and it turned into another argument. I eventually told her it was to make the break up easier, and that I would re-add her when I no longer had feelings for her. Following that, the argument subsided. We had a nice chat about what's going on in each other's lives.


Another month passed and she asked a coworker of mine (who also knows her) out for lunch as friends (she recently started an internship nearby mine). He sent me a screenshot of their conversation where he asked if I could come too, and she said no because I broke up with her and insinuated she was an arrogant bitch. Confused by this, I messaged her over Facebook and told her I wasn't going to try and divide friends and that I wouldn't influence him to not go. Her response was her blocking me completely on Facebook.


Later I asked her over chat why she did that. And she said it was because she was tired of me being accusatory and didn't feel like dealing with me anymore. All she feels when talking to me is sad. I asked her to unblock me, and she said she wouldn't since we weren't friends. She said at this point she doesn't really care if we ever cross paths again. She said this friendship is done, good bye - and that was it.


Now here's the thing about my ex; she's very literal. If she says something, that's what's happening. It is true that in all our arguments I was being accusatory (telling her she had no empathy. etc), mostly just trying to convince her that I wasn't the only reason our relationship died. She also takes accusations very personally (part of which I guess can be blamed on ambiguity of textual communication). She said I just had to accept her 'egoistic' attitude (her words) because that's who she is, and her real friends accept it - and that things didn't work out just because they didn't work out.
So now that leaves me at this point... aside from my ex being my ex, she was a good friend. I've never been in a situation where a long time friend never wanted to talk to me again. On top of it, I don't even know if I'm wrong or not.... and after that, it's feeling like I was.


Now I guess I'm just really depressed. What do I do to feel better? I'm stuck at work roughly 9 to 5 during the week, have almost no friends here, having limited luck with online dating and now know somebody out there doesn't ever want to talk to me again. I already go to the gym and tried distracting myself with hobbies... but everything seems to only work for a little while.


Is there anything else I can do to get over this?"

I am currently a year away from completing my undergraduate Computer Science degree at Georgia Tech. I have been debating getting my Master's degree for a while now, but I am having trouble deciding if the cost of student loans will be worth it. Would a Master's degree pay off quickly compared to what I would make in two years of work?

I would be looking into focusing on networking and computer architecture, but Tech also has an Information Security program that intrigues me. However, I feel that an InfoSec degree could potentially put me in a niche field and limit the opportunities presented to me.

Programmers of Reddit, can you give me some input on your experiences with graduate CS programs? What made you decide to pursue (or not pursue) it? Would I be better off focusing on work experience instead of higher education(I already have a year of internship experience)? Will I be able to learn more skills or harder to acquire skills in a Master's program than I would in the real world?

Thanks for your input!"

First and foremost I really want to thank everyone who gave me such great advice for getting my foot into the gaming industry. I took all of it to heart and it helped a ton. 

Second of all, I wanted to tell you all where the advice has gotten me thus far: a few weeks ago I started sending emails and resumes to several computer engineering firms around Ohio, basically telling them my experience and what I was hoping to get out of a job. About a day after I sent out numerous emails, I received a reply back from local Ohio company (keeping the name private) who specializes in motion sensing hardware (pretty cool stuff) and software, as well as robotics and other neat stuff. 

I got an interview and scored an internship! Now I am working full time, getting paid a decent amount of money, and having fun at a job I love. Sure it is not in the Gaming Industry exactly, but it was just the starting job I needed. Things are going well there (cant talk about the work too much, a lot of it is government contracted) and it will be a great experience for me while I am in school. 

Just wanted to say thanks to those who helped me and to those struggling like I was, try as hard as you can and be persistent! That is what helped me the most. "

&gt;I am SpongeBob SquarePants, managing director of a management consulting business that operates in health-care and IT areas, and, with this letter, I would like to show my appreciation toward a person who spent a one year internship in my business, Thomas Slothrop, as flash developer in an e-learning project.
&gt;
&gt;Thomas Slothrop is a great team player, reliable, precise and keen. Under the right circumstances, Thomas shows great performances in analysis, disclosure and use of skills in the IT field. He proved himself to be committed to the job and often offered his skills beyond his tasks, suggesting spontaneously interesting and effective solutions. Politeness and warmth are also two features of his being.
&gt;
&gt;In this moment Thomas is thinking to widen his assets with significant learning experiences, including abroad. My team and I hope to work with him in the foreseeable future.
&gt;

I keep getting assured by everywhere that I apply that someone else will hire me. So I am casting my net as wide as I can.

I am willing to try any work that will allow me to move out of my parents' house, to be perfectly honest. I also just need something to get some experience because I enjoy and understand the different types and stages of engineering equally - thus, I can't claim any specialization to help on applications.

PM me and I can send a résumé. I am located in Central Florida, but I am willing to relocate in a heartbeat.

My only experience is an internship with NASA in 2008. I have experience with multiple programming languages (Java, C++, Matlab, LabView), but I'm not a wizard at any of them, yet. I have also done modeling with AutoCad, Inventor, and Solidworks."

(Still job searching after graduating in 2011)  The producers (my bosses) are new to the industry where as I have some experience.  They have unloaded a lot of the work on me which is getting to a point where it is making more work for everyone.

Last week, I was told the trailer would be ready by the beginning of this week and to start creating some buzz around the release, thus being a good little worker, I did.  Today I was told it wouldn't be ready for another week, and now I look bad in misleading our fans/followers.  Additionally the producers are not updating me for content generation and they pressure me to get things done and then don't follow through on their end. 

 I'm already stressed as hell due to unemployment, potentially having to move back in with my parents in 2 months. I get paid maybe $15/hr for about 10 hrs per week.  Is it worth me staying on or how do I explain to them how much they are constantly screwing me?"
tiizl,1,2012-05-11,Could use a little direction from experts in the field.,PvtHopscotch,sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/tiizl/could_use_a_little_direction_from_experts_in_the/,"So I'm 26 and in my freshman year of a Systems Administration Degree, I have yet to take any of my major courses, so right now I'm just working with my personal knowledge.

I got an awesome internship with a fairly good sized national retail business. At the moment they have me working on a software rollout project to all their stores.

Okay, so part of this internship is building a personal set of training goals to work towards and that's where I run into problems. My understanding of the SYSADMIN world isn't terribly in depth. I understand that ya'll tend to do a little of everything which appeals to me. I've looked around in the subreddit and found some great posts that I've read over as far as things to do at home or elsewhere to work on my knowledge.

My boss is super supportive of how I want to structure my time and areas of focus here. They don't have anyone that goes by ""system admin"" here as their IT structure is a little weird (quite efficient however), the closest is their system analysts that work on the helpdesk (external, deals with the numerous retail stores, corporate network/PC issues are handled by a separate dept). 

Right now I have my training goals basically set out to give me an overall feel and concept of how the whole ""machine"" works, working a few weeks with each department (Phone/Network, Helpdesk, install/maint, CorporateOffice PC/network support). I have the focus set with the helpdesk as I'v read/heard that’s a great foundation for the job and where I work at the moment anyway.

What I humbly ask from you is if there is something that I should focus on, learn about, gets hands on with given the opportunity? Keep in mind, I'm early in my education so I don't want to try an jam advanced level stuff in my noggin before I get the basics but I am tech savvy of my own accord and consider myself intelligent and a quick learner so nothing is really out of the question.

Thanks in advance for any advice.

tihbp,1,2012-05-11,In need of advice from people in the biotechnology and accounting field as I am a little unsure where to go next....,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/tihbp/in_need_of_advice_from_people_in_the/,"I am currently 23 and at a community college studying an AAS in Biotechnology and Molecular Biosciences.  I was thrown into it because at the time the adviser I saw said it was the closest program they had to Biochemistry.  Now I know they do have a biochem program, but it would add at least a year and I have already been there for a little over 2 years.   So I figured I would save time and stick with the biotech degree, which can transfer straight to University through a special partnership.  Though, I just found out that the bachelors degree that I would obtain is filled with fluff classes like ""history of theater"" and ""Adult Career Development"" and only has 4 science related classes which are: Animal or Plan Physiology, Fundamentals of Genetics, Cell Biology and Applied Molecular Genetics.

Now, first of all, I do not think that these courses would provide for a strong education that would allow me to do anything at all.  I see myself getting out with a bachelor and still being in the situation I am in now where I don't have enough education.  To add to that my main goal has always been to work in Industrial Biotechnology and product development.  Though I know how heroic it is to devote your life to research, I would rather affect people's everyday lives, and I don't think I would have the skills to do that.  I also feel a little like I am running out of time as I am already a 23 year old woman.  All of my best friends from high school have children already, so what if I don't have much time left for school? I also feel really terrible that I should already have a bachelor’s degree by now, but due to financial and personal issues I wasn’t able to stay on track.   I graduated at the top ½ percentile of my high school class, so taking so long in college, even though I am paying for it all myself, seems like I disappointed everyone.. 

This is where accounting comes in.. I got into accounting because I work as a Bookkeeper / Accounts Payable / Accounts Receivable / Everything for a small business, and the more I do it the more I love it.  If I decide to change majors I could transfer next spring (about a year earlier than the biotech route), and I also wouldn't have to worry about my financial state as I wouldn't have to take two semesters of internships.  Lastly, I would love to be able to obtain a professional internship with the Walt Disney Company.   I know it may be a sign of how young I am, but I have always wanted to be a part of something that creates so much magic.  I mean, how can’t you support something that told me when I was young that dreams can come true.  The only thing is I don't really know where to go or what to do to.  I have the ability and the drive, but I don't have any one that knows enough about the corporate accounting world to help guide me to where I would like to be.

So, I would love to hear from people in each field and get some advice.  Am I right that continuing in the Biotech program will not give me the knowledge to get me where I would like to go, or is my goal of Industrial Biotechnology still within reach?  From accountants I would love to hear what I would need to do, what classes to take, what groups I would need to join, to be a shoe-in as an intern and to set me up to have a great career.

HELP Reddit!!,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/tih3f/could_potentially_get_the_job_of_my_dreams_due_to/,"So basically...did this internship at this high-profile publishing company about 6 years ago..got the internship as my mum's neighbor was the owner of the company and I was/still am friends with the grandson/son.

I don't think I did the job very well, although I got a letter of recommendation from the owner and 500 EUR even though it was supposed to be an unpaid internship. I was young, it was my first internship and I don't really remember what I did there (that's why I'm not sure if I did my job well).

Fast forward 5 years - graduated from uni with a relevant degree and recently moved to the world's capital of literature. I know that the owner of the company I did an internship with has got many connections all over Europe and is quite renowned in the publishing world. I've been considering sending her an email asking for her help to get me a job...

The problem is that i haven't really been in touch with the woman since i did the internship. I've seen the son on a couple of occasions (even had a short, akward fling - no sex though - with him last summer) and we're still occasionally in touch.

I'm a bit ashamed that I never even wrote the woman a christmas card and don't know if it would be cheeky to ask her for her help so many years later . i'm not sure how to go on about it/if I should have a chat with the son first although he's got nothing to do with the company/email her directly.

ti4i1,2,2012-05-11,So my boyfriend broke up with me last night out of the blue.,Alocasia_Fruit,BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/ti4i1/so_my_boyfriend_broke_up_with_me_last_night_out/,"I'm 22, he's 22. I graduate college in seven days. Our situation is kind of weird. We're long distance (he lives in PA and I live in NY) but we met each other through mutual friends online. This was almost three years ago. We helped each other through some really difficult stuff and he transferred schools to spend this year with me. But he took a year off at the beginning, so while I'm graduating, he isn't. This wasn't a problem.

He has an internship in DC for the summer. No big deal. He's coming back to school in the fall, and our school is closer to my house than his house in PA is, so that's also no big deal. There were no problems outside of normal tiffs and stupid arguments. Until yesterday.

He's been really stressed out over school. I mean really stressed out - not sleeping, not eating, barely getting work done. It's finals week, so while I'm all finished up and ready to graduate, he's still busting his butt trying to get his stuff done. I've been letting him, giving him space, whatever he needs. But we met up at the dining hall yesterday for dinner and I noticed he wasn't really talking to me or looking me in the eyes. This was on top of some funny behavior the night before when I didn't go spend the night in the library with him and our friends (I was sick, and it was pouring rain and I didn't want to walk over there) so I asked him straight up, ""is everything okay with us?""

And when he didn't answer, I felt like everything just fell apart.

But I thought it would be fine. Our friends showed up and I was visibly upset, I didn't really eat but neither did anyone else, really. When we left dinner, I went back with him to his room because he said we could ""talk."" I didn't realize then that the decision had already been made.

He told me that he had been thinking about it for a very long time, since the beginning of last semester. He said that he didn't feel how he expected to feel when he finally got to the same place as me. He said that he had just been biding his time waiting for the right moment to break up with me, and that I just noticed too early. He said a lot of normal breakup stuff along those lines. He said that he was only putting on a front the whole time because he thought if he could be the best boyfriend possible it wouldn't be an issue (he was, and always has been, perfect in that regard) but didn't break up because we had become such an institution among our friends. I asked him if this was because of the distance and he said no, I asked him if there was somebody else and he said no.

I think that would be easy enough to understand. Sometimes relationships don't work out and I get that. Except he cried. He cried so much. I was crying, he was crying, he kept saying he loved me but he didn't know if he loved me like I loved him. He kept saying all this contradictory stuff. When I finally got too upset to stay there any longer, I tried to walk out of his room. He burst into tears and asked me to stay a bit longer, and then cried on my shoulder for five minutes.  Then on my way out the door, he said he would miss me.

Am I missing something? We'd been together over 2 1/2 years, I thought I knew him. I thought this semester was going so well. It was basically perfect for me, he was basically perfect for me. I was invited to his sister's wedding in the fall. He scheduled his internship around being able to go to my graduation and graduation dinner (which he texted me last night he still wants to go to). He's dropped countless money on Steam games just over the past couple months because he knew I wanted to play them (which is a big deal because he's not a big spender in any way, shape, or form). We had plans. We didn't fight. I really just don't understand what's going on right now.

And then he Facebook messaged me that he wanted to spend the night last night. (No sex.) I said fine, that we could catch up on Community, but then he changed his mind at the last second and said everything was really weird for him.

I haven't really slept, and I definitely haven't had food. I can't stomach it. (I'm sick, too, so that isn't really helping the appetite situation) I'm waiting for him to wake up to respond to my request to talk to him again. None of this makes sense. I keep steeling myself, expecting to wake up at any moment. So far it hasn't worked. I don't really know what to do, help? "

Problem is that once I hit Arkansas I got a phone call from the person I was supposed to be renting from telling me he found someone who was going to pay him more, so the room I had arranged was no longer mine. Padmapper hasn't been much help because people either don't have anything open until June or they want me to lease for 6+ months - that's not feasible because I go home in August.

I'm currently bouncing around hotels and friends' couches and desperately need somewhere stable to live for the summer. My internship starts on Monday and I'll be here through early/mid-August. If you have something available, just fire me off a message and I'll get back to you with my phone number so we can get a feel for each other.

Close to the Metro is a huge plus as I'll be working near the National Mall. Areas surrounding DC (Maryland, Virginia) are fine with me.

Since I brought my car, parking is helpful (but I can make other arrangements if needed) and at least meager furnishings (bed bare minimum) is needed."

I'm a European and got the great opportunity to do an internship over in LA from the beginning of July to end of September, so just under three months.

Now, the office is pretty close to LAX (south/east), and I would like a nice area to stay, hence I was aiming for Santa Monica/Venice as it is close to the beach and close to where I work. I will have a car available for the time.

Do you have any special suggestions on where to look for a rent/sublet for these three months? I would very much like an own room. I already know and frequent westside rentals, padmapper and craigslist...

Does it even make sense to try it from here or would I best aim for a hotel or so for the first couple of days and go apt scouting from there?

At any rate, if you yourself are looking for a sublet/room mate for July - September, then holler at me!

Any help is appreciated as it is a bit of a tricky task from afar.

All of the other preview files in the .iwd file are for the other DLC maps that have been released or announced (the ""_ss"" ones might be the face off maps).

Analysis of **MW/MW2 Nostalgia map pack** rumor: Comparing the image of [MW3 Terminal](http://images.wikia.com/callofduty/images/7/74/Terminal.jpg) found in the patch, there are some differences when compared to the image of MW2's Terminal shown [here](http://i.imgur.com/DbDDi.png). Let's debunk the theory of why I don't believe that this is a ""left over"" image from MW2. First of all, this was found and added on the May 8th - I don't think IW would just add a random place holder image or preview image or if it's just a careless intern's mistake. Second, people mentioned that the color is off. True. MW3's map color correction is more ""dull"" and ""muted"" compared to MW2. Third, the angle of the preview image of MW3 Terminal is different from the one found in MW2 Terminal, which brings furthercredibility that the rumors of a ""nostalgia"" map pack. GHANDI (in the CoD forums) hinted at such a prospect, possibly being even free and being available to everyone in all platforms. If my analysis is correct, a MW2 ""nostalgia"" map pack could imminent. Be excited my friends.



**Update 1**: Somebody mentioned that the MW3 Terminal looks mute and dark compared to MW2 Terminal. It makes sense because color correction on MW3, from experimentation, is more ""mute"" and ""dark"" compared to MW2 and MW (CoD 4)."

There's a number of reasons for this:

* I switched to CS kind of late (about after sophomore year)
* I didn't really *get* programming until about the end of junior year (we didn't really do much of it in our classes...)
* I spent my summers working overtime at non-technical job, so no internships at any point
* My school is a private, jesuit, liberal arts school, so it isn't known for CS at all
* Between a job over the summer, part-time jobs during school, and a naive/uninformed belief that GPA would end up being the bee's knees for my resume, I didn't really spend much time getting better at programming or working on personal projects during school

Although I feel like I've worked really hard during school and learned a ton, I realize that I'm probably at the bottom of the barrel in terms of junior or entry-level candidates. I've applied to a couple of places and I get the feeling that my unanimous rejections confirm this.

The good news is that I know how to do hard work, I really do care about CS and software, and I refuse to accept mediocrity. **My question is, what is the best way for me to become employable and maybe even somewhat competitive?**

I am currently working on building up a portfolio, doing projects, maybe open-source stuff down the line (if I get good enough) and so on... But I really feel like I've only gotten half of what everyone else has gotten out of a degree in CS (or at least just from the ~4 years they spent working on their own stuff there).


* Should I basically just say screw it and go through CS again through self-guided OCW/Udacity/Coursera?
* Some of my professors have suggested working my way into grad school somehow over the summer, is that even remotely possible for someone like me? Or, more importantly, is it even a good idea?
* Should I attempt to find some sort of internship? Are they even worthwhile after having already graduated?
* Or should I just stick to working on projects until I have a portfolio that's worth a damn?

Thanks for your time."

I'm a marketing and development intern for the Center for Chemical Addictions Treatment (CCAT) on Ezzard Charles Drive.  My internship has revolved primarily on organizing our annual CCAT Walk, a fundraiser to benefit the agency and its patients.  CCAT provides a lot of services for the community, its patients, and their families.  Our program includes community-based detox, short term residency, and a 12 week aftercare program.  Our facility also offers alumni events, a suboxone outpatient clinic, and a series of educational courses for families and friends of patients.  Finally, we house al-anon and AA meetings once weekly.  

The success rate of our program (which includes detox, STR, and aftercare) is very high, with over 60% those admitted graduating.  If you know anything about the heroin epidemic in the Ohio River Valley--or anything about addiction in general--these are pretty good odds.  The center does a lot of good for the people it serves, their families, and for the community, but it is still yet to get the recognition that it deserves.  

I'd love to change this.  We're trying to get the word out about our organization through radio commercials (maybe you've heard about us on WARM 98?), print advertisements, and Facebook (check us out! www.facebook.com/ccatsober).  Our annual walk, coming up on May 19th, is also a big part of this.  Last year it was a huge fundraiser for us, and more importantly, it was a great way to tell people about a resource in Cincinnati that many of them are unaware of.  This year, we've added a mural to honor those lost to the disease of addiction.  

So please, if you are free on May 19th, register for the CCAT Walk!  Registration starts at $25, and the money goes to support a great cause.  The walk starts at 9:30 AM and runs until 12:30.  You can find registration on [our website, ccatsober.org](http://www.ccatsober.org).  You get a shirt, free food, and a chance to enter in some really cool raffles.  More importantly, any money you spend goes to fund a great organization in your community.  

If you guys have any questions about the walk, CCAT, or its programs, please feel free to ask!  I'll answer to the best of my abilities, and I'd love to see you all there next Saturday. 

Thanks, guys!

thojr,2,2012-05-11,Applying for a undergrad student internship in the autopsy section of the medical examiners office. Who has experience in this sort of position? Do you have any advice for me? (I am a 21 yr old female cell molec bio major - junior yr.),jenejij,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/thojr/applying_for_a_undergrad_student_internship_in/,"I feel that I am qualified to the degree necessary for this job, but I know that this position will have A TON of applicants. It will be competitive to get an interview, and while lots will drop out in the interview process/after seeing a cadaver first hand, I don't know if I will be able to make the cut. 

**What Qualifies me:** I am fascinated with the prospects of working with cadavers, am not squeamish in the slightest, have seen multiple live surgeries close enough to touch (open heart, mastectomies, tracheotomies), spent time volunteering in ERs, and work in a lab where I do surgery on rats and proceed to decapitate them and remove their brains – for purpose of our study. I have taken college physiology courses, but no anatomy yet. I do have an anatomy quiz ap on my android though, haha. I should mention that I am a 3rd year biology student, and hoping to go to medical school someday. I have had thoughts of working as a surgeon. 

**My downfall:** Somehow I have a hard time being detail oriented, and it’s not that I can’t be precise, but it’s a challenge to me. I come from a family of artists and eccentric writers, and precision has never been highlighted outside of school. It’s taken a lot of discipline to work in and study science for the last three years, but I love to meet the challenge. It’s still a challenge. 


Regardless of how much gruntwork and photocopying is involved, every aspect of this job will be beneficial for me, and teach me so much. I want this position so badly, and I want to express this in an eloquent way. I have a respect for death, and an acceptance of it. I did not grow up with death in my life, and I don’t think that this is a prerequisite to being stable dealing with death (although it might be helpful.) I think I am able to empathize with those deceased, and be thankful and honored to be a part of their passing on, but still have the ability to prevent daily exposure to death and trauma from getting to me. 

**Here are my questions: Have you had this job? If so, what is it like? How do you feel at the end of each day? How do you deal with the difficulties of the job?  Would you recommend it? How can I impress in my resume?**


I really appreciate any advice anyone has to offer.

I'm thinking of trying to make the switch into computer science but i'm not really sure where to start and what my goals should be.

I have very little experience with any programming. I took a qbasic class, a html class, and a logo writer class (lol) in high school but haven't touched anything programming related since. I'm not really sure on what career i'd want to go for, i'm hoping taking some intro classes would help me find where my interests lie.

I was planning on taking some intro cs college classes and then applying to go for a 2nd bachelor's degree in computer science. My goal would be to keep my gpa above 3.5, try to get involved with some student groups for experience, and try to get at least 1 internship before i graduated. 

I'm about to turn 24, based on the requirements of the school i want to go to its going to take me 2-2.5 years if all goes well to graduate. I'm getting a bit older now and i know its a long road ahead so i want to try to keep anymore missteps to a minimum. Any advice is welcome, thanks."
thjxp,12,2012-05-10,I'm going to send an email to the Chancellor in an attempt to reduce the number of emails sent to all students. ,mynameismunka,ucr,https://www.reddit.com/r/ucr/comments/thjxp/im_going_to_send_an_email_to_the_chancellor_in_an/,"Here is my email.  What do you all think about my idea?  Is this email clear?  Do you all agree with what I'm saying here?  Send me some feedback!!

Dear Chancellor White,

My name is X, and I am a first year graduate student at UCR.  I believe that the number of emails sent to all students is much, much too high.  I feel like my inbox is constantly flooded with emails sent to [students].  In the last two days, I have received 13 emails directed at all students on campus.  This is absolutely ridiculous. 

It seems like most of the emails are simply reminding us about events around campus.  I agree that email is a good way to inform all students of events happening around campus, the fact that we get so many emails causes a numbness towards any emails that are obviously sent to all students.  I believe there is a simple way to fix this problem.  I am currently subscribed to NASA's education ""express"" emails.  The format of the email is as follows: the first part of the email is a sort of ""table of contents"".  It has the title of each topic discussed in the body of the email and a very short description.  The rest of the email is broken up into these topics and then each topic is described in detail with all the information I would want.  I think this would be an excellent format to mimic.  I can easily scroll to the parts of the email that are relevant to me, such as when puppies are on campus, and ignore emails that would not apply to my situation, such as an undergraduate opportunity for political internship in Washington DC.  The NASA email is sent out once per week, and keeps me updated without flooding my inbox.  I think most of the emails sent to all students would be able to easily fit into this category.

I guess someone would have to be in charge of the emails.  Anyone who wants to send an email to all students would have to go through the one in charge, and this person in charge would have to make sure everything was formatted correctly.  Of course, there would have to be exceptions, such as campus crime alerts, or other time sensitive messages.  Overall, I think this is a simple, effective way to reduce the number of emails sent to all students.

Thank you for your time,
~X"
thix4,13,2012-05-10,I feel as though I've stopped loving my mother...just in time for mother's day.,[deleted],TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/thix4/i_feel_as_though_ive_stopped_loving_my_motherjust/,"My relationship with my parents has always been complicated. I was physically and emotionally abused for a good portion of my childhood, mostly in relation to my grades. My father was more on the side of physical abuse, but my mother saw him hit me and let him, sometimes joining in. At the time I could do nothing about it because I was not a citizen and if I sent my parents to jail, my family wouldn't take me, leaving me most likely being sent to an orphanage in Russia.


Recently I have gone in for an evaluation for adult ADHD. I had problems concentrating/with hyperactivity as a child, and I still have a good portion of those problems now (although I managed to develop coping mechanisms with most of them and am a successful student at university).


However, despite my faults I was  by no means a terrible child. I had problems doing homework and keeping grades up, however I started staying home alone at age 8 and would do the dishes while my parents were out.

This semester, after taking a few graduate courses as an undergrad (thanks to an accelerated program at my college), I found I didn't have as good of a handle on my ADHD symptoms as I thought. After going borderline suicidal I talked to a counselor and was recommended that I talk to my doctor. 

**This is where it all goes to shit.**

I couldn't make the appointment on my own (forgot the number to my GP)/I needed someone to discuss family history, so my mother came along. She spent the entire time telling my doctor how terrible I was as a kid. 

My doctor is a really nice lady, and actually offered me some wonderful resources on dealing with symptoms while I set up an appointment for an ADHD evaluation with a psychologist (to know for sure before putting me on meds). However, she made the mistake of telling her own story and stating how her son who was also diagnosed later in life, had a hard time forgiving her for the arguments they had (she is not abusive). She ended that statement with how I shouldn't necessarily blame my parents for not understanding. 

**I don't think my doctor knew what was going on. But on the car ride home my mother went off on a self-righteous rant about how I shouldn't blame her/be mad at her for the abuse I suffered as a child. She said that the doctor was right, they were doing the best they could, so I shouldn't blame them.**

**I tried to explain that even from a logical standpoint, what they did was wrong. If hitting me didn't bring my grades up, why keep doing it? The only reason would be to vent your anger/stress.**

**She would laugh at me when I tried to make counter points. Then she told me that she wouldn't grovel at my feet. I find this ironic because when I got lost trying to get to a friends house (the very last time they tried to hit me) and was found after police intervention, my dad made me kneel and grovel at her feet. Furthermore, I didn't want her to grovel, all I asked for was possibly an apology. My mother also had the emotionally manipulative moment where, during this conversation, she asked me if I loved her.**

A month later I came back from school for my first psychological evaluation. My mother was acting really strange and really out of it. 

During the second history evaluation (this time with a psychologist), my mother once again went off recalling my worst moments. Telling him how horrible I was.

**On the car ride back, she told me that our last conversation 'broke her spirit' and how she could just so easily snap and not care about me anymore. She pulled this once when I tried to give her a tip when we attempted to learn to scuba-dive...Her telling me how easily she could lose interest made me lose interest, I haven't dived since, she did multiple times. My mother told me about how all of her friends and my father were worried about her, and how it was my fault. I had to sit and listen to this, and apologize the entire ride.**

**I asked her if she felt better after that tirade. She said she did- I didn't.**

Fast forward to summer vacation. I finished my semester, my grades are okay and I got a much needed extension on my final project for one of my classes. I am living at home and in between internships (doing an unpaid internship until I leave for the city for my paid internship). I work incredibly hard, I am out of the house at the same time my parents are and I come back after they do...I also work Fridays, they don't.

**We are supposed to have guests over this weekend, and the cleaning lady my parents hire decided to take the day off before they come in. My mother attempted to bribe me to vacuum the house and wash all of the floors on Friday. I agreed to it because the way she said it I had no choice, despite the fact that I work most of that day, still have to unpack my belongings and have a project to finish.**

Yesterday morning my mother barges into my room demanding for the 1000x time that I clean the house on Friday. 

**I admit I gave her a bit of attitude when I told her I would do it. She blew it way out of proportion, started shouting about how lots of parents make their kids do these things for free, how I'm ungrateful, and how she supports the entire family.**

Here is the thing, yes she supports the family, but given her income I am hardly a money suck. She makes over $180,000 a year.

* I go to a state school while taking out the maximum in student unsubsidized loans.

* I pay for most of my own medical expenses (except for the psychologist in this case).

* I wear mostly hand me downs.

* I am a CS major who for the longest time had two computers which were barely functioning (until I fixed them).


* My TV is older than I am (literally). 

My father on the other hand (who is acting really nice as of late), spends the most money in the family:

* He buys new cars.

* He bought new bass boat.

* He had a say in our house being way to big for a 3 person family.

* The year I wen to college he got tired of being my mothers secretary for 6 years and blew 50k on starting a new business.

My mother hardly gets to enjoy any of the lavish things he awarded himself.

I understand she works hard, but so do I, I am trying to make the most of myself given my circumstances. I do not spend lavishly or spend all that much of her money. 

She tries to act like a martyr when all of this was her decision in the first place:

* She could have not had unprotected sex/ aborted me if she didn't want to support/care for a child. Sometimes I wish she did.

* She didn't have to marry my father.

* She didn't have to move to the states and start from scratch (she had a medical degree and could have found enough work in Ukraine to comfortably support herself).

* She could say no to my dad.

* She could have bought a smaller house/less things.

**Now, since our argument she is acting really pissy, sighing every time she sees me/ignores me and she started chain smoking...again (up until last year she didn't smoke). She does this because it worries my dad/her friends and she gets attention and pity.**

**She has also procured the lovely habit of telling me ""this is just your adhd talking"" when I do something she doesn't like.**

I guess I am the horrible child, I think I always will be in her mind. My dad tries to mediate (does so much nicely), but it it more focused on my direction with ""why do you upset your mother like this"".

**But yeah, I think I don't care anymore, I feel numb to her, I think she may be right in that I don't love her. I Have 1.5 years left in college and once I am done I think I may cut ties (after paying her back for my education so that I don't feel like I owe her anything), at least if things stay this bad.**

She talks about how it is so easy for her to snap and lose interest, how I killed her spark...well congratulations mom, when attempting to get yours back you killed mine.

**It's sad to say I have a much healthier relationship with my father, who used to do most of the physical abuse, than I do with my mother.**

**Happy fucking mother's day.**

Sorry for the long rant, I really needed to vent.

**Side Note:** Lately my dad has been taking time out to sit and listen to my opinions. Although in a  really lame manner he attempted to apologize for his past actions: 

""Some things in our past suck, but if they weren't that way we wouldn't be the same people, it still doesn't make them less bad, but it's hard to judge."" It's lame but I consider this an apology because it's the closest to one my dad has ever said to almost anyone.

My dad also told me when I got my preliminary diagnosis:

""I am pretty sure I have the same thing (he has it worse), and I used it as an excuse to not do well. Please don't let this diagnosis stop you from being successful or happy.""

**TLDR: I don't think I love my emotionally abusive mother anymore.**

I bolded the highlights."

I will be working at an internship in Redwood City starting in a few weeks, but because I love the city life, I am going to live in San Francisco. I've got a sweet apartment on Lombard Street in Russian Hill. My commuting plan is to buy a scooter and ride to 4th St Caltrain, where I will take the bullet to work in the morning.

Does anyone have any advice regarding scooters in San Francisco, the commute, or anything really? I've got a few specific questions...

1) Do a lot of people ride scooters? Can you ride them in bike lanes? Can you lane split? My research says yes to both of these questions but I want to be sure.

2) Any things I should really look out for?

Looking forward to an awesome summer!"

I'm experienced with the python programming language, and I have experience with lots of internal and external modules/libraries.

I'm not looking specifically for a paid internship (although that would be nice), but what I'm really looking for is experience - something to put on my resume.

I've spent hours searching online, but I've come up with close to nothing that accepts students before college.

If you know of any related company nearby or that accepts remote internships, I would greatly appreciate it if you let me know."

I'm not sure if this is the right subreddit for this but, I'm a high school junior and i want to start learning to code so that i am ahead of the game when i get into college. My current computer is quite terrible and also i have to share it with my brother. I want to buy a laptop so i can use it without worrying about my brother screwing up a project i=I'm working on and also it'll be a bit of a motivator. So, what would you recommend i buy for general school work like essays, etc., e-mails, twitter and programming? My parents probably wont pay for me (they don't understand technology at all and think that the only purpose of a computer is for games, so if i ask them for a laptop they think i will play games non-stop and my grades will drop) so i have to pay myself. I might be doing an internship or summer job over the summer so ill have a little bit of money but nothing too much. Is there any laptop that is cheap and will get the work done? thank you in advance. 

TLDR: I am going to start learning to code and would like some recommendations for cheap laptops i can buy to get the work done."

Brought a half a liter of concentrated yeast slurry home from the brewery I intern at. Pitched it at about 75 degrees at 9pm last night after shaking up the corny to aerate. Its now 9am and there is no bubbling from the blow off.

The brewer I am interning under had mentioned that he pitched this yeast into his IPA (12bbl fermenter) on a wed and came back on a friday and there was no activity and he thought it had stalled but it had actually almost completely finished. Very vigorous yeast.

Is it possible it bubbled all night? Should I give it another day and check the gravity?

UPDATE: checked the gravity... its at .035 (4% abv)... so it took off but is certainly not done yet. I overpitched so I suspect its going to be at the estimated 6.5% within the next couple days. I will let it go 10-14 days, cold crash it, and transfer."
tjpy2,1,2012-05-12,"[UPDATE] Work permit to Canada from France : at a port of entry or at a mission? (please help if you can, pretty please...)",selbino,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/tjpy2/update_work_permit_to_canada_from_france_at_a/,"[Original post](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/rpfw0/work_permit_to_canada_from_france_at_a_port_of/).
So, this update may not interest everyone, but I think it might help people who come across the same problem.

First thing : the port of entry/mission is misleading. The mission is the embassy, the port of entry is the customs at the border/airport. And a detail : my internship is in Canada, not in Quebec. So maybe my experience would have been different if my internship was in Quebec.

If you want to carry out an internship in Canada, you have 2 choices, but the result is the same : a work permit. If it's your first time, or if you haven't used it before, you can go through the [IEC](http://www.dfait-maeci.gc.ca/canada-europa/france/jeunesse-youth/programme_mobilite-mobility_program-en.asp). I don't really understand what it does, but at the end, it allows you to get (if you can convince the immigration officer) a work permit. The second way to get a work permit, is to apply directly for [a work permit](http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/information/applications/work.asp). It's quicker, maybe it's not as clear as the IEC because the IEC is for students so it smooths things a bit, but it's a month quicker in my case. I sent the papers for my work permit April 4, I received the authorization for it May 9, and my flight was May 11. So it was a close one.

About the words. You may see work visa and then work permit. The work visa is the paper that they send you if your work permit request has been approved, and that you have to present to the immigration officer when you arrive in the country. After the officer agreed that you are legit, he delivers you the work permit. The work permit is the paper that you'll have while in Canada, and the work visa is the paper you'll have before. If you don't have a work visa, you won't have a work permit. It is also different from a visa, which is the thing that allows you to get in the country. France's citizens are not concerned by that, meaning you won't have to fill paperwork to apply for a visa before getting in the country. But if you want to work or carry out your internship, you must have a work visa before leaving France. Otherwise you're screwed.

I first thought that if you take a touristic visa and wait in Canada for you work visa to come, you can sort things out later : NO. You must have the work visa before landing in Canada. To sum it up : apply for a work permit if you're carrying out an internship in Canada, don't leave France before you have the work visa, and don't forget your universal adapter.

**TL;DR** : if you want to carry out an internship in Canada and you're from France, you must have an accepted request from the embassy, either for a work permit (in which case you will have a work visa) or from the IEC program (in which case you will have something, probably a work visa too) **before entering the country**. You also have to get a visa, but if you're French, you're not concerned by that paperwork.

**Protip** : when you arrive at the immigration office in the airport with your work visa, you have to wait in line. The waiting time depends on how many people are before you, and how many officers are there. In my case, there was about 10 people before me, and 3 officers. I waited for an hour, so be prepared to wait. Also, get your luggage first, that way you won't freak out if you come out of the immigration office 4 hours after, and you can't find your stuff 'cause it has been dispatched somewhere to wait for you but you don't know where...

And sorry for all the grammar mistakes..."

tjb9k,0,2012-05-12,Questions and concerns about moving to California for school,BrewerHimself,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/tjb9k/questions_and_concerns_about_moving_to_california/,"I’m 19, I did 2 years of university (with little success) in Canada, and I’m battling the decision of whether I want to go back to school or not. The way I see it, I have 3 options:

 - Don’t go back to school. Work a steady job making a decent living until I manage to get a job as a software developer. 
 - Go to a community college here in Florida and eventually transfer to a university to complete my computer science degree.
 - Move to California (in the Bay Area) and attend community college there, eventually transferring to a UC school to complete my computer science degree. 

Each of these options has its own merits in my opinion:

 - The decision to not go back to school would allow me to work full time, make a decent living, and focus on becoming a better programmer. The downside would be the difficulty that I would have finding a job for lack of a formal post-secondary education.
 - Staying here in Florida means I would qualify for in-state tuition, which would make things cheaper for me. I’d be near my mom if I needed any help and I’d get to continue to live at the beach. On the flip side, there isn’t a huge software industry where I’m at. I have yet to meet anyone who shares my passion for developing software and this can make it hard to stay motivated.
 - Moving to the valley would put me in a place where I can meet many like-minded people who share my enthusiasm and passion for technology. Graduating from a CCC would guarantee me a spot in a number of UC schools -- with the exception of Berkeley and UCLA, I believe. The only thing stopping me from doing this is that I would have to pay out-of-state tuition and I honestly don’t know if I could afford to do that. I already have $30,000 in student loans.

If I had my pick, I would move to California. I feel a need to be in the hub where everyone is doing things that are interesting and cool. The computer science programs are larger in California and the school I would end up at if I stayed in Florida (University of Florida) is making a major change to its computer science program that appears to be for the worse. 

Here are a few questions I would be grateful for if someone could address:

 - Obviously, the major issue is money. I could probably save $5,000+ if I took a year off before moving to the Valley, but that would only go so far. My cost-of-attendance for a CCC is approx $22,000 and I think I’m eligible for ~$7,000 in need-based scholarships and grants. That leaves about $15,000 that I would need to somehow come up with. What are my options? I know of Stafford loans and I’d be willing to take out the most I can if it means getting a fantastic education and being in a prime networking spot, but what else can I do?
 - Are there many part-time jobs for computer science students in California? The minimum wage is $8/hr -- just under $1,300/mn before taxes. That would barely be enough to live on here and the rent in San Francisco is significantly higher. If I move then I want to be able to make it on my own. What are my options here? Are there software firms that employ students part-time during the school year (internships included)?
 - In your opinion, would moving to California for school be a good idea, seeing as I want to start my career in the Valley? Opinions backed by experience will certainly carry the most weight here.

I have a real passion for software and I want to be around people who share these feelings, which is not something readily available where I am now. I’m open to any additional thoughts, concerns, or tips that r/cscareerquestions has to offer."

Most of me thinks I wont do anything, but part of me thinks I might, considering I have been suicidal in the past, and that I just really don't seem to care about anything the past few months.

My ex-girlfriend (who I am still uncontrollably in love with still) stopped having feelings for me though she wishes she still could.  I am to weak to stop seeing her and I still help her in every way I can because I know she has had a hard enough life already and I still want to help.  Ever since then I get more and more pissed at myself for not letting go, and I can't go to her about it because she feels guilty for not having feelings for me anymore.

I have a lousy paying job that was my fall back job since my internship didn't turn into a full job.  I now work at a university and I am seeing everyone graduate with jobs lined up.

I am friends with lots of students that are co-workers but they are all leaving because they are graduating and are set up with better jobs than I have.

My parents think I am doing well but I barely make enough to make my car payments and keep the roof over my head.

Almost everything computer related I use belongs to work so if I were to leave I'd have to give back thousands of dollars worth of equipment and go back to using old stuff...

and I feel guilty for even posting on here because I know my life really isn't *that* bad but I just really am depressed with it and don't really want it at all.  My goals are not going to be met (having a family and a well paying job) and if I can't meet my goals then I just don't know why I would try to keep going at all...




Edit: I should also mention the ex-girlfriend is sleeping downstairs after I helped her move out of her apartment and she has no place to stay for two days... the fact that she is here is helping me not run downstairs into the kitchen and grab a knife... but I'm not sure what Tomorrow has in store after she leaves.

I love it, except it means I'll be graduating 1.5 years later than I originally planned (and wayyyy higher fees!). The job opportunities with a CS degree sound great, but if I keep going on my current path, I'll be graduating with only about ~4 months of CS-related experience (and since i haven't found an internship yet for the summer, that's not a guarantee).

From what I've heard, the PEY internship sounds like a great opportunity get some experience and make $$, but I'm wondering if it's worth it to add yet another year to my program. 

Any advice? What's more important in CS - getting a degree ASAP or getting experience? Will getting a Masters help me get a better job instead?"

I fully understand the issue with making myself financially responsible for my work, which is why I think a summer internship would be perfect. I just need an idea as to what companies offer these types of internships. I live in a suburb of Columbus, Ohio so companies close to there would be best.

That being said, I have done paid work for a college student in the past (his class assignment, it was a great learning experience for me) and it was quite enjoyable. If anybody knows of a site that deals with this kind of work then I would love to know about it.

1. Brown leather dress shoe that can be worn both bus cas and bus prof.
2. Leather soles: I hate the squeaking of rubber soles and I like the clicking of a leather sole.
3. Round front with no cap toe. (I think this will help the shoe double as casual and professional)
4. Brown (obviously) I kinda wish the shoe color linked below was an even lighter brown.
5. Affordable price: I'm a college student trying to look good at my internship this summer; therefore, I am certainly a price sensitive individual.
6. Speaking of internship, it's in the banking industry which (for those who don't know) is probably the most conservative industry there is.

With those things in mind, here's what I found (below).  I would appreciate feedback and alternative suggestions.  From how they look in the pictures, the only thing I can think that I would change is the color to a less dark brown.

tlam4,5,2012-05-13,After a serious depression episode I owe my college money and can't finish my degree. Can anyone help me?,fuzzyferret,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/tlam4/after_a_serious_depression_episode_i_owe_my/,"**Tl;dr I was a college student with undiagnosed ADHD and Major Depressive Disorder. I finally snapped my senior year and had to spend a week in a mental hospital. My school refused to waive my tuition even though I filed a medical withdrawal and now I don't know how to pay them back.**

**So I'm looking for advice on types of jobs to look into, as well as special grants for individuals in my situation?**

I started college undiagnosed as ADHD or MDD, two years into my degree I finally found out about my ADHD and was able to get treatment to help me do better in classes. After my third year I had a cumulative 2.98 GPA and was doing very well in my senior year courses. The pressure of such a difficult major, taking 16 hours which included a pretty intense optical physics lab, working, trying to do research, and a difficult home life finally built up until it was too much to handle. I ended up having a pretty serious breakdown and had to be checked into a mental hospital at which point my MDD was diagnosed.

After filing for a medical withdrawal, the school informed me that I was too late in having my mental breakdown to get any of my tuition waived so I now owe the school the full cost of tuition for a semester before I'm allowed to continue college. So I started working for my fathers company doing home remodeling which I've done since I was pretty young. It was going pretty well and I even landed an internship with a financial company. After my internship I went back to work with my father and relatively quickly after that was involved in an incident at a bar that left me unable to work for a month. Not having income for a month along with paying medical costs took up most of the money I had been able to build up and left me back at square one. Now my fathers business is floundering, we haven't seen many jobs at all recently. He owes me a significant amount of back pay because he has been trying to keep us from losing our house.

On top of all this my mother suffers from an extreme case of bipolar disorder and continually steals money from the household for her own use. So any money that I could potentially use to pay off the school goes toward her 20$+ lunches with friends. My father is extremely unhappy and has no one to talk to about it so he talks to me. I'm not sure why I'm including this except for the fact that it makes me miserable and I have no one to talk to about it. In any case it creates a very difficult situation living at home with them and I would move out if it weren't for all of the trouble I'm already facing financially.

I have two goals at the moment which are to find a new job and move out of the house. My only problem is that these are pretty damn difficult when you don't have much work experience, or a degree. What options do I have? I've been thinking about joining the military, trying to get a job in the field on an oil rig, or going to Afghanistan/Iraq as a civilian contractor.

I have a pretty extensive computer background in scripting, programming, and Linux; but I've been told by a couple prospective employers that my background doesn't count for anything unless it was attained through a company so that I have 2+ years of on the job experience.

Please any possible options are welcome, I just want to go back to school and finish playing with numbers so I can get my degree and start my life.

* I'm trying to find internships around my city (Atlanta, GA), but I'm having very little luck so far. I tried through my school's job finder network, but none of the positions appeal to me. Does anyone know of a good internship search portal for engineering related jobs? Or is your company currently hiring interns? I'm not picky about pay, I'm mainly in this for the experience.

* My cumulative GPA is abysmally low (2.2), thanks to screwing around in my freshman year. Is it possible to just put my Engineering GPA on my resume as that's much higher? If so, what subjects should I include when calculating my GPA? Should I include Physics I,II, Chemistry etc. or just Engineering and Math classes?

* I would rather try for an internship instate, but if I get one out of state, is it common for companies to reimburse me for room and board, food etc.?

* Most companies I've looked at require cumulative GPA's of 3.5+. Should I just apply anyway to these companies? These are big companies though. Is it true that smaller companies have less stringent requirements? If so, how do I find these companies to send my resume to? I've had no luck with job search portals. 

Sorry if I sound clueless, this is my first time applying for an internship, so any help would be appreciated!"

University A: I had a low GPA ~ 3.0 goofed off a lot and eventually got expelled for a prank I pulled on another student (Nothing physical, posted his number on CL for casual encounters). I managed to transfer to another university the next semester.

University B: (Sophomore year-until graduation 2013) I currently attend a large state university in the midwest. We are known for our strength in sciences and engineering. 

GPA: Overall: 3.75 Major: ~ 3.8-9 I have so far one year of research experience and continuing. Scored a HHMI internship this summer. Student editor for an university undergraduate peer reviewed academic journal. I know how to code etc. etc.

So I learned that when I apply to graduate schools next semester they will require me to submit transcripts from ALL postsecondary schools. In addition, I learned that University A will put expulsion on my transcript. 

I really want to attend a very good graduate program. I have friends with current credentials like mine and they managed to get into top ranked programs. 

What are my chances? Should I include a letter in my application explaining that the incident was a meer prank and I matured a lot since then? My record is obviously evident. I'm just worried.

We've had to do long distance before through periods of our relationship and we got through it then. The thing is that we'll be apart for her birthday, and I'm worried it will be awful for her since she's living by herself in a city where she doesn't know anyone. She's never been that much into her birthday, but I want to try to do something to make it special for her. 

What can I do from so far away? The catch is that I already gave her a present before she left and she told me not to spend any more money (since I bought a plane ticket to see her next month as well). I'm willing to bend that rule a little though.

I just finished my junior year in chemical engineering at an ABET-accredited, mid-ranked university and I can't help but think I made a bad career choice. I have a 3.7 GPA, and I've been doing research as an undergraduate for over a year. I love what I do both academically in classes and what I do in my research. Unfortunately, I can't stay in academia forever, and I will need to get a real job someday.  


This is where I'm worried. I applied for well over 100 summer internship positions (I live in an area known for high employment in chemical engineering), and this netted me a grand total of 2 interviews. The interviews I got both went very well, the hiring managers seemed impressed with my experience, and they both rejected me. They did, however, invite me to inquire about permanent positions when I graduate. It seems competition for internships is just incredibly fierce. 


I'm very worried I won't be able to find a job when I graduate. Of the five people I know who graduated from my program, none of them have been able to find a related job. One is working as a telemarketer, another went to graduate school, and the rest are working retail. I see myself heading down the same path. I'm no better qualified than they are.


I have no family working in engineering to use for connections (this is how most of my friends who found an internship found one), but I do have quite a few professional connections from doing undergraduate research. Ironically, the interviews I DID get were from random ads I found on the internet.


It's my junior year and it certainly looks like I'm going to be graduating without an internship. I'll have another year of undergraduate research when I graduate, but I imagine I'll be at a huge disadvantage without any industry experience.  It's really going to be sad if I spent four years of my life studying a field I'll never be able to enter. I honestly think I should have gone to a trade school sometimes. 


So, successful engineers: How did you get your foot in the door? It seems that I need experience to get a job, but university experience isn't enough. But I need a job to get experience. Any suggestions? "

tmxpn,6,2012-05-14,Finding balance between work/life &amp; quality/quantity,Mogglez,work,https://www.reddit.com/r/work/comments/tmxpn/finding_balance_between_worklife_qualityquantity/,"I'm not sure if this is correct subreddit to post in (if you know somewhere else where it'd be more fitting to post it, do suggest where), but there's something I'd like to talk about for a bit... or something that I'm wondering about. I'm sorry if this becomes a bit too rambly. **Read the TL;DR at the bottom **

I'm 20 years old and just now got an internship at a store (which hopefully - if I do well - is going to get me an actual employment at said store). Right now I'm working 8 hours a day, without a one hour lunch added in there on top of that. So 9 hours where I'm at the job. Then there's travel time on top of that, to and from the job. Additionally there is also that bit of margin where you wait for the bus, or those few minutes you get to work early or stay a few minutes late.

All this adds up to around 10-11 hours for me. 10-11 hours of the day that I'm pretty much locked up. With 8 hours of sleep every night (without that I'm a wreck) there are 5-6 hours left to do what I want on my free time, not to mention the time that I have to shower, shave, eat, poop, all that jazz. So my question I guess is a matter of quantity vs quality. Now, as this thing that I've got is an internship I'm working without pay. This is also a job that I wouldn't exactly see myself doing for the rest of my life, if you know what I mean... so those two things make these 8 working hours seem much worse than they necessarily should have to. 

But I guess what I'm saying is that I'm almost terrified and very put off that I have to sacrifice more than 70% of my life (counting the necessities) to make the remaining amount of it enjoyable or even bearable. I'm afraid that I'm being far too idealistic in that I'm thinking ""This can't be reasonable"".

Maybe this is a phase of my still passing adolescence, but it truly scares me. I feel somewhat spoiled when I say that this also is my first actual time working full hours... or even having somewhat of a regular job. and the idea that this is what I'm going to do for the rest of my life when I eventually settle for something scares me.

My more logical side tells me that this is what I feel because of several things. Some of these several things being:

* I'm not yet earning money, which makes the time I'm spending at work now feel somewhat meaningless. This will however change in about 2-3 weeks when my internship is over.

* This is not the place I will be working all my life, hopefully. I'm planning on studying later and getting a job that I will feel fits me better. A job that hopefully I will enjoy doing (not always, but enough to feel that it's not a waste a time or JUST a means of getting me money).

* I'm also not yet simply used to working this much, because I've never done it before. Once I get into the rhythm I won't think about it too much.

I think all of these three things are true. But I'm still not sure that (with above things considered) working such a vast amount of time is worth it in an ideal world. But obviously we are not living in an ideal world. To me it comes down it all being a trade-off between quality and quantity. Do I want a lot of free time? Then I won't have a lot of money or freedom in what I can do with my free time. Do I want to use my free time the way I see fit? Do I want to live comfortably? Then I need to put into those hours of work to make that happen. It feels very much either-or.

Another thing that worries me is that I'm very much a ""time optimist"" so to speak. I like to take my time doing things, just do things at my own pace. Do it calmly, without worrying about the time. The effect that attitude currently has on me is that I end up doing very little in the few hours of spare time that I have each day after work. I'm not the type to say ""I'm now going to sit down and focus on this one thing for an hour or two (perhaps a video game) and then go on to the next thing that I would like to do."". I feel like a sort of jack of all trades when it comes to spending my time. I distribute my time to doing so many things half-assed that at the end of the day I haven't really done anything or achieved anything. Granted, this is a problem with me and not with culture or society... but this in combination with a full time job, again, just scares me.

I guess I could go on forever. But what are your thoughts on this? How do you deal with balancing your work and free time? How do you feel about the idea of quantity vs quality? Is there a reasonable compromise or balance between the two that is both good and realistic as opposed to just idealistic?

**TL;DR:** I'm feeling uncomfortable and scared over the idea of spending a majority of my wake time on work(mainly this, I guess)/transport/eating/pooping/cleaning/waiting, leaving me with I would consider an underwhelming remaining amount of time left to do with as I please. I understand that I need to work in order to achieve a sort of freedom, the ability to choose where and how to live, what and how to eat, what material entertainment to get (games, music, movies, etc)... but it's still very off-putting to me, to use up a majority of your life just that I can enjoy the remaining little bit that is left.

**I guess I could go on forever. But what are your thoughts on this? How do you deal with balancing your work and free time? How do you feel about the idea of quantity vs quality?

I haven't signed the employee contract which is basically agreeing to take a drug test and follow their terms of employment. So I can still decide that I don't want to accept the extension and quit without any long term consequences. The downfall to that is I lose a well paying job gaining experience, as I have to ind somewhere new to live by the 30th due to unrelated issues. If I accept the employee contract, I'll have a few days to a week maybe (just guessing), before I have to pass a test.  I don't know anything about the test, and I've never had to fake one before. If I fail it could ruin my daughter and I's future, because I had to get government clearance for the job, and it's through my school.

I made friends among the other kids in the Honors program, but tried to keep my distance because I knew I was probably transferring.  I got particularly close to one girl specifically.  Too close.  I started to have feelings for her, which was not acceptable because she had a boyfriend (long-distance), and I was still happy with my current relationship.  So I backed off and avoided her for most of the year.

Flash forward a few months, it's close to the end of the school year and things are still great with my SO, but I have severe chronic migraines that are getting out of control.  So I start taking this daily medication, topiramate, that is supposed to manage them.  Unfortunately, the side effects really start messing with me.  I start noticing mood swings, trouble concentrating, loss of problem-solving abilities and communication skills, and things like that.  Since maintaining a long distance relationship is all about communication, the meds turn me into a terrible boyfriend, and my distraught girlfriend tells me that I need to stop taking the medication and go back to being there for her or she'll stop talking to me.

Now this is a problem, because I can't stop taking the medication, I need it in order to keep the migraines away.  At one point, before I started taking the meds, I was getting migraines three times a week that put me in bed for up to six hours, writhing with pain.  It upsets me that she would want me to go back to that for her, and I told her I couldn't do it.  We haven't talked since then, but this was kind of the straw that broke the camel's back: I decided to end it with her.

After I made that decision, my whole plan came crashing down.  I'm not sure if I want to transfer anymore, I would have to start over with new doctors and professors who don't understand my condition, and I would have to try to join or form a new friend group as a sophomore.  My friends in Oregon have been really supportive, too, and leaving them would be hell.  To make matters worse, my feelings for my friend had just gotten more intense and I decided to confront her about it before I left for the summer.

We went for a walk together on one of our last nights there, and I told her everything.  She saw it coming, even pushed me to come out with it, but after I told her it became apparent that she was just as conflicted as I was.  She told me she wasn't ready to break up with her boyfriend for me, but she did admit that she had feelings for me, which I had sensed.  After we talked, I was surprised how easy it was to still be friends with her like nothing had changed.  When we went home a few days later, we still texted all the time, but she didn't want me to compliment her because it messed with her head too much and she felt guilty.

Two days ago things came to a head, I got fed up with having to set up rules for our friendship.  I told her that the reason I came clean with her was so that I could stop pretending, and if I couldn't be myself with her then it would be better to not talk at all.  She agreed and we haven't talked since.

I'm not sure what to do, I lost my best friend and my girlfriend within a week of each other.  My girlfriend just got home from school last night, and I'm going over there in a few hours to end it for good (I think).  Once she's out of the picture I will have a lot more free time on my hands, and I don't have any job or internship lined up for the summer.

My question for reddit is this: should I renew my WoW subscription or my SWTOR one??

**EDIT**: TL;DR I'm breaking up with my girlfriend and I want to know which video game I should start playing."
tltw3,5,2012-05-13,Low CS grades. How do I boost them and get other things to put on resume?,thr0wup,berkeley,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/tltw3/low_cs_grades_how_do_i_boost_them_and_get_other/,"Hey /r/berkeley, so CS grades just came out for CS61B, and... I did much worse than I thought I would. I got a C+, thinking that I'd at least be capable of getting a B+.

Realistically, I know I should have done more practice tests, asked the TA's for help, et cetera, and I've thought this over several times. I've resolved to go to office hours more often and start studying ahead of time. I've quit most of my extracurriculars, so next semester I can have more study time. I've already started learning 61C material. Okay.

The problem is, my grades are generally pretty bad. My technical GPA is sub-3.0, though my overall GPA hovers around 3.1- this is mainly because my other major is fairly easy and has been pulling them up. 

I only started studying CS once I entered Berkeley, but I feel like this isn't a valid excuse, as there seem to be plenty of people who are the same and have much higher grades. In CS61A, I also did every single project solo and got over 90% on all of them- yet I still got a B in that class- and low grades in all the other prerequisites. I love CS, but I keep doing ""badly""- and that low self-confidence makes it very hard to believe that I can succeed in this field. 

I am also currently a sophomore- I spent last summer taking classes, and I'm already enrolled in CS61C for the summer. I have two jobs, but one is IT support, the other is design-related. So /r/berkeley CS majors, given this information, should I quit CS while I can? If not...

1) How can I boost my understanding of CS and my GPA? 

2) How (and should I) to start applying for research?

3) How do I apply to my first programming-related internship?

4) Should I go to Hackathons? Do I even stand a chance?"

However, we had a final project which counted as 40 percent of the grade, I finished it early but the class wanted an extension, so the professor pushed to the end of the semester. My program for the final project didn't work correctly as the prof expected and I only knew this after submitting it; since I got a 0. I ended up with a C+ in the course, do you think I can explain this when I'm looking for an internship next summer?  Or does this story sound like b.s.
I honestly understand the course completely, just the prof decided to be a douche and give me a 0. When I contacted him, he said it was too late as the grades have been submitted and finalized.
Just looking for thoughts from people on here who employ undergrad students as interns.

tom14,7,2012-05-15,Career change?,Luxas89,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/tom14/career_change/,"Hi everyone,

I've been searching for finance work for the past year, but it just hasn't panned out at all. I'm thinking about changing my career objectives because I guess I'm just not cut out to make it in finance. 

Here's some background on me. I'd really appreciate some advice about what I should pursue now.

I graduated from a top 50 school with a BA in Economics(we didn't have a finance major, so all finance courses were taught by the economics department) and a minor in Math back in June 2011. I was able to graduate with distinction. 

After moving back with my parents, I started to work on the CFA program. It's honestly helped me a lot more than I expected (I'm talking getting 0 interviews to an average of about 1-2 interviews a week, but I usually don't make it past the phone interview). 

I held an internship at a tiny publicly-traded biomedical company as a finance/accounting intern. I could honestly say that this was my dream job in internship form. At first the work wasn't too amazing- I was helping them prepare for internal audits, doing some editing to their 10-Q's and some other clerical work. However, after my boss saw what I could do and after we had discussed my career objectives, they allowed me  to contribute to the firm's strategic development by allowing me to do data and financial statement analysis. I guess I managed to make a pretty good impression while working on those projects because they eventually allowed me to do some preliminary research and analysis of their potential acquisitions. 

I've also held a few leadership roles within a couple of the extracurricular activities I participated in at my school. 

Given the ridiculous amount of free time I have, I also taught myself some basic SQL, C, JavaScript, VBA, and Access.

With that in mind, I would really appreciate some guidance as to what I should do. I'd really like to work in some kind of analytical role (my sales skills are obviously not very well developed lol).

togf6,43,2012-05-15,My story of Academic Suspension to Dean's List,frenchybrown,GetMotivated,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/comments/togf6/my_story_of_academic_suspension_to_deans_list/,"Well I came into college from highschool with a sweet scholarship and other financial aid leaving me to only have to pay $4,000 of my $40,000 plus private University (provided I maintained a 3.0). I was in the top 15% of incoming freshman for GPA and ACT score. I also had gotten used to just coasting by on my good test taking skills and quick learning like I did in high school, spoiler it doesn't work in college. 

1st Semester I slacked off a lot, turned in A papers 2weeks late and got D's on them (seriously it would say ~~A~~ Late:D) why on earth did I think that was okay? Anyways I got a 1.92 GPA and an Academic Warning and Probation. As this was my first experience with this, I didn't take it seriously.

2nd Semester I did even worse, deciding not to turn in one of my final papers because ""I was on vacation and didn't feel like it"". Anyways 1.74 GPA and a letter over the summer gave me Academic Suspension. I appealed this and through a solid letter of reference from one of my college profs (who basically said I was smart but lazy) and a letter of my own, as well as pleading my case to a member of the academic counseling board. I got off and was able to attend again in the Fall.

My Sophomore year I worked at a moving company and a Bank for 30 hrs or so a week and maintained a courseload of 1 fewer class, each semester, average GPA :3.3! So I was thinking I'm fine, I turned it around; I was wrong. Over the summer I received a letter saying my cumulative GPA was below my requirement for scholarship (like 2.5 or so). I appealed this through a strong letter and my improved Academic performance, I again cheated failure. If I had lost this scholarship my college days would've been over.

Finally this year, in the fall I did fine 3.3 or so, but this semester I absolutely killed it, I'm looking at around a 3.7 or so and the Dean's list. Nothing is final yet, but simply the fact that I'm still here and I'm finally performing makes me so proud. When I think back on how many close calls I've had, it really scares me to think how this could have all come to an end. I'm still struggling to come back from that horrid year, internships look down on my GPA, I can't get into the honor society for my major (I have a high enough major GPA, but not cumulative) and a lot of extended family still give me shit like ""Oh frenchybrown, do you still have your scholarship?"" ""Yeah, you know perfectly well I do"". I'm learning you can't let anyone else determine what you do or how you perform. I did well this year because I decided that school is too important to dick around with.

Anyways, sorry this got so long, I really wanted to get this off my chest today. I feel so proud of myself and hopeful for the future, but still realize I have a lot of work to do still.

To all you incoming freshman, holy shit take it seriously! yes you will have a ton of friends, free time and new opportunities at your disposal, remember what you are there for. Work hard and play hard, don't play xbox for hours and then blow off homework, that is the stupidest thing you could possibly do. This is the time when you find out who you are and prove yourself, to others and to yourself. Take this shit seriously, you have no idea how many opportunities you can create for yourself at college. Get involved, go to bed tired, because you accomplished so much during the day, not because it's 4 am and you stayed up all night on reddit. I know if someone had told me all this 2yrs ago it would've been in one ear and out the other, but you are different and you can be whoever you make of yourself (good or bad).

tl;dr I almost got kicked out of college two years ago, but instead I made the dean's list this year"
todnq,2,2012-05-15,Two internships at once: should I do it for the experience vs. the money?,InternExp,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/todnq/two_internships_at_once_should_i_do_it_for_the/,"I am out of school and currently doing a marketing internship with a small-ish software company. I applied to another internship at a bigger software company with the mentality of ""because why not?""

The problem is that the bigger company pays slightly less per hour (as in, $2 less) than my current company. Here are my concerns:

* I don't think it's looked favorably upon by recruiters (nor does it make sense) to take a lesser-paying job than the one you currently have. Maybe it's different in this economy, but I personally believe that you shouldn't set a precedent of a downward pay trend, only upward.
* I feel like I am already considered a good candidate for a full-time regular position at my current company (my internship is almost officially over), though a job offer is not *guaranteed*. But as of now, I'm doing full-time hours at my company as an intern.
* I will have to dedicate half my time to getting paid a lower rate. Paying rent and student loans is already difficult enough.

Pros:

* The experience. I believe being able to say I did two internships at two different software companies at once may get me an even better job and higher starting pay at an even more prominent software company down the road.
* The bigger company has more stability (hence, it's bigger and more widely known). Looking at glassdoor.com, it seems that all of their department heads, including marketing, make good six-figure salaries. Their regular employees are paid very competitively, too.

Do you guys think I have any room to haggle? I don't think internship rates are very negotiable, but I may be wrong. I'll obviously ask about long-term potential, but assuming that they do say, ""Yes, there is a possibility that we may hire you down the road should we find that you're a good fit,"" would you take the internship at a lower rate?"

[This story](http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/tn7c2/my_computer_is_acting_weird/) reminded me of something I saw a couple of years ago:

I was an intern at a shipping company, helping their IT-techs. A user complained about ""my Word"" some times writing incoherent stuff without him even touching the keyboard. This sounds like awesome bullshit, so I went to check it out =P

I sit down at his desk, bring up a Word document and wait. To my surprise it actually started typing! At first it seemed like random letters, punctuation and spaces, but after a while I could see a pattern, and distinguish some words. The thought that this was devils work actually crossed my mind.

I start reading the ""text"", making out what it MIGHT be about, stand up and ask the users coworkers if anybody had been typing something similar. Turns out, a woman just 2 meters away had! I tell her to write certain things, and sure enough some of the letters and special characters show up O.O What the hell is going on?

I call my supervisor there, explains the situation and he just laughs, points to the keyboards and says ""Bluetooth. Her keyboard is overriding his."" I thought this was hillarious, but we did a recalibration of the keyboards or something like that and then it worked fine.

In January I left a secure job to pursue an internship that would finish my degree. It was understood that it would be a 4 mnth internship and at the end they would decide whether or not to hire me.  Well it ends next week and almost positive I will not be hired. I have called the labor force and explained my situation. That they do not have a position for me and will be jobless in a week. Since, I worked all last year and quite for a paid internship they informed me I would qualify for unemployment. However, the only problem is that they are working me everyday pretty much, with no days off. I need to go for a job interview. I have met my school hours. I am basically there to finish my contract. I know they will not let me off for the interview. Will this ruin my chance of getting unemployment if I call out sick? It will not hurt my graduation. I live in Florida.  It is a well established corporation. Can they contest my unemployment if I call out? Any help or previous experience will help me much! I am not one to sit around, I want to work. ASAP."

Or do they?

I'm about to enter a 2 year degree for Linguistics because I like it so much, but I've recently been very interested in computers, especially in Networking. I've completed all my courses I need for Linguistics, but if I wanna have either CS or CEN as my major, it would take me years to do it all over again, and I 1. don't wanna waste that time 2. my parents will soon expect my to find a job and move out.

I'm studying for my A+ right now so I can learn everything from the root, which the book really intrigued me into computers in general, I want to go then towards my Network+ Security+ Microsoft Certified (can't remember the name) + and finally my CCNA and CCNP and by then I have worked in the field of computers after the A+ like at Geek Squad or CompUSA, I want to eventually work for Cisco one day as an intern and try to apply for jobs abroad like South America, Japan, Europe, Dubai, I speak a handful of languages that I taught myself and took some in college, I'm self-studying the A+ right now, same with the rest in the future hopefully.

I'd really appreciate your advice. Thanks."
tph5g,6,2012-05-16,Dressing casual at an office as a college intern.,mercury14,malefashionadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/tph5g/dressing_casual_at_an_office_as_a_college_intern/,"Hello MFA,

This summer I start an internship that will last for about a year.  According to the director, the dress is fairly casual with nice jeans/khakis and collared shirts like polos or button ups.  Bottoms I got covered, but it's tops and shoes I need help with.

Being in college, I don't have too huge of a budget.  Preferably want to spend less than $60 for a button up shirt and definitely less than $100 for shoes.  I plan on taking advantage of Memorial Day sales that should be happening next week.  

What stores should I check out for slim fitting shirts/polos?  

What patterns, if any, would be acceptable in an office setting? 

What colors would be the most versatile?

I honestly have no idea as far as shoes.  I was thinking of getting a pair of brown boots when fall gets closer.

I'm not sure if I missed anything, but all tips and suggestions are helpful!

Thanks!

tpfox,1,2012-05-16,recent college grad unemployed and hopeless,[deleted],college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/tpfox/recent_college_grad_unemployed_and_hopeless/,"Hi. I was inspired by a previous reddit thread (http://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/nxdzz/im_not_as_smart_as_i_thought_i_was/) which prompted me to write this. 

I graduated last year from a prestigious university with a major in natural science degree. I came back to home in Asia, and have been searching for jobs since without much progress. I was the student who struggled as a freshman and continued to struggle (as described in the link). I almost failed to graduate. Now I have been unemployed for a year and I don't see things getting better.

The main reasons are:
1) I have no work experience
2) I have low GPA, about 2.28 out of 4.0-- since I am trying to get hired in my country, where GPA is one of the most, if not the most important component in the job application

Looking back, my biggest mistake was pursuing my major. I found college to be a gigantic leap from high school; I was simply not prepared for the amount of work and work efficiency as required by my science courses. And despite tremendous effort, I failed to adapt. But for one reason or another, mainly because I was being stubborn and didn't want to give up, and perhaps because then I didn't know what was right for me (and how relevant to professional life college major was), I still pursued my major. As a result, my confidence was completely shattered by my freshmen year. During my four years, I was always struggling and always unhappy inside (as I was not able to share this with my friends). I was always behind with homework, always stressed out and always struggling to catch-up. But my main priority has always been academics and I truly enjoy learning and studying, which made the matters worse. I never figured my way out of my disastrous first year cycle. I have produced some good works, but was never able to manage multiple courses on time. I was also unable to pursue some courses that truly interested me.

Up until graduation I invested all my energy in catching-up and fulfilling minimum requirements, I didn't get a chance to really think about post-graduation life, until after graduation. Now that I'm back home, with my college years that were largely wasted, I have spent months trying to figure out what I want to do, when there is no way for me to really know because I have no experience. 

I am bit down, because all my friends are well employed or pursuing a degree. Most know what they want to do and have an industry/ area of interest. I lost contact with many of my friends. They would ask what I'm doing and what my plans are. I'm embarrassed to reach out. I'm embarrassed for my parents who invested in my college education.  

I really want to gain work experience (perhaps through internship). I had hopes up that if I truly work hard and wisely (treating my college failure as a learning experience that made me prudent and stronger person), although it will take me time to re-build my life, that eventually I can become the person I aspire to be. However, I'm stuck with my job search-- I know I should start networking more. I have applied to some jobs, called up one alum and few hiring managers, bought few books for help, and I look on job sites everyday. But in the end I don't have a presentable resume to substantiate my ability to work hard, and no specialty that is in demand by the job market. I think I don't know how to find a job and how to get hired in this competitive job market.

Does anybody have any advice for me?

P.S. My thoughts might be bit disorganized, as I didn't get a chance to really organize the edit. Thanks for reading!"
tpfh4,1,2012-05-15,"Failed core EE classes this semester, everything else 4.0...looking for advice",[deleted],EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/tpfh4/failed_core_ee_classes_this_semester_everything/,"I see a lot of questions like this, asking ""I just failed class x, what should I do?"" and people give answers like ""dont give up, just retake it, it's just one extra semester."" And I hear that, but I believe my situation is a little different:

I'm entering Sophomore year as an honor student at Arizona State University in EE, I just scored an Internship at Intel and I have a good resume with extensive off campus projects, published articles, etc...I have been pretty confident with my classes freshman year. Well I just got my grades from my last finals and I failed Everything minus Calculus II and Engineering Science 103 which I got A's in. 

The reason I failed the classes was I got extremely sick around midterms, which was too late to get my money back on my classes and drop them...so I stuck it out and missed a week and a half of classes, but fought through and learned the material, but couldn't make up all my grades.

Will ""D"" grades replaced with A's be ignored on my transcript? Or do you think I have butchered my transcript? It looks awful....all A's and then BAM a spew of D's :( 

Give me advice on how to fight this please."
tpezm,3,2012-05-15,"I have to live with a friend who appears to be jealous of my relationship this summer, with my bf in the same neighborhood and visiting often.  How should I navigate the situation?",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/tpezm/i_have_to_live_with_a_friend_who_appears_to_be/,"I am a 20-year-old female college sophomore and part of a tight-knit group of about 7 friends within my dorm, including my boyfriend (M, 20... for the sake of anonymity we'll call him James) and a mutual friend of ours (F, 21, we'll call her Katie).  My boyfriend and I have been together officially for 7 months now, but have clearly been interested in one another for a little over a year.  I have been a member of this group of friends since I arrived at college and before my now-boyfriend and I began to develop interest in one another.  

Katie and I always got along really well until I began to become interested in my boyfriend.  At that point, the amount of time she spent with James started to worry me.  I was sure that he was interested in me until he and Katie would spend hours at a time together, usually instigated by Katie.  I worried that she might have a crush on him, further complicating my feelings toward James, since I didn't want to hurt my friend.  However, we had a heart-to-heart conversation over the summer before James and I started dating, in which I told her about my feelings for James and she subsequently made it clear that she was actually interested in James's best friend, Will.  She had told him of these feelings a few months before without my knowledge and essentially been rejected.  In my mind, this freed up the path for James and I to get together.  So far, our relationship has been great.

However, since James and I have been dating, Katie has shown signs of jealousy.  I know that she has problems at home, although I don't know exactly what they are.  I also know that she confides in James with help in coping with these problems, which doesn't bother me at all, since James is a good listener and helps to keep her grounded (she has anxiety issues and he is good at calming her down).   However, she often comes into the room when we are together, ignores me altogether, and tells James that they need to talk, planning walks together and other outings.  This wouldn't bother me in itself, but the way in which she ignores me and talks only to him is frankly annoying and hurtful, especially because I essentially asked for her permission before dating James and she expressed her happiness for me when we first became a couple.

She is abroad this semester and posted an article about friendships between men and women on my Facebook wall, in which the conclusion that was reached was essentially: ""Relationships are nice, but platonic friendships between men and women should not be overlooked either.""  I didn't respond to the link (I didn't really know what to say), but apparently she later asked James what he thought about the article (answer: he started to read it, but got bored and stopped) and then proceeded to ask him if he was happy in his relationship with me.

I know for sure that James has a lot of esteem for Katie but also feels that she is far too high-strung, stressful, and simply not his type, so there is no way that they are secretly in a relationship.  However, it bothers me that Katie is acting so cold around me when from her own mouth there is nothing to be jealous about, since she is supposedly not interested in James.  

James is my first boyfriend and was my first kiss as well.  Katie has never been kissed and has never had a boyfriend, so it is possible that she is expressing her frustrations about this by being resentful of our relationship.  It is also possible that her main interest was Will, but she also had interest in James, and is jealous for that reason.  

However, the main reason I am asking you for help is because, due to a number of unlucky circumstances involving difficulty finding summer internships until late in the year, Katie and I will almost definitely be living together this summer (along with at least 2 other people) with James living nearby and coming over often.  There is also an outside chance that James will have to come and live in the apartment as well.  Although Katie is a really good friend of mine and we get along in all issues except where James is concerned, I am really worried about navigating this situation without accidentally expanding the Cold War.  Any advice that would help me understand Katie's feelings and how to deal with them would be really appreciated!  Thanks all!

**TL;DR: A close mutual friend of my boyfriend and I appears to be super-jealous of our relationship (but is only being cold to me and not to my bf), despite the fact that she told me before we started dating that she didn't have feelings for my bf, but rather his best friend.  I have to live with her and possibly my bf this summer.  How should I navigate the situation without making it even more awkward?**"
tpdqu,2,2012-05-15,So I have a few questions:,[deleted],trees,https://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/tpdqu/so_i_have_a_few_questions/,"SO here's my little dilemma. I'm a college student that has recently finished school so I've moved back home (a tiny town of 3000) for the summer. I work at an engineering internship and work around 60 hours a week already. I've only smoked around five times, the first few with some buddies and the last by myself basically just to finish the pot that I had left over and each time I've had a bunch of fun or felt really good (relaxed).

Anyway, I don't know of anyone in this town that smokes and I want to continue smoking during the weekends, just at night to have some more fun playing my video games. So my first question is, how do I find someone that deals?

Second question is.. I bought a bowl (I think that's what it's called, http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSM9xw-A2HqJtKfQw4lBn9Mfy9iqz9kI5ixBGV3SkLND1rqYa6QwSqfRgZV). How do I pack it properly? How small should the shreds of Marijuana really be? Also, how do I clean the inside of it near the carb, there seems to be some sludge :(.

Third question is.. Where should I stash my marijuana if I do get some. Currently living with the rents over summer and haven't really got any good hiding places. What are the best ways to keep the smell from escaping, my plan was to get like five zip-lock bags and lock those up real tight then just chuck them under some clothes or something..

Fourth question is, if I were to go hiking over summer I would need to travel and I'd also like to bring some pot to really enjoy my time hiking. What would be the best way to travel with Marijuana?

Thanks guys! :)

Ever since I had an abortion a couple years ago I have felt very empty.  People have tried to have relationships with me but I don't think they get what they are doing to themselves.  It's not like they pity me, but being in a relationship with someone who is still fucked over by their own stupidity is just asking for it.  Meanwhile I know that because I feel empty I feel like to cling to a relationship because I want someone nearby, around to tell me it's ok when everyone else has forgotten or just says it was just a batch of cells.  

Ultimately, there is no evading any of this.  What is done is done.  I am doing everything to make a better life for myself, I've returned to the house, I have an internship, I'm a full time student.  It doesn't feel like it's enough.  I feel like I have crap friends who just want to tell me their business when their bored or want a sympathy buddy.  I feel like I'm still half assing things, I feel myself starting to slack again in school.  I'd go to counseling but it's taking some action that I need and I'm working on it.  

I just wish I knew how to get past this every time I try and make friends, only to feel like I'm a traitor to their morals and am a loser to myself.  "

The thing is, between the hour-long commute to get there, the stresses of tasks I'm given, and the fact that when I get home, it gets a little late and I'm really tired, I find that I just don't have a life of my own any more.

Also, I should be paid soon but I haven't been and the accountants haven't even set up my pay. So I just feel like I've got nothing in return. I have shit in my back account, and I'm working my ass of full time, and for what? Yeah, it's a good experience, but when I come home, I just feel tired and I don't have a life of my own any more.

I shouldn't complain. It's a paid internship and I know plenty of people working shitty jobs/no jobs for fuckall pay. I have a great girlfriend who is beautiful and awesome. I'm 20, work a white collar job, and have a high chance of landing a good, well-paying position at this company once I graduate. But is this what it's always going to be like?

Weekends just fly by. Maybe I should work on making them seem longer.

Also, I nearly never see my girlfriend anymore. She's busy at work too, and it's a shock since on campus we'd see each other plenty.

I've been on 40mg Celexa for 2 years now, and it's worked, for the most part. This just sucks though.

Me (20 M), girlfriend (19 F) have a great LDR, it's only be 7 1/2 months so far but wow she is an amazing person. So intelligent, beautiful, funny. My dream girl. I know the relationship isn't long but I love her so much and I want to be with her. But she has hopes of becoming a doctor, her dad is a doctor so it kind of runs in the family. Like I said she is an intelligent girl, 4.0 gpa her first year at college.

Summer is here and we're back home, about 2 hours away from each other. Still haven't seen each other since April. Today her dad told her how she thinks she won't be able to become a doctor, basically he doesn't have faith in her and she won't be able to do it. According to him she's not ""aggressive"" enough and doesn't have any internships her summer before sophomore year. This got her EXTREMELY upset. She told me she's seriously considering transferring to a premed school in Europe to get away from her father and prove him wrong. This hit me pretty bad. We both love each other so much. I told her to go for it cause the last thing I want to do is hold her back and her dreams.

She's planning on going to Europe second semester of sophomore year so that would be Jan. 2013. Obviously anything is possible, but she is very smart and I have no doubt she'll get in those schools. She already has her heart set on this and I know that a relationship won't be possible if she goes there. 

Do I let this relationship run its course until January or do I end it soon? Either way I'm going to be heartbroken, more so in January. She's already showing me photos of campuses in England and it's crushing me inside. I've put on a happy face for her because I don't want to be the reason she holds back. 

tldr- gf thinking about going to europe for college, i'm so sad and don't know what to do"

I want to start looking for an internship in the comp sci field for the summer to gain experience but I'm not sure what I can say I know on my Resume.  I've had three semesters of classes that used  java to teach the material.  I've also recently took a internet systems class that taught HTML, CSS, PHP, SQL, XML, and Javascript.  

At this point I'm not sure what I can list on my resume as far as what I know or how well I know it.  I feel like I know Java well enough to list it for an internship type job.  When it comes to HTML, CSS, PHP, and SQL I'm not sure whether listing these would be a good idea or not.  I understand basic HTML and CSS well enough, but never did anything with the HTML5 stuff and transforms and other fancy things in CSS.

As part of the internet systems class we were partnered up and had to make a website.  My partner and I made a simple forums with PHP, and SQL so I think I understand those on a basic level enough to get me started with anything but when I see postings with SQL as a requirement I'm not sure if what I know would be acceptable.  I really didn't do much with Javascript or XML so I don't think I should list those.  

I was hoping someone could give advice on what kind of level of knowledge employers are expecting applicants to have when they make these postings.  Anyway I would appreciate any advice or tips whatever anyone is willing to offer."

trxpf,1,2012-05-17,My long winded story,This_Gets_Thrown_Out,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/trxpf/my_long_winded_story/,"This is going to be long. I feel the backstory is somehow important.

Currently 30 years old. I grew up in a pretty poor family (during the 80s recession) My dad was in the military and my mom ran a small daycare.  I didn't have a TV or toys excluding the Legos my grandma would buy me when she visited (the visits stopped as my mother doesn't talk to her mother) My household was extremely religious, attending church at least 4 times a week and this was used to justify my mother giving away most of what little money we had to the church because ""they needed it more than we did"". I suffered from apathy and something more like alienation from my peers. I had no friends growing up. I did well in school, usually around a 3.5 GPA because it was easier to just do school work and get it over with. I didn't excel because *effort* wasn't something my mom taught me. She taught me hard work = gift from God, not hard *and* smart work = likelihood of getting ahead in life. My dad took every assignment he  could that was away from the house. Work was his escape, and still is, to this day. I only remember 4 trips from childhood that we ever took. I was talented as an artist but wasn't allowed to work on stuff because ""you'll make a mess"" is what my mom told me. She also beat me with a metal vacuum cleaner tube whenever I did something she didn't like.

I was accepted into the school music program. My mom told me ""I wasn't allowed to play anything without a volume control"" and then bought a broken piano (she got rid of it two years later)

In high school I was a ""weird"" kid. Not trench coat wearing weird. I tried my best to dress normally because I figured it would help me blend in but not enough, apparently. I wasn't exactly made fun of because I was good enough at sports and was tough enough to pose a physical threat (high school is so easy compared to real life) to most people but my mom wouldn't allow me to play team sports and told me I didn't have enough dedication to do so anyway. You start hearing that crap in elementary school and eventually you'll believe it. I still did pretty well in school, but once again, it was easier to do the work, get it over with, and move on. Not enough motivation to have a 4.0. I didn't get into trouble. What kept me sane was walking the neighbors dogs for cash on the military base. Was never very good at handling money but my parents never seemed to have any. This problem persisted long into adulthood.

I grew up on military bases and their education system is pretty horrible (DOD schools) When we finally moved to America I attended a private Christian school of a pretty huge church, but when the principle runs off with the gym teacher, the pastors daughter gets knocked up in highschool, the song leader is busted for looking at porn on the church's computer...(do I need to go on with this?) I understood church was a great money making scheme from a very early age but this isn't something you can talk about with the adults who are a huge part of the problem. I believe in God btw, but that is another story. I only kissed two girls in high school after I turned 17. I'm not sure if this is relevant in anyway to my emotional development or indicative of something else.

I was obsessed with anatomy and death by the time I graduated. I went to college to study mortuary science and worked in a funeral home. I did well in the ""basement"" but didn't work funerals because I don't relate to people and felt no need to fake emotions to help deal with families. I quit the funeral home business because it exists to make money (normal for any business) but the monetary success of a funeral director is based off of commission in most cases. Selling high priced funerals is morally wrong to me. I dropped out 1 class short of graduating.

I had to get a job and ended up at a moving company after getting kicked out of my house (I was 20 and the parents said it was time to go). I did quite well but it was an experience. Most of the employees are felons or people who are totally down on their luck. I did well because I was strong, careful, spoke well to customers, and wasn't black (we had customers who only wanted white or hispanic guys) I managed to do everything in the company including management, sales, and long distance driving. The problem was that I topped out and knew that no matter how hard I tried, 50k a year was the most I would be making. That's not enough to live in this area. I did the math a long time ago and 64K a year is the minimum you need to get by if you're single. That's a shitty condo and second hand car BTW. Ironically enough the same company offered me 65K a year last week, but working at a moving company? Fuck that, seriously. I've got some horror stories about moving companies and they are extremely shady businesses. 

I manage to go back to school. My dad finally returns home and felt guilty so he put up about 70K for me to attend. I got a degree in Advertising. Graduated Magna Cum Laude, but took off time in between due to depression. Fell in love with the Advertising industry, then out of love. Mad Men started a few semesters into school and people referred to me as Don Draper. Guess that was a compliment? I fell out of love with the ad industry and got fucked over at my ""paid"" internship. Doing art direction and branding but usually the boss would just disappear when it came time to pay me the percentage of our fees.

Moved back in with my parents and have been in the basement ever since. My mom and sister weren't happy about that but my dad pretty much told them to STFU he pays the bills anyway so they will just have to deal. I help around the house. I'm a good cook, do the yardwork, help my dad prep his job. I think of myself as his executive assistant. He gives me money for gas, cell phone, and health insurance. It's enough to keep me happy because I know he loves me very much. To help deal with depression I go to the gym 3x a week, but even that is something of a circlejerk and part of that is working out is too immediate a reward IMO. It's not hard to bang out hard work in an hour or two. It's too simple. I watch my diet pretty well and wonder if what is wrong with me is a deficiency of some sort. I've thought about working in a gym from time to time, but eh...it's a non job IMO. 

I was playing in a band (quite good actually), but got kicked out because the new bass player bribed our drummer by flying him out to various places on his +1s with the company he works for (bass player has a great job, but when you're fat, unable to play your instrument, and have psoriasis on your balls it's hard to get girls) These guys also don't have a problem with getting chicks drunk to hook up and I don't want to be around people like that. But music was keeping me going on some level. I'm not a fool though. I look early 20s but the music thing probably was not going to happen, and my motivation for art is really low right now. I sold all my bass gear last night. I stare at the wad of hundreds, wishing it was gold, knowing that paper money is essentially useless (fiat money). 

Depression runs in my family. My cousin (degree in Criminal Justice) *enlisted* in the army at 34 years of age. He loves it. I don't believe in what our military stands for so that is out. Ironically enough the one thing I do better than just about anyone else is shoot guns and have thought about turning that into a career but I really hate the culture that surrounds guns/the firearms industry. 

Last weekend my 19 year old cousin was killed(car accident, thrown 75 feet from the vehicle). As the QB he ended a 10 year losing streak at his high school and took his team to the state Super Bowl (they lost) Apparently he suffered from depression as well, something about a girl involved, but the family isn't talking about that and I'm not going to ask or assume. It was weird being back a funeral home, knowing I could have done better work on the guy. I hated it. He did more in 19 years of life than I have in 30. 


**ANYWAY** My entire life I've felt out of it. I had a long term/long distance/abusive relationship (got my nose fractured when she sucker punched me among other things) but the girl left me for a middle age guy at some point (""he has money"" she said). She always referred to me as ""the alien"" because my weird emotional states. I ended up dating a model/commercial real estate agent after that but the only reason that happened was because she wanted a guy in a band. We didn't get along, she is now with a signed musician (good for her, she was a great person, we just weren't compatible) I can fake being normal, but it's lame that I have to do that. It takes effort to be normal and drains me. I have extreme mood swings but it's all directed internally. 

What's keeping me going? I have a best friend who works in the financial district here. He hates his job because of the corporate bullshit/hours but makes too much money to leave.(His health is declining from stress/long days) I talk to a girl I knew from way back when. She tells me that she likes me because she was 230 lbs in high school but managed to lose 100 lbs, get implants, and became a hottie. She tells me I was the only guy who was nice to her when she was obese. My other best friend and I make some electronic music together but he's moving away from here (similar band situation). 

**sorry for the drivel**

**TL:DR** I don't know what to do and know that ultimately I am the cause of my problems. Yet I stay in the basement and think too much about everything.

i cut and scratched myself starting 8th grade. got caught junior year of hs. got diagnosed with general anxiety and clinical depression. homeschooled senior year. went to community college. withdrew from classes, from an a/b to a w. 5th year university student. withdrew from classes with 9 units away from graduation. ditched my intership, my team of 5 corps members, and 20 little humans. failed suicide on valentine's day this year. not mute, but just... can't get myself to talk. to anyone. i write 3-4 words down, at most. i talk to my boyfriend via messages on skype. a few money issues, but nothing completely unsolvable. preventable, if it weren't for the valentine's day thing.

i really don't know what to do with myself. my boyfriend has been trying to keep me happy, so i try to be happy. so every day i work at my parents' restaurant smiling and nodding and then running away and being treated like i'm two years old when someone tries to get me to talk. 

the thing that gets to me is that i know it's all in my head. there really is no reason for me to be depressed. there's a table with food, roof over my head, clothes, laptop, and i try so hard to keep myself busy. i take up hobbies, i go places, and then gift them to people and when i stop, i'm thinking about ways to kill myself without failing, breaking up with my boyfriend so he won't be blamed, taking a flight to anywhere and doing it so my parents won't have to see the cadaver. 

like... this shit is in my head all the time. i want to get better but then i just fall into this... i don't know. at one point i was 95 pounds, then 130 this year. i would buy chocolate and ice cream and go to my grandma's house and then i'd refuse to leave from underneath my covers for weeks. i can't do this anymore and i don't want a visit from the emergency crisis team or medication or anything. my shrink has been nothing but good to me, but i don't want to talk to her. i just feel like i want to end it all, but i don't want to be the one to end it. i kind of jokingly asked my boyfriend to kill me instead, but his reaction was really bad and then i felt really bad when i realized how awful that was to say. 

i just realized that's really contradictory, but i don't know. sometimes i'm just... if i pretend i'm better, maybe i'll get better. but this just keeps making me feel worse and makes my head hurt and my parents are going through so much already and they really don't need this, but now they have to worry about their 22-year-old daughter who should have graduated and student financial services are just... i don't want to think about that right now. and health issues i didn't know i had just popped up. and i'm just wondering... is there really a point? ...if all i'm ending up doing is burdening my family and worrying other people, wouldn't it be better for me to end it all and have them grieve for a little and then go off and live their lives with their load a little lighter? 

i tried. i really did. i never missed therapy. i contacted and asked for help from my psychologists. i kept myself busy. i was outgoing and made friends. got accepted into an internship. volunteered. i gave myself alone time. i went shopping. i ate lots and lots of chocolate and candy and took pictures and made scrapbooks. i got a boyfriend. i tried and nothing worked and i don't know if i'm willing to try anymore but... i don't know. i just don't know what i want or how to get what i want or if what i want is even right. 

i really don't know. i don't want to go to sleep tonight wishing i won't wake up tomorrow. i just don't want to wake up to see me and just... i don't know. i feel like everything's wrong"

I had an interview last Friday (5/11) with a local Linux company about interning with them this Summer. I think the interview went well- both at the end of the interview and in the interviewer's response to my thank-you email, he said we'd be 'talking soon'.

The only problem is, I've got other things that could possibly be on my plate for this summer- the internship, doing classes/research at school, or going home- and I need to be moved out of my dorm by Monday. I'm rapidly reaching the point where I *need* to know what's going on so that I know where I'm moving (and parents, etc etc).

If I even should contact him about this, is there a polite way to do it, or is saying ""I need to know now-ish"" rude regardless? This would assume I don't hear back from him by the end of today (5/17)."
trbjs,2,2012-05-17,My self destructive way of thinking,boomerang1111,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/trbjs/my_self_destructive_way_of_thinking/,"I had no clue where to post this, but since I suffer from depression I figured it might as well go here because that might have something to do with it. Anyways, my outlook on life is that if I always set my expectations low enough, I can never fail to meet @them, and I get some sick, twisted form of pride from this. I've never seriously discussed it with anyone, but I felt like I had to get it out, and I'm between therapists right now. As an example, when I dropped out of college the first time, I had met exactly what I had expected for myself. However, when I actually got hired for a part time job, which then led to an internship at a PC repair shop, I far exceeded expectations. But not a day goes by where I expect to go home employed. Hell, not a day goes by where I don't pat myself on the back for living through the morning. With this pattern, I almost always surpass what I expect of myself, but when I inevitably fuck up, I'm not surprised or disappointed at all. This has led to a very ""whatever"" attitude, where I don't strive to achieve anything without some kind of financial motivation, which I consider the main reason I dropped out of college twice (aside from my atrocious grammar). I want to move out, but working full time sounds like an inconvenient pain in the ass for not much spending money, due to bills. So I live rent free with my parents, cleaning in exchange for food and bed. Maintaining friendships sounds like hard work, so I don't talk to anyone unless they contact me first, which never happens outside of work. I don't know if this outlook is normal or not, but I wanted to feel like someone would at least listen to my ramblings without publicly shaming me. Anyways thanks for reading I guess."
trb9x,0,2012-05-17,I'm losing the only woman that I've ever truly loved,screwed_in_auburn,BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/trb9x/im_losing_the_only_woman_that_ive_ever_truly_loved/,"I'm so afraid that my girlfriend (21) and I (23) aren't ever going to get back together and I don't deserve to have this happen.

So we have been dating for almost exactly a year and like all couples we've had our ups and downs.  Mostly little shit like me being at work too much and not spending enough time with her, and me not having enough time to do things on my own, etc.  But always figuring things out within a day and 99 percent of the time we have both been extremely happy, and I feel lucky for every day I get with her.  Lately she has been having problems with people stealing things from her apartment (we still live separately) and has been trying to figure out who.

A couple of nights ago she and her friends started questioning/accusing me of doing it (I DID NOT), and this turned into a larger fight of me being angry about being accused and her being angry that i wasn't confessing.  A few more friends get involved and when the argument hit its peak, one of my ""friends"" decides that its time to tell my girlfriend how he, my other friend, and I had used her car when she was home for winter break and didn't tell her about it.

Now she says that she can never trust me again, told her parents who now hate me, and that we're breaking up.  I understand that it wasn't a great decision and took responsibility for taking her car without permission, it was stupid and i definitely should have told her.  But I don't think that it was proper grounds for splitting up at all.

This was two days ago, i haven't been able to sleep, eat, have any motivation for day to day things like running errands or going to work.  She is leaving next monday to go home for an internship that is 800 miles away.  I don't know what to do.  

I feel like my heart has been ripped out of my chest because this is the only girl that I have ever told I loved, and I truly meant it.  I thought that we were going to be together through college and farther.    Its killing me that something like this is enough for her to just ignore the love and caring that I have and tried to show on a daily basis the entire time that we were together.  I know I screwed up, but didn't think this would ever happen.

What do I do now?

TL;DR - My girlfriend broke up with me because she cant trust me for borrowing her car while she was away.  She is leaving in a couple of days for 2 months and I don't think I can make it without her b/c I have altered my life so much to be with her.  Now I don't know what to do.

She was talking to him via cellphone and email all secretively. I happened to see an email, and it sounded kind of fishy that she didn't ever mention to me about it. I asked her to stop talking to him, since I can't trust her to be honest about her dealing with him. If she was open that'd be fine. I also said if she did want to talk to him that I'd want 100% transparency since she lost a lot of trust that first time.

That was in December/January. Today I see an email pop/up on her inbox as I was about to help set her up on Linux. It was from her ex. A few minutes later I find that she was ""hiding"" his emails in her deleted items folder all saved as attachments to emails forwarded to another account. Basically she was actively hiding these communications. All I could see was her stuff from the past 2 months, everything else wasn't there.

What I did see was enough to raise red flags. Invitations for them to meet up with each other, and some flirtatious back and forths. It sounds fishy to me. At this point I am 80% sure she is cheating on me.

I feel bad because she is unemployed, and her mother lives several states over. If I kick her out, she basically will have to move back home (she is currently a guest at my home, but I am on the lease). I know she just got an internship in my area (that I helped her get) that would set her up for a job, but without a place to live she is s-o-l.

So on an 80% chance should I eject her from my life?

UPDATE: I called her and asked her if she had anything to say. She didn't. I told her if there was ANYTHING she was doing and hiding from me that'd make me upset. She denied it. Then I told her what I saw, and she denied that they did anything sexual/etc and she wouldn't answer me straight about what was going on.

EDIT:

Clarification: I only snooped on her emails after I saw the little pop-ups with her boyfriend's name.

TLDR (thanks TLDR MOFO): I found some flirtations between my g/f and her ex in email and suggestions that they were meeting up behind my back. What do I do?"
ttudt,7,2012-05-18,Today I completely broke down and never showed up to my internship--again. Need advice...,[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/ttudt/today_i_completely_broke_down_and_never_showed_up/,"I thought this would be the best place to ask for a little advice about what I've been going through. So, this fall, I was diagnosed with MDD (severe, recurrent). I've suffered from the same symptoms for as long as I can remember-- low energy, over-sensitive, over sleeping, not being able to sleep at night, outbursts, no concentration and above all just a pervasive feeling of shame and guilt. I started going to therapy in the fall but couldn't afford to keep going. I see a psychiatrist once a month because I was prescribed Wellbutrin, but its clearly not helping very much.



I took the Spring semester off of school to relax, which I wasn't really able to do. In the fall semester, I'd had an internship that I completely flaked out on after a few months there. I liked doing the work and was grateful for the opportunity, but it was too much in conjunction with classes. I was feeling a lot less pressure during my semester off, and I asked if I could come back. The executive director of the place I was interning said sure, but only if I really thought I was up to it. I really thought I was.



I was doing OK for the first few weeks, but then it was just a repeat of everything that'd happened in the Fall. I had a bunch of coursework to finish from the semester before and the internship was getting in the way and stressing me out because I also had a part time job. I quit the job, but that still didn't help. For a month now I've been losing so many nights of sleep, worrying about going into the internship without having the work they need done and at the same time not being able to finish my school work. 



The more I needed to concentrate, the less I could. My deadline for school passed about a week ago, but I still had a research paper (actually a Modle UN scenario) to write for the internship. It had to be done by last night, but when I was working on it I lost my internet connection. I freaked out and just went to sleep because I'd not gotten more than 3 hours sleep in the past couple of days.



I woke up this morning around 8 and tried to work on the paper a little. I had to be at work by 11. I hardly got anything done, and was so tired and so stressed out-- I just felt like I lost my mind. I was crying hysterically for a few hours and by the time that was all over I felt so ashamed because I was going to be late and not have the work done that I just flat out didn't go. 



I did this once in the Fall, too. My boss was understanding, but I don't see how he could be this time around. I just need to know how to handle this situation. I'm afraid to look at my e-mails in case there's something from my boss since I'm so embarrassed. I thought maybe some of you would have been in a similar situation before and could possibly share some wisdom. Thanks in advance!



**tl;dr I have MDD and its been a stressful month. Didn't show up for my internship today and I'm wondering how to handle talking to my boss about my no call/no show?**"

I am a design graduate living in the UK and I am sick of companies advertising unpaid full-time internships.

So many companies abuse the internship scheme in order to get free labour from talented graduates in the Creative Industries. So few of us can afford the luxury of working for nothing yet we need experience on the cv to get the paid job making it extremely difficult for new graduates to start their careers.

What I am currently in the process of doing is forming a charity aimed at people within the creative industries to offer them funding to help while they undertake unpaid internship schemes.

I feel that the internship scheme needs to change but at the same time there are so many loopholes which companies can use to get around paying people e.g. voluntary placements and work experience.

What I am asking from all of you guys is some feedback on this idea and any suggestions you have towards the idea to help make this new charity be worthwhile and really helpful to those in the creative industries.

You are familiar with C++ and may have done some MFC coding at some point. You are happy working on old code and love puzzles, and have a great eye for detail. You know who you are.

I've seen a few folks asking around about internships, and asked my boss about it, and he cleared me to start paperwork. If no one bites here, then I'll have ex-Rice/UT/UH/A&amp;M peeps hit up CompSci departments there for anyone not working yet this summer.

PM me (new account but old redditor). I do not know pay or other terms yet. Cliche, but this is a cool opportunity for the right person.

Not used reddit for anything like this before. I'll try and respond to PMs. You can keep it pretty anon if you like. Just give a rough idea of experience, what you'd expect in pay and what you'd hope to learn. Links to previous work are obviously an advantage.

Fast learners are ok, but you should have some decent VC++ experience. You'd be sharing an office with a couple of support people, with dev experience.

tspjb,3,2012-05-17,"Been together for almost 8 years and although at one pointed I wanted to marry her, I don't think I do anymore. No idea how to handle this. ",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/tspjb/been_together_for_almost_8_years_and_although_at/,"A little backstory. Met as undergrads, didn't start dating until we both had graduated. Things started off slowly and then progressed as you would expect, we moved in together after dating for about 3 years. Come this Sept/Oct we will have lived together for 5 years. 

Shortly after moving in with each other she decided to go back to school to get her doctorate. At the same time we were starting to talk about getting engaged. Knowing this I knew we would have no money to get married, even with help. We decided that if she went back to school we would put off getting engaged until after she finished. 

Things continued to be great. She went back to school and although it was difficult financially we still had fun. 

Looking back now I can see it started as soon as she graduated. All of the sudden I was being put on the spot by everyone, ""when are you going to pop the question"", ""how long have you two been together now"", etc..... It had come sporadically before, but this was a torrential downpour. I tried skirting the question, tried being witty about it, but eventually I snapped and would respond with ""when I am ready"" in a curt voice. And thats when I noticed that a lot of it was coming from her, or should I say on her behalf. She was still finishing her internship and knew that I was still flat broke. I wasn't ruined by any means, just broke, still living paycheck to paycheck while she was finishing up. It would be another 4 months before she started earning a full paycheck and I would be in a position to start saving. So in Sept. she started full time and I started saving. And I have been saving ever since, to the point where I almost have enough to buy a ring. But now I don't want to!!! I've watched her change over the last 12 months. She started out being coy about it, oh look this random person I met once got engaged on facebook. She dropped hints and as the savings account grew I started to pay more and more attention to them. But it in the last few months, her tone would change regarding the subject, all of the sudden she wasn't happy for her ""friend"" getting engaged but instead miserable that she wasn't yet. She “promised” to leave me if I didn't put a ring on her finger by her next birthday which will be this fall. 

And now I don't think I want to marry this person. I don't want people to get the wrong idea, I still love this person and realize that she is just acting out of frustration for not being married yet. Yes her peers are giving her a lot of pressure. But I don't think marriage should be approached by a “you have to or else” kind of attitude. I hate being forced to do anything, and I feel that I am being forced to get married. The sad thing is that for a long time I did, I really did want to marry her. And now I am pondering what our marriage will be like and I am forced to ask myself if this is what I can expect from her. Will she do the same thing when she wants to have kids, or buy a house, or whatever. 

Anyways, any advice would be appreciated. 

Edit: I am in my early 30's, she's in her late 20's. 

TLDR: Been with a girl for 8 years, wanted to get married but don't now because I am being forced to.

tuvz5,3,2012-05-19,Is this the normal status quo for a relationship?,Dovakeeeeeen,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/tuvz5/is_this_the_normal_status_quo_for_a_relationship/,"I'm currently almost two months down the road with my girlfriend (17), I'm 17 as well, and everything's been going well, or at least I think it has been.  
There's one issue that's been bothering me since about a month ago. So here I go:

I feel like I'm always the one initiating contact and that she doesn't really take the initiative to communicate.  Sorry if this sounds kind of selfish, but hear me out.

I'm usually propose and plan out dinners, dates, and pretty much any activity we go to.  On Skype, I'm always the one to start the conversation and I can't remember the last time she has.  If I don't say anything, there's simply no conversation.  Same applies for texting.  At school, I'm always the one who seeks her out. In general, I'm always pushing for the contact.

I only find this kind of strange because when I look to most other couples (generally speaking), both sides seem to be putting effort into spending time with eachother.  They wait for eachother after class, for lunch, and what not.  I understand relationships are different for everyone, but I'm still puzzled over this.  She's said she genuinely likes me and wants/likes to spend time with me, but her actions say otherwise.  

She's quite busy will school and intern work at times and I try to help her with it as much as possible.  On the note of her personality, she's kind of shy and indecisive.  


Is there any explanation as to why it's like this and how I could change it? Am I simply acting too needy?

I like her a lot, and I really don't want to see the relationship go wrong because of something like this. 

**TL;DR - One sided relationship -&gt; Feel like I'm always the one pushing with no pull from girlfriend, not sure if she's uncomfortable or what.**

I was just curious if there are any ent out here that would want to meet up and smoke and maybe show me around (Though i would mention i'm 20 too, that way its not a surprise later)? If not tips for finding someone to smoke with or key things to see in the city are also appreciated! :-)

Questions|Answers
:--|:--
[In my opnion, Craig Ferguson's show is unique, as so much is improvised. None of the episodes are broadcast live (or to my knowledge most aren't\), and yet that talk show seems so much more ""REAL"" than any other to me.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tt9sy/i_am_rob_burnett_executive_producer_of_the_late/c4pj8cf?context=5)|But Craig, like any good host, has strong ideas about himself and what he wants to do.  He's a natural.
[What kind of role do you play in the creation and distribution of that show? The show has grown and changed since it first started very much. How much of that can be attributed of ""Worldwide Pants"" and how much could be attributed to Craig Ferguson?  I believe your sitting on a goldmine. Craig Ferguson has some of the best interviews on Television. Any chance you can just give the man a Charlie Rose style interview show?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tt9sy/i_am_rob_burnett_executive_producer_of_the_late/c4pj8cf?context=5)|Craig wears an earpiece hooked up to my office and he repeats everything I say.  He really is just a giant puppet.  No, Craig is brilliant and all the credit belongs to him.  As a company, Worldwide Pants isn't run by typical ""executives.""  It's kind of me and Dave on the creative side.  Our mantra is to find talented people and let them do their thing.  Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.  In Craig's case it's working.  Peter Lassally, who works for us on the West Coast, was crucial to identifying and championing Craig early on, and he is there on a day to day basis to work with Craig.
[Have there ever been any guests that you were unable to put on the air due to their being intoxicated, being ""out of it"", or something along those lines? If so how do you make up for that?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tt9sy/i_am_rob_burnett_executive_producer_of_the_late/c4pitmy?context=5)|I can't recall an incident like that, but I may be forgetting.  Some people thought Farrah Fawcett was on something when she had her infamous appearance.  I actually have no idea because she arrived late -- after the show started -- so everything you saw, I saw.
 |I was interviewed after the incident and said I thought she was just playing around, trying to be funny.  The day after I was in my office at 11 p.m. and the phone rang.  It was Farrah. I thought she was calling to thank me for backing her up in the press.
 |She began explaining her appearance and to this day I still don't understand what she was saying.  I just know that I was on the phone with her for an hour.  The only phrase I remember is that she kept telling me that she was going to Al Pacino's castle.  Your guess is as good as mine.
 |That was one of those show business moments I will never forget.  I am 49, so if you do the math, I was in mid-puberty when the Farrah Fawcett poster came out.  If I could have ever looked into a crystal ball and imagined myself being on the phone with Farrah Fawcett, going on midnight, and just wanting to GET OFF THE PHONE, well, I don't think my 13-year-old self would have ever believed it.
[**Al Pacino's Castle.**](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tt9sy/i_am_rob_burnett_executive_producer_of_the_late/c4pk2cu?context=5)|Every time you try to leave it, it pulls you back in.
[I must know more about this place. Must. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tt9sy/i_am_rob_burnett_executive_producer_of_the_late/c4pk2cu?context=5)|Thank you and g'night!  Hey, I'm a professional.  Don't mess with this!
[What is the the most uncomfortable thing youve you've seen on the Letterman set? The Crispin Glover incident?  The various Harvey Pekar arguments? Your boss' mea culpa about dating his staffer and getting blackmailed?  Anything else come to mind?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tt9sy/i_am_rob_burnett_executive_producer_of_the_late/c4pirl4?context=5)|We've had our moments.  You can't predict them.  They just happen.  And the truth is, they are great for us.  Crispin Glover, I think, was trying to do a bit -- but I can't really be sure.  Harvey Pekar was great television.  Farrah Fawcett was another one that was pretty amazing to watch up close.  And there was one with the old actor Oliver Reed (now longer with us) that was compelling.  He had a few cocktails and I thought there was a chance he was going to punch Dave.
[Also, was Larry ""Bud"" Melman really that odd? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tt9sy/i_am_rob_burnett_executive_producer_of_the_late/c4pirl4?context=5)|As for Dave's ""mea culpa,"" I actually didn't find that awkward at all.  Part of what makes Dave the best is that he is honest and authentic in all situations.  And I though he handled a difficult situation amazingly well.
[Interesting...never heard of the Reed incident and I was a fan of his as well.  Watching it online right now. That is one amazing beard. Thanks for the head's up. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tt9sy/i_am_rob_burnett_executive_producer_of_the_late/c4pj4o9?context=5)|Here's a little more on Oliver Reed.  I don't remember when this was, but I was not yet a writer on the show.  (I suspect it was late 1987/early 1988 because I became a writer in Feb. 1988.)  I was 25 and I was given a chance to segment produce.  I was assigned Oliver Reed.  He had been in some movie that took place on an island.
 |I got him on the phone and said, ""Hello, Mr. Reed.  So, you spend several months shooting on an island --"" CLICK.  He hung up.
 |I call back, the publicist says, ""Oliver is mad that you asked if he was on an island.  He says, of course he was on an island.""  I said I wasn't really asking that, just thought maybe there might be a story or two from shooting that he'd like to share.
 |He gets back on the phone and I try a different approach.  I figure I'll talk about his past.  I say, ""Hello, Mr. Reed.  I see that you and Lee Marvin spent a lot of --"" CLICK.
 |And that concluded all interactions between me and Mr. Oliver Reed for the rest of our lives.
[I have two questions. 1: how painful was it for you having to watch Joaquin phoenix live on set on letterman? (you know which episode\) 2: what is your opinion on Jay Leno and this whole Conan/Jay thing. (great show last night btw\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tt9sy/i_am_rob_burnett_executive_producer_of_the_late/c4pixhb?context=5)|The Joauin Phoenix thing is not painful for us at all.  I'm never worried during those situations because   I always have supreme confidence in Dave.  And boy did he come through with flying colors.  When he told Joaquin, ""I wish you could have been here tonight,"" it was tremendous.  The place exploded. I thought Conan was an incredible guest last night on our show.  He was really hilarious.  I'm a big Conan fan, really from the start when he took over for Dave in Late Night.  I remember the first cold opening he did with him walking to work and everyone telling him, ""You better be better than Letterman!"" I immediately thought, 'This guy is really smart and funny.""  The idea of going into Dave's old studio and not being suffocated by the past, and moreover creating your own original brand of that show, is something for which I think Conan deserves enormous credit.
[Edit: thanks for doing this AMA.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tt9sy/i_am_rob_burnett_executive_producer_of_the_late/c4pixhb?context=5)| 
[This is why i love dave more than any other host. he always knows how to stay on top of every situation.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tt9sy/i_am_rob_burnett_executive_producer_of_the_late/c4pjhap?context=5)|That is why I love Dave more than any other host.  That and the other hosts didn't put my kids through college.
[How did you get into the industry? Is it tough to get your feet of the ground when trying to become a writer for TV?  Also, who is the longest in the Letterman Shows Shower? Is it David?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tt9sy/i_am_rob_burnett_executive_producer_of_the_late/c4piwvp?context=5)|I started as an intern at Late Night one year out of college.  Here's a tip: once you get into a place, you start putting small amounts of poison in the watercooler.  Not enough to kill anyone, just enough to make everyone a little slower, a little duller.  Next thing you know: head of the company!
[That explains a lot about the show &amp; the network.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tt9sy/i_am_rob_burnett_executive_producer_of_the_late/c4pl0gl?context=5)|And show business in general.
[How much does Dave hate Jay Leno? Is it real or is it mostly for show?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tt9sy/i_am_rob_burnett_executive_producer_of_the_late/c4pj75m?context=5)|They need each other to survive like Superman and Lex Luthor.  (Just so we're clear: Dave = Superman)
 |Honestly, I don't think Dave spends a lot of time thinking about Jay.  As Dave said on last night's show, they've known each other for a long, long time so I'm not really sure even I completely understand the relationship.
 |When they shot the Super Bowl commercial together there was no tension or hostility at all.  It was professional.
[Who were some of the worst guests to deal with on Letterman?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tt9sy/i_am_rob_burnett_executive_producer_of_the_late/c4pitpd?context=5)|The answer to this is never as dramatic as you want it to be.  We really haven't had a lot of big diva incidents and such.  Everyone always asks me, ""Is so and so nice?""  Our segment producers have a more thorough interaction with them and can give fuller answers, but generally everyone is on their best behavior when they do our show.
 |Occasionally a publicist might get aggressive.  I'll leave the names out because we have to work with these people, but once I remember a publicist threatening to pull a guest because he/she/it didn't like the way we had formatted the show.  Specifically, the order of the guests.  I politely told he/she/it that they couldn't tell us how to format our show, much as I would never tell he/she/it how to producer their movie/album/book.
 |The publicist turned to his/her/its assistant publicist and said, ""Call Jay and see if he has an opening.""  At which point I turned to our talent booker and said, ""Call Tom Brokaw and see if he's available for tonight.""
 |And then somehow everything magically worked out.
[So we know the guest wasn't Tom Brokaw. How many does that leave?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tt9sy/i_am_rob_burnett_executive_producer_of_the_late/c4pj82f?context=5)|Nice work detective.  Unless it WAS Tom Brokaw and I was just using him to throw you off the trail.

[You are a fine diplomat sir. How about Crispin Glover? Were you there during the 'incident'? I always wondered if it was staged, but it looked pretty scary at the time. God, I'm old.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tt9sy/i_am_rob_burnett_executive_producer_of_the_late/c4pjkrt?context=5)|I was there when Crispin had his incident, but I was pretty removed from the action.  I think I was just a talent assistant that time.  My personal belief is that it was comedy gone wrong, and, in the words of my boss circa 1985, we all know how painful that can be.

 |(I once was referred to as ""Wallace Shawn's less neurotic younger brother"" in Entertainment Weekly."")
[I was a guest on the Late Show audience show and tell, and it was probably one of my favorite memories in my life.  Always been a big fan of Dave.  My question:  Is Dave planning on retiring anytime soon, and if so, any rumblings as to who could be his Late Show successor?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tt9sy/i_am_rob_burnett_executive_producer_of_the_late/c4pivj1?context=5)|I really have no idea when Dave is going to want to retire.  Dave is in a rarified position in show business in that he can choose when to get off the stage.  It's rare.  Normally, someone shoves you off with a meat hook and there's usually blood and flesh left on the floor.  Dave has to decide for himself when he's had enough.
 |From my standpoint, Dave is still as good as he ever was -- in some ways, better than he ever was because he has incredible stature now.  He is bigger than his guests and that creates an interesting dynamic.
 |Night in and night out he's still really, really funny.  And I say this because it is true, and also on the chance that he finds this IAmA.  I'm not an idiot, people! 
[What's Dave like in person? Do you guys get along?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tt9sy/i_am_rob_burnett_executive_producer_of_the_late/c4pj66b?context=5)|Dave has been on TV for about, I don't know, 5000 hours now.  And largely without a script.  You know what he's like.  You see it every night.  He's not playing a character -- that's him out there.  His honesty as a performer is his biggest asset.  You always know what he's thinking or feeling about something.  He's just not a phony, and that is absolutely the case off the air as well.  The fact that he expresses himself in such a unique and funny way night in and night out, well, that's the reason we've all had jobs for this many years.
[So no, then?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tt9sy/i_am_rob_burnett_executive_producer_of_the_late/c4pligs?context=5)|Hahahaaha.  We get along great.  There has been no bigger influence in my life than Dave.
[In your mind, who are the standouts able to form the next generation of late night hosts?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tt9sy/i_am_rob_burnett_executive_producer_of_the_late/c4pirj5?context=5)|I think there is huge talent out there across the board: Ferguson, Fallon, Kimmel and of course Conan, Stewart and Colbert.  The problem for these guys is not their ability, but the change in the TV landscape.  Talk shows at their core are meant to be sort of filler shows at the end of the prime time day.  Now with DVR, people can watch CSI or whatever else they want at 11:30 p.m.  It's tough competition.  Plus throw in Adult Swim, video games, fascinating Reddit IAmas like this one -- I don't think anyone will ever again have the mantle the way Johnny and Dave did.  It's just not set up that way.
[How's does one get into writing for a late night talk show?  Any advice you can give?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tt9sy/i_am_rob_burnett_executive_producer_of_the_late/c4pj2ms?context=5)|It's never easy, but I have to say it's easier now than ever because there are so many places.  Just find any outlet for your jokes.  Cable shows.  Reality shows.  Game shows.  Even if you can start by just getting in the door as a production assistant.  A writer's assistant is a great way in.
 |Here's a success story:  Tracey Wigfield.  She was a page at CBS.  I met her, hired her as an assistant on Knights.  Gave her a chance to write some ADR (additional dialogue recording) lines for a scene when Jon and I were too busy.  She did a great job.  I recommended her for a writer's assistant job at 30 Rock.  She got it.  Did a great job.  Now she's on staff at 30 Rock.  I think she was nominated for a Writer's Guild Award for one of her scripts.  (Maybe she won -- don't know). Tina Fey told me she's doing great up there.
 |Bottom line: her career is better than mine now.  Advice: Don't ever help anyone.
[Oh god, I screwed it up didn't I?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tt9sy/i_am_rob_burnett_executive_producer_of_the_late/c4pj0u2?context=5)|I think that actually looks better than me, and also answers that other guy's question about whether Dave ever tried to seduce me.
[Rob, on a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 being Barack Obama and 10 being Adolph Hitler, how racist is Michael Ian Black?  I'm thinking about 6.5, but you know him better than I do.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tt9sy/i_am_rob_burnett_executive_producer_of_the_late/c4pisza?context=5)|I would have said 6, but I'm good with a 6.5.
[What kind of car do you drive?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tt9sy/i_am_rob_burnett_executive_producer_of_the_late/c4pizll?context=5)|I have never been a car guy.  For years I drove a beat up Honda Hybrid, but we actually used it as a prop in the movie and it got sort of destroyed.  (That sounds more exciting than it actually is.  It wasn't a big car chase -- just a character throwing rocks at it.  It's one of the funniest scenes in the movie.)
 |I now drive a Lexus Hybrid.  45 m.p.g.  We are big into environmental stuff in my family.  My wife is on the board of the Connecticut Audubon, we use no chemicals on the lawn, my wife built a summer house that is Silver Leed certified -- if that means anything to any of you.
 |But, the real reason I stepped up to a Lexus is because I needed a good stereo system so that I could listen to Mike and Tom Eat Snacks every day on my way to work.  I told Tom Cavanagh that he owed me for the car and he actually wrote me a check.
[What selection does Dave have into choosing the musical guests? He seemed to REALLY like the Hold Steady, and the Gaslight Anthem. If he likes the band, does that increase the chances of them being asked back?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tt9sy/i_am_rob_burnett_executive_producer_of_the_late/c4pj592?context=5)|Dave doesn't get involved a ton with the music bookings. Certainly he has his favorites and, as with everything on the show, we tailor things to what we think Dave likes.  Sheila Rogers is the head of our talent department and Sheryl Zellikson (please let me have spelled that correctly) is specifically dedicated to music bookings.
 |The music has become one of my favorite parts of the show.  It's a real treat for me each night to stand on the stage and watch such great musicians.
[Hi, Rob. Do you listen to Mike and Tom Eat Snacks? If so, what do you think? Also, do you have any funny stories about Tom and Michael from your 'Ed' days?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tt9sy/i_am_rob_burnett_executive_producer_of_the_late/c4piq84?context=5)|Mike and Tom Eat Snacks is my favorite thing in the world.  It is embarrassing what a fan I am of that show.  (Except for the two episodes I guested on.  I knew full well I was ruining their show, but I was so excited to be on I didn't even care.)  I think those guys are geniuses and that podcast is one of the funniest things being done right now in all of comedy.
[It seems like lately Dave has just become a bitter old man. I loved watching him and his slightly aloof take on the world always killed me, but it just seems like the joy has gone out of him. Any thought to that?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tt9sy/i_am_rob_burnett_executive_producer_of_the_late/c4pj5tz?context=5)|You say bitter old man, I say hilarious national treasure.  Potato-potahto.
[I have NEVER understood the Paul angle. I was watching the show from even before you started there and Paul has always seemed creepy, strange, odd, and his music sucks. I just don't get it.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tt9sy/i_am_rob_burnett_executive_producer_of_the_late/c4pj5tz?context=5)|The Spanish redub show was part of my writing submission.  So you're talking, oh, 25 years ago?  I think the show has appropriately evolved to a great place.  You don't want to be Gallagher smashing watermelons in your 60s.  Part of Dave's genius is to have smartly evolved the show into what he is comfortable and great at doing.  You have to keep moving forward.
[He's a legend for good reason, I just remember how happy and joyful he used to be.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tt9sy/i_am_rob_burnett_executive_producer_of_the_late/c4pkv57?context=5)|Also, I remember getting a ton of complaints from the Miami affiliate because people thought we were just running the show in Spanish from then on.
[I can't fucking believe you were the guy who did the dubbed show. If memory serves the guest was someone like Jacqueline Bisset.

 |There was a period of time when I was headwriter that I ate a turkey hero from Rupert every day for two years.  And I went down to his store at some point and saw that he had started naming sandwiches after staff members.  Everyone had a sandwich named after them.  Not me.
 |I said, ""Rupert, why do I not have a sandwich named after me?  I ordered a sandwich every day for two years!""  And Rupert looked at me and in his laconic dulcet tone said, ""You're sandwich is too boring.""
[What is your collaborative writing process like with Jon Beckerman? Do you prefer working with a co-writer, do you also write strictly solo? How did you two come up with the idea of We Made This Movie?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tt9sy/i_am_rob_burnett_executive_producer_of_the_late/c4pizib?context=5)|I'm the luckiest man alive to have found a partner like Jon Beckerman.  He's a genius, super funny, and, quite frankly, easy on the eyes.  We were lucky in that we both grew up together working for the Late Show.  I was made headwriter a week after he was hired as a writer.  He then went on to be headwriter when I became EP.
 |When I was headwriter I would often gather two or three writers in my office when it was crunch time.  Jon was always in that group.  He's really one of the best ever Letterman writers.  So we have a great shorthand.
 |Our process is that we talk and talk and talk and talk.  And then talk more about an idea.  We discuss characters, scenes, story.  We end up making a very detailed outline.  (This may be residue from our days doing ""Ed"").  After we have a detailed outline, we divide things up and write scenes individually, but by then we understand the dynamics of those scenes in detail.  It may also be that we have jokes or ideas from our talks that end up in those scenes.
 |When we're done, we give each other notes.  It's like I'm the boss of the stuff he writes and he's the boss of the stuff I write.  The goal is to never have anything in a script that either of us doesn't like.
[I remember seeing an episode of Space Ghost Coast to Coast that was written by some writer's of The Late Show. I can't remember which episode, but were you involved with that? Any interesting stories or anything to say about Space Ghost?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tt9sy/i_am_rob_burnett_executive_producer_of_the_late/c4pj7k2?context=5)|I liked Space Ghost a lot, but was not involved.  I believe the writer you're thinking of is a guy named Matt Harrigan who used to work for us.  Very funny guy.  Very nice guy.
[What formal/ informal education do you think was most beneficial to helping you do what you do? Who is you favorite guest to have on The Late Show? Thanks!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tt9sy/i_am_rob_burnett_executive_producer_of_the_late/c4pjd0o?context=5)|In some ways my education didn't contribute at all, however, when Jon Beckerman and I were writing ""Ed,"" I found that every ounce of brain was tapped at some point to be used in scripts.
 |The more references I had, the more I know about -- no matter how irrelevant it might seem: from Shakespeare to Art History -- at some point, it came in handy.
 |Favorite guests for me are: Howard Stern, Tom Hanks, Julia Roberts, Steve Martin, Bill Murray, Alec Baldwin, Tina Fey, Marty Short.   And Conan was great last night.  There are more, but I'm forgetting.
 |The people that I admire are the people that realize that while they might be there to promote their project, our show is OUR project.  And they are a part of it.  Guys like Tom Hanks, Steve Martin, Bill Murray, Marty Short work really hard at their appearances.  They are huge stars.  They don't have to do anything.  But they come sometimes in advance and shoot stuff and prepare bits.
 |One of my best memories is directing ""Dave and Steve's Gay Vacation.""  This was Steve Martin's idea.  Jon Beckerman and I wrote a lot of the specifics, but Steve was really the guys behind it.  There was a moment where I was explaining something to Dave and Steve and they're both looking up at me.  It was an out of body experience.  A little voice in my head said, ""Two of the greatest comedians of our generation are listening to you right now.""
[Any thoughts on the Larry Sanders Show ?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tt9sy/i_am_rob_burnett_executive_producer_of_the_late/c4piqaz?context=5)|I was a big fan.  It's all exaggerated of course, but they got the nuances of show business incredibly right.  Show business is awkward, neurotic, ugly, strange and almost every other adjective you can imagine.  
[Morning Rob. You recently Directed your first feature. Do you miss 35mm film? How did you approach We Made This Movie in terms of determining a Directing style and what are the challenges of directing your inaugural feature film as opposed to episodic television and which did you enjoy better?

Thanks for your insights, Rob!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tt9sy/i_am_rob_burnett_executive_producer_of_the_late/c4piqo4?context=5)|My first directing experience was on Ed, which was shot on film.  I know I am supposed to miss film, but I don't think I directed enough on film to have a nostalgic feeling for it.  I directed the pilot of ""Knights of Prosperity"" on video and I loved it.  It's much easier and faster.  You don't have to change lenses.  It gives you great flexibility.
 |Our DP on We Made This Movie is a guy named Chris Sargent who is a big talent.  (Our DP on Ed was Michael Slovis who also is a big talent -- he's now on CSI).  A good DP can make shooting digitally look plenty good.
 |On WMTM, we shot everything the way high school kids would shoot it.  No dollies, no cranes -- nothing they wouldn't have themselves.

[Hey Rob, what do you think was the best time where you felt every joke was hitting the biggest audience with Letterman? Also your favorite joke with it. Thanks!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tt9sy/i_am_rob_burnett_executive_producer_of_the_late/c4pj0x7?context=5)|On a show like Late Show (and Late Night) that's been around so long, there are eras.  Sometimes people want to feel like their particular era was the best or the most important.  I don't think that way.  I think it's all part of a big quilt.
 |The early days of the show -- before I was there -- were magical.  Merrill Markoe and that group redefined television and I don't think anything can compare to those early days.
 |The show had a whole other explosion in the 90s when we first moved to CBS.  I had thought at the end of NBC that Dave couldn't get any more famous, but when the show moved to 11:30 it existed at a whole other level.  We would do stuff and the next day people on the street would talk to me about it.  It was crazy.
 |And I think there's a whole other chapter out there -- whenever Dave ultimately retires.  That will perhaps be the most memorable moment of all.
 |As for my favorite stuff, I think it would be the remotes we did with Dave.  Probably the ""Fun with Rupert"" pieces would be at the top of my list.  Dave was amazing at that.  I laughed all day doing those.
[Did you get to take home any nifty free stuff from the show?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tt9sy/i_am_rob_burnett_executive_producer_of_the_late/c4pk3gf?context=5)|New person comes in.

I am new to it, but I find it fascinating.  I don't have enough time, but I could easily find myself becoming addicted to it.  I love the celebrity stuff, but I'll take all the ""I work at McDonalds"" or ""I just got struck by lightning"" you got.
 |I'd be lying if I didn't say that I am beginning to promote this little movie that Jon Beckerman and I made called We Made This Movie, and I think this is the kind of audience that would enjoy it.

It was a crossroads for all of us.  I always thought Dave would be great at 11:30.
 |One funny thing I remember from that time was how much thought we put into that first show.  It's all Dave cared about.  And then we came in the next day, I remember Dave looking at me and laughing and saying, ""Oh my God, we gotta do more of these!""

[Not even Julia Roberts?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tt9sy/i_am_rob_burnett_executive_producer_of_the_late/c4pmyrl?context=5)|That's really funny.  I actually had originally written: Nope.  Except for Julia Roberts.  No joke.
[As someone finishing school in TV production, do you have any advice for me on producing my own shows? as in, what is the best way to present and pitch a show? who are the best people to pitch to?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tt9sy/i_am_rob_burnett_executive_producer_of_the_late/c4pjt06?context=5)|TV shows are more about the people doing them than the idea.   It's like starting a business.  ""Ed"" cost $2 million an episode.  We made 83 hours.  That's $166 million dollars that people had to pay for that show.
 |Of course they didn't have to write that check all up front, but you get the idea: they want people with track records, who have shown they can run a business.
 |Having said that, when Jon and I did Ed we had no track records and had no idea what we were doing.  So I may very well have no idea what I'm talking about.  And yet, that doesn't stop me from talking!
[Ed has launched the careers of so many stars (Justin Long, Julie Bowen, John Slattery and Ginnifer Goodwin\).  How could Paramount or NBC not want to release this?  They release so much other crap.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tt9sy/i_am_rob_burnett_executive_producer_of_the_late/c4pk938?context=5)|That's been my pitch exactly: ""Come on!  We're just as crappy as everyone else!""
 |We were certainly blessed with that cast.  A lot talent there.  And very nice people.  Many of them are my best friends today.
 |Here's a little ""Ed"" anecdote for you: I wrote and directed Larry Teng and Lesley Boone's wedding proposal.
 |That's right.  Larry Teng, who worked on the show, and who is now a big time director, came to me and Jon and asked if he could propose to Lesley on camera.
 |So we wrote a scene where the whole cast is sitting around the bowling alley and Molly (Lesley's character) is talking about how she's the only one without a spouse.  (This was after Ed had proposed to Carol.)  She's going on and on about how she's never going to find anyone.  It was a completely made up scene.  And then Larry -- who was not an actor on the show.  He worked in post production -- walks in, gets on one knee and asks Lesley to marry him.
 |The look on her face was amazing.  She had no idea what was going on and we had it all on film.  Her parents were there and came out.  It was really nice.  And now they have the cutest babies ever!!!
[I'm an aspiring writer, still in college right now but want to get in the TV industry after I graduate. How did you go about transitioning from intern to writer on the show?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tt9sy/i_am_rob_burnett_executive_producer_of_the_late/c4pjfwq?context=5)|The best advice if you want to be a writer is to write.  It sounds obvious, but you'd be surprised.  When I got my job at Letterman, I was already writing movies with a buddy of mine from college -- Steve Engel (who is now a bigshot successful TV writer).  But my point is to just keep writing, get it into the hands of people as close to show business as you can, and hope for the best.  It's also worth trying to get any kind of job on a production to get in the door.
[PS: Knights of Prosperity never got its due, I loved that show. I still think about the one where Donal Logue pretends to be an architect all the time. And of course ""Ed"" was excellent as well. Both gone too soon.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tt9sy/i_am_rob_burnett_executive_producer_of_the_late/c4pjfwq?context=5)|In fact, at one point we were put on a plane to go meet STeven Spielberg, and got hired to write a movie for him.

I believe in real life that he's a quiet guy, but what about during the Fartman / Private Parts times?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tt9sy/i_am_rob_burnett_executive_producer_of_the_late/c4pk7rs?context=5)|One of my first experiences with Howard as a guest that I remember from way back was going into his dressing room before the show.  He had three tapes and he asked me to look at them and tell me what I thought.  He was considering showing them on our show.  (I honestly don't remember what they were.)
 |I watched the tapes and told him I thought he should play one and not all three because they didn't build on themselves.  He couldn't have been nicer.  He said, ""Right!  You're right.  Thank you.  We'll just show one.""
 |It was a lovely interaction.  He ran the one tape.  It played well.  It was all good.
 |Next morning I tune into the radio show and hear him going on and on about how dare I tell him what's funny.  Who does Rob Burnett think he is?  Telling me what I can do and can't do?  Etc...
 |I think it's all professional wrestling with Howard.   I love the guy.
[So here's my question: what happened? He is more like Leno these days and he kind of kisses his guests ass (sorry Dave\).

That's one thing Dave isn't.  He never clung to his old act.  At times, as headwriter, it was painful because Dave started refusing to do stuff that you knew would work.  But he was right.  He has a compass for himself like no one else I have ever seen.  I admire it.

tu3s0,1,2012-05-18,Summer work Legality Issues,Porkchopdreams,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/tu3s0/summer_work_legality_issues/,"Hey Reddit, 

I am in desperate need of some help.
I recently accepted an internship down in the states for the summer. The internship is a paid one for a few months down here. The problem is, I am a Canadian citizen, and I have no idea how to go about the legality issues involved. I've looked into a few forms, and the J1 looks most appropriate, however, the company I am interning with is smaller and has never dealt with this type of program, and thus I need a bit of guidance for both me and the company.

There is unfortunately an extra caveat to this problem. I am already down here in the states, and I have been working for the last month with the company. It has not been until this week that the company informed me I need to find a way to make this internship legal (long story short, they've been to busy and in need of help to notice until now that this situation is illegal).

twm65,0,2012-05-20,Girlfriend's work visa was denied. Airline won't refund her ticket. Any ideas?,ajfriend,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/twm65/girlfriends_work_visa_was_denied_airline_wont/,"My girlfriend is set up with an internship in India through AIESEC, where she'd be doing marketing and advertising for a technology company. She bought her plane tickets while her work visa application was being reviewed. The embassy got back to her, basically saying that they were suspicious of her being a journalist. They even asked her to write up a document where she would promise to not write any articles about India while she was there, or anytime after she left. We're not really sure why they're making such a big fuss, but we've heard that it might be because they're worried about articles highlighting, say, government corruption and hurting foreign investment.

Her visa has so far been delayed twice, and she's already had to pay to push back her flight plans. Right now, her case is under further ""review"", and it's unclear how long this process will take, or if she'll even get a visa at the end of it. She was super excited to be going to India, but this process has been so long and is costing her so much money that she'd like to cancel her ticket and get a refund. However, the airline, British Airways, isn't willing to refund her. Even to change the ticket to go somewhere else would involve ridiculous fees.

She has two flights. The Brazil-London flight is more expensive and is refundable. The London-Delhi flight is cheaper, but non-refundable. The airline is telling her that the restrictions of the London-Delhi flight apply to both, so she can't even get the refund on the Brazil flight, which seems pretty sleazy to me.

Does she have any hope of getting any sort of refund, seeing as this visa issue is out of her hands? Even just changing the flight to come visit me in the U.S. would be great, as long as the change fees aren't too bad.

Unfortunately, the airline isn't being very flexible. She told them her situation, and asked what her options were. She was basically told that she'd lose her money.

Are there any negotiating tricks that can help her out here? Any advice would be greatly appreciated."

twe9s,3,2012-05-20,"[Help] Decision making anxiety, I should be ecstatic, but rather I'm frustrated.",Sardelic,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/twe9s/help_decision_making_anxiety_i_should_be_ecstatic/,"Hi all, lurked for a little, first time posting. It's a bit of a rant before my question, included for context and to just structure the situation into text for myself.

I'm male, 22, and have always been a fairly anxious person. Typically this manifested itself as a general stress; it's rarely crippling however, and normally it just coerces me into working harder at things. Except for the scenario where I have to make a reasonably life-altering decision, with no clear best answer, under a time limit. In these cases (happened once before), it leaves me mentally paralysed; feeling frustrated, melancholy, and running circles inside my own head.

I've just completed an internship with a company that I joined straight out of university. I work as a programmer, it's what I'm good at and what I enjoy. Working for the company has always been somewhat mediocre; perfectly bearable, sometimes enjoyable, It's not the best environment but I'm doing what I'm skilled at. Nonetheless, I've cautiously kept an eye open for a better opportunity.

Well, it comes time to sign a new contract, making me a permanent member of the staff. At the same time, I received a job offer from another company doing work I know I'd be fairly good at, but potentially boring. I walked into work on Tuesday fairly confident that I would be staying on with my current company, sticking to programming.

Well, I get told that my old company no longer exists due to financial problems. I'm offered a position at the company that owned mine, but that it will come with significant changes to my job description. I'd still be programming, but additionally I'd be doing more or less anything else ""technical"" the boss needs me to do. This is terrifying, as I've always gravitated to things that I know I'm competent at, and the company does work I'm not particularly interested in. The company also offers to pay me a little more than the other offer I received.

Now I'm stuck. I've been trying to decide since Tuesday. On the one hand I have an exciting work environment and easy, moderately interesting work (or so I expect). On the other I have slightly better pay, a work environment I already know, and the opportunity to learn a skill I otherwise wouldn't. Additionally, if I really do end up hating my work or find something considerably better, leaving a place I've worked at for six months seems better than quitting after a month at the new position... I find some comfort in having an escape route, even if it remains unused...

I'll be the first to admit that I'm in a brilliant position, I have no right to complain. However turning down one or the other leaves me at a loss. I'm delaying in answering, frustrating myself and them too. So here I sit, pondering the situation over and over.

How do you guys cope with these sort of scenarios? How do you console yourself with picking one or the other?

Thanks!"
twdrw,1,2012-05-20,Don't know my next move. Help?,chronogumbo,BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/twdrw/dont_know_my_next_move_help/,"It wasn't really a breakup, since we never officially dated, but it feels all the same.

We were best friends for the last year. We began hooking up over the spring semester and she told me she had feelings for me. Due to many of her and my insecurity issues, I thought it was best if we didn't date, so I told her I didn't like her, and it was a bad idea.

We continued hooking up anyway, me freaking out a lot because I thought I was (and i was) hurting her, but more because I was hurting myself.

A few weeks ago, a friend of hers randomly asked her out, and she said yes. This caused me to freak out, and tell her how I really felt on an emotional whim. She freaked out, and we didn't talk for a few days. When we began talking again, it quickly went back to our old flirtatious ways, even though she was seeing this guy, who was goign to another state for an internship the entire summer.

On thursday, I managed to get really, really drunk. I got lost, and couldn't find my way home. I gave her a call, and she was at a bar with our friends. She told me I was right near my house, and i'm being stupid and should walk home. I was really, REALLY drunk and honestly could not figure out left from right, which I explained to her to no avail. I stumbled downtown somehow and ran into her and our friends. She wouldn't speak to me, and was really upset. 

The next day, I dropped some of her belongings at her dorm, as I was emptying my room and leaving my apartment. I told her to get her things, and go. She grabbed them, said thanks, and went into her place, not before looking back at me as I drove away.

I am now home for a few weeks, before I go back to my school for a job, where she is also on campus taking summer classes. We're not speaking currently, and I don't know if she's sorry, or pissed, or anything.

I'm just confused. I don't know what to do, and I don't know know what to think."
tw39n,18,2012-05-20,"Buying my first suit, and I'm hoplelesslysmall. (shopping experience/need advice)",hopelesslysmall,malefashionadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/tw39n/buying_my_first_suit_and_im_hoplelesslysmall/,"warning: I just posted this and saw the real length for the first time, it's really long!


Hey MFA, I've been reading around here for the past few weeks in anticipation of buying my first suit. The suit doesn't have a specific purpose, really, but I'm a 21-year-old college student and will probably have an accounting internship next summer, hopefully a job in the field soon after, and everything that comes with those positions. So I might not need a suit tomorrow, or next week - but I'd like to be prepared. Plus, suits are cool. 

So with my (very) basic understanding of suits I picked up here, I went out to try things on.


First: I've only measured my chest. 34"" by my friend's measurements. I'm also 5'6, and weigh 125lbs. So I'm pretty short, pretty skinny, generally unsubstantial. Looking online before I went to stores, probably too small. Oh well, what the hell, let's just try 'em on, it won't be so bad.

I went to Macy's first, because they have like 30-40% off some stuff, plus I had a 25% off discount coupon, plus I was hoping they'd give me a macy's account for an extra 10 or 15% off my purchase and I could start building some goddamn credit. So I tried on their stuff, even though it was all 36. Alfani and Bar III, their in-house brands, even the ""slim"" stuff was just a mess of fabric when I put it on. I don't know to what extent a tailor can fix shit, but all of this stuff was beyond redemption I'd think. The other brands offered a similar fit - CK, lauren by RL, TH. I'm not up-to-snuff-enough with the technicals on why suits fit like shit, e.g. was it the armholes or shoulders or etc., but, well, I just felt like I was stepping into a blanket with holes in it.

I tried kids sections, but as I expected I am kid-sized but not kid-proportioned. The fit was just off.

An aside, I had my girlfriend with me, so this isn't all self-analysis. She happily agreed that I looked like shit. What a jerk. 

Went to other places. Zaras is supposed to have small stuff, right? I couldn't find a 34, wasn't a fan of any of the suits I saw there (little to no wool, mostly cotton/linen/polyester/other fabrics I've never heard of, guessing shitty synthetic stuff, and I'm hoping for 100% wool like most guides recommend) and the 36s felt like a slim-fitting blanket. The guy at brooks bros. told me to try on the kids suits with similar results to macy's except with a nicer suit - still not happening. Their other suits, obviously big, boxy, american. He offered MTM - I politely declined. I'd assume BB MTM is out of my pricerange. Everything there was. Not sure why I went.


That's about it. I skipped Nordstrom - out of my budget, though I'd love to go and try on some AEs sometime (is it a dick move to find my size, leave, and wait for a deal on factory seconds??)...JCP, other cheap departments, well I don't want a shitty suit and I'm sure they carry the same as Macy's. Heard great things about H&amp;M (not quality wise at all, but for a small guy), unfortunately the closest is 1 hr 45 min away. I'd prefer not to drive 3 hours round trip for the possibility.


My last, desperate stop was some scummy-looking local suit shop. The salesman there saw me and his eyes lit up. He rushed me into the first 34s he could find. Wow, it fits alright - not great, but maybe we could fix it. Only ~~$99~~$199, you say? I asked him to stop trying to get into my pants (well, he just wanted me to change into the suit pants) so I could think for one goddamn second - now the suit is $99 so my ""this shit is shit"" alarm is going off. He was a used car salesman who wandered into a suit shop and was selling me a car with a rebuilt engine without telling me. The jacket looked a bit...off. I was interested in what material it was made of, it had a ""super 150 wool"" tag on the arm, but I looked inside the jacket anyway and it said ""shell made from rayon/trueran"". 

Not quite sure what a ""shell"" was, but assuming ""shell"" means ""the outer part of the jacket"" I wasn't too alright with buying a rayon suit jacket. Not sure why it had a super 150 wool tag on it, too - blend of wool/rayon/trueran? Wool on the interior, rayon on the ""shell""? I'm not sure. But I don't want a shitty, shiny, glistening jacket (on second glance, it did have a noticeable...sheen to it). I didn't feel like asking him and getting a bullshit answer. ""But, but, but, bu....the engine's only *a little bit* rebuilt, sir."" I had a bad vibe from this place the second I stepped in, he looked and acted like a scumbag used-car-salesman-shark-asshole, I saw the word ""rayon"" in every jacket pocket I looked in, so I just told him I'd think about it and left. 

Now I'm here. I'm sorry for the lengthy post. Maybe I should open a blog. But I just wanted to give you guys the full rundown on what happened, why I think I'm trapped in a hopeless situation. MFA might've set my standards pretty high, but even pre-MFA I think everything I saw would've resulted in a ""pass"".


Opinions? Options? I'm looking into MTM now, it's a little more than I hoped to spend, but I guess it will be a little more now and a little more in a year when I need a suit **tomorrow** and can't wait to get an MTM. 

Thick as Thieves looks awesome. 

Propersuit looks cool, but they're a bit more pricey, and not in my city ATM. I will be in a city they're in on vacation, in a couple months, so it is an option (if they stay in one city for months, not sure how they work, guess I'll email). Having them measure me is definitely an upside over TAT, and their suits look great as well. 


I'm not sure about spending about $480 (accoring to TAT) to $650 (cheapest propersuits) but I guess it's really not expensive at all, considering I was ready to drop around $200-250 in Macy's for an average suit on a deep, deep discount. And I've heard MTM might not be the best option for your first suit on MFA, not sure why though, and not sure what other choices I have. Time is hardly an issue, though, so I think that knocks off a big con of MTMs like thick as thieves.


So, once again, I write too much. Just looking for guidance. The $650 for Propersuits is basically a huge extension of what I'm willing to pay, so if you have any suggestions don't take that $650 and say ""if you can spend just $100 more..."" because I'm already spending hundreds more (not cutting into food budgets or catastrophe-savings, don't worry). And if it seems I'm kind of set on TAT/Propersuits, it's because I kind of am, but with enough persuasion against it I can be changed.


Thanks so much, MFA. Sorry for boring you with my shit.


**EDIT** Hopefully this will be seen again. This is in reference to what I perceived as the scummy local suit store. I thought the suit was rayon, possibly some kind of wool/rayon blend, due to an inner tag that said ""exterieure/shell trueran/rayon"" but a kind MFAer pointed out that shell = interior...which doesn't make a lot of sense, but chances are he's more experienced than I...and that the rest of the suit could be, as advertised, wool - or at least wool-ish.

Well, I ended up going back and asking the guy. He said the rayon was in fact the lining of the suit, and then told me I'd have 7 days to return it. So I went for it, so I wouldn't have to sneak pictures. The guy's still a scumbag, though, just throwin' it out there, so I took pictures. Unfortunately my camera isn't too hot and my house is 98% dim lighting so the pictures are destroyed by flash and such, couple I took without are way dark. Not sure if you could tell what material it is based off of these pics... I tried, though.


http://imgur.com/a/piVBw


Personally, I think I'll be taking it back. I feel dirty wearing it now, whether it's wool or rayon or fuckin' top-quality cashmere. But I would like to know what you guys think. Again, sorry for shitty pics, I might try tomorrow in some better spots in the house (maybe even outdoors, I have yet to see sunlight hit this thing) "
tvokv,2,2012-05-20,A Letter: Because It's Just Time to Move On,Lost_and_Myopic,BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/tvokv/a_letter_because_its_just_time_to_move_on/,"My ex was always on Reddit and telling me about it. He never really told me his user name because he values anonymity and uses Reddit as a means to get feedback on things. I actually knew what it was for a while (when you're on Reddit all the time and leave it open, you're not keeping it a secret) but respected his privacy and eventually forgot what it was. If you knew me, you'd know that I am extremely curious and love finding out things that people are specifically keeping from me. So the whole respecting privacy thing was really difficult. Anyways, after he broke up with me I stopped talking to him all together (easiest way to handle a break up for me). There are a lot of things that I just never got to say to him. Some because I didn't realize, some because I brushed them aside, some because I was so upset that he was breaking up with me that my head went blank. 

I'm twenty and he is about the same age. We didn't go out for very long – Less than a year with six or seven months of getting to know each other closer before that. I have a bad history with guys, so this time, I put everything I could into making things work between us. I feel a bit wronged. Luckily, I'm young and decently educated and decently attractive. There's a lot of time for me to find someone else. Since there are a lot of unsaid things, I thought of here. After a couple of weeks of poking around Reddit, I decided to post a letter to him. I've written about seven different versions and each time they have gotten shorter. The first was somewhere around six pages. I'm tired of writing to myself and having the letter go no where. So here's my letter and it's just time for me to let go.

Dear Harry,

It was not completely my fault for you being unhappy or me who started all of our “fights”. I was fairly reasonable and did not expect too much for a serious, committed relationship (which by the way, you put yourself in one once you asked me to marry you and I did not pressure you into that) - just too much for you. Breaking up with me and not taking any responsibility for anything really messed with my head. It was hard to break the feeling that everything was my fault when you didn't take any blame. I did not suddenly become type A. I've been that way all of my life and you knew me for a while before we started dating. It would have been kinder if you had just said that you couldn't be with me because I was going abroad for a year. Standard, generic, and reasonable.

You were only amazing when you were physically there with me. Otherwise, I very rarely felt considered. You never understood me. You hardly ever knew what I wanted or needed. I had to flat out tell you what I needed or take it for myself. Even after telling you, you couldn't really deliver. You kept promising me things and not following through until too late or not at all. Quite often, I would have to remind you because you would forget. You would disappear when you had something to talk to me about or when we started to get emotionally closer. The reasons you gave me when you broke up with me are things that you hadn't brought up with me before. You never wanted to talk. When you messed up too badly or we'd be fighting for a while, you'd make a larger gesture. It was like you thought that would make up for everything even though you made very few changes. And you wondered why I always seemed disappointed.

I resent you a little for trying to tell me how I should have acted at dinner when you broke up with me. Yes, there were better ways for me to have acted, but there were also better ways for you to have acted. I asked you to dinner specifically stating that my roommate wasn't going to be home. You agreed to it five days in advance and I thought that you understood what that meant. I assumed that a straight guy would at the very least realize it as an opportunity to have sex everywhere in the house. Turns out, I was going out with a guy who no longer thought about having sex with me. Then you didn't tell me that you had to leave early until we were on our date. Please note that you didn't say anything about coming back or how long it would take until you were leaving my place to go tutor the guy. All you said was you had to leave and as it turns out, you stayed with me on the date for less time than I had prepared for that night. I went to the store, cooked for hours, cleaned, dressed up, etc. Do you know how long it takes to layer the cheesecake brownies alone? The were made from scratch and I made them because I know you like them so much. Then you didn't even stay for dessert. I wanted everything to be perfect especially with all the fighting we had done recently. So yes, I got disappointed. I didn't want you to come back over because I didn't want you to be around me being disappointed. Clearly, the night meant very little to you and a lot to me. Then you decided that I was mad at you didn't come over when you said you would or talk to me the next day and broke up with me the day after that. 

You broke up with me shortly after you stopped needing me. In the last couple of weeks, you dropped your class that was stressing you out, talked to TA/friend about your issues with him finally, talked with your mom and found out that she was okay with the fraternity and supportive of your education, found a new dream of getting that internship. Around the beginning of those few weeks you told me that you needed me (I was really disappointed when you told me that). I talked with you through everything, held you, supported you, etc. Well, you stopped needing me and then you dumped me. I've told you before, I don't want someone who needs me, I want someone who wants to be with me. As it turns out, you were the kind that needed me. And now I feel like an idiot.

I finally figured out why I was so upset at country swing dance. I was extremely jealous of K. You probably don't realize it, but K is the only person you talk about outside of your family. I don't mean mentioning like you do all of your friends. In fact, you talk about K more than you talk about people in your family. Do you know how hard it was to listen to you when she was sexually assaulted? Yes, it was not a good thing that happened, but I listened to it for a week. A week that you kept reminding me of every situation that can be described as sexual assault that happened to me. And every situation you reminded me of was worse than what happened to K, but I didn't get any support like she did. I didn't have someone constantly trying to help me or worry about me. What happened to K barely registers as sexual assault on my scale. It was high school-age summer camp crap to me. I didn't need to have conversations and conversations about her and M and how horrible he was for her and how she needed to move on. You were far too excited for her switch to an open relationship. It also hurts that you only asked me to go east coast swing dance when you promised K that you would go. It also hurts that you would keep those promises to her but you couldn't keep a stupid, simple promise to get my tupperware from your brother. You drove upset, drunk, in the snow to meet her because you promised her you would go dancing and she wasn't even there. I would have loved to be taken out dancing more. It's quite pathetic for a girl to have her favorite dance partner/boyfriend not take her out to go dancing just to have fun and dance with her. You were extremely attracted to her when you first met her. You called me K after sex once when we first started dated. You said you were just friends so I ignored everything. That's why I didn't even know I was jealous until a few weeks later when I tried to go dancing again. I wouldn't be surprised if you two got together after a while of her being single once she's single. If you do, I wish you the best. She's an amazing girl and I think you would be better at giving her what she needs than you ever could with me.

Thank you for breaking up with me. We were horribly matched and I don't know if I ever would have broken up with you. It was amazing to get my acceptance email for the scholarship and not have to feel guilty for leaving you for a year. I was so happy that I cried. Thank you for showing me what making love was. It's changed my view on sex a lot and now I only sleep with people I have a stronger emotional connection with. Thank you for teaching me I need someone who will do what they say they will, plan ahead, keep a schedule, and can take care of himself – someone who's grown up a little more. I'm really tired of taking care of guys. I suppose I really do need someone like me – which is something I have been strongly opposed to since D. Which brings me to: thank you for helping me get over D. I barely panic when I see him and this is the first time I've been home where I don't feel scared and anxious. I also now know that I want to get married someday. Thank you for giving me a few wonderful moments even if overall it was a waste of time. Good luck with everything.

	Sincerely,
		M&amp;L

P.S. I didn't mind trees as much as you thought I did. I minded them when associated with you. This might have something to do with the fact that you told me that you quit before we started dating, started up again a little while later and said that you would only a little, passively lied to me about how much you did, directly lied to me about it for months, it made your depression worse, it took you away from  school and friends and family, you didn't tell me for two months about being arrested, and then continued to tell me stories about it."
tvnmj,9,2012-05-20,I constantly think about killing myself in hopes of just starting over because I feel like a failure,1259385594989823,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/tvnmj/i_constantly_think_about_killing_myself_in_hopes/,"This is going to sound like a lot of first world bitching, because from anyone else's standpoint, that's what it is--trivial whining from a relatively ""well-off"" person. But to me, it's fucking hell.

I'm a year out of college. I moved to a large city away from my home and the town of my alma mater to take an unpaid internship that eventually turned into the vastly underpaid job I have now. I'm not ""scraping by"" in the sense that I'm struggling to put food on the table. I've got an apartment, I can generally afford food (even though in the beginning I had to dip into the savings I had accrued from working throughout college), and sometimes I can afford new clothes and nicer things.

But I'm fucking unsatisfied. Ever since I was a kid, I've had major problems with competitiveness and comparing myself to others. I can never be happy unless I am the best, and on the relative scale of things, I am nowhere near the most successful of the people I know. It seems like everyone around me, friends and acquaintances, has somehow landed well-paying jobs doing things they love, living in cities they love, hanging out with their friends. I have no friends in the city I'm in. My best friends live across state and across the country.

I find myself hating and resenting my friends. And hating and resenting myself for having those horrible feelings toward people I should probably be happy for. I push people away because I resent them, and am disgusted by my jealousy. This is so embarrassing to admit, but I have one ""frenemy"" in particular of whom I am insanely jealous, and who is doing extremely well in her life and having success pursuing the dream that we both have in common. I find myself hating her because her family is rich and she has the means and ""backup funds to fall back on"" to give her the freedom to do what I would like to do, too.

The obvious solution is to move and pursue a new job... I've tried searching for new jobs, but it's unbelievably discouraging to email your resume out to twenty people and not even get a single, ""We've received your resume"" reply. I don't feel as if I ""deserve"" a job, but I sure as fuck would like the chance to prove that I am worthy of one. It seems like I can't even get my foot in the door. (And here comes the jealousy--somehow my friends have swanky jobs and can afford to travel to other countries or fly around to visit each other, and are going out, eating nice food, buying nice things, and generally enjoying their lives.) (I feel like I sound incredibly whiny in this paragraph in particular. Please forgive me.)

I have a boyfriend and he is very loving and supportive, but also poor. He has to comfort me when I break down emotionally in complete anger and disappointment and dissatisfaction with myself. This happens once a month. A sobbing fit. Sad that we never go out (can't afford it), sad that I have no one here except for him.

People tell me I'm fucked up for resenting people around me, or that I should be thankful that I have a job at all, etc. etc. And that makes me feel worse, because I can't help how I feel. People are constantly telling me, **""Do something about it.""** I don't know if anyone else has ever felt this way, but I just feel paralyzed. Like I don't even want to try.

Which brings me to the topic of this post--that I am constantly haunted by the dark desire to just kill myself and somehow get a chance to ""start over."" To do things right the second time around. To put myself on the road to success, not down this path of failure that I seem to be taking. 

I don't think I could ever go through with it. I have been suicidal in the past and never pushed myself to even attempting the deed, but I've been close. I feel myself slipping into the darkness. Sometimes I just cry by myself--and then feel pathetic in the face of those who tell me to do something, which only adds to the self loathing.

I feel like I haven't adequately described exactly how potent and damaging my feelings of jealousy are, but I just can't find the words to convey the feeling properly.

If you read this, thanks. I just felt like I needed to get this off my chest, even if no one sees it. I hope no one recognizes me.

**tl;dr** Poisonous jealousy, feelings of worthlessness, and self-dissatisfaction are ruining me."

This leads to phone conversations, which then leads to relationship.  I moved to where she was living and got an awesome job.  We lived together, things were going great.  We had a great friendship, deep conversations, and awesome sex.  Then the economy turned south and while my job was still secure, it was far less awesome.  I decided to move back to our home state to attend graduate school.  She was fine with this and even encouraged me, as it would lead to a more secure life for us later on.  We bought a home together and she travelled frequently to and from our hometown for her work.  
Two years of graduate school passes and everything is still good between us.  It's not perfect because we see each other frequently, but not all the time.  Her job gets transferred to the other side of the country... much too far to travel to and from our home.  I made the decision to transfer graduate schools to move with her.  We began renting out our house.  Things were good, but money was tight.  Living in a new city and attending graduate school left little time for a decent job.  I got some great internships which have led to some great opportunities.  However, this lack of funds caused her to have to work more in order to compensate.  Her job requires 10-14 hour days and sometimes 7 day weeks (This in not just due to our need for money, but also the nature of her industry).  She's often tired, and the relationship wanes.  I try to pick up the slack, taking care of our dogs, doing laundry, cleaning, picking up groceries etc., all while going to school and working internships on a full-time basis.  I want to make it as easy as possible for her.  Sex falls to about once every 3 to 4 weeks, and she all but stops communicating.  We have lots of fun times, but some mediocre times too.  I try to reinforce that once I'm done with school, things will be better.  I have some great leads at jobs and the money will be good.  She can work less, even stop at some point.  We can travel and do all the things we've put off.  Plus, we'll have more time together to enjoy each other.  Last week, I graduated.  The night before graduation, she tells me she needs a break from our relationship.  She says she feels too tied down, like she can't enjoy her life.  She wants to ""find out where she wants her life to go.""  Tells me I'm her best friend and she still loves me.  
This past Monday, I moved into our spare bedroom to give her time and space.  I thought maybe she's having an hard time at work because she's been working so hard as I worked toward this goal.  I've been leaving her alone to give her the space she says she wants.  Meanwhile, after I moved out of our joint bedroom, she's been coming home later and later.   She got home at 12:30a the first night, then 1:30a, 2:15a, 3:30a, and last night she didn't come home.  She finally arrives at 12:30p this afternoon.  
Flashback to the past few years since our recent move together.  She has a cell phone but rarely uses it...she keeps it on silent most of the time.  It's impossible to get a hold of her because she's so against being reachable constantly.  I've gotten used to it, but it can be frustrating.  Anyway, starting this week, on my graduation day, she's been texting the same number over and over.  About 70 texts since last Sunday.  Late at night, even after she gets home.  I notice this as I'm paying our cell phone bill.  Definitely out of character for her as she was so against having her phone on and/or using it regularly.
Then, finally, after not seeing her all week, I see her yesterday morning as she's leaving for work.  She asks if I still love her and gets emotional.  I tell her, ""Of course I love you sweetheart.""  She leaves and I say bye.  After not coming home last night, since she's been home today, she doesn't really even acknowledge me.  I told her that I'm giving her space, but it's hard living in the same place and not seeing each other occasionally.  However, we've been in a long-term relationship, and it doesn't need to be like this.  She says that ""it's awkward for her.""  I told her if she's seeing someone else, to tell me so I'm not holding out hope that we might reconcile.  She couldn't even respond to my statement.  
I'm starting to study for my state licensure test beginning tomorrow and this is making it very hard to concentrate.  I've always felt like she was perfect for me, and I care about her deeply, but I can't be with her if she wanted a break to cheat with someone else.  

Advice Reddit?

TL;DR:  Girlfriend of 6+ years wanted a break, texting an unknown number constantly, but giving me hope of reconciliation.  Not sure if she's cheating or how to even respond."

Last summer I stayed at school, so this is basically the first time I am going to be in the area for more than 1 month. I was wondering if there were any places I can start volunteering asap for non-profit organizations. I would like to do around 100 hours before I head back to school in August.

On a different note, I was wondering if anyone could help me find some internships in the area for Hospitals, Research Labs, or Doctor's offices. I applied(and got rejected from LVHN) already. 

I tried to setup a place I could volunteer at and an internship a couple in January and everything seemed fine, but as soon as I came back they both fell through. I am actively searching but since I am new to the area it is a little difficult. Any help would be much appreciated :)  "

My job description does not include anything but MATLAB coding (and really only computational methods within MATLAB), so I have no idea how to do this.  However, I think it would be cool if I could impress my boss and load this information into a C++ workspace.

So, the CFTC has [these reports](http://cftc.gov/MarketReports/CommitmentsofTraders/HistoricalCompressed/index.htm) that can be loaded through excel.  How do I get those into a file on my PC that I can use in C++?

txok8,6,2012-05-21,A day in the life of a Community Access Specialist,ilovecheesepie,ADayInTheLifeOf,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADayInTheLifeOf/comments/txok8/a_day_in_the_life_of_a_community_access_specialist/,"Hello, Reddit! I work with adults with developmental disabilities. My job used to include Employment Support/ Community Access Specialist but with the economic climate (especially for those who are developmentally disabled) we, as and organization, have decided to drop our employment program! 

What is Community Access? Community Access is an integrated community program allowing those with developmental disabilities to access the community in a safe and rewarding way. The individuals I work with designate goals for skill building based on their talents and interests and for each outing, we choose an activity that meets those goals. It is also my job to find interventions to better improve someone's skills. For example: One of my clients has OCD and we are working on saying ""Oh well"" compulsively when he is denied access to something (i.e: Coffee... as he is not allowed caffeine) rather than self injurious behaviors that exist at present.
Pay varies by region/county/agency. I am paid about $10.80/hour but that's after a raise. I started at $10. Pay is not too negotiable because of the way agencies are financed. We exist off of waiver dollars from the state and can only make a certain amount off of our time with each client which limits what we can make individually. Schedule for my agency is typically 8-4 but the way appointments go, it's more of a make your own schedule deal. I also plan a month ahead. Basically the goal is to get clients out as much as possible but we can only go out maximum of 20 hours a month with each client, which comes up pretty quickly for some of them.

Pros? I would say that the vast diversity of clients you get is one of the pros. I genuinely care about all of my clients and work towards their best interests and I have a hard time understanding why when it is so much fun to go out with them! I've been everywhere from hardware stores to amusement centers to casinos to bowling alleys. You get a companion who is basically excited to be there because frankly, it's one of the only times they get out of the house. As a grad student with night classes, It's also wonderful to make my own schedule. If I have nothing to do on a Friday afternoon, I leave! I think it's also great to be using everything I've learned in my undergraduate (I'm a Human Services grad) such as grant writing and fundraising. I am currently planning a fundraiser for my entire agency as we are only a dept within a larger organization.

Cons: Paratransit basically shows up whenever they want to in our county, which puts clients on the bus upwards of an hour each way if they're lucky. It can be really aggravating when a paratransit van shows up for the person's ride an hour or so late and you're supposed to meet another client elsewhere in 20 minutes or when you have an appt after work for yourself (luckily, this hasn't happened to me yet). Also, dealing with county regulators is a pain. They make some of the most arbitrary changes because... I don't know. It's supposed to be to improve best practice but in our county, policy makers are very disconnected from the practice. Recently, the change made was that we need to record outings down to the minute. Our agency also assists with toileting (which a lot of agencies don't do) so I have some poop stories up my sleeve. That can be a con if you're not into it but you really get used to it. If you've ever worked in daycare, it's very much akin.


Even with the cons, I would argue that this is the best job I've ever had. I am constantly making a difference in my client's lives and I can see it. I get paid to go out and do fun things like go bowling or watch movies, or even a simple walk and you find ways to make mundane things like walking fun- even if it's just to get a smile out of your client. Unfortunately, I am probably going to be vacating my position in a year because I will be doing an internship in school counseling that I need to complete for grad school but that's bigger and better things? I get to use my skills in this job to better influence the lives of my students!

tx5kr,1,2012-05-21,"Some useful revelations on my breakup 2 months ago and the relationship we had together, and some questions on where to go from here since she is moving back to the city and we are bound to run into each other.",[deleted],BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/tx5kr/some_useful_revelations_on_my_breakup_2_months/,"Let me start by saying we are young, I'm a 21(m), she is 19 (f).

We met at a dive bar, I was in a lonely place in my life, I had been drinking too much, was failing school, and was generally in a poor way. She was really nice to me, even if I didn't think she was *that* attractive, and she was confident, in a lot of ways she picked me up. I'm a very shy person, so I didn't really make any moves, it took me several hours to get up the nerve to kiss her, and we went back to my place and had great sex. I told her it was only my second time having sex, and she was surprised.

We kept hooking up like that (her coming over late, having sex, and then leaving) for a few weeks. Then, when she was on her period, she said she couldn't hang out with me. I said ""why?"" and suggested we get dinner and see a movie instead, because I really liked this girl. I think it was ""Due Date"" which I didn't even pay attention to because I was so nervous about being there with her.

We both had come from rough families. I had been severely abused when I was 8 by my bipolar mother, she had an abusive father who had left their family. We both had trust issues, anxiety, etc.

About a month after meeting her, we discussed what we were, and decided to be ""official"" since we were already exclusive together.

Not long after, a few weeks, I told her that I loved her, and about 15 minutes later, she said she loved me too. It was the first time either of us had said that.

So, our relationship started in an odd way to say the least, but I enjoyed it, and in general we were very good to each other.

I took a semester off of school and basically did nothing, so I had all the time to dedicate to her. When I went back to class the next semester, I didn't have the same amount of time for her. I was basically a boring boyfriend, I smoked a lot, didn't ever go out really, made a big deal about walking her home (I walked pretty far to school every day, and I get shin splints sometimes), didn't buy her gifts except for special occasions, and was very possessive and controlling, but also very committed. A few times I joked about how I ""owned her"" because I paid for her dinner, and about how neither of us could do any better, and that we were good together because we ""put up with each other's bullshit."" All generally very immature and hurtful things to say, even if I was joking.

She almost never spent the night at my place, she never opened up to me completely about her abusive past, and in a lot of ways I felt she never trusted me completely, and I never respected her completely.

All in all, it was a very codependent, sex-driven relationship, even though the love was real, it was immature. We were both very complacent also. For example, when I met her, I was determined to stop smoking and go to therapy. Because I was so happy with the relationship, I dropped that idea entirely. Furthermore she had other things going on in her life, whereas I was pretty lazy and boring, and was very dependent on the relationship.

We spent a lot of time together, talked every day, and acted like an old married couple. One thing I noticed was that we would fight a lot whenever I wasn't smoking weed, which was on vacation or when I went to visit her house.

We were together awhile, we had our ups and downs, and then she went abroad to Israel (she has an Israeli family) and right away it started getting worse. She had always said I was the only reason she wouldn't make aliyah, which put me under a lot of pressure. She didn't Skype with me as much as I wanted to, and that made me very insecure and anxious, because I put a lot of time into staying and contact, and I felt neglected. She had said things like she'd rather be spending time with her new friends that spend time on the phone with me. When she decided to change the time she took her birth control at, I got upset because I felt that was something I should have known about, which was just a way of me venting that I felt like we didn't have enough communication, and she didn't care about me. One day, I found out she had been smoking cigarettes, which I had said was a deal breaker for me, and it also made me feel like my trust was betrayed because she could have told me and decided not to, I didn't yell at her or anything, I just told her I wanted her to not smoke. In hindsight, I should have told her the dishonesty was the problem, not the cigarettes. Before I went to visit her for spring break, I told her to make the trip about us, not Israel or her family, and she got really mad at me. She made me promise to be open to Israel, so I knew there were going to be problems ahead, because even though I'm Jewish I really don't like Israeli politics, and I don't identify with the culture at all. I didn't communicate this to her though, because I didn't realize how important it was to her.

Mid-trip, I flipped out on her because I was under a lot of stress, not smoking weed, and I felt trapped because I said I wanted to go back to the hostel, and she remarked on how I didn't speak Hebrew, so how could I get home (one of my triggers for C-PTSD is being trapped and controlled, especially by women). I yelled at her, and said a lot of hurtful things, because in all honesty, I felt like I had been betrayed, neglected, and used. It was a manic episode triggered by stress and feeling trapped. Being a habitual smoker, this side of me had never come out before in such force.

Looking back, we were really bad at communicating how we felt, and with such little contact, it was inevitable that we'd have problems.

She broke up with me the day after I got back over skype, saying that we had different life goals (I want to travel a lot, she needs more stability), I had disrespected her (I honestly did not respect a lot of her views, or her family and friends), and she didn't want to be with someone where there was a chance I'd flip out if I didn't have weed to balance me out.

**TLDR: Met GF at bad place in my life, fell deeply in love, we both had similar rough upbringings and issues, had a very immature and sex/control driven relationship, and she went abroad. We didn't communicate enough, stopped respecting and trusting each other, had some major fights, and she broke up with me over Skype.**

Going forward, I have drastically reduced how much I smoke, I work out a lot more, I go rock-climbing a lot (something I love but didn't do at all while I was dating this girl), I started seeing a therapist and dealing with my huge emotional issues relating to my mother, I started hanging out with my friends way more and actually socializing, started talking with my family more, my room is completely clean (it was a mess before, couldn't see the floor), and in general I'm a lot stronger and more balanced as a person, both physically and emotionally. I even managed to snag myself a great internship for the summer and next semester!

She has moved back to the city, and lives in the dorm where the gym (and rock wall) is located. It is inevitable that we will bump into each other again, which is a scary thought. I would be open to talking with her, but I think we also both need more time to heal. We hurt each other deeply, but in hindsight I realize that we both were letting our pasts dictate our futures. She wanted to go to Israel to escape her father/insecurity, I wanted to travel the world because of my issues with my mom, and at a core level we never trusted, respected, or communicated with each other enough. I realize that the only reason I would want the relationship back is for sex and stability, but I need to go out and meet more people, and figure out who I am, and who I want to be. I was genuinely insecure about only having had sex with two women, and now I'm free to explore. Furthermore she helped me realize a lot of things I didn't like about myself after we broke up, and I've improved myself as a person so much.

I guess I'm open to suggestions on how to deal with seeing her in a constructive way, since in the back of my mind, I want to take the time to talk about everything that happened and communicate openly with her about our relationship, but I don't think that she would want to do that, and I don't think it would bring any closure. Even though I've been going to therapy and working out my issues and learning to communicate better, it might just be better to just not have that conversation. In good time, we will have that conversation, but I don't want to rush into anything, because that would just be me trying to control everything again.

We graduated, woohoo, but I had noticed that during the last few weeks he had been acting strange. I assumed it was just nerves over finals and papers and graduation, but a week after graduation he tells me he has been offered a summer internship on the west coast. I am happy for him and I tell him he needs to take it. He already did.

But then he tells me that he needs me to move out there because he cannot stand the idea of doing long distance. But I told him I couldn't, I had a summer job here, on the east coast. And then he dropped the bomb and told me he had expected that I was going to follow him where he went since he had the more ""important"" career. Things escalated from that and we split up, it really was a horrible break up and both of us are really stubborn so neither of us have contacted each other. 

It has been two weeks. I found out today that I definitely pregnant. Do I just call him up and tell him this, I have no clue what to do reddit, I am still very mad at him, but I think he should know. I just don't know how to bring it up?"

I know I can do it and maybe get by with A's and B's, but I'll have absolutely no time for anything else (personal projects, etc.). This is a problem because my portfolio is very light and my gpa is sitting at a 2.8. Last semester I took 12 hours, which enabled me to get straight A's and build a decent web app. 
So my question is, should I take less hours and graduate a semester late(thus getting a higher gpa and a thicker portfolio) or should I try to graduate as soon as possible?
It's very important to note that I'm paying out of state tuition (15k a semester). Also, I haven't yet completed an internship, and feel that I would be better off doing one next summer(meaning graduating later) rather than after I got my degree.
Thanks!"

tzyqh,2,2012-05-22,Career question from a student and experienced Computer Technician ,teencreeps,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/tzyqh/career_question_from_a_student_and_experienced/,"First, a little background. I am 24 and will be completing my Bachelors (finally) in about a year and a half. I have worked in IT since I was 18. It all started with an internship at a large corporation and I recently got a nice job at a small business. 

I never intended to get into this field, but my uncle offered me the initial internship and I gladly accepted. In the last six months or so I have come to realize that the odds of me applying for a corporate IT job after I graduate are quite high and because of this I have decided to take Computer Programming in C and I fucking love it. It has completely inspired me and I finally enjoy working with computers for the first time ever. I plan to take courses and master these languages:  C, Java, and Python. I also plan to take Networking and Unix/Linux courses. My current major is Political Science. 

My questions are: is it essential that I major in Computer Science if I want to get into this field? Would a minor in Computer Science or Computer Engineering be sufficient (maybe a minor is not even possible). If I want to get into this field after graduation, do you think I should get a degree or certificate in something related to Programming or will taking those classes, getting a BA in a subject and my IT experience be enough to get my foot in the door?

Please ask questions if you need too.

**;TLDR
I have 5+ years of experience in IT, both corporate and small business, I recently started learning programming languages and I love it. I plan to take other languages and Computer Science classes. Should I go for a degree in something related to programming or will the experience be enough to get me in the door? Granted that the IT experience I have does NOT include programming.**

Thanks!

tzno6,1,2012-05-22,Not sure what I should be prioritizing when selecting a college.,Hawlwadig,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/tzno6/not_sure_what_i_should_be_prioritizing_when/,"So right now I am looking at colleges to apply too, and I've pretty much narrowed it down to two choices. I plan on majoring in software engineering. 

One of the colleges is a pretty hardcore tech school. 70% boys (I am a guy by the way). I was looking at the facebook page and I saw no one there that I really thought I could be friends with. Most had anime or video game characters for their profile pictures (not that there's anything wrong with that). I got the same feeling when I went to visit the campus. However, this college has an extremely good job placement rate, which is its main selling point. Above 90% of graduates got a job 6 months out of college.

The other college is more of a real university, with a wide range of majors. When I visited this campus I loved the atmosphere there, and I felt like I could fit right in with the people. However, the engineering department isn't nearly as big, and I am not sure about the job placement rate. However the course work looked a lot more in my favor; a lot of hands on classes as opposed to sitting in front of a computer. This college also does not require internships (they can be taken, though), while the other one does.

So I was just wondering, would one choice be better than the other for my overall college experience, and onwards after that?"
tzjua,27,2012-05-22,Clueless Single Guy with Questions,Throwaway91216,AskWomen,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/tzjua/clueless_single_guy_with_questions/,"This is a throwaway account because I don't want too many details about this going public, but I will be happy to answer any specific questions you may have (to a certain degree) in a private message.

I am reasonably successful for somebody my age. When I was 16 I got a job at a large grocery store chain (60+ stores) and about two years later I got a job at their corporate headquarters making over twice as much money. This never happens for any other 18 year olds. Most of the people I worked with were at least twice my age (the next youngest guy was about 25 or so and even he was a little out of place). It is because of this job, unlike most of my peers, I was able to pay my way through the first two years of college without loans or scholarships. I've also been able to just buy things (books, computers, food, whatever I really needed) without worrying because I knew that I had the money to cover for it. I've even been able to loan money to family and friends while paying for school. Now I'm 20, and I left that job (again after about two years) in order to pursue an opportunity with a very large tech company making twice as much money as I did previously. This is technically only a summer internship but there is a high probability of full time employment after I finish my senior year of school (this fall and spring) and even if I don't get a full time job out of it having this company on my resume is a huge deal.

I am also successful academically (for the most part). During all four semesters in community college I made the dean's list. I also completed two directed studies, won multiple awards, and joined an honor society (which frankly turned out to be a waste of time but hey, it looks good on the resume). During my first of two years in university I had somewhat of a bad first semester (3.0 GPA) but it is somewhat balanced by my second semester (4.0 GPA). I chalk it up to having transitional issues going from community college to university (that's what the advisers say, after all), but that almost sounds like an excuse to me.

The last two paragraphs are to demonstrate that, at least from my perspective, I am able to hold my life together pretty well. Some friends have recently told me that they are envious of my position in life and I could really do is remind them that is wasn't easy. Sure, there was some luck involved, but everything that has happened has happened for a reason.

There is only one ""problem"" (I say ""problem"" because some people may not see this as a problem at all). I'm going to be 21 next month and I've never had a girlfriend. I've never had a first kiss and I consider myself lucky if a girl lets me hold her hand. It's a problem to me because sometimes I can't help but think about why I can't find somebody for what seems like days or weeks on end. I'm not even sure that finding somebody would solve this feeling that I have.

I used to chalk it up to weight issues. In high school I weighed about 260 pounds (117.9 kg). While in community college through diet and exercise I managed to get down to 173 pounds (78.5 kg), but that didn't last very long and I wound up maintaining 185 pounds (83.91 kg) for a little over a year. Since starting university I've gained a little more weight and I have been maintaining 200 pounds (90.72 kg) for going on a year now. I really believe that my current weight is due to me not having full access to a drum set in my current place of dwelling (I'm currently living in a condo and I've been playing drums for about 12 years; I bought an electronic drum set but it just isn't the same). The point is, I've always been self conscious about my body and I guess I've always felt that a girl would never go out with somebody like me. The problem is, this hasn't changed at all since losing weight. It's still as difficult as ever to talk to women I don't know.

My entire history with women is so short I can write it out right here. I've been on a grand total of (not including prom, which is a whole other story) one actual date. And some may not even call it a real date, we just met for coffee and talked for a few hours. I had just gotten off a night shift and was tired (I tried to hide it, which was probably a mistake), but we just talked about whatever until she had a meeting to go to (which I knew about before we met up). I'd say it went reasonably well, except at the end we just said goodbye and a few days later she deleted her okcupid account. I think I may have scared her off the Internet :(. That was my latest failure and at this point in time was a little over one year ago. Previous to that I had become good friends with a girl who I was in Calculus I, II, and III with as well as Linear Algebra. I tried to get her a gift for Valentine's day (a gift which referenced a moment of sorts we had in Calculus III) but she just straight up did not accept the gift (she wouldn't even look at it). She knew I was getting her something too, but she never told me that I shouldn't. One of my friends (who is a girl) said she was a bitch and to forget about it. Fast-forward and I'm giving said friend drum lessons for a few weeks. The entire time she's complaining about not having a boyfriend and in general we're very open with our conversations. I asked her out and she said no and called herself a bitch (I'm serious, we're still friends and it thankfully hasn't affected our friendship). Previous to that I had a prom date who I asked out after prom and promptly got rejected. She was really the first girl I've ever asked out not counting an awkward moment in 8th grade with a friend who eventually drifted away from me.

In order to pursue this opportunity I am traveling over 1600 miles away and living there for the summer (this company has offices all over the U.S. and around the world but &lt;INSERT FAR AWAY CITY HERE&gt; is where they put their best applicants and at the end of the summer they connect us with managers from around the country. Because of this far-away trip I'm leaving on I have made the decision to not try and make any connections with women until I get back. My friends (who only found out recently) think that that was a mistake. I agree with them to some extent, but not with some of their logic. One point was ""plant the seeds now and harvest them when you return,"" or, in their words, ""meet somebody and when you get back in town be like, `Hey, girl, I'm in town. Let's get together.'"" This at least somewhat makes sense to me, but then this happened:

&gt; Them: ""When you go to &lt;INSERT FAR AWAY CITY HERE&gt; you're going to be in an entirely different market!""  
&gt; Me: ""I'm going to be there for three months...""  
&gt; Them: ""No obligations!""  

That brings up a core point of what I believe. I am not interested in relationships with a set time limit. Maybe relationships that have a chance of failure, but I honestly don't see the point of being in a relationship where you can count down the days you'll be together. Regardless, my friends have been encouraging -- going to the point of saying something along the lines of ""You have so much going for you. You have a lot of money and have a killer job lined up."" Granted, those aren't the only things that matter, but it's nice to hear anyway.

And so, I've reopened my okcupid account (to ""plant the seeds""). It's going... meh. If you've gotten this far I'd like to thank you because this is /r/AskWomen and I haven't asked a question yet. So if I were to summarize this all into a question, it would be **""how can *I* be better at talking to women I don't know?""** Emphasis on *I* because although I don't like being the me-monster, I really need some personal advice.

Extra points:

* I am in a major composed of 92% men and 8% women, and the increasing trend is that we are getting more men and less women.
* I can only name two out-of-school friends who are girls one of which rejected me and one of which I'm sure would reject me. **EDIT:** Rephrasing this as two female friends and several female acquaintances.
* I listen to metal music. Like, hardcore metal music. People are generally surprised to learn this because I seem like such a happy person (because I guess happy people aren't aloud to listen to metal). I'm attracted to the drumming more than anything. The problem here is if a girl asks me what kind of music I'm in to and I say that I just went to a Meshuggah concert then 1.) they probably won't know what Meshuggah is and I'll sound like a hipster and 2.) if they [listen to Meshuggah](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACRfpwzDLAQ) they'll probably think I want to murder them. I also listen to stuff like Chili Peppers, [Chad Smith's Bombastic Meatbats](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FB5AjHteU5o&amp;feature=fvst), [Panzerballet](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Wh_M3ohtxM), Paramore, and, on occasion, Halestorm. Despite these bands being in my library, my library is primarily composed of heavy metal music. Also, despite listening to metal music I am not into metal culture -- I had to unsubscribe from /r/metal because of how increasingly moronic it was becoming and I am not *usually* into the type of girls who go to metal shows.
* I am a self-described nerd / geek. I've created a few websites, only one of which is really up at the moment."

I recently dropped my laptop and half the screen appears to be either completely white or have multicoloured lines running down it. It's pretty much the definition of broken. [Here is an image of the screen.](http://i.imgur.com/vdu1C.jpg)

The problem I'm facing is that I'm far from tech savvy and I'm pretty poor. Pretty much all my money goes on rent these days and I've been using my laptop for an internship I'm currently part of. So I'm in a serious conundrum.

Here are my details and questions:

The laptop is a Toshiba Satellite A660-11m. The screen details are as follows:

* size : 40.6cm (16.0”) 
* type : Toshiba TruBrite® HD TFT High Brightness display with 16 : 9 * aspect ratio and LED backlighting 
* internal resolution : 1366 x 768 
* response time rise + fall (Typ.) : 8 ms

So my questions. How much am I looking at for a screen replacement of this sort? I'm a bit wary of taking it into any computer repair shops in my city (Liverpool, England) as I'm ripe to be ripped off. How hard is it to replace the screen myself and could I save myself a few pounds? I'm not tech savvy but I'm a really quick learner and youtube pretty much has tutorials on everything these days.

Any help would be massively appreciated. I've looked after this laptop so well as it was a present my Dad got me for graduating from university. A piece of my soul died when I seen it hit the floor.

Thanks again."

tyxp2,447,2012-05-22,How automation saved the girls' evening,knight666,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/tyxp2/how_automation_saved_the_girls_evening/,"Before I begin, I must establish some backstory.

I'm in college to become a game programmer. Currently I'm doing an internship at my school and hopefully I will graduate next year. Every day I go to my tiny office to toil away at a simulation game to help disabled children.

And I do mean it's a *tiny* office. What the school did was basically take the end of a floor and cordon it off with cheap walls (you know, the type where you can't put a nail in because it might bring down the wall). It doesn't have airconditioning, it doesn't have a window that can be opened and there are four desktops + a bunch of laptops heating it up.

There are four of us here, but two (the art girls) are working on a different project, a virtual supermarket. For the past few weeks they've been building and labeling virtual products in Maya (ed: a professional 3D modeling tool). It's what we call ""monk's work"", because in the old days, monks would copy the entire Bible by hand.

But yesterday, one of the teachers came in in a bit of a panic. Turns out they needed all this stuff done today, preferably *yesterday* because they had to resort to doing simulations on screenshots instead of the real scene.

One of the problems, the girls complained, was that they had convert all the textures from PNG to DDS. I wasn't really listening, because this wasn't my project, but somehow those words bounced around in my head. And they connected to... AssetBuilder.exe! You see, for our own project, I had already solved this project. I was sick of loading times that ran into the minutes, so I wrote a tool (using some open source NVIDIA code) to convert PNG and TGA images to DDS textures.

I told them that I would tweak it for a bit and they were ecstatic! It worked very well, converting all images to textures automatically.

Then, the teacher came back with some new bad news: all the items had to be labeled. That meant loading the scene in Maya, selecting an object, clicking on a MEL script and entering ""product"" in the ""Node ID"" field. For 1700 products. The girls estimated it would take 10 hours to do that by hand.

Seeing my previous success with automation, the teacher turned to me. Couldn't I, you know, do some programming magic on the script to automate it? I told him I had never done MEL scripting (ed: Maya's scripting language) but I'd give it a shot.

I quickly realized I was in way over my head. Fixing the script would require understanding how it worked and it was *massive*. I abandoned it and focused instead on the end result. You see, the script was for a converter. And it would convert selected objects to an Ogre .scene file. Which is... XML!

So I glanced over it and it was full of definitions like this:

    &lt;node name=""awesomeProduct001"" id=""""&gt;
         &lt;mesh name=""AwesomeSpread"" /&gt;
    &lt;/node&gt;

Luckily, Notepad++ was installed, so I wrote a quick regex:

     From: &lt;node name=\""(.*?)\"" id=\""\""&gt;
     To: &lt;node name=""\1"" id=""product""&gt;

I ran it and saw those magic words on the screen, saving them 10 hours of work: 1739 items converted. 

I can't say I blame them for not trying to automate it, they're art people after all. But when you're a programmer, everything looks like an opportunity for automation. :)

I work in technology, my partner just graduated from a highly specialized program which has jobs, just not as many in the tech hubs. We talked about moving to a tech hub after graduation, and a year ago, before graduation, it was the plan.

Fast forward to today. The program is done, and my partner has an internship (one out of 5 in the nation precisely in her field) on the opposite side of the country from where I have a solid, exciting job offer in the tech industry. The other job prospects in the hubs have not improved in the intervening year. 

From my perspective, I've followed and supported my partner to further her dream, and taken a few hits of my own, career and sanity wise. I'd like her to take a chance and see what happens. I do feel bad that I've placed this clockwork in motion, and it's causing us some pain right now.

From her perspective, she needs to go where the jobs are to make use of the expensive and time-consuming education, but it's what she loves doing beyond anything else. The prospect of moving to a tech hub with marginal opportunities without lining up something is risky, and that's what is causing conflict right now. She wants me to be happy, just is very nervous and concerned about living and working where I will be.  

We're two weeks out from the moment of separation, what can I do to make things better in the short term and long term? Have any of you been in similar situations? I don't want to cut my losses on this one, she's a keeper.

I feel like I'd get major anxiety working and juggling school because some retail jobs don't work with student schedules.  How do you guys negotiate hours at your jobs?

u1izi,3,2012-05-23,I want to re-train to learn programming for online-based software and applications. Help?,JerkJenkins,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/u1izi/i_want_to_retrain_to_learn_programming_for/,"Some background: I’m in my mid-20s, went to school for Corporate Communications and ended up in marketing/ advertising/ sales/ PR. I’m just not satisfied and have an itch to learn a new area of expertise – which is why I want to retrain myself as a programmer, preferably with a focus on developing software for use online and developing online applications.

I have a few questions:

- Is it worth it to try for it at this point? 
- What will I need to learn at a bare minimum?
- What would be the most useful skills to learn?
- How can I do this relatively cheaply?
- Would a marketing/ business background be useful coupled with programming and development knowledge?

I admittedly don’t have much experience at all with programming – just a bit of HTML / CSS in college and some bare-minimum C++ in high school. I picked up a book on Ruby a few months back and have been enjoying learning through it, though. My current plan is to teach myself the basics and some beginner - intermediate skills. Then, after I have a decent base, take classes at local community colleges/ online classes as needed to fill in the gaps and round off my knowledge. I’ll then either pursue internships in programming and development, or I’ll directly apply for a Computer Science school and pursue a degree more seriously while working on acquiring internships and actual programming experience.

Thoughts?"

I've been both the person venting, and the advice giver in the past few months. And I want to share something quick. 

In the past six months...let's see. 

* Car blew up and almost caused a head on collision. 
* Had semi-nervous-breakdown in student center from too many classes, not enough sleep. 
* Had my car illegally impounded and have to pay a fine even though my car was illegally impounded and the ticket had no legitimacy, and they didn't follow proper proces to take my car. 
* Pretty much hated every single classmate I had this year. 
* Oh yeah, traffic every morning in New Jersey hasn't helped that stress. 
* Stuck at a boring job that I had hit the maximum level at, in suburbia with stuffy suits I didn't enjoy working with. 
* My ex-girlfriend accused me of giving her a rather nasty...disease. 

In the past year 

* Started playing a new sport. I finally decided to pick up hockey. Great exercise, lots of fun. 
* Lost about 20 lbs by beginning to work out and eat better
* Attended two brony conventions, the first one being completely on a whim because it sounded cool. 
* Made friends with said bronies, enjoyed second convention. 
* Went to ridiculous brony New Year's Eve party that I don't remember half of. The half I remember was awesome. 
* Made awesome friends by going to Reddit meetups
* Went to two NHL playoff games which was an amazing experience. 
* Applied and took new internship at a startup in Manhattan where nobody wears a suit. 
* The other nice thing about Manhattan? No traffic! I'm selling my car this week - no more gas, insurance AND the money from the sale can pay down some debt and give me swag money for Bronycon!
* Oh, and then there's that thing I did Monday.

My point here is this. Life has ups and downs. Life without ups and downs is like riding a flat rollercoaster....weeeeeeee. Life would be boring if there weren't any challenges to overcome. 

Would you watch ponies if it was just Rainbow Dash and Twilight drinking tea and playing a board game? Fuck no. The whole reason I like the show that's apparently for little girls is that it's entirely relatable as an adult. 

Rainbow Dash is chasing her dream of being an athlete, rising above her fear of performing. And she has flaws, just like us - egotistical and arrogant. 

Fluttershy loves taking care of animals...but she could probably afford to be more assertive. 

Twilight comes out of her shell, goes it alone to Ponyville and has to trust others and open herself up...and she ends up making five wonderful friends. 

Rarity goes above and beyond for her friends....and then fails. Applejack fails, too. They aren't bad people. They're extremely talented. But even the best of the best fail. Michael Jordan missed 36 game winning shots in his career. He was great because he didn't listen to his critics and was never afraid to step up to the plate. 

I'd like to thank Fly (edit: actually, and Acer, and everyone else, and etc.) in specific since he talked to me while I was having a rough time earlier in the year. It would be kind of stupid if I only vented to places like Plounge...friends share in failure as well as success. 

To those of you in need of support: Everypony is here for you, but you are the person you have to look in the mirror everyday. Not us. You are the only one with the power to accomplish what you want to accomplish. 

If you have depression, or anything else bothering you, you're the one to seek help. If your fat, your the one who has to see the doctor and sign up for the gym. If you want to make new friends, you're the one who has to put yourself out there and open up to people. 

If your life was a cartoon, would you watch it? Would you watch Pinkie Pie moping around for 30 minutes, let alone 60 goddamn years? I wouldn't. 

Just like the show, we have obstacles to overcome. But just like Twilight, we can't give up. We look back where we began, the reasons why we're alive, the things we hope to accomplish. And there's failures and mistakes along the way, but just like Twilight, we rely on our friends - and ultimately, the spark within us that drives us - to overcome these things. 

Make your life worth watching if you were a character on MLP. Take chances. Step out of your comfort zone. Try new things. Persue new opportunities. Meet new people. You're going to die anyways. Your a monkey floating through space on a fucking rock. Might as well do something significant since your stuck here anyways. 

There's going to be Discord. There's going to be Gildas and Nightmare Moons and all types of other shit you have to deal with. But like Twilight and the gang you should derive something out of it. You should strive to overcome, and your friends will be there to cheer you on.

u1e74,1,2012-05-23,Got a misdemeanor in Chicago. What's the best course of action to take?,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/u1e74/got_a_misdemeanor_in_chicago_whats_the_best/,"Hi guys, Reddit has helped me before and this time I need more help than last time. Definitely. 

This is a hypothetical uh.. a situation story that could have happened to some guy I know. eh-hem*

So short version of the problem is I was double hopping onto the CTA,  got caught by a police officer, and I cited a misdemeanor with a hearing date. 

The longer version is I'm back in the city for summer break, didn't have a cta card, and got egged on by my sister. Btw this is not for an excuse, I got caught doing something stupid, so I'll pay the fine or do whatever is necessary of me. Yes, yes, brain is dumb as a brick. 

This happened after the day after NATO when all the people were leaving, so heighten police watch, yah I know! I'm dumb as a rock, moving on. I double hopped with my cousin, and then this officer comes out "" Hey you! Come here!"" I thought aww a ticket or citation. Instead I get hauled off the station. 

They took me down to the closest station, and held me for about 7 hours, till 12am release. Did fingerprints and all that. Now I'm registered. And I have a court date. 

The problem is I have to leave for a internship before the court date. So when I get a legal representation from a lawyer? Would that cost me a shit ton!?
 I'm already in college debt. What is a decent average cost for an ok lawyer. I just need a decent lawyer this case.

Also additional questions.
1. My cousin was with me as well, and when he asked the arresting officer where he was taking me. He flat out refused to tell him, and kept asking him ""ARE YOU HIS MOTHER!?"". Yah... are cops always pricks like that? Or is it just procedures?

2. Why was I held for so long on a simple charge as a Misdemeanor is it to teach me a lesson or something? IF, not that I would cause it'd cost too much, IF I had gotten a call to a lawyer could he have gotten me out faster? I wasn't given a call till at least 2-3 hours in, Then I had to wait in a separate holding cell for until midnight.

3. Would this show on my record. Basically if I'm applying for a job from now on and they ask if ""If I have been arrested before?"" I would have to comply legally and say YES? Or only if I'm convicted of the charges?
-If  and if possible, how long do I have to wait before I can erase that from my records?

4. Would my school be informed of this? Will they take away my financial aid for the coming semesters? Yah I'm not a rich, I need my financial aid, dam why did I do it. 

Additional information of facts.
This is my first time arrest.

The cop didn't give me my Miranda rights when he made the arrest and put me into his cop car. I know the Miranda rights are there for questions  only after an arrest. But he asked me some questions in the squad car, and I was frazzled so I answered them. He asked me ""why I did it."" I said"" I shouldn't have"". It was pretty much obvious that he saw me doing it. 
So am I even dumber than an actual rock for cooperating and answering questions? Or should I have just kept my dumb mouth shut?
Do my Miranda rights extended only after I am booked and registered?

Little fun facts in jail I learned in jail.

My cellmates will disclose any information about their case and their past crimes that they had commuted but not charged with. They also will disclose relevant information about crimes that the police are ignorant or reluctant in solving(gang banger murder cases). Wow, that was an eye opener even for me.

Jail is cold, get a hoodie. 

They will check IN your underwear! Apparently for guns after you are held in custody. This officer said they found find a .45 MM gun in dude's underwear before. 

I learned that sometimes officers arresting a person for smoking a blunt will let them off, for reasons unknown. 

If you get caught for a charge that can send you to jail for a long period of time. APPARENTLY they will buy you a pack of smokes and a happy meal.

Now this is all hearsay. But I think it's pretty legit fun facts.
Oh yah it's boring in jail. I counted in my head to 3528-ish. Kept skipping numbers when my mind wandered. How far have you counted before?

Why do we do what we do? We do it because we're human and it was a bad point in time. "

u19bx,3,2012-05-23,How do I tell my SO about my credit card debt?,creditcardblues,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/u19bx/how_do_i_tell_my_so_about_my_credit_card_debt/,"Hi r/relationships. Throwaway here.

I'm 27F and I've been with my boyfriend 26M for a year. We are moving in together and have discussed marriage. We both love each other very much and want to spend the rest of our lives together.

But I have a lot of credit card debt. Several years ago, I moved across the country to pursue a different career and ended up taking an unpaid internship and then a shitty-paying entry-level job. In the process, I racked up a lot of credit card debt. To be honest, it didn't even bother me until I got serious with my boyfriend and realized I would need money to do the things that I want in life (like go on vacations, get married, buy a house, have kids, etc.)

So about 8 months ago, I decided to get serious about paying it off. I now have about $9,000 in debt (after starting at over $13,000). I have never had any delinquent payments and my credit utilization isn't actually too bad, so I still have a good credit score. If I continue to make very aggressive payments, I could have it paid off in a year. Realistically, it'll take closer to 18 months.

How do I break the news to my boyfriend that I have this debt? Like many people, I feel a lot of shame about being in debt. He thinks of me as a very responsible person, and I'm embarrassed to disappoint him.

We are moving in together, and will be submitting rental applications together and starting a joint checking account to pay for household expenses. I think I need to be upfront with him about my financial state, but am afraid of what he will think of me. To be clear, this debt is 100% my responsibility and I have every intention of paying it off by myself before we get married.

TL;DR: Moving in with my boyfriend, have a lot of debt, feel ashamed, how do I tell him about it?"

I am just trying to find my ""happy place,"" I love working with computers on my own time and tinkering.  I want to get into a career that focuses on this aspect.  I am thinking of getting into certifications for A+, SQL(i like the database admin idea) , and maybe networking or cisco as a supplement.  I was originally thinking of going 4 year degree for computer science but with work and life it may take a while to complete.  

I do work for a company that I may be able to get an internship if I get some education under my belt.  

My main question is, if I go for a certification path and maybe an Associates of Science degree (2 year) and some interning for experience will this be an O.K. start or will it turn out to be a waste of time without a 4 year degree? 

Thank you for helping a lost soul...:)

Edit:  Thank you all for the advice, it's great that there are ways to get help like this from complete strangers.  I wish I could travel back and slap my younger self, but alas here I am.  I can not wait to have kids so I can tell them the things to do differently so they can not listen anf make mistakes:)

u0wtn,8,2012-05-23,Any help with apathy?,Mane19,selfhelp,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhelp/comments/u0wtn/any_help_with_apathy/,"I've been apathetic with everything in my life for at least 6 months now. I don't feel like I've been happy or exited in something since the first months with my girlfriend.

Here's some background:

I'm graduating my bachelors with a psychology degree. I can't really get a decent job until after my masters. However, I don't know which field to choose. I have absolutely no idea what I want to do with my life. I love psychology and understanding the mind. But, I don't see myself working in the field. I love animals. And would love to be able to work in something related to them. But wouldn't know where to start. I'm lucky to have a father that is willing to pay for my masters program but for him to do that I need to make a decision now. So I made the decision of studying behavior analysis. Not a career path that I'm truly fascinated by. I have an internship in the field, working with autistic children and it's not too bad. But I'm not motivated to do anything, ever.  

I am also gay and haven't come out to my parents. This is eating me inside. However, I can't risk telling them and them cutting me off financially. 

I've been with my girlfriend a year and a bit now and she's great and has put up with all my shit. I don't want to lose her because of me being in a weird moment in my life. We fit too well together.

My self-esteem is gone because I feel useless and don't know what to do with myself. Because of this, I've gotten extremely socially awkward and constantly try to avoid being in social situations. The only true friend's I have live far from me. I'm bored with my life but can't seem to find the energy to change it. I have tried forcing myself into the world but it hasn't changed the fact that i'm unhappy. 

Does anyone know of something that I can do in order to make myself enjoy life again?

EDIT: I also forgot to add that I feel guilty quite often. I feel guilty for being gay and not letting my parents know while I still depend on them financially. I feel guilty for not knowing what to do with life. I feel guilty for being socially awkward, for being apathetic in life, and for not being the person I want to be. It all weighs me down a lot but I dont know how to change those thoughts."
u0ni9,1,2012-05-23,Interview advice for doing a co-op/internship?,creamenator,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/u0ni9/interview_advice_for_doing_a_coopinternship/,"Last week I got an email from my advisor saying I got a interviews with a fairly prominent gaming company and an even more prominent financial company. Needless to say I was really stoked; this was would be my first time as an intern and the prospect of working at two of my dream ""positions"" was almost unreal.

I read ""Cracking the Code Interview"", did problems on Project Euler, practiced white board coding with a couple friends and reviewed my notes on Data Structures and Algorithms along with need-to-know things about java and c++. 

I felt ready for the technical interview, I thought I would be able to ""wow"" them. 

Then this morning I had the interview with the gaming company. **Oh my god** it was **awful**. What's worse is that they asked me such a *simple* question. And I choked. I went straight into coding, when they asked me about my personal projects i just *blanked*. I was nervous as shit and completely blew it. In the afternoon I had my other interview with a financial company over the phone. The man had a heavy accent but I was used to that sort of thing. We went over quite a few tech questions within a 30 minute time frame, and I managed to answer all of them except one. Still I was fairly unsatisfied with the whole phone process.

All that technical preparation just did not prepare me for that face to face interview with 2 software engineers. How can I better myself?

**tl;dr: blew my first real technical interview with my dream internship, and is extremely demoralized. How can I prepare myself better? What do employers expect out of an intern?**"
u0n8x,18,2012-05-23,Occupy the Truth,AncientGreed,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/u0n8x/occupy_the_truth/,"I’ve never sympathized with the idea that the rich become richer by stealing from the poor.  I see these “occupy” groups on the streets and all over the news with their message that corporate greed needs to be stopped.  That financially we are in ruin and that the truth needs to be heard.  Well, whatever their version of “truth” is.  I never expected to be in the position that I am now, but I think that if I am going to be erased like the others I should do my best to try and warn people that our current state is far worse than any nightmare you could come up with.  There are people out there every day lately protesting and wanting you to know the truth.  I’m here to tell you that they only have it half right.

Let’s start from the beginning: I run a very large, very well-known company (it doesn’t matter which one).  Contrary to what some of you may believe, I worked hard to get to where I am.  I didn’t come from money, but I had the drive and determination to get what I wanted.  I started with this company right out of college as a Bud Fox-type, at the bottom of the ladder.  My motto for success had always been “eat shit and learn to love the taste.”  I did whatever was asked of me and more.  This job took over every facet of my life, and as a result I quickly rose through the ranks.  Sure I had to stab a lot of friends in the back along the way, but it used to be my idea that I wasn’t on this Earth to make friends.  Making money was all that mattered to me and I suppose it’s why I eventually was chosen to become the CEO.

As CEO, I quickly learned that we were a money making machine and I was simply along for the ride.  I downsized (or eliminated) departments to increase revenue.  I increased productivity, but offered less rewards for meeting the required goals.  I was making our Investors and Board happy, which made us all rich at the end of the day. 
 
Like most successful companies, we had a high turnover rate.  If a person didn’t hit the ground running within the first day, they were gone.  Who had time to care about anyone walking out the door holding a box?  I expected a lot from my employees, but never gave a second thought when terminating a position over a mistake.  I simply never cared for or respected those under me.  Well, that isn’t entirely true.  There was one person who I saw a lot of promise in.

Bobby Daily was a lot like me when I was his age.  He came in fast and never slowed down.  He excelled at every level and his performance refused to be ignored, even by me.  I took him under my wing and gave him a higher position to test how well he’d do.  I could see that his peers hated him, just as mine had hated me at that level.  He showed a lot of promise.  At some point, there was talk about bringing him into the inner circle of management.  I felt that he was ready, but our Investors wanted a test.  I assigned Bobby to one of our larger clients.  I don’t know if it was the pressure, or the rate at which he’d climbed, but Bobby finally slipped up.  An important document went missing and a deadline came and went.  This was all it took for the Board to lose faith.  I chose to knock him down a peg or two within the company as punishment.  I still saw a lot of value in him, so letting him go was out of the question for me.

Bobby never reported to his new position.  A week went by with no word.  At first I was angry.  I had given him a second chance, and he spit in my face.  At the end of the week I made it a point to go to Human Resources myself to see about contacting him.  I wanted to fire him personally.  The problem began when HR told me they’d no record of a Bobby Daily applying with us, let alone working with us over the course of two years.  This instance caught me off guard, and to be honest, it made me a little afraid.  I didn’t expect foul play at first.  I was simply worried about what the Board might think if they got wind of the incompetence within the company under my watch.  First Bobby was a disappointment, and now an entire department not keeping proper records?  I went straight to my bosses to clean up the mess myself before rumors starting flying.  Imagine my confusion when none of the Board members remembered Bobby either.  These men, these brilliant men who I’d looked up to not remembering the very person we’d had countless, in-depth conversations about over these past few weeks. What the hell as going on?

That same night I stayed later than usual at the office.  Since I was usually the last to leave anyway, nobody would think twice about what I was about to do.  Bobby was an employee; therefore a paper trail of some sort would have to exist.  I decided to dig further into HR and see if maybe there was something they weren’t telling me.  Maybe there was something I was being protected from?  Plausible deniability isn’t uncommon in my line of work after all.  I had to have spent hours digging through paperwork, only to find absolutely nothing.  Not a resume, not a signature, not even a damn W2.  What the hell was going on, and why was I being kept out of it?
The next day at work I was ready to give up on finding the truth.  I thought the better of it once I realized that the answer could mean my entire career.  There was a negative light on Corporate America right now, and I didn’t need it shining on me.  I went about the rest of my day “business as usual” when a lead was literally handed to me.  I was approached by a mail room intern named Tom Duenas.  He had an inter-office envelope in his hands, but seemed extremely nervous.  I had a reputation around the office, so I didn’t think much of it at the time.  It occurs to me now that he wasn’t afraid of me, but of something else.  He gave me the envelope and quickly left.  I pulled out a single page of paper with a handful of names on it.  What was this supposed to be?  I made a copy and asked my secretary to get Tom back into my office.  She informed me that he was gone for the day.  Thinking that these people might work for me, I logged into Outlook and began typing in the company address book.  Five of the six names didn’t come up at all.  As I typed in the final name, I saw a match in the system.  As I reached for a pen to write down a department, I looked up to see the information literally disappear in front of me.  It was deleted before I could get a lead.  I called in my secretary once more and I handed her the copy and asked her to look into these people.  I explained that I was positive one of them worked for us as I just saw them in our system.  It didn’t take her long to come up with nothing.  Not even a lead on the final name.  I asked for the list of names back, and she quickly apologized and explained that it had been shredded.

Later that same night, I returned to HR with the original list I had kept.  Again, I turned up with no information.  If they had worked for the company, there was no record of it.  Tom returned to work two days later.  He seemed different from the other employees in that he was timid and very nervous.  He told me that he had quit a few days earlier and was only picking up his final check.  I kept trying to ask about the list of names he had given me, which only made him more standoffish.  I followed him outside and to his car begging to find out what he knew.  Eventually he gave in.  He told me that the list was in fact people who had worked for me, but were fired.  I told him that there was no proof of that.  He brought up Bobby, and told me that when people are fired, they are erased.  Not just from the company standpoint, but altogether.  Not a single person has been heard from since, and nobody inquires as to why that is: no friends, no family.  No one.  None of this made any sense to me.  I asked him how any of it could be possible.  He claimed that he didn’t know.  It was with that uncertainty that Tom got into his car and drove away.  

“I think it’s time we talked.”  It didn’t take long for those above me to figure out what I had been up to.  I was starting to get scared, and if being asked to step down was the worst of what was to come my way, then I’d welcome it and get far away from here.  Oddly enough, the board had other plans for me.  

“We think it might be time for you to join us.  After all, you’ve certainly earned it, haven’t you?  You’ve done right for yourself, and right by the company.  We could use a man like you before it’s too late.”  Too late?  “It won’t be announced until next week, but we’ve negotiated a merger.  A lot of us at the top will be safe of course, but a lot of people at the bottom will have to go.”  Go where?  Where Bobby and the others went?  “Yes, we’ve noticed that you’ve taken an active interest in some of our ex-employees.  You’ll soon come to understand why we’ve had to deny them, just as you’ll have to.”  What do you mean?  “You’ve helped to make us and the investors very rich, but really that sort of thing was promised to us a long time ago.”  By who?  “*Those* who lack greed in the financial sense.  *They* have no immediate concept of wealth in the same way that we do.”  How is that possible?  “By being older than time itself as we comprehend it.  Our profits go up with no interference, and we become rich when *they* ask for so little in return.  Our needs are complicated: stock points, bailouts, tax money, bonuses, etc.  All that *they* require in return are the souls of our high turnover rates.”  They’re dead?  These were people with families…”Money can buy everything.  Money can even buy silence.  It can buy compliance, and complacency.”  Think of what you are saying.  I can’t be a part of this.  I have to—“What?  You have to what?  Tell the world?  Take a look outside of your office window.  You see those protesting below?  More importantly, do you see the sick and deranged among their ranks?  Those who prefer violence and defecating on cop cars to the half-truth of corporate greed?  You aren’t the only one who knows the whole truth.  There are others with this knowledge, and it has driven them insane.  That is who you’ll find below, and you’ll share in their insanity if you don’t join us.  Your mind will slip into oblivion before you can find a person who’ll believe you.  We are offering you a chance to avoid all of this, and to expand your mind and help you to comprehend things you’ve never even dreamt about.  Now tell us, what will you decide?”

I must end my tale here.  Even now I know that I don’t have much time left.  I sent this record of events to every media outlet that I could think of.  Nobody will print it let alone take it seriously.  This is the only website that I can entrust it to in time, and in the hopes that while I will be gone soon (and my existence altogether), some of you will learn the truth and find a way to do something about it.  About *them*.

One of my nipples has recently just started hurting so much, and I'm not quite sure why. I am thinking it might be because of my baby's thrush, but is it normal that it would only be the one nipple? It started the day I started my internship, last Wednesday. I thought I had a clogged duct when I got home (away for 3 hours) because the pain started from inside. Now, the nipple is cracked on top, and it is toe curling pain whenever she latches on. It's as bad as when she was a week old and learning to nurse, only now shes older so she likes to ""knead"" my breast and push at it sometimes, or grab it in her fist and I just want to cry it hurts so bad! I have been trying not to avoid nursing on that side, but I am in so much pain. Even when she is not nursing, that nipple has just stayed erect since the pain started, so it hurts all the time. 

Is there anything I can do? I just broke out my lanolin again, and I have even tried putting some of her nystatin on my nipple. Would a nipple shield help? What should I do? Breastfeeding has come so easy for us until now, I am at a loss."

At least until he gets back that is. He says he had gotten a text from my ex, saying that we had gotten together for a night (like hell) and he was just really suspicious. We figured that in order to break the jealousy, and to lighten the air, we're going to be somewhat committed while he is away. Thank you so much for the advice, and hopefully we'll still be together when he gets back! 

My boyfriend and I have been dating for about 5 months now, and the last two weeks, he's been gone on vacation (he's doing some summer internship for another month), and things have been going okay until yesterday. 
    Yesterday, I woke up with my thighs and biceps sore. I have no idea why, and I'm not sexually active, and I don't exercise. I told him this, and he got really weird. He stopped texting me, and was doing the ""..."" texts whenever I tried to get him to talk. I told him that whatever suspicions he has, are wrong. He's still suspicious, and he won't even talk to me. The second time I tried talking to him, I told him,"" If I was cheating on you, would I tell you? I don't cheat. I don't have anyone else but you, and I love you. I told you I'm waiting for you, and that I want you to be my first. Do you not trust me?"" I know, the trust line is a low blow, but I feel really hurt. I was shaking and kinda crying (which is something I don't do). He was saying how he does care, and I got kind of bitchy and said that he didn't. Last conversation we had ended with

*  Him: Would you just stop 
*  Me: Fine, I'll just shut up and say I'm sorry to make you feel better.

Am I in the wrong here? I realize that some of the things I've said, are hurtful, but does he have a right to be so jealous and un-trustworthy of me?

TL;DR: I woke up sore, and he's accusing me of cheating. We're both 17 and in a 5 month relationship.

Because it's a startup, I work directly under the big boss of the company. I do a lot of stuff to make his life easier and to get entire projects wrapped and shipped. Because I'm in school, I don't always have time to go into the office to check how my projects are running, I use computers I have at home to run stuff. 

I let my employer know that I would be moving away from the company in a little less than 2 weeks. He showed no emotion but I could tell he was less than thrilled. I said I would finish the current large project I have running at home and then be off, I don't want to leave him hanging, and it is a fairly important project. He said that he wasn't happy about me looking for another job, he said he didn't like me ""doing things behind his back"". However, then he said that I had to finish this other unrelated project which was only half done, and would take a lot of effort.

I was about to object when he said that ""What company did you get a job with? Ah, yeah I know a few VP's there. If you don't finish these projects, I'll make sure you don't have a job at this company."" This was rather intimidating, and so I went along with whatever else he said until I could check on that. He wanted me to stay after I quit and do contract work in addition to my other job. I said I would think about it.

So when I got home I emailed and subsequently talked to a person I interviewed with at the new company. I explained everything and she said that since we are in Washington, we have Terminate-At-Will employment, barring anything I signed when I got to the company. She basically said that she was not a lawyer and the new company can't help me out until I'm actually on the job. She also reassured me that unless I had any major dirt (which I don't) that he could dig up and show to this VP he knows, that she doesn't think he can get me fired.

So now I'm still stuck with what to do. I don't want to leave on bad terms, but he's making it difficult not to. I'm kinda afraid about getting lawyers sent after me, especially if it's in his power (which it very much is, the kind of job I do needs lots of lawyers). And if I tell him I don't want to contract, he'll push more projects on me."

i got this interview coming up at an IT firm for an internship, and i am completely terrified. i am cs major, senior in college, no experience, never been to an interview. i was wondering if you guys could help me prepare a bit. the position is mainly PHP programming with a side of drupal, mysql, javascript, and css as per the qualifications required.

-what are some of the concepts pertaining to web development i should make sure to know or review to refresh my memory.

-some sample questions/problems that i might be asked.

-interviewing tips for a web programming position.

-anything else that you think can help me, throw it my way.

im doing my research as well, but there is just too much stuff on the internet, and nothing really specific to this kind of internship. reading from your own experiences might be more beneficial than reading long articles, or books as the interview day is just tomorrow.

all help is greatly appreciated."

Someone from /r/webdev said i should post this question here, so here it is.

I'm doing an internship at a webdevelopment company and they want me to design a SmartTV application. It's a bit of a new platform for me and there's one thing that bothers me the most and i can't find a real answer for it.

How easy (or hard) is it to develop/design an app and release it on multiple platforms (say Samsung SmartTV, LG SmartTV and/or GoogleTV).

Every SmartTV seems to have their own SDK and i'm wondering if it's easy to put the same application on multiple devices

u2l7h,9,2012-05-24,"Unemployed, well qualified international student and forced to leave the USA as visa expires and quickly spiraling into depression. Need advise and support.",junkystuff85,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/u2l7h/unemployed_well_qualified_international_student/,"This is going to be a really long story. So I will try to cut out the details as much as possible. Heck, I am tearing up just writing this so please excuse my post if it seems long.

I came to the US to earn my Master's degree in biotech (molecular biology) as a top ranked student from India. I had a solid job offer back home in the IT industry which I turned down to come and study here. I applied to 5 universities in the US and got accepted by all 5 with offers  of tuition benefit with paid graduate assistantship. I selected a top ranked university and studied really hard to finish my degree in 2 years with top grades. I had a great mentor who tried to convince me to join a PhD under his wing. However, I was not sure about doing a PhD because of the length and commitment it takes especially in science. I mean there was a grad student who was in his 7th year of PhD and a postdoc who was struggling to get results on his project when I joined the lab. Both these people were well in their late 30's, underpaid and had failing relationships. I didn't want to end up like that and planned for a career in the biotech/pharma sector after graduating.

In 2 years, I worked my butt off as a graduate assistant, worked as a paid intern for a respected biotech company for a summer project and got a co-authorship in a major publication. Unfortunately I graduated in a recession. Despite this, I got a job offer in the University hospital from a research investigator who was impressed by my thesis defense. I liked his research, trusted him and joined his lab as a lab tech utilizing my student work permit (which is called OPT and extended to about 3 years). The student work permit is usually used to gain experience and then move on to a employer sponsored H1B visa. I realized immediately that he was a bad boss as he exploited me and made me work from 8am to 11pm everyday including weekends while paying me almost nothing. I felt sad and searched elsewhere for work. Then one fine day, I was laid off because the funding for my project was pulled when my boss' grant wasn't renewed. I applied everywhere and networked fiercely to land another job. No luck. In 6 months, I was completely depressed and was planning to leave the US. Then, 3 days before my flight, I was made an offer by another researcher in the same university hospital. He took me on promising me a H1b visa. I was a little reluctant considering my previous experience but he convinced me to take his offer. I worked really hard for him and single handedly got an almost abandoned project up and running for his lab. The week after the project was completed, he laid me off citing lack of grant funds. I felt shattered. My gut instinct told me I was exploited again and I became very depressed. However, I updated my resume, had it reviewed by a professional resume writer and applied everywhere I could. Networked fiercely, called up every recruiter and tried to land something. Unfortunately, my resume rang alarm bells because

1) I am an international student who required visa sponsorship in a tough economy and political climate.
2) I had two short job stints somehow implying that I wasn't a reliable long term employee no matter how I tried to explain it on a resume.
3) Even when I did get interviews, everything would go fine. Then, I would be asked my immigrant status and rejected on a made up reason afterwards.

I tried volunteering or a contract job but my visa situation doesn't allow flexibility as much as US citizens. The company I interned for doesn't hire foreign workers or even local for that matter ever since the recession hit. All my contacts in academia assured me of help but did nothing despite repeated attempts contacting them. Some employers tried to offer me a really lower salary compared to American peers without promising a work visa so I rejected them based on principle (I hate wage depression) and my previous experiences. Then there were consulting IT/healthcare analysis companies run by guys who sponsor work visas for desperate immigrants by faking resumes, and placing them in bigger corporations and skimming the immigrants salary for the entire duration of the work visa. Bigger corporations turn a blind eye to this as they avoid paying high salaries and benefits. It is really unfair and disgusting.

One company assured me that they would sponsor the work visa for the right candidate. They interviewed me, flew me all the way to their offices and were impressed by my presentation. In the final round, they said they wouldn't sponsor my work visa. And then as a cruel joke I was told by the contract recruiter of that company that they actually don't sponsor work visas at all for mid-level research positions. They flew me there because they had a certain amount in their budget they had to use up for recruitment by the end of their quarter and they thought they would use it on me and a few other candidates. I was completely heartbroken.

Basically no one would give me a chance at all despite my credentials. I understand that I shouldn't just expect a job in a different country when its own people are suffering. But, I worked hard, competed and studied equally well with my American peers here and am not a guy who just came here with nothing and am asking for something. All people did was exploit me here. Please understand that I have no anger against this country at all but just against my situation. All I wanted to do was work here for a while to gain experience and move back to my country as I miss my parents and home a lot.

I am now 27 years old and I have now been unemployed in the US for almost a year and will be leaving soon as my visa will be expiring. Going back I have to face embarrassment and humiliation from friends and family at being unemployed as the biotech sector in India is grossly underpaid and very nascent. Only the most experienced people get a good job there and I have no experience to speak of. My dad is so sad and depressed because he feels he ruined my future since he was the one who forced me to study biotech as he paid for my education in India. I did argue against it back then but in an Indian household there is only so much that can be done. My mom cries at seeing me depressed and I am crying myself to sleep every night not knowing what to do. I can't help looking back at my life and feel so depressed that all my achievements and accomplishments mean nothing now. I have sacrificed a lot so far. I gave up outings and parties with my friends to focus on my grades and research during school. I had a girl I really liked but had to break it off because I couldn't get a job. Despite many opportunities to take short cuts like cheating the immigration system to gain a job here I always took the right path and stuck by it. I am spiraling into depression and have trouble sleeping. I am trying hard to cheer up but I feel like I ruined my life completely. I know there are people worse off than me but I still can't help feeling depressed and I cry everyday. In 2 weeks time I will be leaving the US and am completely emotionally broken at how my life has turned out.

**TL;DR**

I have been unemployed for nearly a year after earning a Master's degree.

Will be forced to leave the US after trying really hard to get a job here as my visa will expire soon.

Feel completely depressed and cry everyday about my current situation. Deeply spiraling down into a dark and negative mood with no motivation at all."

All my clients are from word of mouth, I have worked really hard to get where I am today. I even fix Geek Squad fuck ups at cost. This was brought to my attention by a good customer of mine and verified with other customers. Here is what is going on:

My ex-girlfriend's sister is telling my clients that, I ""beat"" the ""living shit"" out of her sister (my ex) and that she is going to kill me. My ex and I are still good friends and still talk or text on a daily basses. I have never treated her with anything other than respect and kindness, ex or her sister. Her sister is a known drug user ""trying"" to get clean and is missing a few nuts a screws (is bat shit crazy). She has lost too many brain cells to be a adult about any thing.

I am currently trying to get a restraining order for the threats and include my clients in the ""stay away order"" (kicking her out of east county) but because I can't prove that she has broken in to my home and car in 2010, or that she will act on the threats (I have installed a video system at my home and have a call recorder on my cell if she calls or tries to break in again). Because of the lack of proof, of ""Imminent Threat"", I am having trouble getting a judge to even get a court date. I have had a TRO from 2010, on her for 3 months, after she broke in to my house, the county sheriff's where unable to serve her as she runs do to warrants and lawsuits against her. I was left with little choice but to let it laps. From Jan 2011 to Feb 2012 she was in jail. I also have contacted her probation officer with no forward progress.

After work I come home and like to play some video games and watch netflix

My father exclaimed ""You need to stop playing this shit it is ruining your life, anyone who would play these fucking games is a loser with nothing in their lives. ""

I have very limited friends back home since they are all else where now. So I socialize with my lifelong friends on ventrillo or teamspeak while gaming

I was told ""i have to stop spending time on my computer when my dad is home"" Instead I am supposed to watch tv and ""socialize"" with my parents (socializing is bitching about everything while they are very well off and should have nothing to bitch about but everything is a big deal, essentially it is stressful and annoying to ""socialize"" with them and I find zero enjoyment spending any time with them.

To compromise I have used my culinary skills and have begun cooking for all of their friends and every meal when I am at home. I cook it, I clean it, and I eat dinner with them but afterwards I venture back up to my room and play games with my friends who live everywhere in the states.

I am not sure where to go or what to do, but being asked to stop doing what I enjoy simply because my father does not approve of games really bothers me and has beyond alienated my father and I to the point I would rather sit in my car for hours in a walmart parking lot to wait for him to go to sleep before coming back home

I apologize for the rant and poor me sob story but I have exhausted talking to him and am looking for some advice or input as to how to handle this situation

I have my Bachelor's in History, and I’ll be finishing a community college diploma program by the end of 2012 in “Network engineering.” I have entry level IT skills in Cisco networking, as well as system administration. By the time I graduate I’ll have my CCNA as well. I have a year of experience working for a major telecommunications company as a paid networking intern. In terms of my Japanese ability, I already have my JLPT N5 and continue to study almost daily. I have been to Japan twice during the past 2 years.


I want to pursue 1 of 2 paths:

1) Enter Japan on a working holiday visa (6 months + 6 months) and look for work in my field. Since my Japanese isn’t fantastic, I assume I would be looking for work with International (English speaking) companies in Tokyo, Osaka and the other major city centers.

2) Get a job through a private English teaching school (1 year contract usually?) before heading to Japan, and look for another job in my free time. 

My main concern is the job market for someone such as myself with my current N5 Japanese ability. I realize getting work with a Japanese company might be difficult if not impossible, but I was hoping there might be something with an international company requiring English speakers with some Japanese ability.

Realistically I could probably afford 6 months on my own if I chose the working holiday Visa. If I came over with a visa sponsorship I would almost certainly have to ensure I am placed in a major city to increase my job finding prospects, so JET is out of the question. Ultimately if I could not find work in my field I would at least come home with better Japanese skills, most certainly. 

Does anyone out there have any experience looking for IT work in Japan with limited Japanese skills?
What are my chances of finding something decent within 6 months?

I’d love to hear your thoughts, opinions, comments etc.

But when she's feeling scared or sad, she has a tendency to lash out at me - blaming everything on me, asking why I can't just support her, saying I'm making her feel guilty. It generally progresses like that until I get really upset, and then she gets mad at me for being upset/standing up for myself instead of supporting her. She'll say I never really cared about her and keeps threatening to break up with me.

I'm not really sure what to do. This past week has been particularly rough because I've just had surgery on my legs so I've been in a lot of pain and kind of out of it cause of pain meds, but that hasn't seemed to matter.

At the same time, I earned a BS in Applied Computer Science and a BS in Management (dual degree). I get the feeling that my knowledge set is a little different than a lot of programmers: I don't really know much about .NET or web development (back in the day I used to build my own little websites but this was with just Javascript/JScript and HTML). 

My expertise is mostly Java and C++ and I've put a fair bit of my own time into studying beyond just the basic syntax: I can explain how dynamic method lookup and garbage collection work in Java and what’s *really* happening during all those complicated method calls. The programs I've written are more or less the standard data structure stuff like graphs, heaps and other AVL trees, ""splay"" trees. I can also explain what big O/Omega/Theta actually mean, for what that's worth. I’ve also taken it upon myself to learn PL/SQL with what I can download for free from Oracle. 

That being said I've never written a line of production code (although I've seen many millions of lines in COBOL, RPG, JCL, SQL, PL/SQL, .sh scripts, Java, and C#). I never did any internships during undergrad because I needed to keep working full-time to survive, so I'm kind of at a weird impasse where I have some experience but it may or may not be what recruiters are looking for. 

I want to move into business systems analysis or software engineering. I really do love programming and math but people tell me I'm one of the non-typical CS people who are also great with many different types of people and good at interfacing between the IS teams and other employees/customers, so I think maybe becoming a BA would be the best. I've worked side by side with many BAs and I have no doubt I would be great in such a role if given the chance.

Please do not hesitate to contact me if you think I can help you out. I'm not looking to make a fortune, ever. Internships would be fine by me and I'm more than willing to start anywhere to prove myself. My autodidacticism is by far my strongest trait: I can teach myself most things with minimal formal instruction and I have a pretty strong acumen for logical science. I’m pretty humanistic as well and have a strong interest in and behavioral psychology. 

I'm in Dallas presently but I'd be willing to relocate to Austin. Thanks for reading.

u4s69,43,2012-05-25,"Two and a half years ago, I was living in a motel in Durham under a black market arms dealer.",[deleted],GetMotivated,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/comments/u4s69/two_and_a_half_years_ago_i_was_living_in_a_motel/,"Due to a request [here,](http://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/comments/u3odl/im_a_22_year_old_college_freshman_20_lbs/c4s8uhh) I have a story I think I can share here.

Essentially, I had an internship with a big company while I was in college. Graduated as a business major in May 2009, on the downswing of the crash. The job offer I'd received was rescinded three weeks before I walked across the stage, so I moved directly back in with my parents as I looked for serious work while working 15 hours a week folding towels at my gym. I got a job at GNC for a week; then they rebudgeted, realized they couldn't afford my salary, and fired me.

After several months of failing to find work, I moved to a motel (that, unbeknownst to me upon move-in, was a major weapons drop for multiple area gangs) in Research Triangle Park and became Durham's only bilingual business major Office Depot cashier and Papa John's delivery driver. I worked around 60 hours a week between the two jobs and delivered resumes to every business I could come across. I stopped counting after printing and distributing an entire ream of paper's worth of resumes. I did this for five months, living off dead pizzas (unclaimed or returned by customers) and shitty lunch meat sandwiches. I dealt with the extreme stress of all of it by drinking copious amounts of Olde English 800 foties, which caused me to gain tons of weight.

Eventually, I got a tip from an old coworker saying that I should apply to the document management division of a different business line of the company I had interned for. Two days before my interview, so much snow fell in NC that the governor declared a state of emergency. I drove a typically 4 hour trip over 9 hours in 6 inches of snow to make it back to the interview. The day of my interview, and I am not making this up, my Papa John's was robbed at gunpoint and one of my managers was non-fatally shot.

I didn't get the job I interviewed for, but one of the women on the board I interviewed in front of is married to the head of the IT department, and she thought I was charismatic and confident enough not to let me go, so she gave my resume to her husband. It got passed down to the head of Applications Support, who called and asked if I thought I could do IT work. I told him I liked computers, and that, if I sucked at it, I would save him the trouble and quit six months in. Otherwise, that they'd have to match my original job offer's salary.

He hired me. I started work Feb 15th, 2010. I met my girlfriend after moving into my own apartment in March 2010. Six months in, I got a 20% raise.  On March 9th, 2012, I closed on a three-story house, and last Thursday, I bought a [2010 Dodge Challenger](http://images.thecarconnection.com/med/b5-blue-challenger_100179668_m.jpg). I have a bar (with two-tap kegerator!), game room, gym, movie theater, band room, and *smoking lounge* in my house now. All of this at 25.

TL:DR; I do not take a single bit of my success for granted. I got one freak break, and it changed my life immensely. Be tenacious. Be ambitious. Be confident. No matter where you are right now, you may be only two years from having a basement bar and smoking lounge (or more!) in your house. Every single one of you can repeat this shit that I've done as long as *you* know that you can. And I look forward to reading a success story from each and every one of you. Good luck, wolves."

graduated this month with a 4 year Computer Science degree from a top 5 program in the US. I have a 3.2 GPA

I have internship experience with a fortune 500 company

I have been working part time as a web developer for 6 months for a small office

I have had a number of phone interviews, but i haven't gotten past 2nd round interviews everywhere. I am starting to get desperate because I am not in a good situation with my current job. I only make 12.5/hr despite having a degree. I can't really ask for a raise because I told them I am leaving in 3 months, regardless of whether I have a different job or not because I am very unhappy where I am. I have to support myself as well, so I can't quit. This job is a nightmare mostly because I was hired as an entry level developer, but I am the only IT person here. The code I have to work for is a mess, and the company is basically using a database system that is 15+ years old.

I don't really want to do web development. In fact, I hate it. Ever since putting my resume on dice.com, i get calls all the time from recruiters asking for php developers. Sometimes i think these people have absolutely no tech background and just blindly respond based on keywords on resumes. I would rather do application development in C++ or mobile development in Java.

I am not really sure what else I should be doing other than keep putting my resume out there. I missed the career fair at my school, and I am trying to get a job in California, but I have no connections there. Most of the jobs that i have applied to i have done online. At this point though, I would considered anywhere but where I currently am. I am not sure what else i should be doing."

u4bpw,198,2012-05-25,Whats the point in your studying a degree if you can't find my family photos ,Angelojoseph17,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/u4bpw/whats_the_point_in_your_studying_a_degree_if_you/,"During my intership year at university , I got a job at a marketing company. The company itself was owned by one owner, the typical flash type. Guy drove a bentley and had a nice house(mansion), veneered teeth etc. But when it came to spending on IT they always never wanted to invest despite being able to. 

The company had around 100 ish users. Mainly in windows environment and a few macs (people who used them , didnt really use them for the right reason just wanted macs) . 

Being a intern meant my IT manager knew i would have to stick around for the whole year as a part of my degree. Which meant i was given stupid jobs and usually worked from 8 in the morning till 8 at night. No one really appreciated anything I did and if anything IT was a department where everyone just took their frustration on. Being straight out of uni i thought shit is this really what i want to get into. 

The sales team were the worst. They were very driven, by driven i mean assholes who wanted everything right now. Had to be the first in line, never created tickets for work and excepted work to be done within minutes. 

There was always the one guy, he was the top salesman, i guess with that he had the head honcho, main guy asshole persona on him. We had run ins with him lots of times. This guy pretty much made my year horrible. He would ring me at 9 /10/11  pm at night to help him resolve internet problems with his isp and would use the ""i have a pitch to work on for tommorow  so i need to vpn right now"" . He would ring me up and 5 in the morning and say ""hey my blackberry is not receiving emails, I'm out of office today, I need it working now..."" Who the fuck is up at 5 am in the morning... , 100% of the time it was a case of doing a battery pull rather than checking out our bes server.

Another time, he left his laptop on top of his car at the client site and drove off actually running over it. Then he comes back and says i need to get a new laptop, need it working in 30 mins , I also want the same model. My IT manager has no backbone and he would cave into doing whatever other managers wanted just so he was liked by them. Which meant i would drop stuff and do whatever these assholes wanted. 

Towards my end of year i got my sweet revenge on mr sales man of year. He comes into the IT office storming in like a bull and says somehow his computer deleted all his family photos of his laptop. I do my logical think and calm him down and say log a ticket and i will look into it for you. If you stored it on a network drive i will be able to retrieve it. He then mouths of amount how useless our IT department is , how useless i am as an intern (which pissed me) etc etc. I look to my manager and he just says sort this out right now. 

Ask him where he stored it, he says under pictures. Had a look not in there, had a look in the bin , not in there. So i do the most logical thing and go into windows search and search for all images and set it to thumbnail mode. He and my manager sit next to me as try find  it, lo and behold all the images i keep seeing are porn, hardcore porn ..... Mr sales guy suddenly starts sweating going ""hey thats not mine, nooo must be a virus.... "" Hes goes bright red , it was worth it watching this asshole squirm.  As he keeps repeating it another female colleague comes into get a keyboard and she sees the screen and is ""omg thats disgusting"" Sales guy is like ""its a virus keeps downloading porn on my computer"".

At this point i go "" funny.. never come across a virus that only particularly seems to keep downloading milf porn, better write  this on our wiki"" 

Needless to say word went around and thats the last time he ever bothered me till i was there. As much as i hated the places, it was something for my cv and helped me get other jobs when i finished my degree. 

Sorry for being long.

Sorry about that everybody! I'll put some pictures up in a bit of what I took but here's some of what I put in:

- A nice chocolate black tea
- A raspberry green tea. There's another one in there right now but I thought more variety couldn't hurt!
- A vietnamese black
- A really great white tea... the name is slipping my mind :)
- An addition to the notebook (my handwriting is terrible)
- A maple black tea
- Another maple/spice kinda mix black tea

I specifically didn't apply to art museum internships in the spring when I should've because I wanted to have a more relaxing summer. I didn't want to overhaul my entire wardrobe or be cooped in a museum hall, regardless of prestige. I'm not yet decided in what I want to do with my life but I know that the internship I take in the summer of my junior year is vital in deciding that for me. I feel like I'm shooting myself in the foot due to ""not taking a wonderful opportunity"", but my interest is not in conserving or learning so much about academic art but in producing it. I ended up getting an internship with this one organization that may not be as institutionally valued (we'll call it internship A) but is more active in its creative pursuits (throws parties, produces musicians, has an online visual magazine, etc.) Like most internships it's unpaid, so I applied for funding from my college ($3,000), expecting to hear back on whether or not I would receive that funding by the beginning of May. Around the time I was about to begin the internship (the second week of May) I was still waiting to hear back from my college only to find out that my sponsor &amp; professor lied about completing their forms, thus nulling my chances of receiving any cash at all since it made my application incomplete. Though extremely disappointing, I was beginning to accept the situation for what it was.

This is when things become more complicated. My advisor/professor (the one who had part in making my funding application incomplete though she denies this - I have verification from the head of funding saying otherwise), came up with the idea that I should volunteer at a museum, if they will take me, so I can possibly re-qualify for whatever money is left at the college. The thing is, the processing at that point already is over, so the scheming has pretty low hopes to begin with and applying for any sort of volunteer position at a museum was done and over with in the spring. But she claims she has an in with the museum, made her calls and called me at the most inconvenient of times to complete this application in this rushed week period since hearing back from the college that I didn't get the funding for my other internship.

Just yesterday I started my first day as an intern for internship A and it went along well enough for what it had to offer. Because I no longer qualified for funding with this internship I wouldn't need to commit to the 300hrs he calculated for me to begin with, so we agreed to return back to initial 18hr week the organization offered in the first place. With internship A I would be working 3 days a week for 6hrs each day. That was fine with me since I liked the work I was given to complete while there and for the days I would have off I could devote to my own work. I would also likely obtain worthwhile contacts in the art world to help further my own creative pursuits. 

Much to my surprise, the ""in"" at the museum (Internship B) mentioned by my advisor came through and called me, wishing to set up an interview this upcoming Tuesday. This opportunity is only enticing to me under the guise of still receiving funding from the college this summer. It was why my professor/advisor called in the first place. I never told her I was unhappy with my internship, I was only displeased for not receiving funding from other's (her and my sponsor's) incompetences. In order to receive funding, I have to complete 300 hours at the internship I would be working with. This means that I would have to be working exclusively with the museum this summer if I am to get the position, but this also means that I would have to drop the internship I already have seeing as the work schedules would be in conflict with each other. Internship B is located in the Bronx (a particularly sketchy area recounted by my advisor) and I'm staying in Brooklyn. Internship A is in Brooklyn, thus making it more convenient and price affordable. 

There is no point in taking whatever hours the museum would offer because as much as I wouldn't mind working for them, I can't afford to volunteer my time.  I'd like to note that my landing this internship B position will not ensure funding as per more correspondences so far. Upon questioning my advisor if the funding head has gotten back to her, she had avoided a response, coincidentally or otherwise. This gives me a feeling of her insinuating I should take Internship B over A regardless of funding or not. Most of what I know so far about Internship B does not appeal to me, but if I decide to not take the position, I would threaten my relationship with my advisor, whom for the majority of the stay at my college has otherwise fought for me. I feel guilty or bullied into accepting Internship B considering the degree of her involvement and the abnormality of the museum looking at my application now at all.

I feel so extremely defeated to the point of paralysis. I don't know what to feel or choose. I need her on my side in my academic future, I don't want her being disappointed in my decision to turn down the traditionally coveted opportunity. Please help me."

Unfortunately, I think I've discovered that I'm allergic to pet dander. Also, the dogs are really rowdy and one of them is HUGE. They bark a lot and sometimes keep me awake at night. The cat is soooo sweet, but sheds like crazy!

I am taking some summer classes at a local college. I already graduated but going back to school to figure out what i want to actually do. I'm 25, not working right now. 


I've never been great with girls and mostly i never tried after a few blowouts. 


So anyway i have a quick short summer class and I've been talking with a girl in class. need to know what to do next, don't have time to read a lot  of (game material) and all i know is snippets of what i have read from here and other boards. i prefer natural game, being myself and just owning it as opposed to trying to be something i'm not. Thats what i used to do in the past (try to not be myself) I'm a geek, and i'm a loser, and i don't care 


Don't have many interests and i'm mostly boring (don't like drinking, bars, clubs - do like movies/tv, music, video games, technology, gadgets,  - don't got much going in my life as i'm back in school trying to figure out what to do, she goes back to school out of state and only around for the summer. &lt;-none of that should have any effect though on my actions right???  

Though i'm trying to get my shit together - get fit, eat right, learn more, etc, actually find a career and make money, but the last part i'm just not fully invested in yet.  


Never had a real relationship, still clueless with girls - but i'm a little more relaxed, confident with age and i know there are things you should say and not say, just not 100% sure on what those are. 


Real quick - i need to know what to say, how to move to nxt steps, when and how to get things sexual and escalate, initiate kino (where and when - in class?), should i ask her out to lunch (we both bring our lunch but maybe we can eat together) or see if shes seen any movies lately and tell her lets go friday. I'm interested in a relationship - short term or long term. I know not to expect anything, but i don't want to NOT try.


Been super anxious lately because of all this - need to not be... worried about things not going well and then still seeing her in class - shes on my table. worst case scenario i'd like to just be friends (if all else fails i got to know a bit more and hang out with a cool chick) - changed my attitude here too from what it used to be. I'd get all lame if things didn't work out... but screw that, who cares, or atleast i try not to anymore. 


I'm mostly winging everything here, and any info would help. I have a lot of things going against me (broke, not that attractive, balding, no job and no life, ) but more and more lately i've just stopped trying to worry about all that shit. I work on what i can but some of it is simply out of my control or i'm just not ready for it yet. can't worry about everything. Not sure if this is a good atttitude to have but usually i just worried. I'm slowly trying to get my life in order and trying to find a career that i actually enjoy but still super unsure of whats going to happen. Now i'm just trying to do some of the things i DIDN""T do the first time around when i was too focused on my grades and just getting a job (even that plan was flawed because i should have gotten good internships or done more research - my lack of confidence doesn't help)

* being broke - need first date ideas? basically how can i move this out of the classroom. I don't like to party/drink, and i don't have too many friends. I'm not dying for friends either though. I do pretty okay, not lonely or anything.

* I don't want to have to CHANGE my current status, in fact i can't in short term either. Does that mean i should have all my shit together (be working, making money, super fit, ) before dating girls?

* How and when to escalate sexually?

* What things to say, what not to say? 

* What does it mean when she mostly talks about herself? Is that a good thing?

""Monitor says 'no connection to PC', what does this mean?"" ""My mouse is covered in Cheetos detritus, why isn't it working?""

But this one developer. Oh boy. I wish I could defer her, but unfortunately I was the only lab intern who had the clearance to get into her office. I got tickets nearly every other day from her, but this one takes the cake.

Subject: New keyboard does not work

Content: You recently ordered a new keyboard to replace my old one and it doesn't function correctly. Please come to &amp;lt;office&gt; and diagnose.

I sigh and head over, figuring she'd forgotten to plug it in. I arrive, and her system looks normal. The keyboard is plugged in (it's a fancy new USB keyboard, \*ghost noises\*) and it can control the BIOS fine. I boot into Windows, and suddenly the keyboard stops functioning. It's a Logitech, so it should have no issue with Windows... hmm...

I go fetch my laptop (Thinkpad T30), plug it in there, and it works fine in my copy of Windows. I sigh, picturing the worst, and ask her if she'd done anything to ""prepare"" for the new keyboard.

""Why yes,"" she tells me, ""I heard somewhere you need to delete the old drivers to prepare for the new hardware, so I just deleted the old keyboard drivers. I figured the new keyboard would come with a disc.""

Let's recap: this is a developer who knew enough to *find* the generic HID drivers, but not enough *not to delete them*.

Her old keyboard became a headdesk mat that day.

Epilogue: Threw her drive into a functioning test machine and transferred the HID drivers into system32\\ before returning the system to her. She's never been happier.

I closed the ticket with: ""The usual issue."""
u5vf5,13,2012-05-26,"Seven days without fapping, time to make it official. Please, tell me how NoFap has changed your everyday life, your relationship with girls, and also with yourself.",FapOnStrike,NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/u5vf5/seven_days_without_fapping_time_to_make_it/,"Hello hello everyone, 
First of all : I'm French, so I might make some mistakes while writing my text, which may be quite long. 

So I don't really remember how I discovered this subreddit, I believe it was on askreddit or something. 
I used to be a FapAddict. Two times a day minimum, and it could be in the morning, during the day, when coming back home, before going to bed, and even sometimes when waking up with a boner during the night.
I would most of the time watch porn, but I could also do it without, thinking about someone I know. 

My problem isn't porn : I have some sex from times to times, and I dumped my last GF in March. The thing being that I'm quite good at talking to people, and have some culture on my own (don't get me mistaken, I'm not here to explain that I'm better than others, but just to clarify my situation). 

I started fapping around 11/12 I think. At the time, some friends were talking about it, how they would have huge boners when waking up, and how good it was to fap like a monkey. I tried it, bla bla bla, and long story short, it ended up with me being a FapAddict. I used to be chubby until I hit 15 y/o, which might be taken into consideration to understand my problem. So until that age, I couldn't have GFs or anything, as I was seen as the fat working nerd of my school. 
Then I became 16, started loosing weight without even trying, and I started dating girls.  

The real problem with me, is that it's really rare that I am sexually aroused in my everyday life. When I see my friends, checking every girl they see, talking about how they are wanting to have sex, bla bla, I started thinking it was strange I would not be thinking that. I do like to check some boobies/ass in the street when it's beautiful to see, but never ended up with a huge boner because of it. 

At some point, I started considering I could be gay or something, thinking : ""Hey, maybe that's why I've always prefered skinny girls rather than ones with huge breasts and shit!"". But I never could find myself attracted to any man, and knew deep down it wasn't the problem. 

As I said, I've been dating and having GFs, but I never looked for it. Mostly happened by them falling in love with me. And the worst part is that when in a couple, I'm never the one wanting to have sex. (Yeah, I kept masturbating every time I was dating). I'm now 21, and the problem is not solved. 

So one week ago, I found this subreddit, and started reading your stories. Putting aside people doing it for religion, I read lots of things about how it could help overcome depression, start talking more to girls, feel more confident, bla bla. Because the fact is that when I'm out, I could have many chances with diferent girls, but never try, because I don't feel the need. Also, even if I have good friends, and am having a good time at school, people see me as the guy who ""doesn't give a shit about others"". One day, I can wake up and just turn my phone off for a week, living in my own world outside of everything. It's my kind of depression. Every 2/3 months, I just want to be alone, eat in my room, and stay there smoking cigarets and reading books. 

I knew I was going to a huge party tonight in a friends house, with people I've never met. So last week, saturday, I wanted to try this. One week without fapping, for the first time (record being around two days), and see if it might change something tonight. I know that if I don't do anything tonight it wouldn't prove anything, but if it does, it would give me some kind of confirmation. And the only change I want to notice is in myself, if I feel more incline to talk to girls and flirt with them. 

And as far as I know, I've been having job interviews for an internship this summer for the last three weeks, and the only one that went well and ended up with me being taken was yesterday, which give me my first good point for having stopped masturbation. I was more confident, and I knew it. 

And I hope tonight I'll notice some changes. Cause for the past two days, I've been dreaming of sex (I sleep naked, which might not help), and almost gave up today in front of my computer, thinking about a girl I know. I also know that anything you'll say might give me more strength. (And the fact of writing all of this already convinced me to not fap, at least for now). 

Thanks a lot if you read the whole text. Hope I'll have some answers. 
And this is not my real reddit username, but I have some redditor friends, and don't want then finding it for now, and make my life a nightmare. 

PS : Also, in a side note, been on a diet for the past 40 days. Already lost 5 kgs (you do the math :P). Another motivation for me. Trying to have the best summer of my life. :]

Cheers!

EDIT : Ok, the need to fap came back again. God I feel miserable, hah!"

My grades have been going downhill really fast; last semester I dropped all but two classes at the last minute, and this semester I got my first two Cs in classes that were supposed to be easy.  I have pretty good research and internship experience, but my GPA is abysmal.

I feel that I have an acceptable understanding of the material in my classes; I don't think I've gotten less than a 90% on a test in college yet, and for many of my group projects I feel like I carry most of the workload.

For the last few semesters though, I've been getting close to 0% on my participation and homework grades.  I basically don't turn in any individual work.  I know the correct advice is to ""stop being lazy and stop wasting your parent's money and just do your work,"" but for some reason I spend all semester putting it off and worrying more and more about the huge pile of unfinished psets and essays, and refreshing my email waiting for the inevitable angry email from a professor or TA.

I've been thinking that maybe working with other people in my classes could help; for group projects I do fine, and I often volunteer to do all of the work because I have the extra time.  The problem is that I don't know anybody in my majors, and I'm not sure if doing homework in groups is really common at all.  Also I'm pretty embarrassed about my work ethic, so I don't think a study group would really benefit from my joining.

Do you have any advice for how to improve?  I'm thinking of going to see a shrink, but I'm pretty sure I'm not depressed; I try to get out of my room every day, but I spend most of my time avoiding doing real work with my research job or with extracurriculars."

u72fi,5,2012-05-27,how do I survive my parents?,sphagetti_throwaway,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/u72fi/how_do_i_survive_my_parents/,"These are prolly just extreme first world problems :3 (and sorry for the wall of text and... well... randomness!!) Letting this out here so that I don't have to bother my friends about it. They already know most of this but I don't like ranting in person. Feel free to downvote or whatever you want, just needed to get this out on a throwaway.

So, I'm a rising college senior and 21. Spending what I hope will be my last summer at home, working part-time and taking two classes, which start in June.

First, my parents have a growing boutique vineyard on the side. I love the vineyard. I've put a lot of sweat and hard work into it. But I don't want to be tied to a place for ever, necessarily. Especially considering the land it's on is mortgaged to the hilt and I'd be taking over paying down a ridiculously big loan if I took it over ever. EEEEEEK.

I'm a woman, and am constantly told that I'm expected to live at home until I marry, and am expected to continue and expand the part-time family business in addition to (or, they're really hoping for instead of) my own career plans, as the oldest child. I don't want a giant amount of interest preventing me from saving money for when I get old, or from ever being able to afford a little budget travel, even.

I wasn't allowed to move out of the dorms for my previous time in college due to (again) being female. My mother was afraid that I'd be raped if I lived alone or with friends, and wouldn't let me get a part-time job with classes in session to pay for my own living accommodations (which would have been worked out and left THEM with less to pay and ME with less debt in future). Even though I could have gotten a nice cheap place, even alone, for easily 1/2 of what the dorms cost them per year. Yeah, they're paying for part of my college. I pay most of my tuition and books from my summer job, plus anything not covered under the dorm meal plan, and the rest of my tuition goes on a loan. They pick up the tab for my housing. For this coming year they want me to live at home and take commuter rail and then a bus for an hour and a half each way between our house and my school. I am in an engineering program. I will be commuting at 3 am, no joke. I will get no sleep, and then probably burn my whole hand off with a soldering iron in circuits lab or go into a coma from sleep deprivation or something.

I can't get any homework done in the house because people are always banging around and turning the TV on at full blast (thin walls ftw) or asking me to help with a project. Which is why the super crazy late commute. Last semester, I had homework that took until midnight or 1 am 6 days a week (including all day Sunday usually, leaving me with a few hours during the day on Saturday free). I'd get up at 5 every weekday, do two more hours of work, go work out for an hour, and head to my internship, which started at 9 am every day.

My dad also constantly makes these ""oh I can't wait until I have all these grandchildren around"" sort of references, and I just kind of have to look at him and go ""......"" (I don't necessarily want kids, especially not now, for pete's sake! maybe MAYBE maybe when I'm 30 or so....?! I want to get a Ph.D in engineering and work in a damn research lab eventually, I think that should maybe be taken care of first............ but hey, what do I know.) I do fairly well in school. It's not like my only life choice is to find some herp-a-derpin rich arse and seduce him/become a trophy wife... not that I'm probably even good looking enough to be a trophy wife, but you get the idea.

Furthermore, I had/have a large tattoo on my side (not visible with clothes on, even) for a dead friend. I was told I had a choice between being disowned and undergoing laser removal once my parents found out about it, about two years after getting it finished. So.... being the dutiful child I am... decided to undergo multiple sessions of a process that is literally more painful than anything else I've ever experienced, up to and including breaking bones. It makes me sick to look at it and think about what it was supposed to be. My mom keeps asking to look at it to make sure it's fading properly whenever she gets me alone for a minute and makes these little ""no respectable man will want you with a thing like that on you"" speeches. It just makes me grind the fuck out of my teeth.

So I guess back to being home for the summer. I'm used to eating maybe light breakfast and dinner on a less-busy day and working out seven days a week. My parents have a gym membership that my dad uses for yoga classes and my mom doesn't use at all, yet she refuses to transfer her portion to me while I'm home in the ""oh I might go next week"" sort of hopes. She's massively overweight and I don't see that changing anytime soon. Apparently she started putting on weight right around the time I was born. It's truly disgusting. I've not got a lot of money, though I work my ass off in school so that maybe someday I will. I won't be able to work at my part-time job more than 20 hours a week, and will barely be able to afford my part of my tuition + books in the fall. I can't really pay for my own membership because it isn't viable. 

I refuse to end up a fat useless bitch like every other fucked up woman in my mom's family. I go stir crazy if I don't exercise. So I run a few miles in the mornings, but we live in a rural area and I get shit for that too, in case, you know, a serial killer picks me up or a mountain lion eats me or some shit.

I will go to grad school, not just get a stay-at-home type job after my undergrad like my parents always assumed I would. Likely it'll be paid for via loans/scholarships whatever the fuck I can get but I'm not cut out for this getting fat and basically doped up nonsense, shit, I want to be healthy and happy! I have career goals that don't involve getting preggers or married right now! I might want to go to school out of state if I get into a program out of state that's really good in my area of engineering!

I'm lactose-intolerant, which comes from my dad's side of the family is really hard for my grandmother (mom's mother), who also lives with us, to wrap her head around. She likes to cook for us and everything has cream or milk or cheese in it and it makes me throw up or feel massively ill without meds. It's not like I chose this to happen to me, dammit. I'd eat the food and be quiet about it if I could. I take lactase tabs with every meal and it doesn't always completely help. I am miserable after pretty much every meal I don't fix myself. I've been accused of everything from being bulimic to making this shit up because I could eat milk products til maybe freshman year of high school. My other grandmother and half my cousins on my dad's side are also lactose-intolerant. 

Also, they watch television for a couple hours every night during and after dinner, and if I don't partake, they freak out and call me (on the phone or by yelling my name across the house) until I do. I don't watch television as a rule when I'm in control of my own schedule, cause I'd rather talk to people or work on shit or just... anything else really. Other than having the TV on, we don't talk during dinner. They love sitcoms and stuff that just doesn't appeal to my sense of humour. I'm sitting there wishing I could find How I Met Your Mother and Good Christian Bitches and even fucking Cheers funny. I just want to pass out. It's not entertaining for me at all.

As well.... I like a Guinness or whiskey sour or something every once in awhile at a party or whatever but they drink every night. It's always ""want a glass of wine/beer/etc"" and I'm just like ... ""I gained ten pounds in the last two weeks from alcohol alone even with running twice as far as I do when I'm at school every day, *hell* no"" in my head. They get fucking hammered every weekend. Like sorority-girl-college-drinking-record-breaking-keg-stand-drunk. I'm the one that should be getting hammered, but it's never really appealed to me after my first time being drunk. It's not fun for me. I don't understand it.

This endless cycle of alcohol and television is because my mom has no life/friends/whatever outside of her job and gives my dad no end of shit every time he goes to hang out with HIS friends. She has no hobbies. She doesn't make time for anything except TV and drinking and reading the occasional Danielle Steel novel. My brother and I usually have to argue with her for on average an hour before being allowed to go out or do anything outside of the house, including dates with our significant others, or time with friends. Though she's gotten a little more lenient about this, she also freaks out at me about ""boys who don't pick you up from your house aren't respecting you"" and I'm just kind of thinking ""I wouldn't bring home anyone I didn't have a serious relationship with. I've been in exactly one of those. It sucked. Hell no. Besides, subjecting others to witnessing this batshit crazy relationship firsthand would just be unkind.""

My grandmother agrees with and backs up literally everything my mom says, but outside of her quilting group at church, she also has no friends outside of the house and it's usually her and my mom ganging up on my brother and I, and sometimes also on my dad.

Add to this that they're straight-up hardcore Christian fundamentalists. Recall I'm technically not allowed to  move out until I marry. I'm seeing a man at present, but I've dated women in the past and might do so again. I'm fucking terrified of the argument that will result if ever this comes out around the house. Shit would hit the fan if they ever somehow learned I haven't been a virgin since I was sixteen.

Unfortunately, I have no plans to marry anytime soon.... I can't take the right wing politics, the alcohol, the television, the literal cheese, the insulting ""you'll be glad when that thing on your side is gone"" talks every three days, the whole fucking thing. It's like extreme culture shock.

*TL;DR:* bizarre/conflicted relationship with parents/grandmother. How fix/deal with?! I have to live here all summer, and possibly after that. I still love these people even if they're making my life way more complicated than it needs to be. I want to be a good kid and everything, it's just really fucking difficult sometimes.

Background


So, this all started back in September. It was the beginning of a series of life events that triggered a major depressive episode that I'm still trying to work my way out of. I'm 21, going to be a senior in college. Over the summer, my family found out that my step-dad was having an affair... my family's a big part of my life and my brother and sister are really small. My mom was so humiliated that she couldn't tell any of her friends, and was really relying on me to support her.

I was supposed to graduate this year-- was taking 18 credits in the Fall and had an internship as well. It was really a recipe for disaster and after only the first week of school I was already falling behind. I started going to psychotherapy because I thought it might help me keep it together better than I have in the past... but if anyone's gone through therapy they'd know what I know now: it gets A LOT worse before it gets better.


I was living in a nice house with 4 of my friends-- all girls. One of them I knew since middle school and considered one of my best friends, we'll call her L. One of the others I became really close with over the past year, we'll call her K. The other two were really friends of L and K but I knew them pretty well. It was the beginning of September when things started to get really bad for me, in terms of falling behind in school and my family falling apart. I wasn't around much and when I was I can't imagine I was very pleasant... but I had no idea what was coming. 


The 4 roommates called a ""roommate meeting"" and ganged up on me, saying I was no fun to be around and that my presence was a drag, etc, etc. They didn't like my boyfriend who was living out of town and came to stay a few times. I have no idea what gave them the sense of entitlement they felt to verbally kick me when I was obviously down... but by the end of the conversation I'd told them that my life wasn't going to get any easier and if it was affecting them so acutely, I'd have to move out.


I found a subletter right away and moved in with my boyfriend. The girls flipped out about the idea of a subletter and delayed the process of meeting the girl I'd found for months. They talked all kinds of shit on me to anyone who'd listen. I can't to this day understand why they were so upset-- I paid my share of them rent until JANUARY and I moved out in September. I don't think many other kids in my situation would have done that. I thought I did everything I could to accommidate them during a time in my life that I was having a hard enough time taking care of myself: I moved out when they complained about not liking to have me around, I took a lot of my limited time to make sure I found a good subletter, and I paid the rent until THEY decided the subletter could move in.


After all that, the girl I'd known longest, L, would text me every once in a while to see when I'd move my stuff out. At this point, I was 100% shit broke...I'd saved money from my summer job but had to pay rent at a place I didn't live at, and throw in for the apt. my boyfriend and I share... and had to pay out of pocket for therapy because I don't have health insurance. 

-----

What I'm so upset about:


I told L that I would move when I could afford the truck and my boyfriend and I could afford to take off of work. I couldn't go back to school in the Spring because I couldn't afford it and had only gotten grades for 3/6 classes. ...In short, I was extremely busy. The text got more incessant as the months went on, but I was barely making $250 a paycheck. So, at the beginning of May, L texts me and says that its not her fault I have yet to finish the Fall semester and that if my stuff weren't out of the house by May 31, she was going to throw it out.

So, on Wednesday, I moved my bed frame and dresser with a ZipCar my friend rented for me for a few hours. I texted L to say that she could throw away my mattress and boxspring and if there was any other stuff, I would be able to get it in a week when I had my grandma's car. She asked why I couldn't just get the stuff now. I said because my rental time was up. She said, very condescendingly, that we were going to have to set another deadline. I about lost my mind at that point-- I told her that she was a huge bitch and that she could go ahead and throw what was left away if she couldn't be even remotely understanding of my situation.


Then she sent me a text saying that she's fed up of dealing with me and all of my problems. I found that offensive because I had not once spoken to her other than her texted to see when my stuff would be gone since I moved out. And we used to be ""friends!"" She said that she didn't need to know about my grandma's car or about how much the ZipCar cost (??) and that she gave me a deadline and was generous enough to extend it. It still makes me so upset: generous. I've been nothing but generous with this girl since I've met her. I would drive her to work, she was always eating my food, using my makeup, and she strung me along for months before finally committing to moving in to that house with me.

I told her she was a self-centered brat and that her life must really be boring if she was honestly that upset about my furnature (which wasn't even in the way-- there was 10x as much stuff left by other friends who'd lived there before in the basement...). I completely burned a bridge with her, which I feel really terrible about because we were friends for so long. And now I feel really angry because I feel like she's ""stolen"" my friends... she lives with one of my best friends and all of my close friends I've met in college really like her. 


I feel like I need to completely start over with new people because everyone around me just seem like self-absorbed pieces of shit. I say that because I've been trying to reach out to people since I've been so hurt by L, but no one has the time of day. Furthermore, a lot of people seem to take L's side on this. I feel like this is a pretty black and white matter-- I did everything I could to make the situation as easy for her as it could be and she's having a bitch fit because things aren't going her way. I understand that I've been a downer because of my personal situation, but, who wouldn't be?? I'm broke, my family was/is falling apart, I am really behind in progress on my degree and now I feel like I don't have any friends on top of it. What would you do if you were me, Reddit? Am I looking at this the wrong way? Please MMFB :-("

I broke up with a girl I was seeing (of ~6 months) about three months ago. I've been doing pretty well, just starting working out regularly again, handled the rest of my semester pretty well, and recently landed a high paying internship in my field of study. 

The relationship was bad nearly from day one. We were born out of an almost cheating scenario, if it wasn't for my tact and refusing to sleep with her it would have happened. The relationship was full of fun romantic things and amazing sex, but it was inherently toxic due to her immaturity, to the point where she was downright manipulative. She even alluded to committing suicide when we broke up...!! Nonsense! She did a number on my self esteem, and for the first month or two of being broken up I was done for good and didn't give it a second thought!

Now she's hanging around friends of mine - friends she never even considered seeing until after we broke up - and it's driving me nuts! I feel like I can't be friends with the friends I met through her because I feel that they may have some distorted picture of me through her manipulation and victim playing.... it's ridiculous! I am a good man with nothing but positive intentions, I don't deserve to have that weight on me! I broke up with her because of her actions!

For some reason, I don't know what it is, if it's the sex or the romance, or what she made herself out to be when we got together, I can't seem to let go of this girl. For all intensive purposes, I should be done with her and moving on.. but I'm not! I don't know if it's her recent excursion with my friends (""friends"") or my jealousy about sex or what... but I just need to move on! I made this decision and it is seriously perplexing me why moving on has been so difficult. 

I don't want to rebound with anyone but it seriously seems like the only option at this point. 

Has anyone else been in a situation like this or is currently going through something similar? I'm out of my mind here. Help."

I'm a college student, just finishing my junior year and looking forward to turning 21. I'm staying in my college town to complete an internship for credit and my boyfriend (of over 4 years) lives in a town nearby while he's taking summer classes at his university. 

My parents are quite strict, but up until I went away to college I was the perfect little obedient child. Well, as obedient as any teenager can be. To give some perspective, my WASP parents are basically as strict as my Chinese friend's first generation parents. 

Long story short, my parents found out I'm having sex and are basically forcing me to ""stop"" and come home even though I just found a job that will pay me $10.50/hour back at college and I haven't been able to find summer work at home for three years. Problem is, I have no intention of stopping and I really need the money. I don't see how their opinion has anything to do with my sex life and what's more I don't think I'm doing anything wrong. But I can't tell them that, because it will just make them more angry and less likely to let me go back. Their explanation of it is ""if you were doing drugs we wouldn't support you, sex is the same thing"".

I guess what I need here is some advice to help me face my parents and make them understand that I'm not 12 anymore. I love them, and I am forever indebted to them for supporting me financially through college but I can't take this anymore. I need to be my own person and make my own mistakes. 

**tl;dr : Parents found out I'm having sex, want me to stop. But I don't share their beliefs and don't think I'm doing anything wrong.**

I would like to tell the story of how they got me home to talk about this, but I feel like this is already a text wall. So if you want to know, ask in the comments. "

u980k,12,2012-05-28,Help With Anaphoric Macro,alexeistukov,lisp,https://www.reddit.com/r/lisp/comments/u980k/help_with_anaphoric_macro/,"I used to write CL daily but sadly haven't touched it in quite some time. I also don't believe I ever used macros so extensively (beyond with-x style macros). I also recall that extensive abuse of anaphoric macros is a bad idea.

However, I'm trying to inject some more CL into my daily routine, and had a particular case where I want to make use of anaphora. I have a CL instance running that I use to notify me of some things, run some jobs manually and/or automatically. I'd like to write these monitoring pieces using something more human than what I have now.

I have a function that, given some config values, outputs a list of assoc lists of current state variables:

    (defun get-state (conn line)
      (declare (ignore conn line)) ; removed to simplify
      '(((""Count"" . 7) (""Stage"" . 6) (""LastUser"" . ""Mary""))
        ((""Count"" . 3) (""Stage"" . 4) (""LastUser"" . ""Ted""))))

And I write something like the function below where I basically write something like below (I could use remove-if-not below, but this is a simplified form):

    (defun monitor-when-ted-modified (conn line)
      (let ((states (get-state conn line)))
        (loop for state in states
              when (equalp (assoc-value state ""LastUser"" :test #'equalp) ""Ted"")
              collect state)))

I have a few scenarios such as ""send all filtered results"", ""send if single result &gt; N"" (which can be stated as a sort of the previous scenario), ""send if results change.""

Before I get too far down the rabbit hole, taking the ted-modified example, what I'd like next is something more like:

    (defmonitor (""ted-conn"" ""ted-line"")
        (equalp lastuser ""Ted""))

I've implemented this, which assumes a single assoc list, for the time being.

    (defun alist-to-let-clause (alist)
      (loop for (key . value) in alist
            collect (list (intern (string-upcase key)) value)))

    (defmacro amonitor (alist &amp;body body)
      (with-gensyms (let-clause)
        `(let ((,let-clause ,@(alist-to-let-clause ,alist)))
           (let ((it ""ok!"") ;; testing ability to use ""it""
                  ,@let-clause)
             ,@body))))

    &gt; (amonitor (first (get-state 1 2)) 1)

    (FIRST (GET-STATE 1 2)) 
    Error: Cannot take CAR of FIRST.

Now, it appears as though the expansion isn't occurring as I expect for the assoc list.

I started playing around with the above but have clearly (imo) forgotten how macros work. In the interest of both educating myself and in getting off the ground, I'd welcome any tips/help on this. I have copies of PCL, OL, LoL, LOL, etc., so I will be re-reading up, but this is work-related so I'd like to come up with something so I don't end up just doing it in Python.

Let me know if this is better suited to a different subreddit.**

I am a 21 year old female college student, married to a 25 year old full-time working male. We've been married since May 2010. We both gave our virginity to each other after getting married (2 months after to be precise, due to some physical trouble).

I remember he was so incredibly into me before we got married and before we had sex. We're Christian, so we were trying not to do sexual things before marriage, but he was often the one to initiate contact at that time.

Soon after having sex for the first time, I was the one always begging for it and getting refused. His excuse was something about me getting upset and he can't get in the mood. That was because I had some trouble concentrating and actually feeling anything, but I was asking him to help me through it by being more romantic, touching when I ask and not too soon, etc. But he always took offense as if I was not attracted to him. On the contrary, he is the most handsome guy I have ever seen. I thought that the moment I saw him in 2007, and I still think that after seeing his entire body.

Up to September 2011, things stayed this way. I was the one asking for sex, and more than half the time, he would refuse. The only times he wanted it was when his body really needed to do it. I tried to buy sexy underwear and outfits to seduce him, but they never worked. I tried to do sweet things for him to show my love, but that never worked. We had even moved out of his parents' house a few months before, so we had much more privacy to do what we wanted.

I had already tried Googling for similar situations over the past year, but I was doing it yet again, trying different search terms. I kept coming across forum comments saying things like ""He must have a porn addiction."" All this time, I completely dismissed such an idea, that my husband could be looking at that kind of thing. Sure, he looked at it from a young age, but I was under the assumption he had stopped before we got married.

Jokingly, I asked him one night, ""Do you look at porn?"" To make a long story short, I was on the floor in the corner crying my heart out, more than I have ever cried in my life. I could have continued for a long time, but my husband was threatening to kill himself with our big kitchen knife, so I had to compose myself to stop him. We even had sex afterwards, but I have no idea why.

He had been looking at r/gonewild since he began browsing Reddit in September 2010. At first he said he only did it when we were mad at each other and I would go to bed early. But he revealed that he did it even at other times, perhaps when I was gone at my night classes, or at work on the weekends.

It completely broke my heart into bits and pieces. I couldn't concentrate at work or school anymore. I began looking at my husband in a completely new perspective. I began seeing him as an evil traitor. I had already been betrayed by my father in my adolescent years, and had been in an abusive relationship with an older man online who cheated on me constantly. I was finally becoming a more whole person, but finding out what my husband had been doing made me break all over again.

My husband made it clear I should never ever tell anyone else. I don't even have anyone else TO tell. The only person I talk to semi-regularly is my little brother, but he is not the supportive type. Both of my parents want nothing to do with me and live far away. So I have no one to get support from. My husband on the other hand, all his family is right there in-town and they have always spoiled him with gifts and support. And he even tries to tell me to just stop talking to my little brother, my last relative who wants anything to do with me. It makes me want to throw up.

So, ever since finding this porn thing out, I have felt hurt to the core. I can't forget about it, or even truly forgive him. Sure, it's not as bad as physically doing things with another woman, but according to the Bible, it's the same as committing adultery in your heart. (Even if my husband hadn't converted me to Christianity, I'd feel just as hurt, so I guess I'm overly sensitive to infidelity on any level.)

I continue to bring up what he did in bouts of anger when we have arguments. I have said increasingly cutting things to him. I feel like he cannot say I have wronged him after what he has done to me. I have been completely loyal, whereas he has been at another female's apartment until late into the night, and he goes with other females to lunch, etc and thinks I am so horrible for asking him not to do this. Not to mention I've been the one asking for sex and making an effort to improve our sex life, and all he has done is betray me. I mean, I even beg to give him blowjobs and he is 99% of the time against it strongly (I guess my mouth is too small or something).

Now, I am in another state for 3 months for an internship with a huge company. My husband is at home alone, so he can go back to looking at his girls all he wants. It makes me so afraid and he doesn't understand why I'm so concerned. I insisted on sending him nude photos of me so he has something to keep him from gonewild, but he said he ""feels bad"" looking at naked pictures of me. That was a real WTF moment for me right there. He feels bad looking at his wife nude, but has no problem jacking off to random chicks' boobs??

This weekend has been a real mess for us, and we've only been separated a week. We aren't even talking to each other. I can't talk to him about this anymore because all he ever does is threaten to cut/kill himself. He never makes an effort to show he is truly sorry because he was STILL refusing sex. And he still emotionally abuses me, sometimes physically (though not with punches, it's hard to explain). He always has to criticize me, especially on my looks, and he likes to make me feel dumb as garbage. I feel I am worth NOTHING to him. Of course, having no one to support me and my husband putting me down, I feel like I am worth nothing overall.

Anyway, I just want to know I'm not crazy for feeling so hurt. And I think the core of this issue is not being able to tell anyone at all, and just letting it all manifest inside myself. Add that with my lingering trust and mental issues from my childhood, and we get a major depression or some other screwed up mental state.

Just for extra detail, [here is a sketch](http://i.imgur.com/7EYyD.jpg) that I drew last night, the left reflecting the moment I found out, the right reflecting how I feel dealing with it. 

**TL;DR - Husband was looking at porn for 1 year of our 2 year marriage, starting soon after getting married. I can't seem to forget about it, especially since he keeps refusing sex like before, along with abusing me at some level. I have no one to talk to about it at all. We are now separated for 3 months for my internship and I don't know how to ease my fear of him looking again since he's alone, and overall anger at what he did.**"

I've decided that I'm going to submit my resume again anyway though, since I think I have a real shot at the job. But my question is, should I mention something about my original application in my new one? Or just act like I never applied?

I'm hoping I can find someone here who is familiar with French labor laws, or has gone through a similar experience and can provide some advice! I have been accepted into an internship for the summer in Paris which I am very excited about. I have Spanish residency (I'm studying there) that will expire next year so I don't have to worry about obtaining a visa.

A French friend of mine though told me to be more cautious. I will be working at the company for 3 months, unpaid (they are a new company and claimed they couldn't afford to. And I already accepted the offer regardless because the opportunity was so good). Additionally, I have not been told of any contracts I have to sign (so I'm assuming, for now, that they won't be asking me to sign a contract).

My friend seems to believe that if I don't sign a contract, that what I am doing is illegal, but he can't be certain because he doesn't know the law very well. I plan on emailing the company asking them of any contracts I have to sign, but before I do, I'd like to know what are my rights as a foreign resident of the EU working in France, and what obligations do companies have towards their interns? What are the risks of not signing a contract with said company?"

There's also no high-end DVD/Blu-ray work in Bristol to give me an in-roads to broadcast or video industry either. A specialist like me isn't that useful here.

I did work for a year as a creative tech manager for a local charity (AV for live events, filming, kit bookings, photography, Mac IT &amp; server support, creative tech support) but I left as the role and organisation was far too chaotic and they were far too reliant on 'self learning' rather than paying for proper training in anything (I want to do things properly or not at all).

I know the basics of graphic design (I've had to design some disc graphics, business cards, website etc), video production (had to edit a few basic conference videos together among other things), web development (hacked my own website together), IT support (basics, no professional training) and I have a pretty good knowledge of video formats. I don't feel any of these skills are good enough to get me into a professional organisation though - I'm a jack of all trades, master of none as it were.

I've been spending a lot of time at home without work for the last couple of months, phoning and emailing companies, going to networking events, but without much luck. I'm feeling pretty de-motivated, unconfident and useless at the moment. I'm trying to learn app development, web development and various software packages during this time to boost my skills but I just can't focus or seem to get anywhere.

If I was younger, I think I'd find it easier to jump in as a runner or intern (and learn on the job), but at the moment I get the feeling the companies I'm contacting don't know what to do with someone of my age (mid 30's) who's applying for entry level and even just for general temping work (I 'don't have any relevant office experience' apparently).

Boyfriend = [22/m]
Length of Relationship = 4 years
 
So a little background: I received an internship 1.5k miles from home with a great company for the whole summer (3 months). We've know about this since around February, but even with the notice, it was still hard to leave each other, family and home. My family decided to take a road trip with me a week before my move-in date to my apartment, but my boyfriend wasn't able to go due to work. So, since I've left until now, it's felt like a vacation that I'm returning from soon. It hasn't hit me yet that I'm gone, which is another problem in itself. Let's focus on the boyfriend.

While I'm excited for this opportunity and it's going to be great for my future career, my boyfriend hasn't been feeling that great. Since I've left, he's had stomachaches and other ailments. He finally went to the doctor and they told him he has anxiety, which he was given a prescription for. When he told me about the diagnosis, I told him I didn't know how I felt about it and that hurt him. I'm worried for him and today he told me that he has to force himself to eat sometimes. 

I feel bad, because missing him and my family isn't at the forefront of my mind. I'm trying to experience this new part of the country which I've never been to before and absorb the experience of living on my own with responsibilities. It's exciting and I want him to be excited too. We've made plans to see each other around his birthday this summer and he's going to fly over here to drive back with me. 

He also has jealousy issues (which I have too, I'm not going to lie) from being cheated on by a majority of his previous girlfriends. While over here, I'm living in a house with 2 guys and a girl. I have had drinks with one of the guys when his friend is over, but I'm not a stupid bimbo like his other girlfriends (sometimes I want to burn them at the stake). I am also in a major that is largely male.

How do I help him and how can he help himself?

**tl;dr: I am far away from my boyfriend for 3 months and he has developed anxiety issues. How can we both help with the situation and what can I do to be better support?**"
ub3nh,14,2012-05-29,"Today was the first day I realized I don't really care about her anymore, thank you r/breakups",[deleted],BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/ub3nh/today_was_the_first_day_i_realized_i_dont_really/,"Since my ex-gf broke up with me, 2 months ago, I have gotten in better shape (I can actually look in the mirror now and be proud of who I am), secured myself a summer internship on my own, without going through my dad or his friends, I have improved my relationship with my family and friends, all of whom have commented on how different I am now, and how considerate and thoughtful I have become, I have met tons of new people, and I learned to better navigate social interactions in general. I have cut down on smoking weed a lot, and have started going to therapy with a great therapist who is helping me work through my intense issues (C-PTSD from childhood abuse from my mother). Also, I volunteer at a local shelter a lot more, so now I get to walk and play with awesome rescue dogs and make their lives way better whenever I want to.    

I am happy now, and before I met this girl I wasn't happy, I was in a dark place. I was settling for her in a lot of ways, and now I realize that even though I'd like to be on good terms with her going forward, I really don't care either way, she is just, as gotye says, ""someone that I used to know."" If I run into her, I'll share some kind words if I feel like it, but all that pain is in my past, all the ways we hurt each other don't matter anymore. I didn't have much respect for her, she was narrow minded and her situation would have limited my options in life.    

I'm going to change the world one day, but not if I was stuck in a relationship with the first girl I fell in love with. I was immature, I didn't know what I was doing, and I realize that now. I did not like the relationship, I liked being able to have sex and companionship without putting much effort in, and that isn't a relationship, or even healthy.    

So, I just wanted to say thank you, r/breakups, the advice, feedback, and kind words you have given me, as well as just having a place to vent, have truly put me on the path to becoming a better person. Even the criticism I have received from some of you has opened my eyes to how controlling and insecure I can be, and I'm thankful for your honesty and bluntness.    

No contact works, even though it hurts, as does working out, and hanging out with friends and family. Take the advice guys, and it will get you through it.    

A quote that someone else shared with me that hits home:    

""Love anything and your heart will be wrung and possibly broken. If you want to make sure of keeping it intact you must give it to no one, not even an animal. Wrap it carefully round with hobbies and little luxuries; avoid all entanglements. Lock it up safe in the casket or coffin of your selfishness. But in that casket, safe, dark, motionless, airless, it will change. It will not be broken; it will become unbreakable, impenetrable, irredeemable. To love is to be vulnerable.""

Take it easy guys!

I'll try and keep this short, and if you're high and hate relationship troubles (I do) i won't mind you skipping this one.

I guess I'll shortly set it up like r/relationships...I'm 20M she's 19F were same grade/same school/live close at home and away. Dating near 8 months

All is well, but of course the big black hole of our relationship...you guessed it...trees :(

She has the D.A.R.E. imprinted mindset of trees obviously, she still is scared of them. She keeps specifically saying she thinks its 'dirty' overall...

That's fine to me. I don't judge, and i NEVER impose that she must use at all. Anytime she'll corner me as to why I smoke so much (almost daily, after all my shits done) I have to convince her I'm not addicted and I basically verbally repost what's on the front page of r/trees about how its not horribly bad for you/going to be legal soon. Right now we're at an 'agree to disagree but still love each other' standpoint.

Some things that are going to test whether we're together or broken up within the next 4-5 months are/were...

1. Her internship drug test. She was tweaking for a month straight about failing her drug test after only taking only a few hits a full month before the standard piss test. She just passed (I knew she would the entire time).
why that matters: after all her tweaking I'm almost sure getting her to try trees again is almost never going to happen. And she specifically said if she had failed she would have had to break up with me (fucking lame i know) so I see how quick to fire she is on the issue.

2. My apartment next year at school is going to be filled with me plus three other serious Ents, we're planning on smoking quite a lot. 
why that matters: if I don't confront her in some way about trees or get her to at least enjoy them she'll never come over and byebye gf.

After reading 1, you see she HAS smoked. Only a few times with me, but she's never gotten high. Or claims to have not. I've tried doing it with her alone, with her and all her friends, with her in a party setting. Part of the reason I feel this is even an issue is that she doesn't see what I get out of trees because she's only gotten the bad side of it (burning lungs from first time smoking, bad taste, bad first time smell, everyone else is high and she isn't, etc.) As of right now she's like a fisher who had a first bad couple experiences and stubbornly never wants to go fishing again.

My big question to you guys is where to go from here. Should I ask her to try smoking with me one more time, And make sure she gets high? Or should i just cut my losses and give up? Like I said I hate pressuring people, but I feel like she's missing out since she's so much like me :/  Any advice would be awesome.

**tl;dr**  Ent BF here wants GF to try trees one last time. Her good girl background/bad first few experiences/serious tweaking over a drug test she passed have her scared away from it. Need advice how to help a supreme tweaker that you love smoke and actually get high. Or just advice on how to get her to *want* to try it one last time. Not trying to force her. Thanks!

At a [0] now at work but I will be uptoking later listening to any and all advice!  "
uavfx,2,2012-05-29,Adopted IT guy needs help establishing server for small company.,[deleted],networking,https://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/uavfx/adopted_it_guy_needs_help_establishing_server_for/,"So here's what's up. I work for a branch of a small company (around 15 people). I'm their ""communications intern"" who has also been adopted as the IT guy. I've been given a task I have very little experience working with. They want me to come up with a plan to establish a server(s) and/or internal network storage. I've come to Reddit to ask for your expertise regarding how I advise them in this. The needs are two-fold:

Firstly: We work with a lot of video and I mean A LOT. Currently the computer used to edit video is connected to seven 4TB harddrives. This, as you can easily tell, is not sustainable. That is why we are looking to convert to a server and/or network storage unit that can hold everything and also make backups of the info in case one or multiple drives fail. Keep in mind we will own grow going into the future. The primary computer accessing this information is an iMac so we need something that has Firewire compatibility (USB 2.0 is too slow). We also need it to be able to expand in capacity as we grow. It would be nice if it could be PC compatible as we have a lot of laptops that run Windows. Another nice option too would be if it were able to have multiple computers, both PC and Mac, be connected to it at the same time.

Secondly: The other purpose of this server, or another server all together, is for the HR needs in administration. She, the administrator, needs to keep her files (currently only 2GB) kept very securely but with the option of sharing them to people whom only she grants access to. These files need to be able to be accessed from the Internet and held with different permissions for different people whom she gives those permissions to.

Were looking to spend about $2-3K for the first task and have not set a budget from the second. These needs may be consolidated if possible but it is very, VERY important the administration's files not be accessed by ANYONE unless purposely intended.

So, what help/advice can you offer me?"
uame1,3,2012-05-29,In a semblance of a relationship with an Ex and need help deciphering his actions. I'm also moving to his city for work and I'm hoping for reconciliation. Would appreciate some perspective here!,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/uame1/in_a_semblance_of_a_relationship_with_an_ex_and/,"My ex (25/m) broke up with me (25/f) about two months ago. It was only 6 months, but it was very passionate and things between us became very serious very quickly. We met four months prior to dating but grew to be close friends instantly and eventually FWB. I, of course, was very heartbroken about it ending. It was something he had to do as he was going through a stressful time, the relationship was a bit stressful for him (it was long distance and we saw each other monthly) and it was difficult for him to see a future together. Other than that, we were madly in love with each other and the relationship was perfect in terms of compatibility, just too complicated. (I want to try and keep this as short as possible, but I'll leave a small text at the bottom going further into our reasons for breaking up for those who want a better idea of what the reasons were)

We didn't go through the 'no-contact' phase. I rely on him and he still relies on me (although not as much as we used to when we were dating). Right now, it is a murky undefined territory for us in general. We talk almost on a daily basis (usually right before bed). Right now, he reads (and translates) a chapter from a book he wrote in his native language almost every night before bed. The sexual attraction between us is still very high (our sex was incredible) and we do have phone/skype sex occasionally, both of us send nude photos, things like that. I know he also is still very jealous of guys around me. I was invited to a pimps/hoes themed party and he asked to see what I was wearing to help assure me that it wasn't too hoe-y. After that, he 'slipped' and asked that I talk to him the entire time I'm there and then retracted saying he couldn't ask that of me. He is a very nice guy in general, but sometimes he does things for me that go above and beyond the call of friendship, and other times, he can be slightly distant. We send kisses at the end of our conversations, he tells me he talks to me more than anyone else he knows, he sometimes slips and calls me 'baby' but I ignore it assuming it's just out of habit. He had to change his password recently and couldn't use his other regulars as they had already been set. So I jokingly suggested he use 'super that-aint-right'. He took me seriously.

The problem right now is that in the moment of the break up two months ago, I hastily applied for an internship in his home city. I somehow managed to get an opportunity at an amazing company and I don't plan on letting the offer go. What I'm worried about is my relationship with my ex. He asked me not to come if it were just for him, and although I did apply with him in mind, I can't let this opportunity pass. Not only is the job amazing, but the city itself is exciting and new and I plan on doing a lot of travel cross-country while I'm there.

Once I found out I got accepted, I hesitated about telling my ex and waited a week before I finally let it out. He asked me why I didn't tell him sooner. And now he's become a bit more involved in this move than I had imagined. He asked me the name of the company I'm working for, the location, dates etc. When I told him I wasn't getting paid, he started getting defensive saying that I had to get paid (apparently it's a law there) and that he would go directly to the company for me and talk to them about it (The city is massive and this company is well out of his way). He's been asking his colleagues about what I can do in my situation, he's been preoccupied with this for the past two days working things out with me. This behavior confuses me immensely. Within this same time, he also started calling me 'his sweet that-aint-right', texting throughout the day. 

I still haven't gotten over the break up fully. I don't know how he feels about his decision to break up but if he ever wanted to get back together again, I would be really happy to go back to him. The issues leading up to our break up, though, make me a bit more realistic about what to expect from him. But his behavior is really confusing me. Most of the time, we carry on like nothing happened, and other times it seems like he is purposefully distancing himself from me

It would be really great if someone could help me decipher what he is thinking. I'm I reading too much into simple friendly help? Or could he possibly want something more? I'm sure this all must be confusing for him to. I'd also like some advice on how to deal with my ex while I'm there, given that we spend lots of time together now, and that he's already so involved in my relocation. (His involvement has lessened over the past few days because I think he is picking up on my hesitation about it). I want him to see how great things could be when we don't have to face the problems of a long-distance relationship but I also don't want to risk losing him as a friend or isolating him from my life. Welp.

**TL:DR** Boyfriend broke up a long-distance relationship with me 2 months ago because of doubts in the possibility of our future together. We continue to be friends but are maintaining a semblance of a relationship. Applied for a summer internship in his city and was accepted. Now I'm even further confused by what we are and what I want from him.

**Reasons for breaking up**
I'd just like to say that before we decided to date we fully acknowledged and discussed all the problems we would face and decided to date knowing fully the kind of sacrifices we would have to make. He lives 1000 km away and at the end of my school year next year, I might be even further away if I can't find work and have to move back home. Our cultures our different: He's European and I'm Middle Eastern. He's bilingual, although finds it difficult to articulate fully in English. I'm trying to learn his language (it's important to his parents). I also asked that we waited to have sex until marriage. We had a very creative sexual relationship but I'm a virgin (I use that term vaguely and don't feel as if virginity has the same importance that I used to place on it considering all the sexual activity we shared). Even without actual sex, he confided that I had been his most satisfying sexual partner. The hardest to deal with was the long distance aspect of the relationship; especially towards the end when he was going through a very stressful period with his senior project. It was very difficult for him knowing that I couldn't be there physically to support him. If you've gotten this far, you're awesome."

Since I will be visiting England and France with this internship, I have eliminated those parts of my trip. So now I have a city line-up of:

Rome
Florence
Venice
Munich 
Prague
Amsterdam

Between all of the Italian cities, I was thinking about 7 days. This leaves 7 days for Munich, Prague, and Amsterdam, which IMO is just barely not enough. (I have to go to Amsterdam either way because that is where my bus for London is leaving, but I could just go there for the sake of it being a point to depart.) The most logical city to eliminate, to me, is Prague, since it's more out of the way than all the others. I've heard it's simply awesome though, which makes me hesitate. So I thought I would get some outside opinion.

ua9sd,0,2012-05-29,Doctors refusing to help my boyfriend who suffers from mysterious ever-increasing chronic pain. Please help.,Rehauu,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ua9sd/doctors_refusing_to_help_my_boyfriend_who_suffers/,"My boyfriend was in rear ended a few years back and, less than a year later, developed horrible pain in his lower legs, fingers, and arms along with mild headaches and an ""uncomfortable feeling"" in his throat which has now been going on for over 2 years. At first, the pain would flare up and then improve. He was managing with heat and trying medicines like Neurontin. He saw several doctors repeatedly and was tested for everything obvious. He was finally diagnosed with Fibromyalgia. As the pain increased over time, he eventually stopped getting highs and lows and just had a constant level of pain that slowly increased. He eventually had to start taking hydrocodone to manage the pain. He's also on Cymbalta and Baclofen, he has Zanaflex for bedtime, and uses a mix of heat, TENS units, massage therapy, a chiropractor, and a gluten free diet to try and control it. Nothing but the hydrocodone puts a dent in it. He spends a lot of time shaking his legs and rocking back and forth, he can barely sleep at night which makes the pain even worse, and he's dropped over 20 lbs in a year which he didn't need to lose.

He was just recently sent to a pain specialist who says he feels that my bf's pain is too severe and too constant to be Fibromyalgia. He wants to do a spine MRI and check for MS among other things. He gave him a new hydrocodone prescription with a few more in it than before. Unfortunately, his pain actually got worse before he was due for a refill and he was forced to take extra just to function at all. Now, he has completely run out and he can't get a refill for another 9 days.

Here is the sticker. He called his pain doctor on Thursday to see what they could do and the nurse and front desk worker both repeatedly said he would get a call back that day and never did. Even the after hours on-call physician never returned his call. He went the entire holiday weekend debating whether or not to go to the ER but decided to stick it out until today (Tuesday). He spent an entire day crying off and on which is extremely out of character for him so I've worried as hell about him. I'm in another state doing an internship and can't even comfort him. He tried asking his regular doctor for help with the situation and was given another prescription of hydrocodone. The pharmacy refused to fill it. His doctor's nurse finally called him back just a few minutes ago and told him that they couldn't do anything for him because he has only seen them once and is too new of a patient.

What in the world is he supposed to do? He barely made it through the weekend and had to borrow a few Vicodin (which have half the hydrocodone in them of his pills) from a friend of his mom's and was managing on just a fraction of his usual dose. So not only is he in horrible pain already but he's also being forced to suffer some withdrawal symptoms. His doctors knew he would be dependent on the medicine and still allow this to happen. I really don't understand. He's not drug seeking, he doesn't abuse it, he takes it when he can't stand it anymore which just happens to be most of the time. It's reaching a breaking point and we're both getting desperate to figure out what's causing his pain and solve it with something other than narcotics. Nothing is happening fast enough. He's doing everything he can to just take the edge off the pain.

Should he just go to the ER? Would they even care to help him? What could they do to help? If all they can do is give him a shot or something, how is he supposed to last until the 7th? We're both freaking out, his mom is terrified he's going to do something impulsive like kill himself (although I don't think he will. He is scared and hurt, not depressed.) Is there anything else he can do? 

TL;DR: My bf has insane amounts of chronic pain in his legs that leaves him rocking back and forth for hours on end and ran out of medicine when the pain increased more than expected in a fairly short amount of time. His doctor refuses to help him. What should he do to make it to his refill date on the 7th? Would the ER be able to do anything?


UPDATE: His pain doctor contacted his regular doctor and they agreed to send him to the addiction/psych ward of the main hospital. He was really upset that they would think he is an addict or a drug seeker but we both agreed that he should go so they could see that he doesn't fit the profile of an addict and see that he is truly in a lot of pain. He left just before 10 am and I just heard from him (at 12:30 pm). He said the doctor at the addiction/psych ward was surprised that his pain doctor refused to help him and they didn't even hesitate and gave him two Percocet and an Ativan. I am beyond relieved at this point but now we still have to tackle the main problem of.. What could possibly be causing this that we haven't already ruled out?

Thank you all for your help and suggestions, I really appreciate it and will pass them on to him as soon as I can. If anyone has any ideas as to what else could cause these kinds of symptoms, anything else that might be worth trying to relieve the pain, or any questions, please feel free to comment or PM me."

ua4r9,1,2012-05-29,"GF left for SC a month ago, and staying there for 3 more months...",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/ua4r9/gf_left_for_sc_a_month_ago_and_staying_there_for/,"Hello fellow redditors, 

I'm **21** and here's my story:

Well it all started like 8 months ago when my GF(soon-to-be 20) got into hospitality management school. We are both Lebanese, and we've been together for 2 years (before we actually broke up knowing that LDR doesn't actually work hoping for the best in the future). The thing is like a month before she left, I was hurting like hell, so  decided not to talk to her again, as part of forgetting her and avoiding getting more hurt... I told her about why I'm stopping and etc. Like a week later, her friends started talking to me asking me how I've been doing etc(in fact they never talked to me before on phone or IM, so it was like she was trying to find out how I've been doing etc.) then a week later she called me, we talked for 5 minutes about her brother(she said she just called to ask for advice about her brother) but the conversation went well beyond that and she said she missed me and we hang out 2 days later.

However, 2 days before she left, she called me and said I want you to come over, and cried saying she's going to miss me and it's also hard for her. and then a day earlier, she had a farewell party, and I stayed at her place until a late time helping her pack everything, until I finally had to say goodbye, and she burst into tears and starting crying, hugged me really hard and kissed me.

I was hurting a lot deep inside, but actually couldn't show it.

When she left, we had already agreed to keep in touch from time to time, and as she arrived she sent me her US phone number. I tried to keep in touch with her until recently (like a week ago) she said she doesn't want me to call her again, nor wants to keep in touch as this is hurting her a lot. I respected her choice and said ok I'm no longer going to call you nor message you, however if you feel like talking to me do. A week passed and she still didn't talk to me. she'll be back in 3 months, and in 2 weeks I'll be leaving for UC berkeley as part of my internship and summer sessions. 

I tried to book a plane to go see her on her birthday, or on any weekend, but I cancelled every reservation knowing that she doesn't want. It actually really hurts me, knowing that I had to break up with the girl I love and still love for a lame reason. But what hurts me most is that we're no longer talking together. What could she be up to? 

When I talked to her a week earlier I told her please if there was another guy tell me I would try to understand and seek for other things in life. She strongly denied having another guy and told me she wants to be alone for the coming months and wants to enjoy her life until she finally figures out whether we're meant or not.

I really can't wait for 3 more months (I believe I'm actually hurting a lot now because I'm having my finals and have nothing to distract me from that issue).

TL;DR: So is she seeing another guy and that's why she no longer wants to talk to me?
Is she actually hurting and doesn't want to to me because of that?
And what hurts me most is the fact that she could be doing stuff with other guys while I'm still waiting for her (I hope you know what I mean)

Sorry for the long post and please give me some advice... Thank you!"

u9w9a,2,2012-05-29,I have just requested a leave of absence from my Masters program. Why do I feel guilty about it?,theforemost,Christianity,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/u9w9a/i_have_just_requested_a_leave_of_absence_from_my/,"I'm struggling with a decision I have made to take a leave of absence from my Masters program. My masters program requires me to live incarnationally among the poor, learn, and practice anything from church development/bible studies/sharing Christ to community economics/health care/education/advocacy. My program is through the U.S. but I am studying in a major city in India.

I need to go home and support my family because they are going through a lot right now. They tell me that they're fine but my mom is being attacked by her brothers (my uncles) for taking care of my grandparents. They are accusing her of trying to hoard favor from my grandparents and trying to take over property all of which my mom is NOT doing. All she is doing is caring for my grandparents out of love and respect on her own.

I don't feel supported by my local contacts/college here. There have been talks from my U.S. professors with my Indian professors to get them to more involved in my life and needs as a student with lectures, internships and house stays. The local Indian college hasn't done the greatest of job in this (to put it mildly).

I met a nice woman here that I have fallen in love with and want to marry. She has been a major source of encouragement and has helped me along as much as she can with my frustrations with my Indian college.

I want to work with my college here and do some work on my own in order to get myself return in line. I'd like to return in a year's time. I can't meet the satisfactory academic requirements unless I do this. It will be hurt if I stay with my program AND try to work out my academic issues. As the oldest son in my family I feel it is absolutely necessary that I be there and offer any help I can. The way I see that is by living with my grandparents and taking care of them while my mom takes care of herself.  I also want to mediate with my family. I think Christ will bless me in being a peace maker. I didn't plan on finding a woman or a woman that I would want to marry but I have and I do so I also have that to consider for a leave of absence.

My questions are...Why do I feel so guilty? Why do I feel like I failed or lost? I don't want to quit my program. All I know is that I want to a break so that I can take care of my family, give my local college the space to host me well, and to marry the woman that I love.

It's been a long process but I am trusting in God to take care of me. I have given him all my hopes and desires. I have been living abroad and serving him here. I haven't been neutral in serving him. I am trusting in him as I move forward and I am waiting on him when I need his blessing or can't move forward.

Did I fail by not being able to finish my program in the allotted time of two years? What am I going through right now. I feel like one burden has been taken and new one has been put on.

TL;DR I'm in an incarnational Masters program in India (I'm from U.S.). Requested leave of absence to take care of my family, get a better hold on academics, and get married. Somehow, though, I feel guilty/shame/anxiety. Why do I feel that way?"

u9tmt,3,2012-05-29,How to deal with unknown futures in an LDR?,ari7,LongDistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/u9tmt/how_to_deal_with_unknown_futures_in_an_ldr/,"Hi all.  I've been in a wonderful relationship with a wonderful guy for 6 months now.  We both go to the same university, but he's 21 and going to be graduating next year.  I'm 19 and graduating a year after him.  He also plans on going into a PhD program which can be 5+ years, but will not know where until next spring. 
We'll have some practice in distance in that we have to spend this summer (4 months) apart. The first month has been fine, and I don't doubt that we can make it work. The hard part is the unknown that comes after.

Next year, I'll get three months with him in the fall semester, spend a month away, three months for spring semester, and then he graduates and goes to grad school while I go away for a summer internship.

We have no idea where he'll end up for grad school, but chances are it will be a plane ride away.  We'll have to deal with that for a year, and thats even assuming that I can get a good job in the same area as his uni the following year.

He's asked me where I'd like to work in the future so he can apply to schools in that area, since I've had some great career opportunities neither of us want me to lose, but I don't want to ask that of him, because I want him to do whats best for his career as well. 

I'm worried about the sacrifices one of us might have to make, and just how being apart is so hard.  I trust him, but its hard to completely avoid feeling insecure with distance, and worrying about something that just might not work geographically.  I know that I should just focus on the fact that I love him, but the logistical side of me worries about juggling all these unknowns.
Does anyone have advice for dealing with this sort of situation?"

This is my second build, I'm looking to replace a 2 year old rig that has served me well and is still going strong, but I've gotten my first job / internship and I love to build so here it goes.

CPU: intel i5-3750k

CPU Cooler: cooler master V8
(I've done a lot of research and asked on toms, and I am able to confirm that this cooler will allow me to get to 4.5 ghz I wanted to go with the noctua nh-d14 but I just love the design of the v8, and it's a lot cheaper!)

MB: AsRock Z77 extreme6

 GPU: Radeon HD 7870 

Case: nzxt phantom full tower white w/ red trim

SSD: http://tinyurl.com/buz54zx

I've got a 500gb Samsung spinpoint, a copy of windows, and a 650w corsair tx psu as well as 8gb of ddr3 g.skill ripjaw ram, so I should be good there. ( Oh, and of course my mouse and keyboard and such).

Total: ~$1,100

My biggest concern comes from the ssd, I want one and I only want to spend about 100 bucks. I'm new to the ssd world and while this looks like a good choice to me, I'm not sure. I know I want at least 120 - 128 Gb to make it useful to me, but other than that I'm lost.

Any opinions are welcome, I think I've got a sold build picked out aside from the ssd, and I'm excited to order! Finally, sorry for the messy formatting I'm doing this from my iPad...

However, my formal IT work experience is quite light; since 2001, I haven't even logged two years working in an office setting drawing a steady paycheck. I put myself through college by working as an independent IT technician, gathering jobs from OnForce and referrals from friends and family. I'd held my last position for eighteen months, when I was hired as a QA Specialist for a small data services company in Manhattan, but was let go when my primary responsibility of data acquisition using Python was outsourced to the Ukraine.

I've been told by a few recruiters that I should focus on a single specialty in the IT field in order to improve my prospects. I've spent quite a bit of time working with the QA department of my first real employer many years ago, and that's where I felt most comfortable, so that's where I'd like to spend my time. However, my QA experience is limited to my current job title, and an unproductive summer internship spent doing some manual testing for a website. Ideally, I'd be happiest with a contract position in an established QA department where I could gather enough experience over a 4 to 6 month period to move into a more senior position.

uc9z3,49,2012-05-30,How to motivate ones self,sigmasix114,TrueAskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAskReddit/comments/uc9z3/how_to_motivate_ones_self/,"So I'm currently a junior in college. I'm studying computer science and do *decently* well in it. I've had a couple internships and all that jazz, I play bass guitar and love to play dems videogames. But i've recently come to a fairly shocking realization: I'm not motivated to do **anything**. Literally anything at all.

 It's gotten to a point where the amount of effort it takes to get myself to class everday is just absurd. I've stopped playing bass for the most part (that was  a long time in the process, though). I don't really even play videogames all that much anymore, somehow the joy of it has just dissipated. When I do play some of my favorite games I get the feeling that I'm just going through the motions, desperately trying to regain that old nostalgic feeling.

I've tried to motivate myself to work on some projects, like design my own app or software or something to that tune, but all that ends up happening is I stare at a blank text editor, maybe define a factorial function (because why not, right?) and then save it and close it ""to be worked on at some other point"", which obviously never happens.

My lack of motivation/laziness has gotten so intense that I don't even smoke weed anymore. **That's right**, I've become so lazy that I don't even bother getting high. I didn't know that was something that could happen, it's like I've transcended stoner and reached some sort of meta-stoner levels of laziness. 

Simply put, nothing seems particularly appealing. I don't feel specifically depressed, I'm not in a dark hole of misery or anything along those lines, I just feel very bland. I don't really want to do much of anything, and when I do go out and ""do"" stuff it feels very forced. It's sort of like I'm making a deal with myself - ""If I go out tonight, then I can stay in and watch re-runs I've seen dozens of times without feeling guilty tomorrow night"".

I'm wondering how many other people feel the same way (I'm quite confident I'm not particularly unique in this lack of motivation) and if any people that did experience it eventually conquered it, how. Thanks guys."

My new job is stuck on Windows 98!,coreybo24,techsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/uc6r0/help_my_new_job_is_stuck_on_windows_98/,"I just started this summer engineering internship and they only use Windows 98. The PC they gave me is a Pentium III. The monitor is a NEC ""MultiSync 95"". I don't know what that means except that it is enormous. Also everything on the screen is HUGE and in horrible color. The resolution will not increase past 640x480, and the colors won't change from 16 colors even though I selected different options then restarted as recommended. I tried downloading KernelEx so that I could use some Windows 2000/XP stuff but that didn't really work. I downloaded Opera as my internet browser which has helped a little, but maybe there's another one out there?

Main requests:
Recommended upgrades and tools?
Best internet browser to download?
How can I fix the color and resolution?
Any other suggestions...

Links would be helpful. Thanks in advance!

UPDATE: I just want to clarify that this is an environmental engineering summer internship, so no lives are in direct danger by bad hardware/software. And I doubt that they would be in ""design danger"" either because it's still a reliable company that does good work. And I'm gaining some pretty valuable experience right now so I don't think I would quit unless I got a better offer. So... temporary fixes??

Questions|Answers
:--|:--
[I love Shadowrun for the SNES, one of my favorite games, ever.  Also has one of the best beginnings: waking up in the morgue, falling out of a slab in the wall.  What inspired that beginning scene?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uavdc/i_am_jordan_weisman_creator_of_shadowrun/c4tsfj4?context=5)|Denny Thorley, the Producer on the game, loved the game but wanted a little ""lighter"" take on it. So as I often do I went the other way and pitched the opening in the morgue - not only to tweak him but because it gave us a great way of introducing the world to the character and the player at the same time since Jake had lost his memory. Plus, I really wanted to hit some of the central Noir themes, and the combination of dead man walking and lost memories play right into Noir.
[How important will be dialogues in your game? Will there special quests that can be solved through dialogues? Skills that can be used in dialogues? Will quests have more solutions?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uavdc/i_am_jordan_weisman_creator_of_shadowrun/c4tsfvi?context=5)|We think that the conversations are one of the key pillars of the game. We want the game to be about story, and in an RPG story is told via a combination of action and dialog with the majority of the depth coming from the dialog. I have been focusing all my efforts exclusively on the design of this critical aspect over the last several weeks and I am very excited about where we are headed, including the ability for quests to be solved only through leg work and conversations. 
[Back in 1993, when i was still a kid living under the roof of my fundamentalist christian parents, dying to get into tabletop roleplaying your game was the first one that actually appealed to me. For years I have been a gigantic fan. I've followed your system, read the fic, followed your kickstarter development and drooled with total anticipation.  Before I ask a single question THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU for the worlds you made, from Shadowrun to Crimson Skies thank you. Don't ever stop. Don't ever quit on your stuff, because its freakin awesome.  What other directions have you considered taking your IP's in? Have you ever considered getting anything like a TV series based on Shadowrun or Crimson Skies?  How do you feel about the Shadowrun MMO project they are working on in Germany? Are you concerned about how well recieved its going to be as a F2P model?  4th Edition Shadowrun is kinda a point of contention among its fans; how do you like the direction the universe took after the 4th ed stuff started coming out?  What were some of the ideas when you first designed the history starting from 1st edition that you looked at at the time and said ""Well, that actually sounds pretty awesome but I don't think anyone will buy it."" and tossed?  Do you still have worlds left up in your head that you haven't had a chance to do anything with?  Do you think its ever a possiblity that Shadowrun (after Returns and the Online project outta Germany\) could ever see Triple AAA production values from a major studio again, or did the whole FPS thing completely jade you to the experience? (Honestly, wouldn't blame you if it did.\)  Also; if some rabid, mildly insane mega fan of yours from canada was to arrange to have a sandwich delivered to you, what kind of sandwich would you prefer?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uavdc/i_am_jordan_weisman_creator_of_shadowrun/c4tuyvu?context=5)|I've been working on tv and movie versions of my game settings for years. Maybe some day.  The SR MMO looks promising and I can't wait to see what our friends at Cliffhanger Games come up with.  I'm focusing on the original Shadowrun era because that's the one I created and still love. I know some people are unhappy with 4th Edition but I'm not part of that.  I generally don't ""toss"" many ideas I have for games, especially RPGs. They often live for so long, all my ideas eventually make it in.  There are plenty of game worlds still in my head. The question is, would anyone else like them?  I think that Shadowrun would make a great AAA game and I know just what I would do with it. However: A) I don't own the rights B) I don't want to spend years on a single project.
 |In general, I don't eat things given to me by anyone who could be described at ""rabid"". Hope that makes sense. . . 
[Assuming that you guys knock it out of the park on this release, what are your long term goals for the Shadowrun franchise?  What do you want to be when you grow up?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uavdc/i_am_jordan_weisman_creator_of_shadowrun/c4tsjln?context=5)|Man I have been asking myself that question since I was 10 and I still don't have a good answer for that.
 |All I know is that I want me and Harebrained Schemes to keep making games that we love and want to play. 
[FASA created some of the most intriguing settings for games, and you're responsible for quite a bit.  What would it take to get all of the FASA licenses permanently wrestled away from Microsoft and into the hands of loving creators such as yourself?  Is there a Kickstarter for this in the future?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uavdc/i_am_jordan_weisman_creator_of_shadowrun/c4ttzvz?context=5)|Thanks for the complements. I don't think we will ever end up with all the right for the old FASA games, but our goal at Harebrained Schemes is to start creating games and universes with the same integrity, depth, and intriguing settings like I used to do at FASA - so stay tuned for what happens in the next couple of years :)
[Hi thanks for doing this! What races will be playable in SRR?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uavdc/i_am_jordan_weisman_creator_of_shadowrun/c4tsept?context=5)|Human, Elf, Ork, Troll, ,and Dwarf.
[Thanks for doing this AMA. I would like to know a few things about *Shadowrun Returns*.  ** **Street Samurai** see a threat assessment overlay of the environment that notes enemy appraisals, options for cover, potential weapons, and statistics for drawn weapons.*  ** **Combat Mages** see magical auras, granting them the ability to locate magical items, identify spells being prepared, and find the intersections of magic lay lines where they can recharge their power.*  ** **Hackers/Deckers** see the digital control circuitry that allows them to manipulate the physical world via the digital one.*  ** **Shaman** see the “true world” that lies in the astral plane, distinguishing the true nature of people, plants, creatures, and magical objects while buildings and other “dead” objects appear as mere shadows.*  I love this idea and I'd love to hear more about it. (I'm new to SR world.\)  A few questions come to mind. Is Samurai's perspective basically our own (i.e. perception of moving physical objects through sensory stimuli\)? Will graphical assets change significantly in different perspectives? Will UI change significantly in different perspectives? Would change of perspective change perception of other senses than sight? (I'm thinking about hearing.\)  **II.** What kind of graphical engine will you use?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uavdc/i_am_jordan_weisman_creator_of_shadowrun/c4tsm0y?context=5)|The street samurai's view is the ""physical"" world but overlayed with a HUD that displays weapons and tactical information, kind of like a fighter pilots HUD does for air combat. As the player clicks to other characters there are graphical elements that change to present that characters ""world view"", but mostly it is overlays of information (glowing auras, laylines, etc) and some cool visual effects rather than a completely new view. We are expanding the Moai client code base for our graphical engine 
[Thank you for doing this first and foremost. As a troubled young adult, I am looking for a purpose. What brought you into the idea of creating game developing?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uavdc/i_am_jordan_weisman_creator_of_shadowrun/c4tscjb?context=5)|I was a dyslexic child and cold not read well. As a teenager I encountered D&amp;D and it totally blew me away. Here was a game that inspired the imagination and thrived on socialization. It caused me to learn to read those damn confusing rules and all of Lord of the Rings as well. Totally changed my life.
[Given that SR will be cross-developed for both tablets **AND** PC/Mac/Linux, does that mean that we can't expect a game that's larger in scale/scope, and have more than 10 hours of gameplay (given the graphics, memory and processor speed limits of tablets\)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uavdc/i_am_jordan_weisman_creator_of_shadowrun/c4tsi0v?context=5)|Since the current tablets are already more powerful than the home PC's of the 1990s I don't believe the limitation is not a hardware one but rather one of realizing that there is a ""hardcore"" game audience on the devices and that they will pay enough to create games of appropriate depth.
[I am thinking about how brief (but marvelous!\) Crimson Steam Pirates was, and hoping that we're going to see longer, more in-depth gameplay.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uavdc/i_am_jordan_weisman_creator_of_shadowrun/c4tsi0v?context=5)|Crimson was not an RPG, but rather a linear tactical combat game so SR will be much much deeper and have a longer play than for sure. Plus with all the creativity of the SR audience empowered by the editor we will release it should have an unlimited amount of play. 
[What was your favorite mech in MechWarrior?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uavdc/i_am_jordan_weisman_creator_of_shadowrun/c4tuuyc?context=5)|I'd say it was the MadCat--it was the first 'Mech to really capture the aesthetic I was looking for.
[1\) What personal beliefs allow you to identify with and enjoy the heavy metal, cyberpunk aspects of the content you create?  2\) With perhaps the exception of Shadowrun, many of these universes share themes of honor, duty, pragmatism, contrasted with the stories of people who face the consequences of believing in those ideals. Which of these ideals, or ones that I may have missed, do you share?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uavdc/i_am_jordan_weisman_creator_of_shadowrun/c4ttsoz?context=5)|I enjoy creating and telling stories in complex worlds with shades of gray rather than stark black and white because it gives the writer more legitimate and compelling points of view to work from. In BT/MW we created very different Houses and Clans each of which had their own compelling world view and philosophy. While they were often ""evil"" from each other's points of view, from an objective point of view the reader could understand the actions taken and how they meshed (or didn't) with each culture's view of what honor or duty means.  Shadowrun has it's own version of what honor and duty means. While an RPG allows and encourages each GM to create their own version of the world they are playing in, in my version of Shadowrun the runners are classical anti-heroes meaning that they are totally outside the ""law"" doing things that disrupt society but they do live by an internal code of honor and duty to each other and to the SINless, the poor souls without system identification numbers that live in the slums and are prayed upon by gangs and corps with equal abandon. In my version of the game the runners are often the only hope the SINless have.  
[, I'd like to say that I'm a big fan of both Shadowrun and BattleTech, so thanks for creating those.  Also, how much input did you and the other folks at FASA have into the  various Shadowrun video games (the SNES &amp; Genesis games, as well as the Sega Mega-CD game that never made it out of Japan\)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uavdc/i_am_jordan_weisman_creator_of_shadowrun/c4tsdg5?context=5)|Thanks for the thank yous. In actual fact I had every element for the first 25 years of the game all written in code on my padded cell wall BEFORE we published the first edition of Shadowrun which means I am about to run out of material and better start writing again soon :)
[1\] Which edition of the table-top game do you think will have the most influence on the genre and setting of Shadowrun Returns?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uavdc/i_am_jordan_weisman_creator_of_shadowrun/c4ttcb1?context=5)|1 &amp; 2) We are mostly looking to the 2nd and 3rd editions of the P&amp;P game for our inspiration and time setting.
[3\] Should we expect to see a more wired or wireless world?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uavdc/i_am_jordan_weisman_creator_of_shadowrun/c4ttcb1?context=5)|3) Well its funny with all the good guesses I made about the future 23 years ago I totally missed the wireless revolution :) Our current thought is that we will hit a middle ground between the ""retro"" future of the original version and a more up to date version of the world. 
[Mechwarrior was one of my favorite game franchises, and the whole concept of piloting a mech is unbelievably cool. Why would you give this franchise up and let it die. Is there any chance of mechs coming back?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uavdc/i_am_jordan_weisman_creator_of_shadowrun/c4tv5jk?context=5)|I never gave up the MechWarrior franchise. I just don't own it anymore. It's owned by Microsoft. However, Pirhana games is doing MechWarrior Online right now. 
[Yeah, the video they made like 3 years ago looked great, but this new game is nothing like that. Seems like a typical online game with no story mode.

[As someone who sadly is moderately young, I didn't get a chance to grow up with Shadowrun as many people here might have. That said, I'm following this project with extreme interest because I love everything cyberpunk. So my question is, even though this game is primarily for Shadowrun fans is it something that a newbie who lives and breathes cyberpunk and RPGs could enjoy as well?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uavdc/i_am_jordan_weisman_creator_of_shadowrun/c4tshws?context=5)|We want to make sure that SRR is not just for those that grew up with SR, and thus will it will have all the depth of SR lore that we can shove into it, we are working really hard to make sure that it is a great entry into the world of Shadowrun that does not make the first time player feel overwhelmed. 
[What dragon will be considered for eating a kitten? - will there be a fully functional stuffer shack? - will we see dunkelzahns inauguration party as a DLC event? - will there be havens for chars to hole up and spend their money in?  ^_^](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uavdc/i_am_jordan_weisman_creator_of_shadowrun/c4tteuw?context=5)|1) We believe that no dragon should be left behind when it comes to kitten gastronomy. 2) Funny, we were just talking about Stuffer Shack! Fully functional? No. 3) No. 4) We're thinking yes and perhaps they'll get nicer as your Lifestyle increases. Perhaps.
[Love MechWarrior, sadened there hasn't been a modern release of this game with mega awesome graphics.  Is this something we may be able to see, even on console?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uavdc/i_am_jordan_weisman_creator_of_shadowrun/c4tv4la?context=5)|Google MechWarrior Online. Your wish is coming true.
[How heavily was the Shadowrun game influenced by William Gibson's writing, specifically the short story ""Burning Chrome""?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uavdc/i_am_jordan_weisman_creator_of_shadowrun/c4tv85i?context=5)|Shadowrun was influenced by a variety of sources including Gibson but owes just as much to D&amp;D.
[Will Gibson be consulted in any manner for the new game? I would love to hear he's involved in any capacity!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uavdc/i_am_jordan_weisman_creator_of_shadowrun/c4tv85i?context=5)|Gibson will not be consulted--he's not a big fan of cybered elves. ;)
[Me and my brother loved Mechwarrior! Oh man.. Co-op was frustrating cause he was a terrible shooter though.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uavdc/i_am_jordan_weisman_creator_of_shadowrun/c4tvc3v?context=5)|Yes, game development is expensive. The main cost: great people.

And outside of PnP: what card/board games do you consider your favorites?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uavdc/i_am_jordan_weisman_creator_of_shadowrun/c4tvrgh?context=5)|I loves me some Civilization II. Card/board--anything with ""strip"" in the title.
[Love you for the table top games from my teen years. (Battletech, Shadowrun.\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uavdc/i_am_jordan_weisman_creator_of_shadowrun/c4tu28w?context=5)|I wouldn't say that tabletop games were the result of limited technology. When Dungeons and Dragons was created, no one was saying, ""Since we don't have personal computers, let's do this."" Instead, I would say that they were an innovative expansion on the tabletop miniature wargames of the era.
[Were pen and paper RPGs a result of limited technology, or a legit art form that should be kept alive? (Did they peak and they had their day, or do their rules and pacing offer something special.\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uavdc/i_am_jordan_weisman_creator_of_shadowrun/c4tu28w?context=5)|I am all in favor of tabletop role-playing and wish I had more time for it. From my perspective, it has nothing to do with rules or pacing. It's about getting together with your friends and spending a few hours using your imaginations together. All these years later, there's still nothing like it. 
[Hello Jordan, first I want to thank you for the fantastic work you've done. The themes in mechwarrior of personal honor, pride in one's self and loyalty to ones house have had a deep personal impact on me. How much of the story is guided by you personally and what of the universe do your writers influence in creating your vision?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uavdc/i_am_jordan_weisman_creator_of_shadowrun/c4tvvb2?context=5)|I love collaborating with creative people and enjoy allowing others to grow, evolve and enhance my ideas. Early on, the story was heavily guided by me. Then, when I found the right people to pass the torch to, I stepped back and focused on other projects, checking in regularly to ensure the original vision was being maintained.
[Why do you think Shadowrun struck such a cord in Germany?  I'm US-based and am curious/jealous at how much larger the fans seems to be over there.  A friend of mine, whose played since first edition, even overheard a random group of tourists riding a the train from an airport discussing the game.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uavdc/i_am_jordan_weisman_creator_of_shadowrun/c4ttlmv?context=5)|Its a fine question. I think it is because it hit a nerve at the intersection of Cyberpunk which as very popular in Germany a different take on classic high fantasy that has also been very popular in Germany. But maybe some of the German fans can express it better or correct me altogether!
[Jordan, big fan of your work!  I'm a writer who has been working on a game similar to Shadowrun Returns for a while - we loved the P&amp;P Shadowrun, and wanted to see it reincarnated as a squad-based strategy game somewhere between X-COM and Disgaea.  I'm excited to see what the official version winds up being!  My question is, how does someone contribute writing to a project like yours?  Is there an opening for an internship, or do you accept submissions?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uavdc/i_am_jordan_weisman_creator_of_shadowrun/c4ttdw9?context=5)|Thanks, we're excited too.

This is kind of broad, but how did you go about owning a business with somebody?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uavdc/i_am_jordan_weisman_creator_of_shadowrun/c4ttpe9?context=5)|I did attend Circle Campus for a year and it was a good experience. Starting businesses isn't hard, it's staying in business that's hard. The trick is to first find a business that you can afford to start and be excellent in. To do that you need to keep your costs down as low as possible. When I started FASA in 1980 I lived with my parents and took no salary for two years to get the company going (32 years later I am doing it again to get HBS going).
 |In terms of partners the key thing to realize is that it is like picking a wife or husband as they are somebody that you are going to spend A LOT of time with for hopefully many years. You need to make sure that you can work with that person to reach decisions quickly and that their work ethic and style matches your own. Even with all that said, make sure that your partnership agreement provides for exiting a partner should everything not work out well. 
[I read on your kickstarter update that you hired the original composers of the games on the Sega and SNES. This makes me very happy. Since the music of the original games was limited by the hardware of the time, will they still adopt the chiptune approach ?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uavdc/i_am_jordan_weisman_creator_of_shadowrun/c4tumso?context=5)|Yes we have engaged the Sam Powell, composer of the Sega Gensis SR game AND the Marshall Parker, composer of the SNES SR game to contribute music to Shadowrun Returns. I can't speak to their method of composition but clearly we will clearly be using WAV files or similar for playback. 
[Hello, Jordan.

[All I saw was creator of MechWarrior.  I spent so much time playing the RTS version of MechWarrior. Please make another one because man, it was the bees knees.  Raven = best mech eva.

ubkmp,2,2012-05-29,I got two job offers ... HELP!,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ubkmp/i_got_two_job_offers_help/,"After graduation, I applied for full time positions *and* for internships because applying for full time didn't go well since I didn't have any ""experience"". In March I was able to snag an offer for an internship that I accepted. I figured it was better than nothing and I needed experience so when I to a job fair, I have more ""competitive experience"". Also, I figured if I do well on the internship, it could lead to full time with the company. Sounds great, right?

Two months later I got a call and interviewed with another company and *FINALLY!!* after countless rejections, I got a full time offer with a great company!! 

The hiring manager gave me a verbal offer over the phone and told me HR will email me the details. :) I haven't heard from HR about my start date yet and I haven't I gotten a written offer via email, but I hope those will come soon. It's been a week and I'm concerned because my internship starts next week. :/ 

So now I'm in a bit of a mess. I didn't want to cancel my internship last minute without a written offer from the other company because I didn't want to take the risk in case my full time offer gets retracted for some reason. :/ So at this point, I'll likely get the details of my start date sometime *during* my internship. 

There's a chance I can do my full internship or that I'll have to quit 3-5 weeks into my internship. In other words, I'll work for 3-5 weeks and tell them I quit. :( I don't really know what to do. I don't want to tell either company about each other just yet because it will look bad. I mean, what would you think if I told you on the very first day of my internship ""*I think* i might have another offer somewhere else so I'm gonna quit in a few weeks?"" What should I do if my start date is in the middle of my internship? Do I just up and quit? Should I try to push my full time start date till after my internship. Overall, the full time position is a priority for me.  

Thanks for your help, Everyone!

Gorgeous, funny, smart, etc. (I also have this problem with being able to tell if someone is into me, or if she's just being nice and friendly). Recently, she invited me to go visit her in DC, where she's doing an internship, because ""August is forever away"", which is when she would be back in town. Is it safe to say that she at least likes me a little bit? Also, should I go? because I would love to. I just don't wanna be led on or anything. idk if this even makes any sense, but I needed some outside perspective, because my friends are all spontaneous and tell me to go for it, whereas I'm always the cautious, play-it-safe one.

ubakf,1,2012-05-29,Need perspective...,Irregular_Expression,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/ubakf/need_perspective/,"Hello Reddit. First post, but have lurked for awhile now.

I recently graduated from a private, non-profit, regionally accredited online program with a BS in CS in December. I have been working locally as an intern for a few months. I completed some work in Visual Basic for this company, and they use my program on a daily basis.

This is fine, but there aren't really any open positions within the company. I can't continue to live off an interns pay forever.

I have been looking for jobs, and have had a couple of good interviews, but didn't land the jobs. Each time I interview, I get the feeling that when it is found out that I completed the program online (which I am honest about), it feels like they don't take me as serious as they should. I feel like I know how to program, and have been doing it for some time now (prior to school). But rarely do I get the chance to show it. The places that I interviewed for haven't asked for prior work or have had coding tests.

What should I do? Should I simply not mention it's an online program (even though it is an actual brick and mortar school)? Should I try to force projects at them? If anyone has experience with this I would love to hear it. Additionally, if you have hiring experience I would love to listen as well. "
uba2l,5,2012-05-29,"Just Met My S/O Today, Where Do We Go from Here? ",AnonymousRebel,wemetonline,https://www.reddit.com/r/wemetonline/comments/uba2l/just_met_my_so_today_where_do_we_go_from_here/,"I guess I'll just dive right into this, then. Keep in mind, I'm 18, going into college next year, and my S/O is 17, going to be a senior in high school next year. Nobody knows about us except a few of her close friends, a close friend of mine, and my brother. This story is gonna be a long one, so apologies in advance.

I first met my S/O over Chatroulette last April.  She seemed really cool, we had a great conversation, but she had a boyfriend, so I just thought we'd be internet friends and that'd be that. Not that it was a bad thing; she was still really cool and fun to talk to. We talked a lot since we met, and eventually started texting back and forth. I had a couple IRL girlfriends during the time we were texting, from around April-August. After I broke it off with the second girlfriend, I started to develop feelings for my S/O. Not because of her beauty, really, but because of the way she was there for me each time I stumbled and fell. She didn't just leave me on my own like she very well could have. She was, she is, a great friend.

Of course, what could I do? She had a boyfriend, was happy, and I was just some kid who lived a thousand miles away. I kept my feelings under wraps for the next few months, during which time we kept talking more and more. I started dating another girl IRL last November, and said girl broke up with me on New Years Eve. That night, with no plans and nowhere to go, I stayed up and texted my S/O into the night. She was stranded in Washington state with her father due to flight delays, so she knew my pain, somewhat. We talked about all kinds of stuff, our mistakes, our regrets, how we wish we could meet each other... everything. And I'll never forget it. That night was when I knew I had something truly special with her.

Fast forward to February, we'd been texting/Skyping as frequently as ever. One night we were texting, and, long story short, she confessed she was physically attracted to me, that she wanted to have sex with me. The way she put it, if I lived closer, we'd be 'friends with benefits.' This upset me, but I didn't let it show. I kept on keeping on. One night in March, I couldn't let my feelings stay dormant any longer. We were talking on the phone, and I told her that I was in love with her. She was somewhat shocked, and said she'd have to think about it. A few days later, we came to the conclusion that, though a relationship was out of the question now and that she doesn't feel the same right now due to her feelings for her  then-boyfriend, a future relationship could be possible were we closer. I held onto this hope, and was relieved that everything was out in the open.

Fast forward to May (this month), we'd still been talking and texting regularly. I had been dating an IRL girl from mid April up until the beginning of May. And in the second week of April, my S/O told me she was beginning to fall for me. I was shocked, and this set off a whirlwind of thoughts in my mind. Do I really love her? Why not just settle for your IRL girlfriend or find someone closer? All of these and more were going through my head.

I broke up with my IRL girlfriend, much to my S/O's relief (keep in mind she was still with her boyfriend, though she confessed things were not going well between them). Soon after, they broke up, and my S/O made plans to visit a local college in my area for theater/performing arts. And that leads us to today. I met my S/O for the first time today. We talked, had lunch at a local diner, and generally tried to get over the initial weirdness of seeing each other for the first time. We sort of did by the time we left, though it was still there. As were walking out, we had our arms around each others' waists, and right as we were about to get to my car, she stopped, and kissed me. I returned the favor for about ten seconds, until we realized people could see us, and then we proceeded to get into my car.

We drove to a more secluded place, where we kissed even more, and, most important of all, my S/O finally told me that she did, indeed, love me. I was overjoyed, and the next hour was among the best I'd ever had. We didn't even have sex like in those movies, we just kissed, embraced each other... yeah, I know it sounds weird, but it was awesome.

As great as today was, I have a few questions. First of all, my S/O has a summer internship in a small town in Virginia. She has three days of free time away from work. This town is about ten hours from where I live, so I was hoping I could find an excuse to see her without telling my parents about it. Or should I just tell my parents and hope for the best?

Second off, how can we keep this going until if/when she decides to attend the college in my area and we can be together? It'll be tough for both of us to resist the temptations of other women/men in real life. Also, should this be a full-fledged, committed relationship? Or should we wait until we're actually within reasonable distance of each other to make it 'official?' She told me that no other guy, in her eyes, can really match up to me, and I feel likewise about her. Nonetheless, the temptations are still there.

Again, sorry for the long post, hope somebody decided to read it and is willing to offer advice. Cheers!"

I'm 21, and I often go back and forth on whether or not it's worth it for me to transition. Specifically, I wonder if I can keep my career intact if I do decide to transition. I'm a Computer Science major and I'm more than halfway done the program. I desperately want to be female, but I've already done a lot of networking through internships and such, so I wonder if it's really possible for me to start over.

I was pretty close to going on hormones a few months ago, and the above is one of the things that really made me reconsider. Instead of trying to face this, I've been telling myself that all I really wanted from transitioning was attention.. but I don't think that was the case.

People who are supportive of homosexuality, especially in the northeast US where I live, are certainly in the majority nowadays. But there's still a stigma towards transgendered people. If I transition and DON'T pass, how likely is it that anyone will even want to hire me?

Thank you for your time."

I was told by my future boss that there is no dress code (wear whatever is comfortable), I can choose my own hours as long as I work 35 a week, and I will be sitting behind a computer all day. 

Nobody has even hinted at the possibility for a urine test, but I still haven't consumed as I am just trying to be safe. I am aware that each company has different policies, so I don't expect a perfect answer. But in your (probably) expert opinion, should I be in the clear?

uehxd,0,2012-05-31,"Adulthood, Love, and Transitions- help a fellow Redditor keep her ground when the world around her is changing.",[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/uehxd/adulthood_love_and_transitions_help_a_fellow/,"Dear Redditors,

How do you handle big life transitions, like graduating college or breaking up with your first love? What is the best way to handle a break up with someone you love who still loves you too? I can't even think about dating anyone else yet, and am worried about keeping myself sane while going through this transition from graduation to an internship to law school. Any ideas?

(preemptively, wanted to clarify why I did not post this to /relationships. this isn't about my relationship anymore; I am trying to take care of myself and my own happiness now.)


Story:

I have been dating the most incredible man for two years. We are enormously happy in our relationship, and are one another's best friend. He is my rock and my happiness, and has empowered me with so much confidence. He values my intelligence, accepts me at my worst, and can make me laugh when I am hysterically sobbing.

He is one in a million.

But, alas, we are freshly graduated from college after he earned a masters degree and I earned my bachelors. I am off to an internship on the East Coast followed by law school in the Mountain West, while he has a job 1000 miles away on the West Coast. We talked, and decided that it was best to put things on hold indefinitely. We have done long distance twice, for a 3 month stretch each, and it was tough-- really tough. He said he definitely wanted to revisit things in the future, but we need to take time to get ourselves together. I love him more than anything, but we are so young and not ready to think about marriage quite yet. While it's painful, it seems like the right thing to do, but I don't know how to handle this. 

We are staying together until the very moment I leave for my internship next week, but I am really struggling with my emotions. We are not breaking up because things are going wrong, but ending amicably, because we would never wish the other any harm or pain. It is not fair to either of us to expect to be able to have the same relationship we've had when things are changing so enormously. He's my best friend. I am so sad he's leaving, and am in so much pain. After being in a relationship for so long, I feel like I don't know how-- or really want-- to be single. I don't want anyone else; I want him. But I can't have him right now, I know that.


I have been a wreck since graduation because all of my closest friends, he being my very best friend, are moving away. I am nervous for my internship in a big city I have never been to, and terrified for what law school holds. I am really, really struggling, and have been suffering with the worst depression I've battled since high school. 


I would love to know if any Redditors have advice for me on how to handle this maelstrom of emotions. Furthermore, if anyone has advice on how to most appropriately interact before and post-move with my soon-to-be-ex SO, I would be very grateful.

Great grades through high school, landed the Honors Program in college, then things got tough.

My freshman year, the problem of not having taken Biology since freshman year of high school came back to bite me. Not really my fault, or anyone's- that's just how my HS worked. Those in the Honors track went Bio-Honors Chem-Honors Physics-AP Something. Biology was full, so I went AP Chem.

Got a C and a C- in Biology for my first year, ended up repeating Bio II over summer to get my GPA up. Ended up wiping the C- with an A.

I got to Junior year with a 3.4 on the rails, and started applying to med school. My advisor told me not to- she said my grades weren't good enough. I got an interview at my top choice, but got waitlisted and declined. Graduated with a 3.55, still somewhat lost as to what to do, but the dream of the long coat was still there.

Took 2 years of post-baccalaureate courses to beef up the resumé, pulled over the 90th percentile on the MCAT, and got into a 1-year Master's program that had at the end the promise of an interview to the attached med school.

Nothing lower than a B over the Master's, got into med school, and for 2 years, all was great. As, Bs and the occasional C, but no sweat.

Then came third year- clinical duties. I fell into a depression, and was diagnosed with anxiety/panic disorder. I started failing exams, just because my brain wasn't working right- I'd know it in practice with my advisor, then blow it on the exam.

After a year, and failing 2 of the 6 clerkships, I had to appear before the school's promotions committee- they decide for students in trouble if they are allowed to continue. I was recommended to take 6 months off. I later found out one of the clerkship directors recommended I drop out, and it was only my advisor arguing for a second chance that got me the sabbatical over dismissal.

That brings to last July. Two more required clerkships, Neurology and Surgery, remediating the two failed ones, Peds and OB, my acting internship and the big exam- Step 2CK.

I nailed Neuro on the second try, and decided to take Step 2CK early while I was on a roll. Busted my ass for a month, took it during OB, and nailed them both to the wall. Peds took two tries, but it fell as well.

Commence applying to residencies. Applied to 35, got 4 interviews.  9:1 is a fairly normal ratio, so I was feeling okay. Match Day, when we find out where we go for residency, fell during Surgery.

Next to go, Surgery. I hate Surgery. I hate the blood, the gore, the smells, the sounds, I just feel helpless. I gritted my teeth, met it with a snarl and took it to the ground. Panic attacks? None. Depression? Gone. I was on a mission. The exam? Passed, first stroke. The Match? Not my first-choice program, but a program. Better than a lot of folks do.

The last barrier? The acting internship. That's a month of meatgrinder, where a fourth-year student is treated like a full MD. Long hours, lots of responsibility, but once it's done, it's all over. Making it better, my AI was at the same hospital where I'm doing residency.

Got the score back: High Pass, a B.

It's over. 8 years since I graduated college, a Master's along the way, and tomorrow I do what they said couldn't be done. I get my MD.

Never believe them when they say it can't be done. It can be. You just need to want to fight hard enough.

I won't get into details but I get paid $16/hr and I am in college. It's great, but most of the time I sit here on the computer.

udykj,17,2012-05-31,"How to Beat the Slush Pile (or how to make first readers fall in love with you, and why submission guidelines are really, really damned important) [xpost from r/writing]",danceswithronin,shutupandwrite,https://www.reddit.com/r/shutupandwrite/comments/udykj/how_to_beat_the_slush_pile_or_how_to_make_first/,"Okay, here’s the deal. First readers are the people who will see the work you have submitted to a literary magazine before the editors ever will. These are the unpaid minions (usually interns) who go through the submissions before they are culled into a smaller pile for the editorial staff to pick and choose from. **They are the real gatekeepers you have to woo – not the editors.** For the most part, unless you catch the eye of a first reader, the editor will never know you exist. 

Depending on the size of the magazine, first readers (or slushies – *mush slushy, mush!)* will have to go through hundreds or even thousands of submissions a week. That is *millions of words.* Do you think that they actually go through and carefully read every one of those millions of words? Hell no. Because that is purgatorial and a waste of time. 

The truth is, a first reader can usually tell from two things whether a writer is serious about submitting or not:

* **The query letter.**

* **The first page of the submission.**

With that in mind, here are ten pieces of advice that will help make a first reader fall in love with you:

* **Proofread.** For the love of gods old and new, proofread. Competition is fierce. If there is a typo in your query letter or the first page of your submission, there is a 99.9% likelihood it is going in the trash.

* **Be humble.** You have not written the next *Grapes of Wrath.* Yours is only one of the dozens or hundreds of submissions a first reader will see in any given day. Saying anything to the effect of, “Oh man, you must publish my story, it is the best thing since *War and Peace* and together we will win a Pushcart with it and you would be a moron not to publish it” is going to get your query letter passed around the editorial office and laughed at. True story.

* **Revise.** Once you have finished a story, set it aside for a week or two and work on something else. Come back to it with fresh eyes. Rework it. Do an extremely thorough **self-edit** or proofread. Get someone to **beta read** it (preferably someone who is not your mother) for a subjective second opinion. **Revise it some more.** Cut the fat. Expand parts that are sparse, but keep in mind – especially if you are submitting a short story – that it is important to keep your work as tight as possible. There is only so much room in any given magazine and you are competing ferociously for it. If a first reader finds typos and grammatical errors in the first page of your story, you can be sure they will not read past the first page. 

* **Read the magazine you’re submitting to.** Get a subscription if you can. Most lit mag subscriptions are laughably cheap. Not only will you be helping to support and uphold the industry you are trying to get money and recognition out of, it will let you know the general tone and style of the stories the editors pick, so you will be more likely to get a positive response by sending a story along the same lines. 

* **Don’t try to be cute.** It’s okay to be charming and show a little wit in your query letter, but there is a fine line. Having a sense of humor is okay, coming across as a smart-aleck assclown will not endear you to your first reader. 

* **Don’t try to be edgy.** Same premise as the previous point, but the opposite. If your main character says “fuck” every other word and is generally a bad-tempered *Catcher in the Rye* knockoff, the first reader is probably going to roll their eyes and move on. 

* **Make the first page of your story the strongest in a narrative sense.** If there is anything boring in the first page of your story, it better not be there by the time you get ready to send it in for publication, because if there is, the first reader is going to assume the rest of the story is boring too, and move on to the next thing in the slush pile. 

* **Read the submission guidelines.** If the submission guidelines say that they want the manuscript in Arial, triple-spaced, every other word in bold, by-gods if you want to publish in that magazine you will do exactly what they say. Because here’s a secret: sometimes ridiculous submissions guidelines are a test. They are a test to see how well you pay attention, or whether you’re someone who thinks that the rules don’t apply to you (the latter is a group of people that editors hate to work with). They are a test to see how bad you want it and how professional you’re capable of being. Flaming hoops of formatting guidelines is part of that process. If you want to be published, you will follow every single instruction that is given to you. 

* **Impressions are important.** If you make a good impression or get published in a magazine, any further submissions may be flagged for a higher priority of consideration than others in the slush pile. This is a very good thing for you. If, on the other hand, you make an ass of yourself by not following any of the rules above, the first readers will remember you, and not in a loving way. Don’t let that happen to you.  

* **Don’t send simultaneous submissions.** Granted, *some magazines don’t mind this,* and will make a point to say so in their submission guidelines. If there is no mention of “simultaneous submissions allowed” in the guidelines, do not submit to multiple magazines at the same time. Simple as that. Wait for a rejection letter before sending your work out to someone else. Nothing makes an editor shake their fist at the heavens more than to go through the cut rounds, pick a story they really like, only to see that that story has already been accepted elsewhere. It’s bad form. Don’t do it.

* **Consider the person on the other side of your submission.** They are usually unpaid, tired, eyesore, hungry, thirsty, and in dire need of a stiff drink. They are in the literary business because they love good writing, the same as you do. They are not the blackhat gatekeepers who are sabotaging your efforts at traditional publication. They are just doing their jobs, which is to make sure that they get the very best stories for the publication they’re working at. They have pride in their work, and they want you to have pride in yours too. "
udyg4,117,2012-05-31,"Ten Ways to Beat the Slush Pile (or how to make a first reader fall in love with you, and why submission guidelines are really, really damned important)",danceswithronin,writing,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/udyg4/ten_ways_to_beat_the_slush_pile_or_how_to_make_a/,"Okay, here’s the deal. First readers are the people who will see the work you have submitted to a literary magazine before the editors ever will. These are the unpaid minions (usually interns) who go through the submissions before they are culled into a smaller pile for the editorial staff to pick and choose from. **They are the real gatekeepers you have to woo – not the editors.** For the most part, unless you catch the eye of a first reader, the editor will never know you exist. 

Depending on the size of the magazine, first readers (or slushies – *mush slushy, mush!)* will have to go through hundreds or even thousands of submissions a week. That is *millions of words.* Do you think that they actually go through and carefully read every one of those millions of words? Hell no. Because that is purgatorial and a waste of time. 

The truth is, a first reader can usually tell from two things whether a writer is serious about submitting or not:

* **The query letter.**

* **The first page of the submission.**

With that in mind, here are ten pieces of advice that will help make a first reader fall in love with you:

* **Proofread.** For the love of gods old and new, proofread. Competition is fierce. If there is a typo in your query letter or the first page of your submission, there is a 99.9% likelihood it is going in the trash.

* **Be humble.** You have not written the next *Grapes of Wrath.* Yours is only one of the dozens or hundreds of submissions a first reader will see in any given day. Saying anything to the effect of, “Oh man, you must publish my story, it is the best thing since *War and Peace* and together we will win a Pushcart with it and you would be a moron not to publish it” is going to get your query letter passed around the editorial office and laughed at. True story.

* **Revise.** Once you have finished a story, set it aside for a week or two and work on something else. Come back to it with fresh eyes. Rework it. Do an extremely thorough **self-edit** or proofread. Get someone to **beta read** it (preferably someone who is not your mother) for a subjective second opinion. **Revise it some more.** Cut the fat. Expand parts that are sparse, but keep in mind – especially if you are submitting a short story – that it is important to keep your work as tight as possible. There is only so much room in any given magazine and you are competing ferociously for it. If a first reader finds typos and grammatical errors in the first page of your story, you can be sure they will not read past the first page. 

* **Read the magazine you’re submitting to.** Get a subscription if you can. Most lit mag subscriptions are laughably cheap. Not only will you be helping to support and uphold the industry you are trying to get money and recognition out of, it will let you know the general tone and style of the stories the editors pick, so you will be more likely to get a positive response by sending a story along the same lines. 

* **Don’t try to be cute.** It’s okay to be charming and show a little wit in your query letter, but there is a fine line. Having a sense of humor is okay, coming across as a smart-aleck assclown will not endear you to your first reader. 

* **Don’t try to be edgy.** Same premise as the previous point, but the opposite. If your main character says “fuck” every other word and is generally a bad-tempered *Catcher in the Rye* knockoff, the first reader is probably going to roll their eyes and move on. 

* **Make the first page of your story the strongest in a narrative sense.** If there is anything boring in the first page of your story, it better not be there by the time you get ready to send it in for publication, because if there is, the first reader is going to assume the rest of the story is boring too, and move on to the next thing in the slush pile. 

* **Read the submission guidelines.** If the submission guidelines say that they want the manuscript in Arial, triple-spaced, every other word in bold, by-gods if you want to publish in that magazine you will do exactly what they say. Because here’s a secret: sometimes ridiculous submissions guidelines are a test. They are a test to see how well you pay attention, or whether you’re someone who thinks that the rules don’t apply to you (the latter is a group of people that editors hate to work with). They are a test to see how bad you want it and how professional you’re capable of being. Flaming hoops of formatting guidelines is part of that process. If you want to be published, you will follow every single instruction that is given to you.

Don’t let that happen to you.

Apparently the company is extremely busy and this has been passed all the way down to a lowly intern. Getting help from others has been impossible so I come to you guys.

PC Specs

* Windows Server 2008 x64
* OS installed as Complete Standard Installation
* VMWare vSphere Client
* VMWare vServer Center 5
* Windows is not updated at all
* No additional roles installed

Me

* First year intern
* Computer Skills: Competent
* Networking Skills: Minimal a.k.a I know enough that I might accidentally blow something up

Problem: The OS, VMWare center and client we installed by someone else. I attempted to get to the website via http://&lt;server&gt;:8282 but I it doesn't find me the host. I tried entering the default passwords (root, administrator, vmware) into orchestrator and client, but to no avail. The person who set it up mentioned ignoring Fully Domain something or the other (he doesn't remember) error while installing vCenter. I looked it up and think its Fully Qualified Domain Name, to which the solution seemed like fiddling with the DNS reverse lookup. So I installed DNS server role and followed some guides but no luck. I have uninstalled DNS server role to make sure I don't break something accidentally and now stumped.

The reason I haven't updated Windows is because I have heard there are problems with that.

What should I do?"

I also did an internship with Audio Sports Online covering 5A high school football in Indianapolis, but had no idea how to implement that.

Retail pays little to nothing and the hours are horrible. I feel like I'm more than capable of handling the jobs I'm looking for. Things like faxing, filing, phones and all that jazz seem easy enough.

*  Sign up for 2 more summer classes (First class chosen waiting for response from university before second)


* Schedule CLEP exams


* Prepare resume (started Thursday may 31st. Not enough time to complete in one day.)


* Email contacts about PCR internship and security/IT position


* Email Reccomended contact about Neural engineering project.


* Prepare and start some form of exercise Routine


* Clean Room


* Contact university about Academic Status (Sent message, awaiting response)


* Reset Sleep Schedule (successful)


* Complete all classwork and homework. (done for thursday)


* Plan one fun thing with girlfriend/friends as a reward.

I'm a complete newbie when it comes to Machine Learning (and CS in general, I've only had 2 semesters worth of courses).  I'm trying to write an algorithm for document classification for an internship and I'm feeling out of my league.  

Right now I've got approximately 2000 documents I need to classify and that number is expected to grow over time.  I've got tfidf weightings for each documents, so right now I'm trying to write a Mixture of Gaussians mixture model using the sparse vectors of each documents tfidf weighting (right now there are about 44000 unique words after normalization, so that's how many dimensions I've got).

Things seem to be blowing up, though--I can't reasonably computer a 44000*44000 covariance matrix for each gaussian per iteration, so I'm just doing diagonal matrices (the variance of each term).  But then the variance turns out to be so small that when its time for doing the exp() part of this function: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_normal_distribution#Non-degenerate_case,
 multiplying by the inverse eventually makes the resulting scalar too huge to compute.  Right now I'm trying to standardize my ifidf scores by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation, but that hasn't seemed to help with the resulting scalar size. 

I really don't know what I'm doing.  Is MoG the wrong approach to this?  Apparently LDA is the best thing for this sort of thing, but from what I understand that would definitely be out of my league.

I guess don't know what I'm asking, exactly, but if anyone could provide some insight as how I'm approaching this incorrectly or what might be a better strategy, I would really appreciate it."

I just moved to Williamsburg, VA for an internship with Jamestown/Yorktown. I am currently looking for a job while interning. I already looked into the heavy hitters in town (Busch Gardens, fast-food joints, Regal theater, Cracker Barrel, etc). My question: can anyone suggest any local establishments that may have job openings or basic places to look for a job? (I am looking for summer/short term jobs)

Many thanks in advance and I hope I posted in the right subreddit.    "
