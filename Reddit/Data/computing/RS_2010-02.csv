They want to have advanced features on top of Linux's iptables. My job consists of implementing these features on top of existing software, some iptables modules inside the kernel, specifically.

My boss ignored the licensing issues due to the GPL, and is reluctant to make the code open-source, thus making his innovation available to competitors. I told him about *BSD and explained him about the more permissive license, he was interested but not willing to switch, because some of his software was already based on Linux/iptables.

He has suggested to release the code as GPL to comply with the license, but in an obfuscated form. I don't really approve this, it just doesn't seem right (provided it's even legal in the first place, I'm not sure).

Currently paying for an apartment I haven’t lived in for two months.",bentaboutrent,needadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/aywyf/advice_please_reddit_currently_paying_for_an/,"Anyone here had to leave an apartment before the lease was up? Did the landlord have an agent who did a questionable job of re-renting the place?

Backstory: Your average roommate horror story, I ‘spose. We had worked together during an internship in San Francisco and then decided to get a place together once the internship was up. We find a place with a great view ... but once we move in, we start noticing all the crap that’s wrong with the place: elevator doesn’t work, fridge leaks constantly (spoiling our food), no fire alarms, icky mold, screen door that’s fallen off because it’s so corroded (landlord said she would replace before we moved in), etc. Only after constant complaining does the landlord do a halfass job fixing anything--after two months the fridge was never fixed or replaced because she wanted to see the fridge leaking herself. Well, it would leak sporadically and we even showed her our soggy food and food with a layer of ice on it.

Soooo ... shortly after we move in, roommate gets a boyfriend and she does a complete 180. The world stops for this guy, she starts acting different, and I soon get it out of her that he’s a drug dealer. I’m a pretty quiet person who keeps to herself, and these two are up all night talking, playing music, and laughing (sweet jesus, did they have loud, annoying laughs). She gets no sleep, starts acting increasingly erratic, and I can hear her at all hours of the night blowing her nose. Oh, and the guy has basically moved in at this point.

After several confrontations, weeks of her drug dealing boyfriend living in the place, me not feeling safe in my own home, and her refusal to compromise at all (I didn’t trust that she was in a sound state of mind during all this, I knew this when I talked to her, but didn’t know what else I could do). We have the traditional falling out. And landlord could care less about the situation, as expected.

The landlord said before that we could give a 30-days notice and leave--this was after our calling about several things wrong with our apartment. She just never wanted to deal with it. Don’t have it in writing, though. We both move out, and I drop the keys off with the landlord’s agent about two months ago. I now live about six hours away. The place still hasn’t been rented, according to the agent, and our deposit is almost up (in another week).

Any advice, Reddit? Should I start pestering the heck out of the agent? Or just accept that I’ll probably end up in small claims court for additional rent?

Or do you have any similar stories? Or any words to put this whole thing into perspective?

I'm a casual user of the site and have been for several years, but because this issue is sensitive to me, I've decided to post this with an anonymous account.

For some background, I was a skinny kid until midway through grade school when I had a bout of clinical depression and weekly hospital visits during which I put on a ton of weight rapidly, taking me from the average flat-stomached eight year old to categorically obese in a few months. After about six years, early in high school, I lost 50 pounds straight without any exercise which left me with an unalterable amount of excess skin. (And hey, if I'd known that I'd end up with this problem, I would have lost it steadily the right way.)

Now, I'm in my early twenties, and I've been eating healthily for several years, my weight remains stable, and I've lifted weights from three to five days a week for over a year. It's my lifestyle. Despite the strength gains, excellent health, and increased tone, I still suffer from visible, albeit somewhat mild, [gynecomastia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gynecomastia), love handles and pouch. This sort of excess skin is visible through any cloth, so I am way too self-conscious to even wear t-shirts that would otherwise look great on me. Lastly, it deals a direct toll on my confidence, and I stray away from prolonged social contact with persons I'm sexually or romantically interested in because of my fear of my body. I've lived this way for all of high school and now most of college. I'm a bit fed up of feeling left out of life.

Foremost, I'd like to know what entails surgery for excess skin removal or liposuction. I'm also looking for any advice regarding the potential for surgery, or anything you feel that should be said. From people who have had surgery for excess skin or similar problems, doctors, health enthusiasts... even people suffering from the same problem now. Any advice helps.

Lastly, regarding finances, I'm an American, and I do not expect my health insurance to cover this or to help me. I'm paying for this with all the money I am saving from work and internships.

My sincere thanks to all of you in advance."

I had a few thoughts on what this club might entail. First, I think it would be great to have a forum for women in male-dominated fields to be able to discuss openly about the pressures they face in being women and in these fields. Second, I think it would be a great academic resource. My sorority has a list of majors/minors in the house, in hopes, that if you are having trouble in the class, you can seek help from someone who has already taken it. This is great, but there are no other physics majors in the house, so the resource has been useless to me. Also, I find it easier to ask for help from fellow women because of some issues I have had with asking for help from misogynist professors. Third, I would like to inform the members of opportunities. There are many organizations that are working hard to increase the female numbers in their offices (for jobs and internships) but it is hard to find this information. So, those are my ideas. I was wondering if you had any others? What are your thoughts? "

b1j27,5,2010-02-12,IAmA recovering Compulsive Gambler who has been clean for over a year and a half. AMA,NoMoreBets,IAmA,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/b1j27/iama_recovering_compulsive_gambler_who_has_been/,"I don't want to give my exact clean date because I would like to keep my anonymity as I have not shared most aspects of this story even with my closest friends. Yes this is a throw-away account. 

I will start my story at the beginning of my collegiate career. Directly out of a very good high school i attended a very well regarded college where I studied a form of computer science. For the first 2 years of my college career I was extremely involved around campus. I was a member of many many clubs and organizations and active in greek life. I was very happy with my life and had an extremely bright future ahead of me. 

During this period of time I would gamble a little bit every now and then, maybe once a semester. During the summer after my sophomore year the trouble began when I started visiting the casino's more and more often with my friends. I was also winning. A lot. I played poker exclusively as I didn't want to play a game that I didn't ""have an edge at"" but that summer I could do no wrong. I basically played ""professionally"" as in I didn't have a job other then playing cards and living at the casino. It was a dream come true. So I thought. 

The next semester in school I started doing extremely poorly gradewise, and I started to lose interest in doing the activities I had previously enjoyed. I was going to the casino at least once a month if not more. Looking back on it now I see this was the beginning of the end for me. It was during this period that I also started playing craps and blackjack. I basically new the moment I first rolled the dice that I was a compulsive gambler, unfortunately it would take a lot more of my money and misery before I was willing to admit it. You see, I had always looked down on anyone in the casino who was ""playing against the odds."" 

This continued for another year where I was mostly just scraping by in class by doing the bare minimum and I had almost completely dropped out of my social activities. When I wasn't gambling I was also playing quite a bit of WOW which didn't help (and for a long time I thought was my primary problem but now I realize it was only a placeholder from the gambling when I couldn't get to the casino. I have subsequently tried to get back into other mmo's and find I don't enjoy them at alll... ) 

The summer after my junior year of college I had a fabulous internship offered to me which I took. It was a dream job in more ways then one (so I thought) because it also put me within a 15 minute drive to the casino. I started going daily and in a very very short time it began to affect my performance at work. 6 weeks into my 11 week internship I was fired. This was the beginning of the end. 

I was now a total recluse except for a few of my closest friends. I failed out of school this semester while continuinig to go to the casino as often as possible. I wasn't working but still had access to large amounts of money due to being born lucky. I was losing around 10 grand a month. It was sick, but I couldn't stop and I didn't know where to go for help. I had never heard of Gambler's Anonymous at this time. 

I kept up this charade for another 15 months or so, living off of my folks money and contemplating suicide on a regular basis because I could not control my gambling. 

Finally I had snapped, I went on a week long spree to foxwoods where I lost enough money for a small house. This sum I could not explain away and I finally decided to end my own life as I felt there was no way out from the situation I was in. 

I felt horribly alone and I was fed up with my inability to control my compulsion, I literally felt like the only way to free myself and my family of my sins was to end my life. I won't go into the attempt, as if I did it would break my anonymity to anyone I know IRL who would read this. I will say however it was a very serious attempt that left me with a broken back and in the hospital for several weeks. 

Fortunately my parents understood that my gambling was an illness (I'm still not sure I believe this but it is useful in helping me recover so I go along with it) and with the proper treatment it could be arrested. They sent me to a gambling rehab for 45 days. 

The rehab was an amazing experience but most who read this will not be so lucky so i'm not going to dwell on it. If you have questions ask. 

When I got out of rehab I went to live with my folks and started to attend GA meetings several times a week. I got a sponsor and started to figure out how to get my life back on track. 

The first thing about Gambler's Anonymous (referred to as GA from here on out) is first and foremost stopping gambling. Let me tell you it is not easy. It is the hardest thing I have ever done in my life, and what's worse is that it is a constant, never ending struggle. My first several months home I went to 3-4 meetings a week and the urge to gamble hardly ever left me. This is what brought me around to calling it a disease. 

I can look at it objectively, as I am not a stupid person and I can say ""here is what gambling did to me, it made me want to end my own life"" and yet I still WANT to do it. I still feel compelled to do it. It's insane, it has to be a disease of some sort (again I don't buy into this 100% but it helps me in my recovery so I'm not going to argue over semantics) 

I got a job and started to get my life back on track. I again started beocming involved in organizations around me who did things that I loved to do (I won't say which again for anonymity reasons) 

I also got a sponsor and started working the twelve steps. The twelve steps are an amazing process that I think everyone should go through even if they are not an addict. If you actually read the twelve steps you will note that only 1 of them (the first) even mentions your addictions (gambling, drugs, sex .. whatever.) The other 11 are simply about character change. 

I will only make this a little longer by getting into my journey of step 1-3 and 8-9. 

Step 1 is admitting your powerless over gambling and that your life is unmanageable. This may seem like a trivial step but when your in the position of an addict it is extremely hard to admit that you are powerless. You think to yourself, if I am powerless then how can I hope to arrest this disease? Also most addicts are very intellectual and narcissistic and do not want to admit defeat in general and certainly not over their addiction. However once you embrace this step you move on to steps 2 and 3 (which I will cover together) which shows one how they can recover once they admit they are powerless. 

Step 2 and 3 are as follows: 
2 Came to believe that a Power greater than ourselves could restore us to a normal way of thinking and living.
3 Made a decision to turn our will and our lives over to the care of this power of our own understanding.

You'll see that 2 follows from 1 naturally. If nearly everyone in the GA program has admitted to being powerless over gambling, but yet still somehow manages to refrain, then there must be a higher power helping them. 

Step 3 follows from there. We, as addicts must turn our will and our lives over to our higher power. This is very unnatural even for most religious and spiritual people. Most people, when they pray to G-d (or any higher power) will pray FOR something, they will say ""G-d please let me get a good grade and I won't try to touch shirley under her dress anymore"" or ""please G-d let the colts win the superbowl so I can make one more score."" 

Instead the recovering addicts prays only for knowledge of G-d's will and the power to carry it out. When I pray each day I thank G-d for giving me another day to live, another day to be better and make up for my past wrongs. I pray that today is my day to help another person who is suffering, to put my in a situation where my knowledge can help others. When I do get an urge to gamble I simply step back and say ""G-d help me"" and it helps quite a bit. 

One trigger for my gambling is stress and espcially relationships. I have never been very suave with the ladies and these situations can easily send up triggers, however I have learned to embrace the serentity prayer in all aspects of my life. 

G-d, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change. 
Courage to change the things I can, and the 
Wisdom to know the difference. 

When I come across a tough situation I ask myself ""can i change"" if so I try to do it. If not I pray for serenity to accept that I have to live with whatever is occurring and to not let it affect my recover. 

In closing I want to say that one thing that has helped me the most is remember the phrase 1 day at a time. As a human I can, with G-d's help, endure ANYTHING for 1 24 hour period of time. However earlier in the program it would be even 1 hour at a time. I would say, I won't gamble now but I'll go in an hour, and then do the same thing next hour. The time passed, slowly but surely and by the grace of G-d and Gambler's Anonymous I now have over a year and a half of clean time. 

I am recovering as well in other aspects of my life. I  am now working full time (at a different better job then when I started my recovery) while attending school full time to finish my B.S..  I am more involved in the lives of most of friends then when I lived next to them (as opposed to several hundred miles away) and I love my life. I am also beginning to take care of my body (which I had neglected both while gambling and in recovery) and it feels good. 

One last thing I will leave you with that gives me chills. The first day I wen into rehab I was given the Gambler's Anonymous ""One day at a time"" book, which has saying in it for each day and a small prayer. On that day the prayer was: ""G-d preserved me to help carry out his purpose"" 

Yours in recover,

She's currently unemployed and living with my mom and has completely lost motivation to try and help herself. She is almost 22 and has never held a job longer than a couple month long internship as a pharamcy technician assistant. She has some college education but dropped out and got her pharmacy technician certification. The month she obtained her certification all the employers started their hiring freezes. She has been unemployed for a little over a year and has stopped trying to do anything to help herself. 

Problem is, my mom is financially underwater and she is going to have to sell her house because she can't afford to pay all the increased taxes, bills and maxed out credit cards. My mom and my sister do not get along and they always fight over stupid things. My sister has a habit of getting defensive and shutting out people, so anything you say to her that doesn't jive with her perconceived notions of the world she reacts negatively to. This includes well intentioned advice. My mom is a whole different can of worms that I don't want to get into, but let's say she's a very dysfunctional and negative person.

It's hard enough to get a job with experience and qualifications, but not caring about your outward appearance and how you interact with people will almost certaintly doom any job interview. She is simply really naive to a shocking degree. Almost as if she's missing fundimental life skills to cope with the real world. I told her it might be a good idea to see a psychologist to help with her feelings of depression but she doesn't want to do that. Her health insurance is running out next month due to her not being in school anymore, so it will be harder for her to get help after that.

As a person sitting on the side lines watching all of this unfold, it is really disturbing. Granted she has a little less than $20,000 from my dad's life insurance policy left, I really don't feel confident she understands the urgency of needing to try to help herself. She'll probably sit around feeling sorry for herself and messing around on her computer until she is broke and then be in even worse shape. Neither myself or my mom can pick up the slack for her once she goes broke.

Does anyone else have experience with situations similar to mine? 

In the past, I've tried suggesting that she take her volunteering role at the animal shelter and try to make it into a good work experience bullet point on her resume. But she decided she wanted to quit after 2 weeks once the shelter operators had her start working with the dogs (she likes cats). I've been stressig that showing dedication and a work ethic, whether you're employed or not will look good on a resume devoid of substantive work experience. Taking on responsibility and learning something as simple as how to do clerical work and run an office. She doesn't seem to make the connection. As a last ditch effort to get her out of the house and talk to people I told her it might be a good idea to take a fun class at the local junior college. She decided to take an art class, but now it's looking like she may not stick with that either.

I know there isn't a whole lot I can do to influence her, since she's her own individual and the decisions are ultimately hers. I just hate seeing someone completely collapse in front of my eyes like this. If she's waiting for another economic boom to hand her a job, she'll be waiting a LOOONG time.

EDIT: I don't live with my mom. I left the house when I was 18 for college and have been on my own for the past 7 years. If my mom sells the house I anticipate her being able to make a profit because she and my father (deceased) bought their home back in 1994 before property values got insane. Still selling a house in this economy could take over  a year... mom waited until she got into a pretty deep hole before she even wanted to admit to herself that she may need to retool her lifestyle.

Seeing the successful coming out stories has me thinking of making one of my own, but here’s some background info first. 

I’m a second year college student studying biology. I really like it, especially evolutionary biology. I would love to make it into a career. I have a good shot this summer of getting an internship at a museum, studying paleobiology.  One problem, my dad is a conservative Christian, and I mean very conservative. He hates Obama with a passion, thinks homosexuality is evil, believes the world was created 6,000 years ago, and thinks evolution is a big lie. I slowly became atheist throughout high school but kept up the pretense for my dad, who seemed to become more conservative as I grew less. Now I pretty much silently disagree with him on everything he believes. And he loves to talk about conservatism too! It seemed like every day he had to bring up how Obama is corrupting America, how gays are evil, or some “fact” he found whish disproves evolution. That’s one major reason I chose the college I go to now, it’s over 10 hours away and in another state, that way I only have to hear about it when I’m home for breaks, or on weekends when I call home, or in the random emails he sends me….

Anyway, I’m sick of lying and pretending to be someone I’m not. I’d really like to go on this internship, but there’s no way my dad will let me if he knows what it’s about. But at the same time, I’m afraid my dad will overreact, either kicking me out of the house permanently and disowning me or forcing me to drop out of college and come home to preach to me day and night. I’m still financially dependent on them as they help pay for some of my college expenses and I still live at home during the summer.  I only have a few years before I probably move out permanently but I can tell these last few years a gonna be a pain.

So now I have a question for all of you, do I risk coming out atheist or suck it up for a few more years? If I do come out, how do I go about doing it?

Somehow I managed to land two different 16 month internships at IBM which I'm absolutely ecstatic about.  

Job 1: Information Developer (Technical Writing).  Actually there's not much 'technical writing' per-se, only around 10% of my time I'll be doing writing.  Most of it is a more systems analyst type role where I'm the middle-man between clients and developers.  A bit of Q/A thrown in there too.

Job 2: Software Developer.  Mostly working with various CMS.  HTML, CSS, PHP, PERL, RDMS, Java.  Truth is I'm not really that great of a programmer (like I said, i'm a finance major), so I'm kinda intimidated by this job.  I am able to pick up technology pretty fast but almost all my co-workers will be engineers and CS grads so when they start talking data structures or whatever I'll be lost.  I haven't touched Java in two years and I know a BIT about Javascript.  I wouldn't really say I have a passion for programming too.. and I know to really excel as a developer you gotta love what you do.  I'm not sure I have that passion.

Looking for some advice from some of you experienced IT professionals about what job has better future prospects / better looking on resume.  If it helps, my career goals are kinda mixed... I'm still fairly young so I'm not sure what I want to do but I love technology and the capital markets.

All advice appreciate, thanks!"

For a lot of that time I was more concerned with keeping things running with what I could and not much beyond that but within the past year I've been wanting to do more and especially now with graduation being so close. 

  One of the big things that I want to work on is getting a handle on the physical portion of the network. I've been here almost two years and I don't have a clear picture of how things are wired up here.  When people move offices etc the basically have unplugged the computer from their old office and plopped it in the new one along with the phones so there are a lot of exposed ports laying around the business.  

I'm looking for insight as to how people manage their networks related to the physical portion.  Do you have a wire map showing where everything goes, dedicated software to keep track of things etc.

* What is a typical curriculum for an SE program?
* What knowledge/experience is expected of SE graduates?
* What can I do to improve my confidence in the field?
* What are the typical job functions of a software engineer?
* What should I absolutely know before graduation?
* How important is development (coding) experience versus synthesis/analysis (planning) knowledge? It seems that the courses focus more on the theory than the application. Is that typical?

**On a related note...**

* I've been looking for *any* type of internship relating to computers for about three years, and everything I've found falls through. I live in Ohio, go to school in Indiana. Any advice?
* I'd really like to learn Unix/Linux administration. Where is a good starting point?

I started with HTML/CSS in high school and shortly after picked up PHP, then Javascript (backwards, I know). My freshman year I learned C++ and Ada, both using basic OOP but only doing small-scale programs. Sophomore year covered Java and more OOP, though neither in depth. A project allowed us to make a choice of two languages, so I have also used Prolog and Scheme, *briefly*. This is my Junior year, and we had a larger (group) project assigned. I was responsible for the database backend and interface, which I implemented using Java and [an h2 database](http://www.h2database.com/html/main.html). The member of my group responsible for the GUI basically didn't do it though, so the project didn't end so well. Next year will be my Senior year, and I'll have courses focused more on testing than development, and the final course is a Senior project and 30-minute presentation/seminar.


Most courses have repeated the same concepts of the ""Software Design Model,"" including specification, requirements analysis, coding, testing, maintaining. We've also talked about other methods like agile programming, extreme programming, and pair programming.


My chief complaints are that the professors in the department aren't convincingly knowledgeable/experienced, and that the courses don't require enough work to be comfortable in the languages.

I work for the school's web team, but that only consists of HTML/CSS/Javascript work with the occasional C# form. I'm beginning to worry that when I graduate, I'll be completely unprepared for what's expected of me when/if I get a job.


Any advice?

b4dqs,1,2010-02-20,How much vitamin D3 should I take?,[deleted],AlternativeHealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/AlternativeHealth/comments/b4dqs/how_much_vitamin_d3_should_i_take/,"Official Recommended Intake for Vitamin D is Too Low
2,000 IU/Day or More Needed for Optimal Health

by William B. Grant, Ph.D.

(OMNS, Feb 19, 2010) Vitamin D has been a natural part of man's experience forever, and 90% of vitamin D is derived from solar ultraviolet-B (UVB) irradiance. The health effects of vitamin D can be and have been determined from a variety of studies including ecological, observational (case-control and cohort), and cross-sectional studies.

Vitamin D helps both to prevent and to treat chronic diseases including many types of cancer, cardiovascular disease (coronary heart disease, stroke, etc.), congestive heart failure, diabetes mellitus (types 1 and 2), osteoporosis, falls, and fractures. It is also effective against infectious diseases including both bacteria and viral infections: bacterial vaginosis, pneumonia, dental caries, periodontal disease, tuberculosis, sepsis/septicemia, Epstein-Barr virus, and influenza type A such as A/H1N1 influenza. The autoimmune diseases include asthma, type 1 diabetes mellitus, multiple sclerosis, and perhaps rheumatoid arthritis.

Pregnancy outcomes are also adversely affected by low serum D levels. 40% of primary Cesarean-section deliveries in the United States are linked to low D levels (9% of births in the United States involve primary C-section), and preeclampsia is also linked to low serum levels of D. In regards to cancer, vitamin D helps cells fit into the organs properly or commit suicide (apoptosis), and also reduces angiogenesis (new blood vessel growth) around tumors and reduces metastasis. For metabolic diseases, the mechanisms include increased insulin sensitivity and insulin production. For infectious diseases, vitamin D induces production of cathelicidin and defensins, which have antimicrobial and antiendotoxin activities.

Due to current lifestyles in the United States, most people do not spend sufficient time in the sun to produce the higher serum D levels associated with optimal health. Black-Americans are particularly vulnerable to low levels due to their darker skin, which reduces the amount of UVB that reaches the 7-dehydrocholesterol in the lower epidermis to produce previtamin D. Black-Americans have a 25% higher mortality rate than White-Americans, and this difference may be explained in terms of lower serum 25(OH)D levels. Solar UVB is an excellent source of vitamin D during about half of the year. The way to take advantage of the sun as a source of vitamin D is to expose as much of the body as possible without sunscreen near solar noon, the time when one's shadow is shorter than one's height, for 10-30 minutes depending on skin pigmentation, being careful not to turn pink or red or burn. ( http://www.doctoryourself.com/holick.html )

Supplements represent an efficient way to obtain sufficient vitamin D. African-Americans should consider taking 3000 International Units (IU) per day while White-Americans should consider taking 2000 IU/day. The current dietary guideline, approximately 400 IU/day, was based on the amount of vitamin D in a spoonful of cod liver oil, which prevented rickets.

There are few adverse effects of vitamin D. With whole-body exposure to the sun, one can make at least 10,000 IU/day in a short time. Adverse effects such as hypercalcemia have been found in general only for 20,000-40,000 IU/day for very long periods. However, those with certain diseases such as adenoma of the parathyroid gland, granulomatous diseases, lymphoma, sarcoidosis, and tuberculosis, should limit their vitamin D intake or production due to the fact that the body's innate immune system produces too much 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D in the serum, which can raise serum calcium levels too high.

Several studies have examined how much mortality rates and economic burdens of disease could be lowered if the population had more vitamin D. These studies were for Western Europe, Canada, the Netherlands, and the United States. They generally found that mortality rates could be reduced by about 15%.

During pregnancy and lactation, women should be taking about 6000 IU/day. The current US ""Adequate Intake"" recommendation is a mere 200 IU/day. Bruce W. Hollis and Carol L. Wagner, Medical University of South Carolina, recently completed a randomized controlled trial vitamin D supplementation for pregnant and nursing women and found that even 2000 IU/day was inadequate, and that there were no adverse effects with 6000 IU/day.

Not because of my skills (which have been commended by my bosses on many occasions), but due to the studio being a fairly small operation, and if they don't create a job for me, I don't have one. 

I've already made a niche for myself at the studio, and they will miss me dearly if/when I leave, so creating my own job has already been done, its just a matter of funds to hire me.

I need advice on where to go from the end of my 1 year internship. I've already sunken into debt, and looks like I'm going to keep going further. 

All job prospects look to be more unpaid internships, to prove myself to another studio, before they hire me on, and it seems like this will just be a waste of all the time and effort I've put into this studio so far. (Not to mention that I'm going to run out of money eventually.)

So, I'm at an impasse. And I'm just asking if there are any professionals out there that could sit down and talk to me, and offer me advice on what my next best possible step could be.

Leave a post here, send me a PM, any way works.

I'm nearing the end of my first degree program – a technical degree (Associate of Science) in network engineering – at a community college. This quarter I'm interning for the IT department at the college I attend. I have two more classes and then get the degree this coming June.

But now I'm stuck. I have no idea what I should do after that. I have a lot of options: going to a university to get a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (or something similar), trying to find a job working as a help desk tech and start to work my way up, taking certification exams... I just don't know which route to take.

The university option means four more years of school (since the degree I get in June will have been a technical/accelerated degree).

I don't know if I can get a job with the two-year degree I'll be getting. From what I've heard from many of my IT colleagues and friends, the degree, and even the certifications, don't mean anything. I've been told that the actual experience is what lands you the ideal job and enables you to advance.

On the other hand, I still hear that the two-year degree is almost equivalent to a high school diploma nowadays, and that I need to get the Bachelor Degree.

I don't have any certifications currently. From what I've experienced, the courses that prepare people for the exams, and even the exams themselves, is all bookwork and memorization. I don't learn much from reading a bunch of text and better absorb the information by applying it in some kind of scenario or simulation. Furthermore, I don't have the money to spend on the exams (that keep getting updating anyway).

Something else I've noticed is that being female seems to be to my disadvantage; I'm not taken as seriously as the men doing the same kind of work. Even for my internship, all my supervisors are male, and I know only one other female on the campus who works in IT – I thought the male-to-female ratio was decreasing?

Anyway, I just need some insight on what I should be doing next, because I feel stuck, and I don't want to waste time on school if it would be more to my benefit to find work, or vice-versa. Any advice?"

I've had counseling on the matter, but I guess not enough, because I continue to fret and panic and worry about things that will barely affect my future. 

I say this is regulated to school because AFAIK I didn't feel this way concerning an internship I had at a software development company last summer. I felt stressed (a now noticeably different emotion than anxiety), but I didn't worry about my work. 

If anyone else has encountered this, please let me know I'm not alone. And if anyone has recovered from something like this, I would very much like to know how it happened and how you recovered.

b7cpz,1,2010-02-27,"Reddit, I need job advice",jobadvice,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/b7cpz/reddit_i_need_job_advice/,"I'm in my last year at an average Canadian school doing a **Finance** degree (emphasized for a reason you will soon see) .  I've been working for the federal government part-time for a few years and was recently offered a full-time job doing clerical stuff.  The pay is pretty good (42k) with amazing benefits... excellent work/life balance and a steady employment and golden pension with basically no risk of getting fired.  The thing about working for the government is everything is inefficient--it takes one year to hire someone externally and there's so much beurocratic bullshit nothing gets done and everyone slacks off because they know they can't get fired.  Not to mention for EVERY SINGLE JOB there's literally thousands of people applying (an EA job for my manager was open for 48 hours and had over 4,500 applications).  The only reason I got the full-time job is because there's a big 'once you're in, you're in' mentality.  It's extremely hard to get a job but once you're inside you're allowed to apply for jobs internally which is much much easier then externally.  If I didn't take this job, I don't think I could get back in and I do think there's a lot of potential for advancement.. but no chance I could 'make it big'.

I was also also just offered an internship doing software development for a very big IT company.  Not google or MS, but if you started to name global IT companies you would say this one early.  The pay is good for an internship.. more then the gov't job but without benefits... and it's only for 16 months.    The thing is, as I said... I'm a FINANCE major.  I've done some freelance web development, tech support, taken some CS classes (my minor), and done some Database work for a relative who has a Financial Services company but I don't think I'm even at an intermediate level of any programming language.  It doesn't help that I'd be working with Java which I've never even touched before.  I'm not going to say I lied to get this job because there was a very thorough interview process but I did exaggerate a thing or two.  if I did take the internship, I'm scared to death that I'd be completely lost.  I have friends in SE/CS and they almost beat me when I told them I landed this job... I don't even think you could compare my technical knowledge-base with theirs... and those are the type of people I'd be working with.   On the other hand, it'd be an amazing opportunity to learn a lot and I'd have something solid to put on my resume.

Am I out of my mind for even considering taking the internship?  I'm a pretty ambitious and I know I'd be bored to death at the government job... even if I did end up getting transferred to a job in IT or Finance (still not sure where I want to work).   I'm young and I have absolutely no idea what I want.. which is why I'm asking for advice.  Sometimes I think I want to do a masters in finance or MBA and see if I could break into equity research or trading (which has always been a dream).  Other times I think about just having a relaxing and fairly stress-free and stable life.  Once you're in the government, your resume is radioactive in IT/Banking because they think the public sector is a joke... I'd most likely be in the public sector my entire life.

Thoughts?  Experiences?

tldr: i'm a young finance major who got offered two jobs, one full-time clerical job (with a lot of upward potential) with the govt that would provide a golden pension and stability my entire life.  The other an internship (16/mo) for a very well known IT company doing software development which is something I don't have much experience in."
