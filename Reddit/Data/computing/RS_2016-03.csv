48det7,3,2016-02-29,Huge rambling rant on recurring depressive symptoms,AllegedAlec,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/48det7/huge_rambling_rant_on_recurring_depressive/,"So... This is kind of hard for me. I have never really discussed my depression in this many words with anyone, but I feel that I do need to get this off my chest. It's a huge fucking wall of text I've written in about 20 minutes with sleep deprivation late at night, so I'm sorry if it's a bit illogically structured or just plain rambling at times. I've put a TLDR at the end for those who can't be bothered to read all of it (I don't blame you.)


Short list of random info on me: mid-twenties, male, never officially diagnosed with depression, but I have seen a psychologist for it and anxiety, symptoms of schizotypal disorder, but not enough for an official diagnosis.
I've been having issues with depressive episodes for good part of my life now. Although recollections of these periods are vague, which makes it hard for me to pinpoint with any accuracy when they started, I do remember one which was in my first year of uni, which is a good 6 years ago.


**A brief history of my depression:**

My life officially went to shit two and a half, maybe three years ago. It was the first time that besides my depressive symptoms, I also started having panic attacks. I don't know why; I had no reason for this to happen. My grades were great; I had just finished my bachelors cum laude, I was in a field I loved working in and the internship I was doing was great.
My entire study ground to a halt for more than one and a half years, with me being too stubborn seek out help. Eventually, my parents convinced me to seek a psychologist to help me deal with the anxiety attacks, which were coming more regularly. Although he eventually found out about my depression, I never found the heart to tell my parents; they couldn't, and can't, help me with it, and it'd only worry them.

**Seeing a psychologist:**

It was probably one of the hardest things ever to go to my GP and tell her that I needed psychological help. This had two reasons. Firstly, I don't like talking about feelings. Secondly: I'd been burned once before. During the worst point in my the previous depressive episode, I'd gone to a student counselor and told him about my issues. He said that while he empathised, he was not able to help me with it, since it did not affect my study in any way, and recommended me to see my GP about it. 
In any case, this time, a few years too late perhaps, I did do this. The anxiety attacks alone were wrecking me. There was a time that hardly a day passed without one, and most days I'd have multiple of them.

The psychologist assigned to me was a lovely, yovial man. I made a lot of trouble for him. As I mentioned, I don't like discussing my feelings, and at several times during my appointments there, he mentioned his frustrations with having to drag every detail out of me. I can't blame him for that. 

**Aftermath:**

After a year of seeing the psychologist, I was starting to feel better. My internship was finally, more than a year and a half too over due, coming to a close (though back then I did not know it would still take me nearly half a year to finish it) and I started to have good days again with some regularity. I saw a life ahead of me. It was still uncertain what I would do, or what I even wanted to do with it, but it was there, and it didn't scare me like it had before. During this period, I was able to make plans for to finish my masters. It was by no means a stress-free time; my prolonged, mostly unexplained tardiness with deadlines had annoyed my supervisors to no end. Even my explanation of depression felt lacklustre and hollow to them. I can blame them for this too much. If it had been me it would also have been hard to mesh the idea that the guy who'd spent a lot of his earlier internship planning frequent movie nights with other students from the research group, actively joining discussions and joking around, with the what I told them: I couldn't get out of bed to go work on my research, and even when I managed, I sat at my desk for a few hours before deciding it was useless and going home. 
It must've felt incredibly schizophrenic to them, and it probably was. I was trying to present myself to the world as still being fine, despite very obviously not being so.

By the end, it had taken the toll on the relationship I had with supervisors to the point that one of them still is not on good speaking terms with me. But I did not care too much. I was getting my life in order. My parents had subtly hinted me that getting both me and my brother through university was taking a financial toll on them, and that after what my mother calls my 'sabbatical', I should probably try to finish ASAP.

**Back with a vengeance:**

So for the last 9 months, I have been doing so. I've tied up loose ends, done a second internship, finishing on time this time too, and I'm now in the final phases. Seven weeks of courses and ten to write my thesis and I should be done.
Emphasis placed on should: for the last five, maybe more, weeks I've been slipping back and it's terrifying the life out of me. I've been feeling worse, I sleep worse and I've even started smoking again. The tipping point that made me realize something was off was when I started tearing up when I saw a innocuous poster and I had to choke back tears. 
Since then, my mood has begun shifting radically. On some days, I wake up feeling fine. I make plans, I do shit, but by the time it's evening and I'm trying to relax, I can't stop feeling like shit. Other days I'm feeling completely normal. Other days still I feel completely apathetic to everything.

Suddenly, I feel less secure about my future. Am I really going to finish my masters before the summer, and if I do, what am I going to do then?

I'm terrified. I don't want to go back to the bleakness that was my life during the last really bad phase.

**Doubts**

And despite the huge wall of text I've written above, I still have doubts. Am I really depressed? Is it really not just some sadness? I mean, I am fine some days. I can still laugh with my friends. Am I not just a lazy bastard who's trying to find an excuse to not work as hard? And how do I know I'm more depressed than others are? Maybe I was just unusually chipper for the last 9 months. How would I know? It's not like I have a good frame of reference to compare it against.


**TLDR:**
I was depressed, then I wasn't and now I am becoming it again and it scares me and I don't know what to do."
48df22,1,2016-02-29,How to decline with grace?,Discardafterusingme,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/48df22/how_to_decline_with_grace/,"I'm at the last week of a ""marketing"" internship with a small local business and...its really not working out.

I accepted the internship thinking I'd be doing marketing and getting some concrete, relevant experience. I started working and discovered that I was the /entire/ marketing department, with no budget, no company marketing history, and no tools. I've pretty much spent the whole internship doing a ton of self-study. I have been able to set foundations for improvement but my main issue is the company.

Like I said before, its small. There are two owners who disagree about the company direction, nothing is recorded, my boss back-tracks on almost everything said (and nobody can hold him to it because nothing is written down). Who knows what else is not written down! It feels like I'm on a boat made of duct tape. I won't go into too much detail but there's other happenings that have made me lose even more trust in them.

I have a job interview next Monday, which is for a non-marketing position, but it's at a company that I have worked for before and they're more put-together at least.

How do I break the news to my boss? Ive never declined a job before. He seems to think that I want to keep working here and is already trying to build future plans.

48djsr,1,2016-02-29,Pursuing an internship as an information technology manager with a small company. They currently have no IT department. Should I be concerned? If I move forward what should I expect as a salary?,bryburn,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/48djsr/pursuing_an_internship_as_an_information/,"I'll start with a bit of background. I'm a 3rd year computer science major and looking for internships. I've been applying, and interviewing for internships in IT and software development. This one in particular stuck out. It seems like an impressive position to have, especially for an entry level candidate! ...but maybe too much for an entry level candidate?

The company is a small company, between 10 and 15 people on site. They're fairly well established and have been around for a few generations. However, they don't have an IT department yet. After interviewing with them it seems their plan is to hire a full time employee straight out of college as well as an intern in college. Then have these two be the IT department for the company. Specifically the first project would be web design and e-commerce management— managing it not creating it. After that they want someone to manage the servers, website, troubleshoot, and generally deal with all tech related things. Right now they don't have anyone on site they consider tech savvy.

I like that I could be ambitious and independent in this position, but at the same time I have to wonder if this is too much for an entry level position. I have some experience working in the IS department of my college. Working at the help desk for a while, then as a server technician. Only minor projects involving web design or management.

Lastly, if I do take the position I have no idea what I should ask for a salary. Glassdoor and those sites list IT manager as a fairly high paying position, anywhere between $55,000 and $100,000+. I expect that's a ridiculous amount to ask for an entry level position, and for a small company. So I really have no idea what the position should be paid.

What do you think? Is this too much to take on with my current experience? If not what should I ask for a salary?

Any help or advice is greatly appreciated."

48dkk0,1,2016-02-29,CMV: Apple unlocking the San Bernardino's terrorist poses no security risk to other iPhone users,ZenerDiod,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/48dkk0/cmv_apple_unlocking_the_san_bernardinos_terrorist/,"I've seen a lot of hyperbole about what the court order has asked Apple to do in the San Bernardino case. The facts that I see them are as followed:

1) Apple is not being made to code a backdoor into all of their phones, they are being made to make a firmware update for one particular phone, and the FBI is compensating them for their labor. The court order says that the firmware will be ran off the RAM in recovery mode, so it will be deleted from the phone permanently once it is power cycled. 

2) The FBI is saying Apple can keep the phone at their facility and provide remote access to them. 

3) The FBI is saying that Apple can code the firmware to work with a phone EIN, so even if it managed to fly off the device magically it wouldn't really work on anyother phone.

Common argument I've heard: 

 **""They're forcing Apple to make a security flaw that doesn't exist ""**

Not really the security flaw is that iPhone's accept firmware updates that can disable security features even when their phone is locked as long their signed by Apple. If FBI wanted to be real dicks they could subpoena the license keys already and try to write the code themselves

""**Once something like this exist there's no containing it**"" 

Apple already has to keep a huge code base from leaking(including the source code to iOS &amp; OS X) for very important security reasons. The task of adding one more revision of a cracked iOS to what has to be very secure repository of code should be trival. If their repos become compromised they have other problems.

And once again this ""exploit"" doesn't even work on the latest iPhone because their security is implemented in hardware on their secure enclave processor. 

I'm an electrical engineer who's experience in security hardware includes a few grad classes and an internship, so am by no means an expert, but am simply tired of people posting baseless speculation about technology they clearly understand even less than I do.

I'm an intern at a local non-profit, the organization just received a large donation of computers, after they prepare them they are looking to sell them. I'm creating an advertisement that will be be put online.

-

I've never designed a sales advertisement before. All critiques are welcome and appreciated. I have experience in user experience design so I find that I am drawn first to analyzing the first impression someone might have of this ad. Here's what I think the hierarchy of the poster should be, please correct me if you think otherwise:

-

Hierarchy :

1) Price

2) Specs

4) Brand &amp; Non-profit mission

3) Location + phone number


-

Sometimes its hard to know which element is more important because I don't know exactly who the ad is being shown to, will they consider price first? will they be interested in helping a non-profit? 3) Location could even be argued to be the most important, because will the person expect this company to be locally located, if not would they just ignore the ad? 

-

Some other things to note:
The tower is ready to use, the operating system is installed and updated.
CompuCorps sells many other computers, and computer parts.

-

If you have any resources for advertisement design, theory let me know! I love coming across things like that.

I know how to do like the basics of the problem, but I'm not making the connection to what's being asked, or how I should go about answering it. If anyone can give me some information, please help. It'd be much appreciated.

This is the entire problem:

&gt; After a long day on the job, you are reflecting on how much you have learned about business decision making through this internship. A good example is C&amp;M’s current plan to raise money through a stock issue rather than a debt issue. You recall from your Intermediate Accounting class that issuing debt imposes a fixed financial obligation on the company, but does not convey ownership to the debt holders. However, if C&amp;M issues stock, it gives up some ownership and thus some control. You know how protective Conner and Martin are of the company, and you wonder why they chose to issue stock. You decide to ask them the next day.
&gt; 
&gt; The next day you ask the management team if you could get some information about the proposed stock issue. You explain that there are trade-offs between issuing stock and issuing debt, and you wonder why they are planning to issue stock. Martin has an immediate response: They do not want to take on any more debt; they would prefer relinquishing some control rather than assuming more obligations. They argue that companies are like people who have ready access to multiple credit cards and use them to live on, effectively taking on more debt than they can easily repay. Having friends in this situation, you understand C&amp;M’s position. 
&gt; 
&gt; They then ask you to help them evaluate the three options they are considering for raising the necessary money for expansion. Amazingly enough, one of the options is to issue debt—you are glad to see they are at least considering it. The three options are:
&gt; 
&gt; 1. Issue $10,000,000 of 10-year bonds with a coupon rate of 6%, interest payable semiannually. (C&amp;M has an “A” bond rating.) Although the current market rate is 6%, based on current economic forecasts, Conner and Martin recognize that market rates might increase to 8% by the time they issue the bonds. Although they do not like the option of added debt, they feel it is a reasonable alternative and should be considered.
&gt; 
&gt; 2. A second possibility is to issue 2,600,000 shares of common stock ($2 par value) to current shareholders and a selected group of new investors (a private issue). The stock would be priced to sell at C&amp;M’s book value per share at the time of issue.
&gt; 
&gt; 3. The third option is to proceed with the initial public offering (IPO). Based on current and anticipated economic conditions, the resurgence of the IPO market, and interest in high-tech companies, Conner and Martin think they could get an IPO price of around $5 per share. At this price, they would need to issue approximately 2,000,000 shares. 
&gt; 
&gt; The company does have some shares held in treasury but does not want to re-issue these shares at this time. Conner and Martin also plan to continue to pay dividends to current shareholders but at a lower amount, probably $0.05 per share.
&gt; 
&gt;  
&gt; 
&gt;  
&gt; 
&gt; Instructions
&gt; 
&gt;  
&gt; 
&gt; (a)      As a fourth alternative, you suggest that the company borrow the money from a financial institution instead of issuing either bonds or stock. Conner and Martin of course turn the question right back to you, and ask you to summarize the advantages of borrowing in this fashion compared to issuing bonds. Write a memo describing the advantages and disadvantages of each method of financing.
&gt; 
&gt;  
&gt; 
&gt; (b)      Which alternative would you recommend to Conner and Martin? Be sure to justify your answer in comparing the merits of raising capital through bonds, loans, and common stock. Include any pros or cons of utilizing treasury stock in raising capital. Be specific in your answer, but remember you are writing to entrepreneurs, not accountants."
48eadt,43,2016-02-29,Impunity - Part IV,WriterWhoWrites,CaffeinatedWriter,https://www.reddit.com/r/CaffeinatedWriter/comments/48eadt/impunity_part_iv/,"“Montogomery Motel how may I help you?” Bob was leaning on the reception desk. 

“No thank you, I don’t think Stan will kill your wife for you, Sir… not even for two hundred dollars plus a prize pony. How do I know? I’ve known him since we were kids, you-” Bob calms himself down, remembering that he runs a business afterall. “If you’re ever down this part of the country, don’t forget the comfiest place for weary travelers. We have kitchnettes, cable-tv, clean beds and a beautiful view of..” The line is dead.

A teenage girl, leaning back on the chair with her feet on the reception table and eyes glued to the computer, giggles.

“This isn’t good for your blood pressure, Uncle Bob. Let me handle the calls.”

Bob puts down the phone, exasperated. It rings again, she lunges and picks up before Bob. 

“Norah from Montogomery Motel, if you’re asking about Stanley Smith he’s not accepting any hit-jobs and he isn’t interested in an interview. But if you want a cheap place to screw that hottie you met at the bar, we’re here for ya!” 

“Hey!” Bob protested. Norah winked and moved the receiver towards him. “Don’t worry, they disconnected before I got to the punchline.”

The door opens. A man in a black tie and suit enters. “I need to speak to Robert Reed.”

“Call me Bob, what can I do you for?”

“I’m Agent Joyce from the IRS, Bob.”

Norah gives him a brief look, then nods as she types into her computer. “He’s legit, Uncle Bob. Although he’s lost some weight from his last mugshot”

“Are you looking at my file?” Agent Joyce tries to peek at the computer screen. 

“What do you want, Agent Joyce from the IRS? Let me guess- Stan operated an unlicensed lemonade stand as a kid and didn’t report his income or share his profits with you.”

“Really? We’ll have to look into that as well.”

“Nah, that’d be past the statute of limitations Mr Taxman” Norah said.

Joyce looks confused, then collects himself and fumbles in his bag for a paper. “I’m afraid there’s a problem with *your* returns, Bob. You owe the state government a lot of money”. 

Joyce hands the notice to Bob.

Bob takes out his reading glasses. “Norah here does all my accounts.” Norah waves at Joyce in acknowledgment, eyes still glued to the screen. “She’s a prodigy. There’s no way there’ll be a mistake..”

“You’re right, Bob. Norah here looks like a smart kid and it isn’t her fault, its yours-” 

“One hundred and thirty seven thousand dollars?” Bob frowns.

“That’s right, Bob. We have discovered some disturbing details about your finances.” Bob’s head is buried in the document, trying to piece it together.

“For every working day in the past thirty years, you’ve driven to McBurger Queen to pick up a hamburger on your way to work,” he taps the reception desk, “and ate it on this very desk. We have many witnesses, Bob.”

“Yeah, so? It’s on the way to my Motel and they serve the best hamburgers in a fifteen mile radius.”

“Well it so happens that this place falls under the jurisdiction of Maryland. The sales tax in Maryland is six percent, Bob, while the sales tax in Virginia - where you live and work- is seven percent. Since you buy your breakfast at Maryland and eat it here in Virginia, you owe the good people of Virginia one percent on every hamburger you’ve ever eaten at the place.”

“This is outrageous.”

“Its the law, Bob. The only thing that’s outrageous is you robbing the good people of Virginia of their one hundred and thirty seven thousand dollars.”

“Maybe its the fault of the people of the good state of Virginia that they can’t make a half-decent hamburger.” 

Silence, as Bill goes over the notice again, mumbling and frowning.

“Uncle Bill, are we going down under? Do I still have a job?” Norah interrupts, eyes still glued to the computer.

“You are requested in the IRS building on Tuesday. Bring a lawyer, and be on time, Bob, or we’ll have to take over your account books.”

“Oh, you can bet I'll be there and appeal it. Norah will be my attorney, as always.” Norah waves once again, eyes glued to the computer. Bob puts the notice down in a defeated gesture.

The Senator snips the ribbon amidst camera flashes and a polite applause. Reporters swarm around him, shoving their microphones towards him as they’re held back by his security detail. 

“I’m honoured to inaugurate the opening of the newest research facility of Oxvac Pharma. This place is going to be another testament to the hard work and ingenuity of the American people. I also congratulate them on securing a Federal grant for coming up with medication for the most hard-to-cure diseases..”

He stops, peers at a person behind the press crowd and motions his bodyguards to make way. The reporters are pushed back and the Senator moves towards a young man in a wheelchair.

“How’re you feeling, Jim?” He holds Jim’s hand with a warm smile, kneeling down to eye level. ”You look much better than the last time I saw you”. 

The reporters circle around the scene, all mics are on Jim now. 

He speaks in low, creaky voice, struggling for breath after each syllable. “Its all thanks to your support for such cures, Senator.”

Jim falls forward and hugs the senator, who pats his back reassuringly. A few reporters wipe a tear from their eye.

“That was a nice touch,” the CEO says as he accompanies the senator back to his car. The Senator plucks out a tissue and sanitizes his hand vigorously.

“I’ve shaken hands with more cripples today than in any of my campaign tours”

The CEO looks at him disapprovingly. “Oh yeah, they don’t call them that anymore, do they? Disabled, whatever. Tomato-tomatoe.. new-age crap.” He pulls down the windshield and throws the used tissue out.

“Being respectful is the least we can do, Senator. Considering that we’re partly responsible for their disability.”

“You inherited this company, Wallace, remember that. If you ain’t got the stomach for it might as well handle it to someone like your father- you’re nothing like him. How close are you to finishing it?” 

“We’re close to confident we’ve found a specimen that matches most criterion.”

“I hope this is it this time. I’ve risked too much for you lot..”

“Don’t make it sound so one-sided. The shares my father generously gifted to you long ago are worth three billion today.”

“And they’ll be worth jack shit if this little project doesn’t pull through.”

The car drives outside the city and follows the dirt shoulder of a forest road to reach a gate. A guard comes out to inspect the passengers and signals it to open after a stiff salute to the Senator and the CEO.

They alight just outside a mess of red hazard tapes. Ahead of them a couple people in white plastic suits and respirators move about.

The CEO brings his handkerchief to his nose. 

The senator stops just outside taped enclosure. “Smells like a dead horse..”. He squints ahead and shakes his head. 

“This isn’t it.. I remember that smell even after all this time.  There ain’t no perfume in the world that can make me forget it”

“This is the best we could come up with given the paucity of data..”

“Fifty seven years.. fifty seven years and you still don't have it! You make me do the work your scientists should be doing..” The senator stomped back to his car. 

“Take me to Preston’s office,” he barked to the chauffeur. 

---

Agent Joyce hesitates as he is halfway through the door, perhaps feeling his conscience catching up to him. “I’m sorry this happened to you. Nothing personal.” He exits, leaving the door swinging as silence envelops the room.

“Uncle Bob, what are you going to do? If you kick Stan out it’ll all go away.”

“Stan has nowhere else to stay. He won’t stay at Katie’s because he doesn’t want her to be bothered by the Police or anyone. If he sleeps in the parks or streets, they’ll pick him up for violating some curfew they imposed on the spot.”

Norah looks away from the computer. “Speaking of Katie, you’re not going to believe this. George ‘the lonesome’ Olson is at her house.”

“What? How do you know?”

“They have a camera on their porch which they’ve connected to a service which is like a crowdsourced neighborhood watch. Basically, people keep a tab on other people’s neighbourhood feeds and report in case of suspicious activity in return for credits that can be cashed for real money or used as quid pro quo.”

“Is that why you bury your eyeballs on the screen, looking at other people’s yards?”

“Among other things, it’s just extra income on the side.. I’m more on the executive side, I co-created this service,” there is a hint of pride in her voice. ”But that’s beside the point - shouldn’t we tell Stanley?”

“George doesn’t have anything to do with Katie. He’s probably accepted a bounty on Stan, and since he’s only got impunity worth 22 years, he’d save his kill count for the singular target. If Stan rushes out like a madman they’ll get him again for one thing or another.”

Bob looks back at the notice in his hand. “One hundred and thirty seven thousand dollars. Geez.”

“What’re you gonna do?”

“I’ll fight it, but if it doesn’t work out, I’ll pay it. I won’t kick Stan out.”

“They’ll keep coming after you, Uncle Bob. Why do you care so much about Stanley Smith?”

“Its a long story.”

Nora takes her eyes off the screen and leans forward, giving Bob her full attention.

He sighs, folds the tax notice into his pocket and extends his hand. “I need a cigarette.”

Norah feigns an offended look. “I’m your uncle. You think I wouldn’t know?” She reluctantly takes out a packet from her trouser pocket. 

----

“Senator, what brings you here?” The young intern springs up from her seat on seeing him enter the DA’s office.

“Just checking up on my nephew. You must be the intern”

She nods. The Senator moves over to her work desk, peering over the mess of documents, newspaper clippings and photographs.

“Mr Preston usually leaves for lunch and comes back an hour later around this time.”

She suspects the senator already knew and doesn’t offer to call him up.

The Senator picks up a sheaf of papers from her table, examining it.

“What’s this?”

“I got it from a law school classmate who works at a private firm. Years ago they acquired the legal firm which handled Stanley’s birth father’s will.”

The Senator is engrossed, eyes glinting in fascination at what he’s reading.

“Is this the only copy?”

“Yes, it took him some sleuthing to get it from their vault. He couldn’t risk finding a copier so he just replaced the original with some bogus legal papers he was carrying. It is highly confidential afterall,” she says proudly.

“Good.” He folds it and puts it in his coat.

“But, Sir, Mr Preston needs to see those..”

“Tracy, was it?” He looks at her badge.

“You’re young and bright. You’re wasting your days here with my good-for-nothing nephew and his illusory political ambitions."" He hands out a card to her. ""Call this number, I’ll set you an appointment for an internship at the Department of Justice and forget that this meeting ever happened including whatever you read in that piece of paper.”

Tracy considers the offer wide-eyed.
 
“So do we have an understanding?”

She pauses for the longest time, calculating the best route for her career trajectory, concludes that the senator does have a point. This affair does not concern her. And Preston was a sexist snob she’d always hated.

“Thank you, Senator.” 

“You’re a bright kid who knows how to make the right choice, you’ll go far.” He smiles at her, patting her shoulder.

The senator rolls up the document and walks outside the building. He borrows a lighter from a bum he finds smoking and sets it alight, trampling the ashes with his expensive, patent-leather shoes.

----

Bob and Norah lean on a car in a near-empty parking lot, looking towards the rows of police cars, armored vehicles and unmarked Sedans with government plates. Civil servants with binoculars laze around, occasionally sending status updates. Across the street the pastures spread out, and in the distance a mountain looms over it all.

Bob blows a long puff of smoke.

“When I was nine, Jones and Henry took me there with a stack of booze and Playboys,” he points to the mountain in front of them. 

“It was the hottest summer in a century, and the snowline barely went a few feet down the summit, exposing a lot of the bare rocks. With the kind of brazen stupidity that only alcohol and adolescence can justify, we went quite far up even after it was dark, treading on rocks that had been buried under the snow for god knows how many years.”

“I fell down a fissure that had been exposed with the melted snow. Henry and Jones, those Bastards… didn’t notify anyone all night ‘cause their Daddies would’ve smelled the booze in their breath. They go down next morning and come back with a caver in the afternoon. The caver tried for hours, said the cave was too narrow and too deep, I was trapped upside down, wouldn’t survive more than a few hours.”

“My old man first tried to chip away the rocks. He gave up when the insides just crumbled and piled up over me. He sat there and cried next to the cave, trying to reassure me by chanting verses from the Bible. That’s the last thing I remember before my consciousness gave away.

“Next thing I know I’m on my pappy’s shoulder being carried down the hill, ankle busted but the rest of me intact. All he ever said was that it was divine providence.. only told the truth two years later when he was on his deathbed. It was Stan - he’d come up that hill kicking and screaming, dragged by his little step-sister. He lowered himself down and pulled me out. My old man never told me how they could do that- it was a promise he’d made and he took it to his grave.”

“Whenever people asked how I got out of that hell my old man would just praise the Lord’s grace. Those were simpler times back then, and people wouldn’t inquire further.”

Bob looks at the mountain, “For many years even the sight of that hill brought back nightmares. I’m never going back up again.”

---

From his motel room window Stan peers out at the sprawling landscape, the mountain of his childhood glinting in the orange light of the setting sun, wondering whether his pentagenarian feet were nimble enough to make another trek to the fissure near the summit. *I should take a shovel*, he thinks, *it is probably buried under a large heap of snow by now*.

48eewf,1,2016-02-29,Need Advice scoping out my specialization,nomilkmike,AskMarketing,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMarketing/comments/48eewf/need_advice_scoping_out_my_specialization/,"Aha! So this is my first post ever, excited and terrified at the same time. Been a longtime lurker, finally decided to step into to the light.  I'm at the point in my career where I need to narrow down my options and start to specialize. The problem is I don’t know what direction to choose. 
 
Background: 
I'm 23 years old, about to graduate with a degree in Film &amp; Media. Even though I haven't graduated yet I'm coming out of college with 2 ½ years of work experience. My first position as a design assistant, making graphics for use in online educational media and the other as a web marketing intern, where my focus was more on the analytical side (GA, CRM account management, etc). 
Currently I'm working as a marketing associate for a computer training company. Originally, it was only supposed to last 2 months but they loved my work and kept me on as a part of the team.  The company is a decent size about 120 employees across 8 different states. Where things get interesting is due to some internal problems, our marketing manager was let go, leaving me and the other used-to-be-intern to run the whole marketing department by ourselves!  
At first, it was incredibly stressful but it forced me to grow a lot as a marketer and a designer. I got my first real taste at 'designing with code' updating our company's outdated html email signatures and creating custom landing pages. Up till this point, I've always handed off my designs to a developer, now I have no one to rely on but myself. Its been pretty liberating as well as frustrating (I'm looking at you Outlook word rendering). My coworker and I have split up the work, I design all our marketing materials, while she writes all our content. Responsibility is shared when it comes to laying out our campaigns in InfusionSoft. Combined the two of us have taken over our previous manager's job and more. 
 
Where I'm stuck: 
I love my job and the challenge that it presents however, compared to jobs with a similar description as I'm being paid pretty poorly. Right now I feel I'm a generalist who can do a bunch of different things but no one particular thing mind blowingly well. If my time lurking on /r/marketing has taught me anything its that specializing is where the money is at. When it comes to deciding what should be my niche, my mind turns to mush because from all the different possibilites. Has anyone else experienced this and how did you finally get set into one specific role?
 
My three very different roads to follow: 
- Become Adobe Instructor for current company. 
- Marketing Designer at another company 
- Visual Designer at a marketing agency 
 
Could anyone working in one of these areas chime in on their experience? Or anyone who's risen for associate to manager let me know how that went for you?  
 
P.S. Sorry about all the words"

48f1s0,0,2016-03-01,Last month I got rear ended by an 18-wheeler and it (obviously) totaled my Corolla. So now what?,legithappytobealive,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/48f1s0/last_month_i_got_rear_ended_by_an_18wheeler_and/,"So last month I got rear ended by a semi-truck on I-17 in Coconino County, Arizona. Traffic was at a complete stop due to an accident ahead and there was nobody behind me when I stopped. After about 20-30 seconds of sitting still I saw him behind me, had a quick thought that he might hit me, and realized I had no other choice but to stay put. There was a guard rail on one side, parked cars on the other, and parked cars in front of me so my only choice was to embrace the impact. I sat and watched him coming - sucked! - and stupidly braced myself. Left hand on the wheel, right hand on the e-brake (manual transmission, it was a reflex), and right foot on the break. He hit me and I jolted forward, felt instant neck pain, but was able to walk away. He had Minnesota plates/license. 

I went to the ER for an x-ray and CT of my neck, they said it was strained but OK, and gave me muscle relaxers. Since then I've been to primary care who gave me narcotics for the pain and referred me to PT. 6-7 weeks later, I'm doing physical therapy 2x a week for my neck and shoulder. The impact of the semi and reflex of my seatbelt not only strained my neck but also dislocated my shoulder, collar bone, two frontal ribs, and one in the back. The x-ray was only checking my neck so this wasn't identified by a doctor until PT a couple weeks ago. 

I was VERY fortunate to have been able to borrow a car from a friend until I was able to replace mine. My auto insurance reimbursed the already-paid-for Corolla but not at a rate that would've allowed me to purchase a car at equal value/relatively close to the same as what I had so now I've got a car payment because, financially, it's my only option right now. 

The other driver's insurance company hasn't contacted me. I haven't contacted them, either, because I'm still trying to heal and don't want to dive in until I know my body is taken care of. Since the accident, and it 100% was NOT my fault the officer said so(Maybe it's a distracted driver situation?) - I've acquired plenty of med bills, plenty of doses of pills, multiple and long-lasting injuries, and a monthly car payment (with an added bonus of increased insurance rates - whoohoo!). I'm an intern for a corporation and graduated college two months ago with plenty of debt, I pay all my own bills, and live on my own so I'm trying to handle this as best I can. 

My questions are:
Should I seek legal advice? From who/what kind of attorney?
Approximately what can I expect to pay for legal help (aka, how much MORE will this accident cost me?)
Should I wait to hear from the other guy or reach out? OR Do I wait until I have a lawyer to contact them? Should I do it or leave it up to legal?
What kind of charges should I expect if this goes anywhere?
When/should I settle? Or does this type of thing go to court?

Tl;dr: I got hit by a semi-truck on I-17 in AZ and he totaled my car - 100% his fault according to police - and now I'm stuck with med bills, a car payment, injuries, and no contact from the other guy. This accident has cost me A LOT so far and I'm not even better yet. Now what??"

I've had internships every year totalling 21 months industrial experience and have an interest in computer aided engineering and simulations.

Parts I've designed are in production now and I've taken products from sketches to finished installed components

Along the side I have founded an FSAE team as kind of practise run at running a company, I've recruited 12 other engineering and business students and we've attracted sponsors and started designing our FSAE car.



I also have skills in programming and have written a few thousand lines of Python currently used by a Fortune 500 company. 

I've learned web development skills and built out my own portfolio site 

I'm starting to build sites for other people and have done a few for local charities etc.



The main thing is I'm not sure how to spin my skill sets into some cohesive service or package, I feel like I could be a good consultant for product design but without 10 years experience in an industry I don't have the links and network to find potential clients 



My city (Manchester,U.K.) has a growing start up scene and I'm interested in that but it's mostly digital companies 



I'd really appreciate any advice ! 



Oh I also own www.learnengineering.co.uk which I'm convinced has potential as a site I could monetize but I have no idea what to do with it.

Are there any places to find trainee programs / internships for newbies?,magicsebi,TillSverige,https://www.reddit.com/r/TillSverige/comments/48fmzt/currently_studying_python_but_i_want_to_get/,"**I know there was a similar question a few days ago but the top answer has been deleted.** :(

I have a Bachelor in Physics and I had been working on a Masters' in Atmospheric Science but I took a temporary break to study Python. I have a bit of experience with IT stuff and it's going pretty well so far but, of course, I'm no pro yet. I like this stuff more than pyhsics and I'm a fast learner - I'd be faster if I got my hands on some actual, real developer stuff.

I can't use my savings forever so I'd like to find some sort of trainee program or internship for a newbie in IT. Unfortunately I don't know Swedish yet either (I am studying it though!) but I can say my English is almost at a native-speaker level (Native language is Romanian). I know such internships exist for newbies because a friend said she might hook me up with one at her place but nothing came of it so far...

Cheers!"

48goau,127,2016-03-01,Just had a seminar in university about feminism and 'the gender gap',slimbarracks,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/48goau/just_had_a_seminar_in_university_about_feminism/,"**Summary** 

Just had a seminar for a US Politics module in one of the top universities in the UK. Was astounded at the level of feminist indoctrination and misinformation. Just had to rant. 


**Body**

The seminar was on 'the gender gap' in the USA. I am staunchly anti-feminist and am fairly well versed in gender politics compared to other students my age (which has been supplemented by TRP). I had a range of articles and sources disproving every feminist myth I could think of, and had done extensive research, thinking I could change other student's minds about the necessity of feminism. I thought I could at least appeal to the guys in the class.


WRONG.


Every single guy in the class was a quasi-feminist. I don't know whether they actually identified as ~~male feminists~~ manginas, but they were definitely spouting some feminist shit. Some of the points raised by the class as a whole were:



&gt;Opposition to abortion is sexist!!! It's so difficult for women in some states to get abortions because...discrimination!!!


I don't have that much knowledge about abortion laws in the US, but I'm fairly sure that the backlash against abortion isn't to do with gender discrimination, but the rights of the foetus. 


&gt;Womyn are paid only 77 cents to the man's dollar!!!


The gender wage gap does not. fucking. exist. That figure has been taken from average calculations that do not account, in any way, for different industrial preferences, female withdrawal from the labour market due to family considerations, etc. A completely shitty and ignorant point you'd expect from a 6rd grade who's done no research. 


&gt;There still exists a glass ceiling, women are not evenly represented in the higher paying jobs. Most CEOs are male, most of Congress is male, women are being held back from success, bla bla bla more feminist bullshit bla bla bla.


There is no glass ceiling. Women choose not to go into these industries as much as men do because a) many of them take dumbass degrees in university such as women's studies, nursing, makeup and fashion studies (how the fuck is that an actual course) and b) they want the high-paying jobs without knowing what obtaining that position entails. Once they find out, they lose incentive because 'it's too hard and time-consuming'. Don't fault men for being more ambitious and hard-working (in general). 


&gt;People don't like positive discrimination even though it helps wimmin achieve their dreams and succeed in the real world :( 


...What the genuine fuck? If women didn't like that men were privileged once upon a time, why the fuck should we like when females get privilege in the working environment? I have been applying to tons and tons of internships, and for almost every single investment bank I have applied to, they have a separate program JUST FOR WOMEN. Feminism has overshot equality, it has tipped the scales in the favour of women. Fuck your positive discrimination. Equality of opportunity, not equality of outcome. 


&gt;I don't think people should vote for Hillary just because she's a woman...but it's reasonable for women to vote for her because she's a woman and she understands them... :)


How does a college-educated female maintain such insane contradictions spewing from her mouth without her brain imploding? I will never know. The worst part is, when she said this, some other people in the class were nodding thoughtfully in agreement. *Eye twitch*


In general, there was a lot of Hillary Clinton circlejerking and praise, victimisation of women, and misunderstanding of social and policy issues. No mention of alimony laws that devastate the lives of men. No mention of unfair social expectations on men. No mention of depression and suicide rates. No mention of quotas and positive discrimination of women being unfair on men. No mention of domestic violence against men. No mention of prison rape. No mention of adoption and child custody laws. No mention of the fact that there are 7 different federal departments dedicated to women's wellbeing and advancement, and none for men. 


Thankfully I don't live in America.

48gpgw,1,2016-03-01,"I was just convicted by a jury of my ""peers"" to a ""crime"" I am positive I didn't commit.",27818632,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/48gpgw/i_was_just_convicted_by_a_jury_of_my_peers_to_a/,"I'm so disappointed with humanity right now. 

To start this off, I attend West Point, also known as the United States Military Academy.  I entered cadet basic training in June 2010; had everything gone according to plan, I would have graduated in May 2014 with a degree in mechanical engineering w/ focuses in engineering management and aerospace. 

But life didn't go as planned. In March 2013, I was brought down to CID as a potential witness that was under investigation. If had no idea at the time, but it turned out my sister company's TAC NCO was [guilty as shit](https://saboteur365.wordpress.com/2014/03/11/muh-dik-and-the-face-of-black-americas-sexual-criminality/)*. The TAC positions, for those unaware, are two mentors assigned to a company of about 120 people. The officer and NCO are there to run administrative details, but also to mentor and train us (cadets) in our journey to becoming officers. Their offices are repurposed barracks room, so they work alongside us. 

Through two CID investigations (and I have complaints about how that was run... The second time they pulled me into my TAC NCOs room without warning and forced me to testify, in the middle of our final exam week). 

In these videos, I watched McClendon sneak up on me, unsuspecting, in the shower. I had morning practice that had authorization to miss breakfast formations, so I was typically one of the only people in the barracks at this time, and McClendon used that to his advantage. The showers I used at the time had two entrances on opposite sides, so either way my back was turned to one exit or the other. Between the two times I was questioned by CID, I watched somewhere between 9-11 videos of myself and two videos of a different woman whom I did not know, but looked similar to me. 

Though this did not involve any contact, I was profoundly affected. I had honestly trusted this guy, and trusted his subordinates, who loved him as their TAC NCO. I also had a lot of guilt - a year earlier one of my female classmates had reported him for something, which we all assumed was an inappropriate joke that she took offense to. She was ostracized, ridiculed behind her back, and I believed the story that was told - though no one was privy to the facts of the case but her. 

When my performance slipped in the rest of that spring semester slipped tremendously, in large part because the investigation questioning both occurred immediately before my midterms and before finals. The previous semester I'd had in the neighborhood of a 3.8, and before that a 4.1, but now I barely passed a few of my classes. I was having trouble sleeping among other things, and my company's TAC NCO attempted to pep me up in all the wrong ways. ""You weren't actually raped."" ""I've seen all kinds of shit, I'm all kinds of messed up, but I compartmentalize. Your problem is you can't compartmentalize."" ""At least you'll be a better leader."" ""I heard this guy targeted you more than other people. This guys a sick fuck, and you should be offended but flattered.""

That summer, with the pending court martial hanging over my head while McClendon went through various mental evaluations, I ended up failing my leadership detail (a graduation requirement for us is to lead other cadets in one of our summer trainings. I was a platoon leader). I went in the first few weeks and was told that I and my cadet platoon sergeant were the strongest leaders in the company, but the stress caught up with me. I made mistakes like oversleping for our morning PT formations (we were running on about 4-5 hours of sleep for six weeks), leaving my radio behind, etc. All inappropriate habits for someone a year from graduation. 

In August, it was decided through my TAC team and a psychiatrist that I would leave the Academy for a year of medical leave due to ""adjustment disorder with depressed mood."" I drove home in late August, and essentially moped. As a cadet I wasn't legally allowed to work though my parents pressured me to do so. I also avoided going to therapy (that I was supposed to be taking, admittedly) until around mid-October when my mom basically forced me to call. Attending those sessions, I was incredibly angry. I was angry at being forced, I was angry at the situation, and I looked for more outlets for my anger. This civilian therapist claimed she understood what I was going through, and that was the perfect outlet for my anger - how could she understand how imperative trust was to those in the military, and how this had fractured my trust? That was the issue, not so much about violation of my body (though I was terrified what could have happened to those videos as well). She made assumptions about my feelings, and that gave me the perfect excuse to shut her out. By December, she basically told me that our sessions weren't going anywhere and weren't helping me, so she wasn't going to see me anymore. 

Meanwhile, as I'd been pressured to get out of the house, I chose to volunteer at a nearby barn in late October. I'd always loved horses growing up (who am I kidding I was obsessed as a little girl, elementary school age) but never got the opportunity to do anything with it. Through that barn I met a wonderful older woman, and started taking lessons with her. This was a major turning point for me, because I immediately clicked with it. My friend and instructor praised me immensely on how much of a natural I was, how much of a pleasure I was to teach because I was so hardworking and diligent, etc. I'm tearing up now just writing this. 

That November we also had a family reunion, at which I met a few of my uncles I hadn't seen in 17+ years. With my dad being in the Army, we consistently lived a prohibitively far distance from them. After this reunion, one of my uncles offered me an internship at his engineering firm. So, in January, I drove myself to LA and moved into another uncle's vacation condo. I'm incredibly grateful for that opportunity, and I know how lucky I was to have it - but it was isolating. My coworkers were all fairly significantly older than me. My aunt and uncle were both busy, and over the five months I was in LA I saw them twice outside of work. I spent my time between work (which was at first frustrating busywork that didn't capitalize at all on my mechanical engineering knowledge, but at the end changed as I did a lot of work in MATLAB), and taking riding lessons three times a week. The lessons were my outlet - I quickly picked up on dressage and jumping, and shortly before I left nearly got the opportunity to compete in a cross country event. 

I had absolutely no desire to go back to West Point. I fought with my parents over it. I don't know whether they took that seriously at the time, or if there was ever the option to not come back. I reentered the corps in June 2014 after passing the APFT and passing a psychiatric evaluation. However, that weekend coming back I made two mistakes that ended up changing how my entire year would go. First, I took a pass Friday night without putting in a pass request - my best friend graduated at the late graduation and I went to celebrate at his family's house nearby. I thought I had followed all the proper procedures, but I woke the next morning to missed phone calls saying I was AWOL as I hadn't put in a pass request. I kicked myself for that. I should have known, but I forgot. The second mistake was I initiated an illegal torrent dos low of Game of Thrones on my personal computer (my govt computer was being reset or something). I stopped that download almost immediately - it was a stupid thing for me to do - and ended up waiting to see the finale. 

At the Academy, we have the Cadet Honor Code: a cadet will not lie, cheat, steal, or tolerate those who do. 

Several weeks later, while in my new leadership detail (a platoon leader for field training) I was pulled out of training and approached for evaluation. HBO had contacted West Point with the download, and it was traced to me. I was asked if I did this, I admitted I had in a sworn statement. I was also pulled to have a regimental board (a mid-level disciplinary punishment) for being AWOL. For that mistake I was assigned (iirc) [40 walking hours](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d7/West_Point_Cadet_walking_the_Area%2C_May_98.jpg) and 35 demerits (the max). Once the semester started, I received a brigade board (the highest punishment level for regulations violations) for connecting my personal computer to the network. I received another 40 hours (iirc) and another 35 demerits. The demerits are important only in that you can only accrue a maximum of 70 demerits within a six-month period, and then a conduct investigation happens. 

So, there I am, coming back to a new peer group whose only real memory of me is me struggling after the sexual assault-harassment thing, and I've accrued all these new disciplinary issues. Needless to say I wasn't exactly welcomed with open arms. I continued to struggle, still dealing with depression and reintegrating. I told the Sexual Assaulr Response Coordinator (SARC) that some of my biggest mental issues were feeling like a failure because of my reactions and the things my TAC NCO had said. Without my knowledge, he told the upper chain of command about it, and it trickled down that this SFC had said inappropriate things. That brought more hostility from him, as he'd gotten in trouble the year prior (which I didn't know at the time) and had undergone a lengthy investigation. I imagine he felt I was twisting his words like this other woman had allegedly done, when in reality I had no intent to complain about him, but merely about the impact his words had on me. At one point when I approached him to ask for assistance with something, he went off on me. ""I don't think we're even supposed to be talking to one another, given our history. I know what I said, and you know what I said, and one day, when you're more mature, you'll realize I was just trying to help you."" He constantly badger me about ""not trusting him"" and how I couldn't blame other NCOs for one NCOs actions. In reality, his hostile approach in conversations really just shut me down when I was struggling with confidence to begin with. 

As a result of the brigade board, I also started a mentor program with an instructor in the leadership department, and that was possibly the most beneficial thing to come of that year. She helped me regain a lot of my confidence and poise, and I'm eternally grateful for her help. 

However, I still had yet to go through the honor board process for violating the honor code by ""stealing."" As I'd admitted to the offense, I went through a cadet advisory board, where nine of my peers listened to my cadet chain of command and TAC officer talk about my character and potential for leadership. I was struggling so much at this point that there weren't a lot of positive things to say. My attempts to reach out for help were interpreted as me blaming my performance on the assault/harassment, and they all thought I should be completely ""healed"" - I'd had a year away just for that, after all. Despite that, the majority of my classmates recommended that I graduate with class. However, I also had to get recommendations from my TAC officer, Regimental TAC (RTO), brigade TAC (BTO), and commandant before meeting with the Superintendent. My TAC recommended separation based on a ""lack of resiliency."" The RTO, BTO, and Comm all recommended a 6-month turn-back. I didn't meet with the Supe until January of last year, after I scrambled companies. I represented myself poorly, nearly passing out from nervousness in front of this three star general. He decided to turn me back a year, now to graduate in May 2016. 

I improved over the next few months and had no disciplinary issues whatsoever, though I struggled a lot with depression. My previous therapist from the fall had violated my trust by talking to my TAC team without my knowledge (longer story that I can elaborate on), so I tried to deal with it on my own. My performance was mediocre by my own standards, but it was acceptable. However, I bonded more with the seniors in that company and less so with the juniors. The next year, after the class of 2015 graduated, I was again without any close friends and had a nonexistent support network. My mentor left, and because of the honor program, I had to get a new mentor to finish the exact same program I'd done as a result of my brigade board. 

in December of that previous year, I was also given a parking ticket demerit for forgetting to move my car (putting me over the 6-month 70-demerit limit and triggering a conduct investigation) and accused of violating the honor code by lying. I had to go through an investigation for that, but thankfully it was quickly dropped when I was able to provide proof that the other person had misunderstood me, rather than me intending to deceive in any way. The conduct investigation happened in perhaps March, and again my former TAC and TAC NCO recommended separation based on a lack of resiliency. They also told the investigating officer that they were sure I'd been blaming all of this on my assault - even though they were the fist ones to mention it. 

As a result of the CI, I was put on some sort of suspended separation for demerits, and assigned an additional duty over the summer. My new TAC also told me he was going to recommend another session of SLDP (senior leader development program). This would mean three of that exact same program - one for the brigade board, one for the honor board, and one for the conduct investigation. All which were essentially triggered by this dumb decision to download a $3 tv show - that I stopped the download of. 

Now we get to this last semester (I apologize for how long-winded this is). I was assigned to do mandatory morning workouts run by a cadet, because my previous APFT score was under the company target goal of 270. For those unaware, the APFT is a physical test consisting of 2 min push-ups, 2 min sit-ups, and a 2 mile run. The minimum passing score is 180. The maximum is 300. I had scored in the neighborhood of 265. Everyone was afforded the opportunity to take a diagnostic to see if they could score higher, but I missed it becaus I was sick with an upper respiratory infection. I was placed on these workouts anyway. 

The guy running it was an absolute ass on a power trip, and (imo) a misogynist. The first day of morning workouts he mocked a woman in our company for having a high-pitched voice, in front of 30+ underclassmen, some of whom she was directly leading. I pulled him aside later and told him that was unprofessional and disrespectful. He blew me off and several days later did it again, this time making up a cadence that he would squeak out, and the other workout members would echo in an equally squeaky voice. I again told him this was absolutely unprofessional, to which he told me he'd gotten permission from her to do. I later found out he hadn't. She said she'd talk to him. 

That first week I ended up twisting my foot badly and injuring myself, to my frustration. X-rays showed that while it wasn't broken, I had an [accessory navicular](http://www.foothealthfacts.org/footankleinfo/Accessory_Navicular_Syndrome.htm), and was placed in a camboot, with a warning that if I pushed it, I would likely require surgery. Following that, I worked out on my own at the gym, after checking in in the morning for accountability. 

One morning, probably on 1 or 2 September, I missed the accountability and continued on my own to work out anyway. Asshole dude asks me at morning formation where I was, and I tell him so. I also ask whether he'd received an email I sent him the night prior, about the potential of having equestrian morning workouts (I'd made the equestrian team at my school the previous year). He somehow interpreted that as me saying I'd missed workouts because I had equestrian practice, which I never said. On top of that, the email got stuck in my outbox, which I found out when he approached me to tell me he hadn't received it. He told me that he wanted concrete days when we had morning practice. I told him I'd let him know when I found out. Morning practices were never discussed after that point and faded off my radar. I continued to attend morning workouts on my own until I got out in a non-weigh bearing cast in mid-September. 

A month after the incident, asshole approaches me to tell me he thinks I was lying. I told him I never said I had equestrian morning practice, he says I did. He says he specifically asked me whether I did and I confirmed. I remember only confirming that I worked out that morning. He tells me he's sending it up as a potential honor violation for lying. 

The end of October, I'm approached to give my sworn statement on what happened nearly two months prior. Stupidly, thinking I had nothing to hide, I waive my right to a lawyer and give my sworn statement. My roommate also testifies, but with false information shed gained through hearsay. 

I go the entire time thinking this will get dropped. There was no evidence to back up the claim that I lied. I find out at the end of January that others disagreed, and it was being forwarded to an honor investigative hearing. 

I scramble to talk to a lawyer. We go through and she agrees my roommate's testimony - which says I only went to one or two morning workouts, and that equestrian practice was never even considered - is the most inflammatory of the evidence (which consists only of seven sworn statements). Essentially, asshole says that I made a statement, I say that I made a different statement. Though other people were standing nearby, no one can confirm either of our sides of the story. 

I had my hearing yesterday. At the hearing, nine cadets sit on a board with a cadet overseeing as the ""judge."" Four people and myself testify. My former roommate confirms that several pieces of her testimony are false. She confirms that she knows for certain that I went to one or two, because I spoke directly about them. She then says that she remembers me getting up every morning, though she can't confirm exactly where I go. (But where else would I go at 0530, if not the gym? Nothing else is open). Asshole testifies that he tried to treat everyone equally and tried to make me go to workouts, but keeps calling me a ""special case."" He says that I gave a lot of pushback on working out, and says he never agreed to me working out on my own at the gym (which I know for sure is false). He can't remember when workouts started. He can't remember when I was out on profile, even though he was also my section leader. He can't remember whether I was on profile for the date in question. However, he claims he remembers exactly what he said, and exactly how I responded, nearly six months later. He claims he knew immediately that it was fishy, that I was lying. When he came to my room and I checked my outlook, he says he knew for sure, right then, that I was lying. Yet, he never asked to see my email. He also expressed visible frustration that he didn't ""have power over me."" He repeatedly characterized his relationship with the other workout attendees as ""having power over them.""

Asshole's roommate was the honor representative, and had been present for the approach for clarification a month later. He confirms that asshole came and complained to him that he thought I was shirking my duties. He then decided, because of that, that he would see if there was a potential honor issue - which didn't fit with asshole's narrative that he immediately knew I was lying. 

My team captain also testifies, confirming my story that morning practices were discussed, and that our coach had been adamant about them over the summer. She says she didn't think they were going to happen, because she didn't really want to do them, but admits that our coach has a pretty strong personality. But to me this is irrelevant because I never claimed I went to morning equestrian practice. Despite this, the board seems to get hung up on whether I could have potentially been confused about them happening - my own fault, due to language I used in my sworn statement, when I said that a conversation on 31 Aug or 01 Sep had made me think practices were definitely going to happen. 

I also got up and gave my testimony before answering questions. I think this may have been where I shot myself in the foot. I never remembered exactly what asshole had said (he approached me over w month later for chrissake), so I repeatedly tried to indicate that no matter the language that was said, I was trying to communicate that I had gone to work out on my own, as had been agreed. When he approached me to confirm, I had been in conversation with another cadet, and I believed I was confirming that I had worked out. Perhaps there were small inconsistencies with exactly what I said, but I know the message and the timeline were always consistent, because I remember those clearly. I remember I was irritated with him for interrupting me (as if my conversation wasn't important!). It wasn't until my testimony that I was able to emphasize I'd never been confused about the potential of equestrian practice *actually* occurring and had not accidentally gone to one.

In my closing statement, I tried to emphasize the lack of proof. I pointed out asshole's hostile language and his slouched posture, and how his emotional perception of me had shaped his memory of the events (he was literally mixing up events that happened in November with what happened in September). He had inconsistencies with saying he treated everyone equally, but then listed ways in which I was a ""special case"" (said multiple times with derision). His roommate said that he was motivated more by thinking I was shirking responsibilities than the thought of an actual honor violation. My roommate confirmed that to the best of her memory, I had not once overslept during this time period. There was no benefit to me going to work out at the gym and call it an equestrian practice rather than a morning workout. Even if I had overslept and missed it, the consequences probably would have been an hour of cleaning duty. On the other hand, the consequences of lying and being caught in a lie (after being on suspended separation) means getting kicked out. I don't know if that's set in stone with this board decision, or if that's merely a recommendation, but that possibly means recompensation - repaying West Point in excess of $200k, if not even more given the years I've spent here. It means not getting my majors (mech engineering and my second that I would be finishing this semester in sociology). It means my loan through USAA shooting from .75% interest to 18% interest (I currently owe in the neighborhood of $22k). It means not having a West Point resume. After all I've fought to get through this place, I never in a million years would have risked that. 

No order to find me guilty, 6 or the 9 board members had to find that I had:
- made the statement
- knew the statement to be false
- the other person suspected the statement to be false
- intended to deceive and gain an unfair advantage in that deception

I'm still flabbergasted. I haven't yet told my parents, who are eagerly planning for a graduation in roughly 80 days. I don't know what happens from here, or what to do. I need to talk to my lawyer today to see my options, but I'm just incredibly disappointed in this entire system.

48grvw,38,2016-03-01,Things you don't always know when you want to move to Sweden,lostinsweden_,TillSverige,https://www.reddit.com/r/TillSverige/comments/48grvw/things_you_dont_always_know_when_you_want_to_move/,"I've lived in Sweden for 2 years so far and it's been quite the experience. There have been ups and downs, and many times I've been incredibly frustrated. There have also been times I've been happy and excited as well.

Let's face it, if you are planning to move to Sweden, you've probably met a Swedish person, or are wanting to study here. Perhaps, you've been offered a job, however i'm going to guess that that's a minority of cases. Perhaps you're following someone with one of those connections as well.

Regardless of the factors, there are many variables to you coming to Sweden and thriving. 
The following is my take on coming to Sweden, observations and personal opinions. Nothing is conclusive or absolute, so know that there can be exceptions to it all.

Questions:

The first question you must ask yourself is: Why are you coming to Sweden? 

Are you coming here for another person or love? Are you coming here for the culture? A new perspective? A new life? Job opportunities? I could go on, but I'll let you decide that for yourself.

The previous reasons are basically the main reasons I came. 

But there are still other questions to ask yourself. 

Do you have enough money to not work for 2+ years? Do you have a job already lined up? Can your family assist? Does your sambo (if it applies) work? Do you have a place to live lined up? 

Coming to Sweden:

When I first got to Sweden, I was excited. I had been dating another Swede for quite some time and ended up coming here to be with that person. I packed up, sold everything, and came here after waiting 9 months for the sambo visa. 

My sambo finished studying nearly a year after I arrived.  During that time period life was incredibly slow. I was living in a town of around 40,000 people and everything closed by 16:00, except a few grocery stores. I come from a city much larger than Stockholm. Back in my hometown I was hardly ever at home. If I was not working or studying, I was out and about enjoying the lakes and parks with my dog or the nightlife and music with friends. That would not necessarily be the same in this new place. 

Weather:

I arrived in Sweden during the summer. I have to admit that Sweden is really lovely during summer and spring, when it's not raining, which I guesstimate amounts for about 70% of the time. 

Then the rest of the time it's incredibly dark and cold. During winter the sun's rays last about 3-4  hours a day. The closer you get to winter the less sun you’ll see and the further away the more you’ll see.  The temperature during winter is very temperamental. One day it can be -15 and another it can be 2 or 3. Snow commonly melts and appears every few days, so you end up with slush messes everywhere. Actual sun is rare because its usually hidden behind clouds or grey skies. 

So, Sweden is mostly a cold, rainy, dark and sunless place, with perhaps one month max of perfect weather spread out throughout the year. 




Pre-Planning and Post:

Before I got here I did some research and made a list of all the things I had to do, such as getting a personnummer, going to skatteverket, visiting migrationsverket, setting up a bank account, getting a körkort, getting into SFI, and visiting the local arbetsförmedlingen. 

After my arrival I spent most of my time doing or acquiring those things. sending off emails, working with and making connections through arbetsförmedlingen and sfi. 
I sent so many emails, too many to count, but maybe heard back from 2 max? I also would frequent the local and many other job sites where you could apply. Nothing!

Language barriers:

The fact and realities are that proper understanding of Swedish is key for one to get a job in Sweden. Swedes have a hard time finding work as well, so compounding a lack of Swedish does not help. 
I learned this after my girlfriend finished her higher education and began her job search, which was not so long ago. As well as experience from other Swedish friends.

Unless you are truly specializing in something that focuses mostly around English, which is usually limited to IT/Programming, then it won’t be so easy. Perhaps you could manage to get a job as an au pair or the like. 

I'm not the first, and probably won't be the last to notice that Swedes tend to be reserved, isolated and really enjoy their personal space. This was quite a cultural change from America. 

Social effect:

The first time I came to Sweden was around New Years. I met a lot of people during that time and I spent it with my girlfriend’s friends. I met a lot of people and I learned they spoke perfect english, despite them commonly apologizing for how bad their english was. 

Reflecting on that moment, I’ve noticed a lot of patterns. Swedes can speak perfect english, but due to being shy or uncomfortable about their abilities in it, they tend to prefer to speak in Swedish. Eventually, hanging around Swedes will require you to adapt, or else you will not be a part of the conversation, and your connections in Sweden will commonly not flourish. That’s just the way it is. 
Some Swedes can be super outgoing, and be willing to always speak English, i’ve met a few of those. They have actually become some of my best friends, however, even spending time with them and their friends required a bit of awkward moments due to this “language barrier”. This extends to professional settings as well, which is why Swedes will prefer to hire someone that speaks Swedish so as not to make a strange dynamic in the work setting. 

Luckily, you can help fix all this before you come here.


LEARN SWEDISH:

I implore you to do more than duolingo or rosetta stone type program.
Learn it at a school, practice with Swedes directly, or buy books to learn it. 
I found many audio books via torrents, etc. 

I also implore you to watch Swedish media as possible such as shows.

Whatever! As much humanly possible.

Start with no subtitles. I found this a humbling experience. However, it was similar to my experience with other Swedes at parties. I found I didn’t understand very much for the first year. Even after studying it with babbel and duolingo. 

You also have to remember patience. It takes years to learn a language fluently. You may think you understand the grammatical rules to Swedish. Perhaps you also think you have a good grasp on it, but its really a different experience when a new exception throws you completely off guard. As any other country, Sweden has its different types of accents, which changes how you hear words often. It can mean that people mumble more or less, speak quicker or slower, etc. Swedes tend to be lazy in pronunciation and often cut letters off words, so really, be patient. 

I sometimes feel like a 5 year old and it’s frustrating, but hang in there!

Swedes in Social settings:

After living in Sweden for all this time, I understand now that for the most part, if you're not working or studying, then you're probably at home because it's super cold outside, wet outside, dark outside, etc. This is likely a factor in the largely unsocial behaviour in Scandinavia, which equates to people standing as super far away from each at bus stops, on the bus or in public places. You’ll also generally see most youth with headphones in, and that works here. Most people won’t bother you. However, please keep in mind that if you do need help just ask for it. People are keen to help and be helpful, even if they don’t want to become your friend immediately. 
It really makes a difference when you take sun out of the human equation. People have less energy, are less happy and can quite easily become depressed. 

However, Swedes have the perfect solution for this. ALCOHOL!
I've never seen a night and day difference between a group of people. I work in a bar often, and i’ve seen people drink and become social butterflies. I also have been to house parties, and other events, where the same kind of applies. I don’t want to over generalize, but these are just observations i’ve made.

However, if you don’t like to drink, such as myself, that can be problematic, since that’s basically one of the only things to do in the evenings. Nearly all social settings here will require it, especially if its in the Winter, since there isn’t a nice summer stuga to go visit or nice weather. 

Finding work :

Swedes like a Swedish education, when it comes to looking at names on a resume. 
I had read about it on articles other ex-pats had written, and received confirmation and impression that it true by asking other people and friends i’ve met.. I’ve also read several doctorates regarding immigrants and education and it does seem to be incredibly influential.

So after a year of living in Sweden, I applied for my masters and I was approved. I had no intentions of ever doing this, but my girlfriend felt it was the best move, and due to lack of finding work it seemed like a good option, as opposed to just sitting around and only learning Swedish via babbel and duolingo (since I had completed the joke that is, SFI) and applying for jobs that never came.

A side note, another thing vital to a resume is a körkort. It seems silly, but its one of the way to weed out people. Of course it doesn’t apply to all jobs, but if you want a professional top job i’m fairly certain it’ll make a difference. 

We moved back to my sambo’s hometown after she finished school and the search for work continued for the both of us. 

I remain studying, and have gotten to the third Swedish language course at my university. 
She works in the service industry full time and I work as a bar tender from time to time for a little extra cash. I’ve also done a short unpaid internship with a media firm, where the above scenarios in a professional setting applied. Unpaid internships are super common in Sweden, as they are all over.

Housing crisis:

Now there is still something I have not even discussed about moving to “larger” cities, which includes gothenburg, stockholm, uppsala and mälmo. There is a housing crisis in Sweden. The word crisis may not sound like its a big deal, but when people are waiting 2,000 to 20,000+ days for a first hand contract on an apartment in Uppsala, it most certainly is a crisis.

Unless, you’ve lived in the cities for a long time and have been queued up on the cities housing developments websites, you’re not likely to get a 1st hand contract. So that means you’re dealing with a 2nd hand contract. Perhaps someone will rent our their places for 2, 3, 6 months. Sometimes furnished, sometimes not. There are so many variables, but finding a place is not simple. 

One hour it will be available on blocket.se or on facebook housing groups, and the next it won’t. 
People are constantly in need, so when they are available they usually get taken super quick. Those will be the most valuable tools in finding a place, although I implore you to search for more depending on your personal situation.

I’m not going to discuss cost much, because it varies on what you’re looking for and if you’re a student. However, it is not uncommon for a 1 bedroom apartment that is around 40 sq meters to cost  7000 krowns to 10000+ krowns. The fact that the person that holds the contract cannot over charge also makes it even more competitive, because throwing extra cash at a 1st contract holder will not allow them to choose you over another legally.

Cost of living:

A cheap chinese or indian to go meal will generally cost around 120 sek per person. If you want to sit in, have a drink and a full meal, you can tack on an extra 100 sek per person. 

I live in a city where I bike, but back home I drove everywhere. 

Gas is around 1.69 dollar per gallon for premium gas back home.
Where I live on average its around 11-12 kr.

When converted from gallon to liter and adjusted for currency that is about:

12 kr for premium per liter in sweden vs 2,27 kr for premium per liter in american city I lived in.

So fuel is between 5-6 times more expensive here than where I lived in America. 
I wanted to talk about that, because that cost in living effects everything. Clothes, food, etc. 
If you come and are wanting to drive then you must account for an increase in car maintenance, car insurance, etc. 


You must support yourself:

When Sweden approves your temporary uppehållstillstånd, you are not really guaranteed the social net that the social democratic welfare provides. So you need to be able to support yourself during this time. Luckily you still have access to the health services and have nearly the same rights as any average Swede would. 

I could go on about what else you need to do to prepare, but for those wondering if they should come or not, I can only stress that you need to really make yourself mentally prepared. 
Ready yourself for the culture shock, the inevitable ups and downs you will go through due to the changes, loneliness, coldness, lack of sun, the loss and distancing of old best friends, family you had back home, etc.

It’s quite a journey. Things are not super easy in Sweden, but no place is perfect. 

If you have questions, etc, feel free to ask!

48gxdo,20,2016-03-01,My (27m) wife (26f) gave $500 to her sister for rent without telling me,InLawDramarama,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/48gxdo/my_27m_wife_26f_gave_500_to_her_sister_for_rent/,"I’m back to this throwaway account again, lucky me! Wife and I have been married for just under two months and I just spoke to her on the phone during lunch to learn she gave her family $500 to cover the rent for their house, let’s call it Park House (2 bedroom apartment) and wanted to give them $200 to cover the rent for this month. We’ve just bought a 3 bedroom house, let’s call it Straight House. She says she didn’t tell me because she didn’t want to stress me out. BS! There's a number of factors that contribute to why I'm really mad. Every time I think about this and the way I found out, I get angry. Typing this out now, I’m fuming! Ok, so let’s get some facts for the sane people of reddit to give me perspective… 1.) She has a younger brother in first year of college, living away on campus (only home for the summer)... 2.) She has two younger sisters, one is away on internship in other country for a couple of months (not sure how permanent it may be), the other lives in Park House and does not make enough to cover the rent of this fancy 2 bedroom flat. 3.) Her parents do not live in this country and only come here 2/3 times a year…. 4.) I’ve reduced my hours at work for the last few weeks to spend more time on a catering business project I’m setting up. She’s quite passionate about the business too, but really it’s my baby and I come with 90% of the ideas etc…


So, I had an important mini-launch event this weekend just gone. As part of my reduced wages, we agreed she would pay our mortgage this month. I usually pay the mortgage so she’s asked for the payment details so she can pay it. She sent me a message this morning asking for me to hurry up with the information before money goes out of her account for other stuff. It was quite an urgent message where she said “shit was going on in her family” so I made a point to bring it up in our usual lunch-break conversation. She said on the phone that once she paid for the mortgage there would be barely anything left in her account so, I was a bit shocked and asked her where exactly the rest of the money was going out to. I had to draw it out a bit but she finally revealed that she had paid $500 to her parents who couldn’t afford the rent in Park House the month before and was planning on giving them $200 to help them pay the rent this month. I blew up and told her we would talk about it in more depth when I got home later.


I’m so angry and upset. Since November/December I knew this would happen and have always said it was financially silly for her family to try and pay for Park House. Apologies in advance if the money doesn’t phase you but combined with my reduced wages and investment in the new business and then, just based on the principle of it… I’m really upset and its money we can't afford to give out. It puts us on the bare minimum and following the wedding and other bits and bobs, we're far from in the black at the moment. FYI, she has a poor credit rating, my credit rating is very good. Also, for our culture/religious background, we practice a more traditional style of marriage…or at least I hoped… and feel this massively undermines me and what we agreed. To be fair, the rent for Park House is relatively cheap for that kind of house/location but still, it’s something her family always struggle to pay for. I would rather the family stayed with us at Straight House whenever they needed to, than we paid rent to Park House. She did apologise on the phone for not telling me about it and said she didn't want to stress me out in the lead up to the mini-launch event. But I don't really buy it and after a few seconds she said we should move pass the conversation as she's already apologised...which is typical of her and is a sign to me that she hasn't 100% regretted the action. Anyway, I got off the phone and said we would talk about it later tonight....


**TLDR; Wife of 2 months reveals she gave $500 to her family to cover rent of a nice 2 bedroom flat for her family. Only one sister has been living there recently. Brother is away at college and other family are out of country for forseeable future. She didn't tell me because she didn't want to ""stress me out"". She apologised (thought not 100% owned it) on phone, but not sure how to move forward. Big conversation show down coming up this evening. Want to come out of it with best possible outcome**


Extra info: I'm pretty well-adjusted and mature when dealing with things and honestly, if she told me, it would not have stressed me out, phased me or push me over the edge. Also, before we got married and bought our house, I lived with my brother and sister in what we’ll call Lake House, which was a 4 bedroom house. Back in Nov/Dec, my family offered her family the chance to use one of the rooms for next to nothing. They refused, basically because of pride. FML.

Edit: OK. Sooo much lost in translation. I don't need to argue with a bunch of Internet strangers, especially on a throwaway account, but I will just leave this... Yes, we aim to practice a more conservative type of Christianity which says two become one so there's no her and my finances...it's ours! When she makes decisions on our money without consulting me, captain or not, that's not nice or in-keeping with us being one. Money coming from her account or mine are technicalities. I went part time at work as a joint decision! All these inferences based off of the captain thing are so wild and off the mark. I obviously know the truth, which is a lot more nuanced than you can get in a post so I'll take the fair comments on the chin but 80% of you reactionary idiots can move on!"

What's the protocol now?,ChaosCon,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/48gxsk/google_asked_for_my_resume_whats_the_protocol_now/,"So, a little background: I'm a physicist working on a dual PhD in physics and electrical engineering. Back at the beginning of February, a Google recruiter emailed me more-or-less out of the blue saying

&gt;If you are open to new career opportunities, please respond with a copy of your resume and your preferred Google office location. This way we can match you to potential teams that fit your skill set.

I haven't finished school yet, but I *am* very interested in discussing internship/career opportunities with them so I took a couple days to tighten up my resume before sending it off. Two weeks ago I got a confirmation email (from a human, not a robot!) thanking me and saying

&gt;A Recruiter will be in touch with you shortly if we have a position that is a match with your qualifications. They will reach out to you to discuss potential career opportunities at Google.

And now here I am waiting to see what happens. A couple things on my mind:

1. I'm **not** a computer scientist (I just play one on tv!) but I've got a very strong background in it *as it applies to my problem domain*. I can tell you all about z-order trees and fast electrodynamics algorithms and monte carlo ising models, but I'm really worried I don't know some ""obvious"" bit of CS stuff that'll totally sink me, should they want me. Is this a valid fear?
2. It's been two weeks since I've heard from them; are we past ""shortly?"" Would they even contact me at all if they don't want me? Should I contact them now? Wait a bit?
3. If things go the way I want them to, I'm most interested in doing an internship this coming fall, then finishing school, then kind of seeing what happens from there (depending on if I like them/they like me in the internship, where I see myself applying my skills, etc.) Is this an idea that would significantly influence (either positively or negatively) any of their thoughts about me as a candidate?

All in all I'm pretty excited that they're even interested in me at all -- I *never* thought anything like this would become part of ""the plan."" It's just a very nervewracking experience because it's so different from the academic climate I'm used to. Hence my asking for advice :)"

What would be the best way to spend my free weekends in terms of helping my med school 'resume' (besides hanging out with friends - i'll already reserve time for that).

So far I have 1 research article that i was co-authored for.
My ideas for now are:

- try to find a lab in my university that will let me volunteer only on weekends, or even weekday evenings (because my internship job is only 10 mins from my university)

- use weekends to study for mcat (but i have lots of time for that anyway)
- work part time at a 2nd job (mainly because my parents earn close to minimum wage and they've poured most of their earnings so far to my brother's and mine education so i thought this could be a little extra cash on the side to help out)
- or just find some other place to volunteer (eg a hospital)

also if you're wondering why im studying CS, well mainly because while I am passionate about medicine, even with a ~3.7ish cGPA, its very very hard to get into med schools in Canada and I need a backup plan that can help support me and family while I get medicine to work out."

Basically i'm trying to decide whether I should work up to a Senior Business Analyst type of role vs. Software Development. I like both, find both interesting, it takes me longer to program concepts, but i love the challenges. Some info about me:


Currently, I'm 25, half-way thorough University in ""Business Technology Program."" We're considered a hybrid between business side and software sides of things, have experience on both ends of the spectrum, a jack of trades is what I refer to it as. 

Currently, I work as a intern business intelligence analyst at a big Public company. (8month intern) I gather and utilize design, requirements, analysis, process improvement, scope management, and project coordination with stakeholders. I work cross-functionally with every department (engineers, I/T, supply chain, procurement, inventory managers, and project managers). I analyze vast amounts of data daily, prepare reports for senior level Execs, and spot anomalies in data. I took it upon myself to learn VBA and automate reporting (300 lines of code, felt very impressed), made queries in Access, Pivot Table for proof of concept and analysis, and minor SQL experience (company won't allow SQL server for me). I enjoy the project management side of things, managing teams, working cross-functionally, essentially being the ""glue"" between teams and achieving required objectives. I have experience in Java/SQL/ and Python (personal learning).







My question is:

1. Should I get a project management certification and work in the BA field? Work up to Senior BA --&gt; Project Manager?

2. Go into the I/T side of things, do more development and software testing, create applications to interface backend databases. (develop my Java/SQL/ and Python programming further?) 

I have such a strong passion for both project management, data analytics and I/T/programming and just confused where to specialize in. I don't want to move into another BA role, and my next intern role comes in September (4 months), really trying to figure out how to best move on from a business intelligence analyst is. 


I feel like at 25, i really need to figure out what direction of the Business technology world I want to go into. I feel like I should have accomplished a lot more. Probably putting stress on myself, but just looking for advice.





Current Skill-set:
•	Data Analytics (Access queries, pivot tables, SQL, excel, Vlookups etc.)
•	MySQL (self taught, beginner level)
•	Python (self taught beginner level)
•	Android Programming (currently self teaching myself)
•	Java (beginner, educated from Academics/personal learning)

48hkzh,4,2016-03-01,"Looking for some perspective on whether or not to end my relationship with my (21, F) SO (22, M)",snapple1234,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/48hkzh/looking_for_some_perspective_on_whether_or_not_to/,"Hi r/relationships! I'm just looking for some advice as to whether or not I should continue my relationship with my SO or move on. Sorry if this is all over the place, I'm just really not sure what to do. I'm not close to that many people so I don't really have anyone to talk to, hence why I'm posting here. 

We've been together for 2 and a half years. This is both of our first real relationships so I don't have a lot of experience with romantic relationships. We were introduced 2.5 years ago and have been pretty much inseparable ever since. I'll start by saying some positive things about our relationship, followed by our issues.

Positive: We're both introverts and I love that we both understand each others social struggles. He's super goofy and lets me be a weirdo too. I feel totally comfortable and relaxed with him, I know if I say something stupid he'd never make fun of me or be mean. I love cooking with him and just hanging out. He really loves me and I know he'd do anything for me. 

Issues: He can be controlling at times. When we first got together I had some issues with partying too much and in general needed to grow up. He helped me get myself together and start taking responsibility for my own actions. So initially this was a positive, but I've grown up a lot since we first got together (moved to a big city for a semester of school pretty much alone and survived just fine) and I don't need him babysitting me anymore. He doesn't like how I dress or how I do my makeup a lot of the time (I've gotten more into avant garde makeup looks lately, dark lipstick and what not, so I admit this is different than the light makeup I wore when we first got together) and he'll refuse to go out with me until I change. He has anger issues and tends to get agitated easily. It's never escalated to violence, but being with someone who is on edge a lot is exhausting. 

Why I'm thinking about possibly ending it:

1. I think we don't push each other enough. Like I said, we're both introverts, him more than me, and we don't really help each other get better when it comes to social interaction and just making small talk. 

2. I have two semesters of school left and I need to be pushing myself more. I spend a lot of time just chilling with him and not really getting anything done. I know this is something I need to work on independently, but I think we're just co-dependently lazy. I would like to better myself and it would probably be easier if I was single.

3. We've been together for 2.5 years and I just don't know if I'm up for another year. I am not thinking about marriage at all, but  I can't see us getting married. We're very different and I'm not sure if we could plan a life together/ share finances. 

4. This is probably the main reason.  I'm 21, and I've only got one more year of school left. I'd like to have fun my last year and explore other options more. This might sound insensitive, but it would suck if I spent my last year of college with him and got more invested only to break up later. He's the only man I've ever had a relationship with and while I love us I can't help but wonder what I could be missing out on. Recently I ran into an old friend who'd moved to NYC for her career. She just broke up with her long time bf and is having a great time exploring her options sexually and career-wise. I can't help but feel jealous. My bf and I are both currently working 9-5 internships and we pretty much come home, cook dinner, watch netflix, and go to bed. That's about it. I just feel like I'm missing out on my youth. I know its not healthy to compare your life to someone else, someone who might be neglecting to say how lonely she gets or how much she wishes she had someone to share her experiences with, but even though I know this I still feel like my life is very dull. 

So what do you think? Should we break up or am I throwing away something good? I love him but I don't know if this relationship is right for me anymore. 

**tl;dr In at 2.5 year relationship, mostly happy but not sure whether or not to end it because I've been feeling like we're codependent and dull.**"

I'm a Chemistry major and just some background to the kind of person I am, in highschool I was the dumbest, laziest, unmotivated fuck in school up until junior year. The counselor stuck me in 3 ap classes, 1 being Ap Chem. I've heard all kinds of things about it and people would laugh at the thought of me attempting the class, let alone Ap. Long story short, I worked my ass off, I failed dozens of times but I learned and grew, I was so successful I raised my gpa up to a 3.9 senior year by getting 4.2-5.0s my last two years, I was the only student to pass the Ap chem test with a 4. I didn't socialize whatsoever and I was pretty much in my room if I wasn't at school. I bought my own gym equipment so I just went to my basement, therefore I had LOADS of time to study and do HW, and I was happy doing just that (at the time). I went straight to college to study chemistry and I also started working at target a month before school. First semester was shit, second was amazing, summer and this past autumn was bad because my girlfriend left me in June and I didn't take it so well.. 

Moving on to now, my GPA is a 2.6 right now and I'm taking Majors OChem 2, Analytical Chem, and calc based physics 2. I was working full time last semester but I knew the semester would be hard and my grades the previous semester weren't so hot so I dropped my lab and hours at work to have 14 credit hours and about 15-20 hours at work. Now this is what I was writing to my Ochem professor,

""I'm not quite even sure how to tell you how I'm feeling but I am absolutely failing the class right now. I've never done this bad before, I've failed and picked myself up, I've grown so much up until this point in my life, and I've done amazing things by being persistent and optimistic no matter what, but I have never been the guy that brings the average down so much it looks scary. Without me, the graphs for the class would look so much more even. And honestly, without saying anything scary, I hope you understand how that makes me feel exactly. I've been working since I came into college, and I've done alright and started to get the hang of it, but apparently cutting my hours in half and being broke all semester isn't enough to be average in your class, and it's too late to put in my two weeks now and try to fix this mess.  I also teach taekwondo classes twice a week here which takes up about 6 hours. I dropped the lab for the semester so I could focus on your class, analytical chem, and physics 1251 but clearly it hasn't helped. There shouldn't be an excuse, I'm sure other students in the class are having it harder. Sir I want to improve and get better but I just don't see it, everyone else is beyond ahead of me and it's extremely difficult to find time for OChem. I stay up til 2-5 every day depending on when my morning class starts and it's all just to finish HW for other classes or rushing to attempt your lecture preps. I mean it takes me almost 1.5-2 hours for your lecture preps, and sometimes I'd feel better off skipping them and using that time to study, I don't know! Of course there are other things in my life that are bothering me and holding me back, but I know you don't care for more excuses. I love chemistry but Organic Chem is uninteresting to me and I honestly can't bring myself to be so passionate about it and passion is what drives me to learn. I'm not sure what to do sir, I'd like advice because I don't want to give up but do you think I should just withdraw? It's not like HS, this will be on my record forever but I'm not sure what to do, I'm willing to work hard but with all my constraints it's difficult"" 

I stopped typing and just figured I come to a place where I could let out how I really feel right now. After my girlfriend left me it took me almost 9 months to get out of depression, and I'm confident she's not in the way anymore for me to grow as a person. I'm interested in a girl right now and she makes me so happy, we have so much in common and we get along so well, she means a lot to me. I know teaching classes, going to the gym, socializing with my friends and all the thinking I have about this girl is taking up so much of my time, but if there's one thing I learned in my life, it's that make sure you're happy, even just a little bit. I honestly almost ended my life 2 times in those 9 months and every single day, the majority of my thoughts were spent thinking about horrible things. I never thought it would end, and then the semester started and I started to pick myself up big time and the girl I like has helped me a bit as well which is why she means a lot to me, it seemed crazy to me. I haven't been this motivated since back in high school when everyone doubted me and I proved them all wrong by becoming one of the top students. I don't want to just cut off my relationship with her, maybe my friends and work, but I can't just cut if off with her and try to talk to her again after like 3 months, I feel like she really likes me and I REALLY like her, I feel like it will ruin the relationship we have right now and possibly just end it.

The problem is I started to fall behind so fast in Ochem and Physics it's scaring me. The first midterm i got a 65/200 and the average was about a 65% but obviously me and a couple other students are outliers so far to the left of the graphs. Like I said in my email, I've failed, I've done bad, but I am consistently getting the LOWEST grade in all my quizzes and midterms. Physics I can fix, but Ochem, there are people getting 110%s and 100s on all the quizzes and midterms. Last semester my professor curved the class so  much I went from a 50% to a B, but that was because I had average/ slightly above average grades. I stay up every day, like I said, usually just trying to finish online HW or lab reports, and that helps me learn, but my classes need so much more time dedicated to learn. I'm trying my best but the reason why I didn't want to email him was because almost every day I'm handed back a quiz that makes me die inside. I'm a science major so I'm used to it, but it's weird, now I'm not average or better. Not even slightly, now I'm the worst score, and it's not because I'm dumb, I know I'm not stupid, but even the stupid kids in the class are doing better because they have the time to do problems and go over as much material as the professor provides them. I only have so much time to do what I can but it's not enough. I've been sad maybe even depressed over my grades before, but this is beyond what I can handle, it's killing me inside, I feel like my life is ruined at this point (sorry if I'm exaggerating)  but I don't want to turn to something else, I want to go into physical therapy or perhaps I do change my mind, the things I'm interested in require a great GPA. I thought about getting my PhD while teaching HS, I don't know, theres so many options, but I want to be something great, and right now I don't see why the girl I like would consider me in the long run if I'm not my greatest. Even if she likes me for who I am, she deserves someone great and I have that potential, I just can't get my shit together. I've done amazing things and I'm hard working, but these classes simply just need time. I'm trying to balance my grades, sleep, work, gym, and social life as best as I can, but If I'm not on top of it all, then I am failing. I have no one to help me except my adviser and I don't have time to talk to him, I don't have time for anything! If I had more time than I did to write this post I'd go see a therapist but I'm just writing this before my next lecture.

I have my next midterm next Monday and I don't have a lot of time this week to catch up, but I'm confident if I study hard from today I will get around average, but I just don't feel like that's enough, what if I fail again? So what if I get average this time? My GPA is still shit, and I just don't see myself doing something amazing like I did in HS with this class, OChem is the most uninteresting thing I've come across in my life. I love chemistry so I'm trying to accept Ochem but I'm not passionate for it.. I can't get any internships or get any nice scholarships because my gpa is disgusting and I'm scared I won't get into any Grad school I want. I went from pharmacy to physical therapy now. I want to be happy, and I want to work the rest of my life doing something that makes me happy and I want to spend it with someone I love. I do a lot of extracurricular, and research is in my mind, getting a Psych minor is too, I have a lot of things in mind, but I feel like none of that will matter if I fail Ochem and I just don't want to consider retaking it, I REALLY want to just pick myself up but at the moment I'm literally the bottom of the barrel in the class. I think the last day to withdraw is coming up so I feel pressured but I don't want to give up! I'm a stubborn guy and it's never threatened me like this before. I want to write so much, I want to go on and on (as if I haven't already) I want to write about everything that bothers me but I think I've said enough, I just want advice, reassurance, anything.. 

Please be nice, I know I've left a lot room to be made fun of or criticized but the last thing I want is more things putting me down. Sorry if theres any bad grammar or spelling I'm just rushing this because I need to study.."
48ht1p,3,2016-03-01,How is the Mechanical Engineering course at Bristol?,Skatchan,UOB,https://www.reddit.com/r/UOB/comments/48ht1p/how_is_the_mechanical_engineering_course_at/,"Hi there!

I'm a prospective engineering student and I need to make a decision on which uni I want as my first choice before the 4th of May. I have offers from Bristol, Bath, Oxford and Manchester. I'm fairly confident of getting the grades for any of the universities I have offers for, though since Manchester is asking for the lowest grades (AAA) I'll probably put them as my backup.

That leaves me with deciding which of Bristol, Bath or Oxford I want to put as my firm choice. I know many people would automatically choose Oxford but the high intensity environment worries me a little.

It'd be super helpful if you could give me answers to some questions, go ahead and answer whatever course you're on.

How many hours a day would you say you spend on lectures, labs and independent work? 

Have you noticed any interest from companies looking for graduate engineers or have you found it reasonably easy to get an internship?
To try and get a feel for the difficulty of the course, how did you find A level? For me the first year was very easy but this past year the difficulty has stepped up considerably, though I think I'm on top of it now. 

Where do you think I should go?

Thanks for your help!"

48i8ia,23,2016-03-01,[RANT] Why encryption matters in everyday life (besides just finance),floam412,Monero,https://www.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/48i8ia/rant_why_encryption_matters_in_everyday_life/,"So a little disclaimer to anyone who doesn't know, but I'm working through an internship to work in the field of Cardiology (not a residency to be a doctor, but what I'm going for really doesn't matter)... So obviously this is a complete 180 from the occupations that most people who frequent this board have; since a large majority of people deal with computers for their job and deal with this subject pretty much all day long.  I know we like to think of encryption only useful for finance through things like Monero, Bitcoin, etc; but I would like to give some arguments that show why encryption is important and can literally save someone’s life.

We were touching on a topic about pacemakers today, and that sparked a type of realization that I hope to share with you guys today.  I’ll start on this topic and diverge into other aspects of everyday life.

Pacemakers were very simple devices back in the day (around 1950s) and they were very big.  Through what we can do with modern technology, we have been able to create pacemakers that are much smaller and WAY more sophisticated.  

Pacemakers are used when the “natural pacemaker” of the heart, the SA node, stops firing or is significantly hindered (there are natural “backups” in place) to send signals to the heart’s muscles to tell them to contract properly.  Now and days, pacemakers are capable of figuring out when to stimulate the heart faster or slower, depending if the body is exercising or not.  It is even capable of shutting itself off when need be if the SA node decides to be compliant and starts working again on its own, when then, the only thing the pacemaker is there for is to monitor the rhythm and back up the SA node when it stops working. *Bear with me here, I’m getting to the point*.

Pacemakers can now send signals to apps on your phone via bluetooth or wifi to give you updates on the device itself, lets you know how much battery life you have, etc.  With some pacemaker companies, they can monitor your device for you and get in touch with you if they think there is something wrong with the device.  This requires the ability to get in contact with your pacemakers specific serial number and monitors the activity. 

Back in 2013, former US Vice President, Dick Cheney, said that there was a great deal of concern from his Doctor, the FDA (I’m sure CIA too), and more importantly from him as well, the possibility of his pacemaking device being hacked.  This threat had him fearing for his very life; the possibility of someone getting control of his pacemaker through the Internet of Things (IoT), and being able to deliver a fatal dose of stimulus became very real.

http://www.cnn.com/2013/10/20/us/dick-cheney-gupta-interview/

https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2012/10/03/medical-device-hacking-fda-are-told-to-start-taking-it-seriously/

This can be said for a number of different stuff as well, as stated in the second article I posted above.  A number of medical devices are susceptible to these kind of attacks, whether they are pacemakers, insulin pumps, etc. 

A quote from that article:

&gt;No security incidents have to date been the result of intentional action, but the input of researchers has the FDA convinced that as devices grow more sophisticated, the risks are worth taking into account.
The GAO outlined risk vectors and potential outcomes, including:

&gt;* Limited battery capacity: Can hinder the power-sucking security features, making the devices susceptible to an attack that would drain the battery and render the device inoperable.

&gt;* Remote access: Could be exploited by a malicious actor.

&gt;* Continuous use of wireless communication: Could create a point of entry for unauthorized users to modify the device, especially if continuously enabled.

&gt;* Unencrypted data transfer: Can be manipulated. For example, an attacker could modify data that is not securely transmitted and alter information used in administering therapy (such as insulin dosing).

&gt;* Susceptibility to electromagnetic (e.g., cellular) or other types of unintentional interference.

&gt;* Limited or nonexistent authentication process (such as requiring a password) and authorization procedures: Could leave medical devices susceptible to unauthorized activities, such as changes to the devices’ settings.

&gt;* Disabling of warning mechanisms: If these mechanisms were disabled, a patient would not be alerted if unauthorized modifications were made to the device, such as that McAfee’s Jack demonstrated with the Medtronic insulin pump.

&gt;* Design based on older technologies: Such devices might not have been designed with security as a key consideration.

&gt;* Inability to update or install security patches: which, in certain medical devices, could prevent identified software defects from being addressed.

So it really isn’t that farfetched that encryption could possibly save someone’s *life*.  Again, I know we like to only think of encryption as something to secure financial privacy and anonymity; but the need for encryption is literally everywhere you look.  Whether it’s to protect from getting hacked on your iPhone, Car, Logistical information of where you are going, who you voted for this election, etc; the need for encryption *against* the bad guys has never been more clear.  Governments will insinuate that encryption has only shady uses for criminals to get away with crimes… when in all reality we need encryption to *protect* us from crimes these criminals want to do.

I know there are some cons with encryption in some specific cases that the government will bring up some (Ex: the supposed funding of terrorist that shot up people in Paris); but the way I see it there are way more pros than cons when regarding the beneficial uses for devices and things to be encrypted, so that only *you* can control what you send and receive.  This includes what Monero is doing, in that *you* can either keep your transactions private from prying eyes, or *you* can make them public for one transaction or all of them.

So let’s treat the Monero project as something more than just finance, more than just some “get quick rich scheme”, more than a mechanism to gamble anonymously or day trade; let’s instead treat this project as the starting point of developing a sort of technology that can revolutionize how we send money or *information* in general, in a completely *private and decentralized* manner that can be used by anyone or quite potentially any device that is sending crucial information from point A to point B in a safe and secure way.

Edit #1: formatting


Edit #2: Fun facts.... Cardiology works similarly to Monero or Bitcoin, in that there are **actual** nodes placed all over the body to detect and verify pressure changes, chemical imbalances/amount of oxygen in blood, etc. that send signals back to the heart to serve the main function of telling the heart to perform in a *certain way* in certain situations of stress, exercise, relaxation, and so on. 

Kinda like... sort of like... *dynamic block sizes*

There you go guys... Mind = Blown"
48iisn,19,2016-03-01,Why does it take my dog so long to warm up to strangers?,Lauren55G,Dogtraining,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/48iisn/why_does_it_take_my_dog_so_long_to_warm_up_to/,"We adopted our schnauzer mix about a year and a half ago (our best guess is he's about 4 years old) and immediately hired a trainer to work with him as he shows definite reactivity to stimuli -- other dogs, motorcycles, some strangers, etc. In the time we've had him, we have come great strides and developed a lot of tactics for managing his behavior, including introducing him to strangers--some through genuine training, others through calming mechanisms like his Thundershirt and Herbsmith calming pills. That said, there is one area that I continue to struggle with figuring out his reactivity and I haven't found a great solution. 

He comes to work with me which I *know* is such an amazing opportunity, and I have a baby gate up that I keep in my immediate office to contain him. (If UPS or another stranger comes in the office, he runs at them barking... never bitten anyone, but I want to ensure he doesn't. It's worth noting that the gate may be a cause of frustration for him sometimes, however.) We have a fairly small office, 8 employees, but we have interns that rotate in and out every semester and this varies from 2 people a semester to 5 this current semester. It's with the interns that he will still occasionally bark at them or seem anxious.

The current strategy I have to introduce him to strangers is have them ignore him entirely for a good while (it's worked wonderfully with other strangers outside of my office, like when my in-laws came to stay with us)--for the interns, I say at least for the first day or two they are in the office. I let him sniff the interns (assuming they are comfortable with this, of course!) and eventually let them interact, trying to have the interns give him treats (but not too many, because with one batch of interns we tried this and then he seemed to just be barking at them for treats!). The problem is, despite meeting them and familiarizing himself with their presence, he still barks at them if they come too close to my immediate office door, or go from sitting to standing near him. 

At this point in the year, for example, it's hard for me to call them ""strangers"" to him because the current batch of interns has come to the office 3 days a week since January, yet he still demonstrates discomfort with them. 

Anyways, I know I'm extremely fortunate having him come with me to work and having colleagues and interns who are comfortable with him, but I recognize his barking can be problematic and I don't want to lose the ability to have him come to the office (or worse, have him actually bite someone.) Any tips or ideas about how to familiarize him more quickly? "

I was interested in University of Tampa's BS Cyber Security program, but after some research, found out that I'm better off just doing basically any computer-based degree (and UT is so expensive). Ultimately decided on USF, but not entirely sure which degree is the better choice. From what I've seen, MIS is ""better"", but that's only after some very quick research. Since I'm in a business major atm, I've taken a few courses that are needed in the MIS program, so I've gotten some out of the way. 

I'm fairly well-versed when it comes to computers and technology in general, and a lot of the careers in both IT/MIS are interesting to me. Will I be in a good position after graduating such as finding a job and a decent salary from either program (USF's website states the average entry level position for an MIS major major makes $30,000-$50,000, while I've seen people state that it's usually $50,000+)?

I'm writing this to my resident techxperts to inquire about possible  internships for minorities in the DMV area.   I mentor minority students in the area and we have been reaching out to companies far and wide to try and place them somewhere but haven't been having much luck.   Unfortunately, without some sort of connection or in, it's hard to get your resume to really shine despite how great of a candidate you may be in person.    

  I have mentors of all colors and creed and know that I couldn't have made it through law school on my own, so I am doing my best to give back. I know that there aren't a lot of minorities on reddit in general but the great thing about the DMV is that, in my opinion, it is a great example of what the melting pot that is the USA has to offer so I hoped I may be able to find some success here.   

I have 3 students currently looking for summer internships.  One in Comp Sci, one in ESNP and one in marketing.  They all have prior internship experience but are really looking for an internship where they can more thoroughly develop themselves as adults.  Any advice or direction would be much appreciated.

CHARACTER | 22
-----|-----
Name | Whitaker Myska
Age | 32; 7th day of 5th month
Gender | Male
Symbol | A sleeping mouse with the tail fanning into strings of a marionette.
Occupation | White Fang Chief Technology Director
Appearance | Whitaker is a tall, blind albino rat faunus – though he’s referred to as a mouse because of his brothers.  He’s 5’11” with a pretty thick build.  White hair and pale eyes sit over a long nose.  A set of goggles, more reminiscent of binoculars, sit upon his face most of the time.  This houses cameras of different varieties that give a wide field of view and a range of light spectrums.  A white furred tail hangs from his back, a rattail of hair over his back.  His clothing is a blend between the White Fang outfit and a lab coat.  He walks with a white long cane to detect obstacles.
History | The younger brother of the prophetic mouse, [Lloyd Myska](https://www.reddit.com/r/RWBYOC/comments/2h75o6/lloyd_myska/), Whitaker was in the world’s circle of attention without knowing.  He grew up as a blind child always fiddling with the cool electronics his older brother managed to get.  Despite being blind, he quickly learned to take some things apart, as well as put them back together.  He always had an interest in them; how they worked; how they were made.  His semblance, upon discovery, allowed him to have a lot of fun with this, helping him advance his knowledge.  Like his brother, he was brilliant.  Like his brother, he became someone of interest to a great many people.  Lloyd made sure his brothers didn’t have to work while he did, enjoying a good education and the free time to pursue their interests.  Whitaker always looked into devices such as scrolls, codices, and similar smart devices beginning to proliferate throughout the culture.  It wasn’t easy for him, as Menagerie got everything imported, often with later dates and higher prices than the human kingdoms such as Vale and Mistral.  Even so, as Lloyd increased the money coming in and allowed more and more advanced technology to fall into his hands, he furthered his understanding further and further.  Access to the world wide networks allowed him to learn even more.  He found offers for jobs or internships left and right, though his brother advised him against them.  See, these was the repercussions of Lloyd being someone every major organization and government wanted.  If they couldn’t have him, maybe they could have his brothers – [Blaine](https://www.reddit.com/r/RWBYOC/comments/485ma3/blaine_myska/), the youngest, would also face such solicitation.  Whitaker began to avoid the public eye for this reason, becoming somewhat of a recluse.  When Lloyd became obsessive over his visions, he stood by him in support of his actions, despite the repercussions for the family.  As the money stopped coming in, various debts were racked up, and the family became subject to more open and threatening forms of solicitation, Whitaker’s view of things shifted.  He stood by his brother to the end, only leaving on that final night in frustration that his brother wouldn’t even attempt to fight.  He met the infiltrating members of the White Fang, guiding them to Blaine and leaving.  When they were blamed for killing Lloyd, he and Blaine knew the truth.  The two decided to join the White Fang’s fight for faunus rights, beginning to see the attack as an act of faunus racism – or so he claimed.  He weaseled in with everyone, cautious to the end.  He became angry and violent, beginning to push just about everyone away aside from necessary or logical dealings.  He sided with [Auratus](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6fybgRbo36QaUZ6UlhrcS1DRGc/edit?usp=sharing) during the coup, securing his current position as CTO.  He appears dedicated to the cause, but others have their doubts.
Personality | Cautious, short-tempered, and vindictive, Whitaker isn’t one of the most pleasant of people to be around.  He’s become extremely manipulative since his brother’s death, as well as cynical.  One of the biggest supporters of the White Fang’s new methods, he has become merciless in his efforts to seek violence against mankind.  However, the source of this is more personal.  He cared about his brother deeply – looked up to him, nearly worshipped him.  In his eyes, the World Government is to blame for what happened to Lloyd – from the life-ruining obsession to his assassination.  It is suspected he only intends to use the White Fang as a method to achieve some measure of vengeance.
Strength |  Whitaker, like all of the Myska’s, is brilliant.  His semblance is incredibly versatile, especially for someone with as much knowledge of various devices as him.
Weakness | Whitaker is a technician, not a warrior.  He cannot fight directly.  His blindness is an obvious handicap.  He is immobile and somewhat unresponsive when using his semblance.  He’s also got a pretty short temper, which can cloud judgment and cause errors in any thought process he attempts (calculations, logical deductions, etc).
Semblance | Technomancy – remote machine access.  Through a form of astral projection, Whitaker can take direct control of any machine from a certain distance.  If they are hardwired through other things, he can chain to increase range.  This includes computer systems, factory machinery, and even droids.  The more complex the device, the more concentration is required – making it harder to “wake” him from the projection if necessary.
TOOL |
Name | Grimm Lullaby
Primary Form | A Grimm plating walking cane made to channel aura.  It helps increase the range of his remote access.  It’s very ornate with small carvings of images and words from old [nursery rhymes](http://rwbyoc.tumblr.com/tagged/rwby-nursery-rhyme).
History | As blind children, the Myska brothers were raised with many audible or physical practices (as opposed to visual).  As a young child, Lloyd would play a recording of a book of nursery rhymes to Whitaker and Blaine that their father had gotten him.  Blaine had this made for him as a gift shortly before Lloyd became obsessive.
Style |  Whitaker doesn’t really fight directly.  Whatever he can manage to do with his semblance is free game – messing with pacemakers, taking control of vehicles, fighting with androids, etc.
Trivia |  One of three “blind mice.”  Whitaker means “white field.” Myska means mouse.  The weapon name is a reference to something I made a few years ago titled Grimm’s Lullaby (no relation to RWBY). His semblance was based on “speak no evil,” myself taking that to mean action.  His symbol is based upon his semblance, being that he can control devices like a puppet.

Yes, I know it doesn't have any peripherals or an ethernet/wifi adapter, I'm hopefully getting those from my parents' computer when it dies, or if that doesn't happen before I build this I'll just find some that work.  I'm starting an internship in July, so this build is planned for a couple of months after that starts so that I have money to spare, and maybe get a part or two for my birthday.  However, I might wait for cyber monday and see if any of my parts are on sale, but I'm not sure that's something that happens.  At this point I'm just checking to see if there are any improvements to be made to the build."
48ja3w,14,2016-03-01,"Gigabyte XM300 first impressions / mini review, and comparison to Razer Deathadder",kaokao1215,MouseReview,https://www.reddit.com/r/MouseReview/comments/48ja3w/gigabyte_xm300_first_impressions_mini_review_and/,"So I just received my Gigabyte XM300 that I bought from Newegg, and I'm pretty impressed with it. A little background, I mostly play FPS games, and I play CS:GO, and competitively in leagues like ESEA. 

The shape is quite similar to a Deathadder, and the best way I can describe it is a ""thinner"" Deathadder. The back of the mouse where it supports the palm of your hand is actually wider than the back of the Deathadder; however, where your fingers actually touch the mouse is noticeably narrower, and much more comfortable for me. The ""hump"" on the XM300 is slightly lower than on the Deathadder, and it tapers off more smoothly. On both sides of the XM300, there is a rubber grip which is significantly more grippy than the rubber sides on the Deathadder. The rubber grips have chevrons facing forward, and is deep enough so that dirt/dust can get trapped inside, I'll have to see how it is after a couple of days. 

On the right side of the mouse, there is a ""wing"" that sticks out towards the front of the mouse so that it is easier for you to pick up the mouse; it is similar to the Finalmouse ergo, and the Logitech G402 and G400s. Personally, I'm not a fan of the ""wing"", and would like grooves that go down where your ring and pinky finger would normally lie on the mouse (like the Microsoft Intellimouse 3.0 or Mionix Castor). 

As for the clicks, the left/right click are great, crisp and quite easy to click. The left and right click has very slightly more resistance than the Deathadder, so there shouldn't be any problems with accidental clicks. The mousewheel click is pretty standard, no issues there. As for the thumb buttons, the back thumb button (mouse4) is pretty standard, but the front mouse button (mouse5) has noticeably harder to press, not sure if it is just my mouse, or a by design. 

The mousewheel is average, with okay scroll steps, however the scroll wheel is not firmly held in place horizontally, and you can move the mousewheel left and right when you wiggle your finger on it. Also, when you pick up the mouse and shake it lightly side to side, the mousewheel rattles inside the mouse. 

Software wise, I didn't mess with it much, I just set it to 800 dpi and 1000hz for all steps, but the software looks very ""tacky"" like they got a 16 year old intern to design it, but it works, so not too much to complain about. 

**Pros:**

+pretty good shape

+good grippy rubber sides

+comes with 2 extra sets of mouse feet

+wide base to support your palm 

+good clicks 

**Cons:**

-""wing"" on right side instead of grooves for your ring/pinky finger (personal opinion)

-mouse5 somewhat hard to press

-mousewheel rattles


tldr; for 40 dollars, this is a fantastic mouse, I'd personally pick up this mouse over a Deathadder

48jacy,13,2016-03-01,"I [21M] don't know how to deal with parents who are against my engagement to my girlfriend [22F] they, however, highly approve.",yungmarriedthrowaway,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/48jacy/i_21m_dont_know_how_to_deal_with_parents_who_are/,"I am an international student from Eastern Europe, who's been living in the US for over 4 years. I am only a year away from graduation and aside a couple rough moments in college career am well on my way to a great professional career as an engineer. Being an international undergrad I am not making a lot of money, but just enough to cover some of my bills and throw a few bucks in my savings from time to time. I do have a couple hundred dollars in credit card debt, but I'm slowly paying that off without acquiring further interest. Fortunately, I have a 50% scholarship, but the rest of my tuition is covered by my family and no matter how it may affect my parents' budget, they insist on me not pulling any loans for my senior year. I am very grateful for that. 

Over a year ago I met a wonderful girl, who quickly had this engineering student realize he actually does have emotions and from there that relationship bloomed like I didn't even expect. She's been my supporter in the toughest time, she is always there for me, she loves my heritage, she is smart, gorgeous and most importantly she is the best team player any man can only want next to them. She is also a year older and is already graduated and has a job of her dreams, earning four to six times the amount I make. She's visited my home country a few times with me and my whole family adores her and especially my parents, who accepted her as almost their own daughter. On the other hand, her parents are like a copy of my parents that lives on the other face of the earth. They treat me as a family member and are extremely encouraging in our relationship, even though I grew up in a totally different culture. Both sets of parents are happy for us.

Not such a long time ago we took a big step and moved in together, simply because it felt natural to both of us as we started staying at each other's places more and more, sharing budget, cleaning and doing all of our day-to-day routine together. We wanted to do that in a respectful way and first talked to our parents. Even though her parents are of very traditional upbringing and mine are terrified of me losing focus on my school and career, they approved the move under a condition of us being serious and not treating this as a try-out. They all said that the pre-marital/pre-graduation move wouldn't be their first choice for us, but they want us to be happy and feel like our relationship influenced us in a great way. We were shocked by the positive response. However, on my side my parents strongly insisted on no marriage before my graduation and dad mentioned he would be dissapointed if I decided to propose before graduation. Both of my parents were previously married while they were teenagers, had kids and didn't pursue education later, of course, regretting about it further in life. It didn't help that my older brother also got his girlfriend of six years pregnant, which led to extremely quick engagement and marriage in his senior year of college, leading to my parents busting out nice sums of money the wedding and his college. He f-ud up his classes and barely graduated. Their combined past is now really affecting me.

My girlfriend and I both decided to get married after my graduation. Ideally we started planning to have it right after my graduation, while my parents are here in the US, so they can join us in this important step. Her parents are totally on board and are really excited for us and already said will help with any wedding planning financially and timewise and will help with anything they can in the future. At the same time, I haven't discussed anything with my parents as I know they will be against it, because of their fear for their investment in my education and career, which is rational yet not understandable for me. Being an immigrant on student visa, my prospects of staying in the US are slim unless I get a more permanent form of residenceship. My parents are encouraging me to stay in the US...and they don't realize how hard it can be. After graduation I have 65 days for either 18-month long employment in my field or I leave the country (no way I'm doing that) and also it complicates my job search I'm starting right now (I did have a couple great payed internships in the past 2 years). 

Soon it will be a year till my graduation and our potential marriage and finally my girlfriend for the first time firmly insisted on me figuring out the situation with my parents' opinion on our marriage. She wants me to concentrate on summer classes while she starts picking venues, but she doesn't want to start planning until my parents are on board. Ideally, she'd want an engagement (she doesn't care about diamonds and rocks, but would like a ring). My mom is flying in for a visit in May and I want her to be here and ideally share our happiness if we choose to get engaged. 

My parents still do float me, yet I am able to support myself in extreme case they'd choose to fully let me be on my own, yet instead of the whole deal being a negative experience I want them to participate. 

I want to propose, wanted since we decided to move in, yet the only thing that makes me hesitate is the potential conflict with parents, who I deeply care aabou and who supported me through so many moments of my life. 

Any advice on how to communicate with parents effectively and how to proceed with confidence besides I am too young for this or need to live with her a little longer to work out more? I am sure about our compatibility in financial values, routine life, conflict resolution, trust, sexual life and communication more than majority of people who I see getting married at 31 or 41. "
48jbkl,16,2016-03-01,My [23 M] girlfriend [24 F] of 3 years just broke up with me and I'm confused and looking for advice,NotAThrowawaway,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/48jbkl/my_23_m_girlfriend_24_f_of_3_years_just_broke_up/,"Throwaway because she knows my reddit account:

K and I met in college 3 years ago and hit it off.  After a month or so, she asked me if she wanted to date and I agreed. I had never been in a relationship before and she had dated twice before in high school. K broke up with the first due to poor communication and the second because she didn't want a long distance relationship when she went to college.  I later found out she had broken up with her second boyfriend a week before she asked me out.  She assured me I wasn't just a rebound and given how long we dated I agreed with her.

We have been through long distance twice ourselves, once when I was on an internship and she was at school (5 hours away) and once when we were both on summer internships (opposite sides of the country).  Those were 1.5 and 2.5 years ago and we managed to stay in touch and get through those well.

Two years ago, K started talking about marriage.  I said I didn't feel ready because we were both still getting through school. She is very religious though, and so she struggled with that. She understood how I was feeling and we agreed to talk about marriage when we were closer to graduation.  We both ended up going to Grad school so I postponed it a while longer.  I didn't want to get engaged while I was still in school, but I was planning on asking her at the end of the year when I graduated.

Last summer she mentioned that she had developed a crush on one of her coworkers [M 20], but that nothing had or would happen and I believe her completely. Then last semester she asked to spend a couple weeks apart, partly to finish a huge paper and partly to spend some time thinking about the relationship.  We got back together after 2 weeks, but I don't think that very much changed between us.

Last week we had watched a movie with friends and then went back to K's place. She was working on an assignment and I was just hanging out keeping her company.  K started sniffling and I asked her what was wrong. She said that she was feeling really stressed and emotional, so I held her and comforted her for a while. She left to clean herself up, and when she came back she said that she thought we shouldn't see each other any more.

She said that she had been feeling selfish about the relationship and that she had been going back and forth on whether she felt like she had a future with me since the last summer (when she had the crush on her coworker). She said that it was super stressful and that she couldn't stand it any more.

I was very surprised by this and I am still somewhat in shock.  We had gone to a movie that night and we had been making weekend and spring break plans earlier in the week.  Things had seemed perfectly normal and I didn't know anything was wrong until she started talking about it that night.  I also don't know what went wrong. K said that I hadn't done anything wrong and that she still loved me and she knew I loved her.

My first question is what happened that made my girlfriend break up with me; I still don't understand. She said she was going back and forth on having a future with me, so she chooses the option that guarantees we won't?  I don't know what she was looking for or what she expected, and that's frustrating.  My guess right now is that we are both growing up and doing new things (grad school, careers, etc).  I still loved who she was, but maybe she didn't love where I was going.  She still has 3 years left in school and I was planning on graduating this year. I am looking for jobs near the college and was planning on staying local to be near her, but maybe she wasn't ready for me to be ""leaving"".

Secondly, what should I be doing right now? Should I make sure she's okay, should I give her space, should we talk about it more?  I know lots of people suggest ""no contact"", is that whats best?

We both share a common friend group, one of whom is her coworker [25 M](different than the one she had a crush on).  We both still want to see these friends, but don't think I'm ready to hang out with K yet.  Any suggestions on how we can handle that?

Finally, do I have a chance to get back with her? And should I try? I've been processing this for a week and talked with friends and family. I still feel like she's who I belong with and who I want to spend my life with, but is it a good idea or am I still ?

Sorry for the huge blob of text, I'm just trying to get everything out

**tl;dr**: Girlfriend of 3 years broke up with me. What did I do wrong?  What should I do now? How do we handle shared friends? And do I have any chance to get back together?"
48jc1f,3,2016-03-01,Looking for advice from professional software engineers and/or recruiters,musicular,entp,https://www.reddit.com/r/entp/comments/48jc1f/looking_for_advice_from_professional_software/,"Hi all,

Please excuse my posting another post asking for advice within 2 days of the previous one.

So here's my situation:

- I graduated from App Academy exactly 1 year ago. (It's a Ruby on Rails web development bootcamp in San Francisco where students only pay tuition once hired as full-time software engineers, with a job placement rate above 95%. Students take 6 timed coding tests where the passing score is usually 90%, and failing any 2 tests results in dismissal from the program.) Despite the high job placement rate, App Academy grads typically apply to 200+ jobs and go to 2-8 onsite interviews before receiving their first offer. Typically they do this within 1-5 months of graduating. I received perfect scores on all the coding tests, but have not applied to enough jobs quickly enough to receive an offer. For brevity, feel free to skip down to the TL;DR.

- I dated a girl at App Academy and we had a shitty breakup (for me anyway). It was my first love, and I became very depressed for awhile and didn't apply to jobs at the same rate as everyone else. I applied to 85 jobs in the 4 months after graduating and had one onsite interview that didn't lead to an offer. So I decided to take a part-time remote contract dev job where I was working for free. The purpose was to gain experience and (theoretically) land interviews more easily.

- At my contract job, I was considered an excellent programmer but was a bit of an asshole to my manager. (I know it's not a valid excuse but I was unconsciously still very angry about the breakup and unknowingly acting that way.) As a result, I was fired after 2 months of working for free. I definitely learned my lesson. To be entirely fair, my manager was also unprofessional. At one point he told the CEO that he'd built an entire feature that he'd never touched, that had actually been built by the previous dev team. But that doesn't matter. I fucked up by being overly blunt and definitely learned my lesson. (For the record, I consider all 4 of my managers in other internships and jobs to have been highly competent and professional.)

- Since I wasn't earning any money, I moved back to Oregon to live with my parents while I still had the job. I became even more depressed after getting fired and finally went into therapy. In October, I had another onsite interview in SF from an application I'd sent months previously. By November (2 months after getting fired) I had applied to another 100 jobs, reaching a total of 180 applications in the 7 months since graduating, far less than the average.

- In January, I had onsite interviews in SF with Twitter and a company that had just been bought out by Salesforce. (I had completed a coding challenge for each company prior to the onsites.) I didn't receive offers from either company, and kept applying. To date, I've applied to 305 jobs and have had 4 onsite interviews. For the 50 applications I sent after my interview with Twitter, I had several phone interviews. For this latest batch of applications to 75 jobs in multiple cities, I've had no new interviews. With the exception of the unpaid contract work from July-September, I now have a 1 year gap on my resume.

**TL;DR: I graduated from App Academy 1 year ago and now have enough downtime on my resume that I'm getting no new interviews. (For the record, my experience is unusual; by my estimation, roughly 95% of App Academy grads I've personally known have full-time dev jobs.)**

**I'm working on a new project in Node/Express/Angular to put on my resume and am broadening my job search to cities outside the ultra-competitive SF Bay area. I've started attending dev meetups in my area. (The App Academy contract financially incentivizes us to seek jobs in metro SF or NYC, so I didn't apply to jobs outside those areas for the first several months.) I'm also looking for any relevant contract web development job I can possibly get, in order to hopefully have an easier time landing a full-time position.**

**What else can I do to finally land a full-time dev job? Do any of you have any advice for me?**

**How should I explain my resume gap in interviews and while networking? The advice I've received up to this point has been to say nothing about the breakup and nothing about being fired. I've basically just been saying I didn't apply to enough jobs quickly enough, and explaining that AA grads typically apply to hundreds of jobs before being hired.**

**Any advice is greatly appreciated!**

I guess I have no where to turn but to anomyous strangers online but I really need to just explain how I feel and hopefully someone will listen.

It was about a year ago; I was graduating college; had been with the love of my life for over two years and I planned after she graduated (another year) to ask her to marry me. I felt so ""alive""...felt like I had my entire life planned and that I would transition smoothly into the next phase of my life....

I took an internship in another state and although it was hard; we made things work as it was only for the summer; I have the opportunity to stay there and really build a career but I chose to come back because I knew that the only way to make it work was to be closer than the 500 mile distance between us when I was in the other state. 

I took a job closer to her where we could see each other on the weekends; however, this is really where I believed I messed up. The job is good; I don't get paid near what I could or should but my relationship had meant more to me and I believe that it would all work out in the end. After a couple of months of being back, my gf began to act a little off and I knew ultimately what was going on. I had been driving 4 hours hours to see her every other weekend and the final time I was there she decided to tell me that she was having second thoughts about being with me; ultimately listing every little thing about me that she didn't believe was going to sit right with her in the long run - remember I told you I've been with her for over two years at this point so I figured she would have seen this by now. So in the end she broke up with me.

Fast forward to now; I feel that I made a huge mistake in my life. I loved this woman but here I am months later and I don't even know how to pick up the pieces and move on with my life. I have no confidence in myself nor do I believe I even have what it takes to make someone happy. 

My job is still the same; pretty much dead-end...student loan debt and other bills...and worst of all I feel alone. The friends I once had have changed and are doing things I don't want to be a part of. My best friend committed suicide a year into my relationship with that woman; I feel like I have nothing. Part of me died when I lost my best friend and when my gf left me the other part went with it.

I'm not really sure where to start; what do I do? Where do I go? My confidence is shattered, I am broken, I have a real hard time trusting anyone...

So here I am; complaining about my life on Reddit. I apologize. People have it way worse than I do and I should be happy for everything I do have; which I am. I just wake up and here I am in my mid 20s without a real life plan while everyone else around me has their career's and are starting their own families...

When does this feeling stop? When can I look at a picture of her and I are be happy for the memories and realize that she is a big part of who I am regardless of what happened between her and I? I just feel broken. 

Once again; I'm sorry. I don't mean to complain about such trivial matters...I just have to talk about it so I can understand it better.

I've had both great experiences and some days where I feel like complete shit. Just to give some background information: I am a 19 year old college freshman who is commuting to a local university because of how inexpensive it is. In terms of grades, I'm doing okay. Not great, but okay. I'll list my main concerns.

1. I feel like I'm not nearly doing enough for my education. I hear stories of college freshman doing so much more with their education and yet I'm still not sure what I'd like to do. I know I want to do something business related, but man, the idea of finding an internship right now might not be possible because I have no idea what I should intern in.

2. I can't afford to live in a dorm, so commuting is just simply what I am stuck with. I am going to look into joining some clubs, but still, I really don't know exactly what I should be looking for.

3. My lack of independence is starting to bother me. I still live at home while most of my peers live in dorms or apartments. While yeah I am saving money, I feel like I'm setting myself back so much in terms of being able to live on my own and take care of myself. I don't know if I'm thinking too much about this or whatever. "

After a long journey of breakup, alienation and depression  I finally have  the strength to take responsibility for my life. 

In the past  few months I learned a lot about myself and what I like  and don't like - finally, after lurking for so long.

Now I want to try myself out, experience New things, experiment... find my passion. And have already done a bit of that.

Problem is, I am a masters student with ca. 4 semesters left and I feel like I am running out of time.
I have excellent grades and am employed in the third job at the university, but I lack a profile (masters is politics, history, int. Law). Right now I should already have a dream job I strive for, and a plan, but I don't because I lost quite some time to my ""dark ages"" where I never actually did anything.

For Illustration: 
If I can stay in research, great!  I have connections and grades and interest, but I lack a profile. To develop that, I need a lot of  time, which would cancel options like longer internships abroad.
Is it dumb to travel the Balkans for 3 weeks this summer? I phantasize  about it every day.
I feel like an imposter when handing out my C2 certificate for English. Is Erasmus or work and travel in Canada a bad idea that late  in my studies?
Should I skip the internship at the UN for a more reasonable yet less desireable option (got a few of these), because I know the UN stuff will not lead to employment?
I am sleep-deprived to the max, so sorry if the text  was confusing.

How much of a problem could starting at Epic be? If I code in my free time, and get working on a Portfolio of Android projects for example, will I still have a decent chance to switch jobs later if I want to? Or am I pretty much screwed by having Epic on my resume?"

So I just bought a dell Dell UltraSharp 4k UP3216Q 31.5. Sadly after a week and 2 units I am having to send them both back. Dell (like everyone) is cutting major corners. For these units they would never wake from sleep mode. On top of that, honestly for 1.4k they were pretty meh. Not to mention they don't work on a macbook pro (that is a pretty horrifying fail)

I am looking for a monitor because I have been using a mac screen so long. Now when I am connected to my other screens they seem blurry. I figure it it is time for an upgrade. I mean I got these 3 screens back in college (yay internships! Did I mention I am an engineer.. not excessive for my work)

I think that 32 inches was a tad small. I am looking to move away from 3 monitor set up to having just one really big screen. I do a lot of gaming, though mostly I am programming. Thinking 40 would be better.

I know the issues with having a TV as a screen. But surely there is a gem that over comes this. Especially with modern screens and with a 1.5k- 2k budget. Usually the issue is with input delay and color washing. Though with 4-5k TVs we also have the lack of display ports on many units... I am a sucker for 100% color correctness but so long as it's not washed out compared to the macbook next to it I wont care.. 

I did find http://www.rtings.com/tv/reviews/by-usage/pc-monitor/best

Starting off, I wanted to explain a bit about where I am currently at. I currently a Junior pursuing a Bachelors in CS and have a few side projects that I am proud of, interned for another company part-time/full-time for about a 1.5 years, and am planning to graduate next winter. The company that I am currently interning for has about 500+ employees and is transitioning from ""startup"" to ""stable company"". I have been with them for about 9 months part-time/full-time and am allowed to work remotely while while I work part-time for during school. 

I was initially hired on by a manager who ended up leaving shortly after I started for a lead position at another startup. At first, I was honestly a little scared about this internship being a complete bust. The first month or so were a little insane as I was having to onboard, figure out the existing systems, and sort through codebases without much guidance. I eventually was able to get my head above water and I have now pretty much assumed almost all of the technical roles of my previous manager. After getting the existing systems organized and such, I proposed a major overhaul to my boss which was received really well. I am now in the midst of creating a new management portal, creating new demos, making our documentation better and effectively implementing that proposal. Last week I had one of the first public appearances within the company of what I have been working on and seems to have gone over extremely well. For all intents and purposes this has been one of the best opportunities I have received with regards to growing professionally. 

I have begun really thinking about what I want to do after graduation and plan to have a sit down with my boss later this month but he has been absolutely thrilled with my performance and is been openly willing to get me contacts for just about anywhere in the company. This is really where my question begins, I have a great connection at my current internship, what seems like multiple paths for career advancement and really have no major qualms working there. Post graduation, I am assuming for the most part 100k+ salary based off glassdoor and for the most part the ability to work remotely.

My dream has always been SpaceX, Microsoft, Facebook, Tesla but as I type this post I cant help but think how insane it would be to give up what I already have and start over. I am curious if anyone who has been in my position or is able to offer some insight could chime in? Should I keep aiming higher or is what I have out of graduation something I should hold onto.

48kog8,323,2016-03-02,"My First Offer - Journey through unemployment, depression and college.",AggressionRanger,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/48kog8/my_first_offer_journey_through_unemployment/,"  I've seen a few posts like this, tales of peoples trouble to find a job. It always helped me along the way to know I wasn't the only one who didn't have 9 offers before graduation and entry-level salary of 100k. So here is mine, hopefully it will offer a morale boost, feel free to ask any questions about the journey. Sorry for the wall of text, I’m trying to keep it brief and not make this my life story.


For the first year and a half of the Computer Science program things were great, I worked as a 'Greeter' (bouncer) at a night-club and went to school. Although the job had shitty hours, I was standing around the majority of my shifts, which is great for someone who is writing algorithms and studying data-structures all day. I was able to hold a pretty respectable GPA along the way. As I was 28 when I started the major, I was in a bit of a ‘hurry’ to finish school and join the industry, which for me meant summer school and fully-loaded schedules at all times. If I can give any advice to undergrad students right now, it’s don’t do this. Take an internship. For me, I was misinformed of the following facts. I believed that A) Most internships were unpaid, and B) Internships were available year round. While both have cases of being true, for the majority of the industry, this is not accurate. I used the logic that I couldn’t afford to NOT be in school, as I needed the financial aid money to pay my rent. By the time my classmates started talking about their internships, and me realizing they were getting paid (a sufficient amount, enough if I had done the same I would have been fine financially), it was too late for me. 


Toward the middle of my senior year I was laid off from my part-time job. I was devastated. While the job wasn’t great, it had the potential pay-wise to keep me afloat if I wasn’t receiving financial aid (via picking up more hours). Previously, I was relaxed about the job hunting prospect because I knew I would be ok for the time being, had I had my job, which now I didn’t. I thought I might be able to scoop up a part time CS job being fairly close to graduation. I was wrong, and thus began one of the darkest chapters in my life.  Unable to get a tech job, a call back, or anything but rejection emails, I took a job cooking. A bit of background about me, I was a ‘cook’ for a decade; I hated it with a passion. I was so jaded from that industry in the first place that’s what pushed me to go back to school. I felt like a piece of shit. Despite how far I’d come in the last few years getting my degree, somehow I landed right back where I started, flipping hamburgers.


Alas, I was completely miserable, hated my job, wasn’t getting call-backs and my grades began to fall. I knew I was too far in at this point to back-out so I did what I had to. I wrote my resume, if I didn’t get any calls on it, I re-wrote it differently, and differently, and again, and again. I probably have around 10 ‘generations’ of the AggressionRanger resume, and I’m talking these list different projects, skills, ect. Each one probably took me 5 or so hours to write and a few days of revisions to make it send-worthy. Finally however, I ended up with one that got me responses. 


Interviews were no picnic either. Although I always did well in school (until recently), the process of problem solving wasn’t something explicitly taught. Every technical interview I had, I knew the solution, it wasn’t ever ‘out of my wheel-house’, but to sit there with a phone-stuck to your ear, trying to explain your convoluted first-logic was tough. I got rejected. It hurt, but I kept trying. Stress levels rose and I saw the timer-running out on my schooling, and realizing without that sweet financial aid, I wouldn’t be able to pay my rent. I would have to have 2 crappy cooking jobs to make ends. How do I interview working two crappy jobs 50 hours a week? More stress. Heart pounds. I don’t live alone, I have a family, so not paying rent means I have to explain to them why we are living inside a refrigerator box off the Freeway overpass. More stress, but I forged on. I learned from where I had failed before, and I tried to find ways to ‘plan out’ a problem better so in the advent I had an interview, the interviewer was a bit more clear on what the hell I was doing. It worked. Eventually I had a technical interview I was able to catch and explain the problem well, well enough I was invited on-site. Once on-site, although nervous and tired from 6 grueling back to back interviews, I went home and received an e-mail they would like to make an offer, and will call to discuss in a few days. Days went by, I accepted. Less stress. It’s over. No refrigerator box. No two crappy jobs, hell I was even able to put in my notice at the 1 crappy job.


I suppose the point of all of this, is to let others know you aren’t the only one out there struggling. It’s real. It happens. I probably put out 100 resumes. I had 12 interviews/technical assessments/HR screens from various different companies. It took 6 months. I started sending out resumes in August. November was my first phone-screen. Every-time I got rejected, I dusted myself off and went at it again, because I mean what is the alternative? It’s the hamburger- flipping the fucking hamburger is the alternative. That kept me focused. I stayed positive because my interviews/assessments/phone-screens were staggered. Just as one passed, usually within a few weeks another would come along. It’s simple, but it gave me hope, and that kept me going. They made it sound like with a CS degree people would be jumping out of windows to give you jobs. They made it sound like with a CS degree we would be a part of some elite, never jobless club that would rule the world and play Nintendo during the work day while eating catered lunches. Not true. The truth is, you will get rejected, you may be depressed, but most importantly, really, is to just keep going. Not everyone has a job ‘locked’ 6 months before graduation. Not everyone has offers from every Big-4 for a 100,000 starting salary with a 30,000 signing bonus. It’s ok. You’ll be fine.

He was a wonderful boyfriend.  He was sweet, kind, loved me with all of his heart and was always honest with me.

I was young and stupid and midway through my graduate program I for some reason caught a crush on a classmate.  I never acted on it nor did I ever tell anyone about it but just having what I considered feelings for another guy was enough in my mind to tell me that I was afraid of settling down at a young age.  I struggled with the idea for about 3 weeks before one day just after his birthday I delivered the very bad news to him that I thought it was best we break up.  

I told him that both of us were to young to even know how we wanted to live our lives or who we wold be with.

He didn't take it very well, and it really broke my heart to hurt him so bad but I was trying to be honest and didn't want to hurt him worse later on.

I told him I would always love him and be there for him but for awhile I needed some space so that I could heal and not just run back to him out of guilt.

To his credit he did as I asked and did not contact me.  Of course as I expected I was not a very popular person with either of our families or friends.  I did not want anyone to get any wrong impression or if for some reason he decided to say something false or hurtful so I made it a point to talk to our mutual friends right after (within a couple of days) and at first they were all shocked but didn't seem to show any real anger towards me.  My family was very disappointed because they really thought we were going to be married but ultimately said it was my life and they loved me.  I never spoke to his family at first because I didn't think it was my place.  I ran into his sister once and she ignored me until I went up to her and made her say hi and she told me to fuck off.  This was shocking because she is a dainty little girly girl, but I get it I hurt her brother.  Soon after our friends started to distance themselves from me, again somewhat expected although I thought they would at least be more understanding.

After about 2 months I was ready to start dating and met a guy who worked at a bar that I frequented and we went out for about a month.  He ended up being a total prick and deadbeat who just assumed that since I offered to pay for our first dinner together that it was just going to continue to be that way.  Breaking up with him was no trouble at all.

I had a couple of tinder dates and they went about how you would expect them to go.  Neither guy was a bad guy but ultimately we just did not have any chemistry and I didn't feel anything for them at all.

Then one of my friends from my internship set me up on a date with her cousin.  We hit it off right away.  He was a great guy, nothing wrong with him at all.  He was educated, held his own in conversations, treated me well and has ambitions that are on par with mine.  One giant problem, he wasn't my ex.  We had been together about 5 months when I just determined that I really loved my ex with all of my heart and even though this guy was great it wasn't fair to him or me for me to be longing for someone else and be with him.  So I ended it, it was amicable and he said he understood.

That was about 3 almost 4 months ago.  I have made it a point to be single and try and make sure that my feelings were real.  They are.

I have done some back door searching and found out that my ex is still single.  I had lunch with one of my former close friends and she let me know that he was very devastated by our break up and they as a group have been trying to keep his spirits up.  I let her know my feelings and what I was thinking and she said that she believes he would take me back in a heartbeat.  But she also warned me that if I broke his heart again she would never speak to me again.  

She also said that as far as she knows he has never dated another girl in the past year.

This brings me to the real problem.  I have dated around, he knew when I left that I was going to do that as it really was the whole point.  

I want of course for him to accept that I looked around and found out that the grass wasn't greener and that he really is the one for me.  But I also know how guys can be about the whole sleeping with other guys thing and he is going to be no different.

I'm willing to go the extra mile for him because one I did hurt him so much but way beyond that I really do love him and have determined that even though my last bf was perfectly fine, I could not get past him.

Has anyone ever done this before or had it done to them and can you share your ideas on whether or not I should do this (I'm going to unless someone convinces me it is 100% wrong) and how best to approach this.

   
**tl;dr**: After being away from my first ever real bf I have come to the conclusion that he is mr. right and that I need to do whatever I can to take back the pain I caused him."

48l5wq,2,2016-03-02,It is against the laws of computer animation to produce a bee.,Lemnistance,madeupshit,https://www.reddit.com/r/madeupshit/comments/48l5wq/it_is_against_the_laws_of_computer_animation_to/,"monetizeyourcat:
It is against the laws of computer animation to produce a bee. This is not to say it can be done, and is not; rather, it is widely known to be impossible. The polygons simply don’t fit together correctly; it is unknown how bees appear three-dimensional in the wild.
So when Jerry Seinfeld approached Paramount with a brief treatment about a CGI bee, they were excited. They were getting the Seinfeld name, and they were going to show the world they could make a computer-animated picture about something no one else would dare to - bees.
But man-years of work produced only hideous, Groeningesque mockeries of the bee form. Millions of dollars were down the tube. In desperation, they settled on a final gambit: if they could not make a bee for Seinfeld, they would make a bee OF Seinfeld.
Over the course of a year, Jerry Seinfeld, then aged 52, underwent a gradual transformation at the behest of his new patrons at Paramount. Hundreds of procedures, costing tens of millions of dollars, caused Seinfeld to resemble an immense bee more than a human man. The executives at Paramount were unsettled by his grotesque transformation, and disturbed by the mounting costs of making a man into a bee, but they considered the patented Seinfeld style and the technical marvel worth the financial and human costs.
Paramount forged ahead with shooting, and Seinfeld forged ahead with the procedures. They finished the mo-cap for his new bee body in two horrifying weeks. Interns confirm Seinfeld refused to wear clothing - that he was fully nude for the duration of shooting, exposing his increasingly alien stinging genital. He was more bee than man now, and the world knew it - and he knew it.
But what Paramount did not anticipate, could not anticipate, was the effect of the gradual transformation on Seinfeld’s mind. Successive iterations of the script, as the scalpel and pint after pint of bee signalling peptides reshaped his body, became more and more incomprehensible to humans. Obsessed with hierarchies of power, and with stinging. Months into the scriptwriting process, Seinfeld confessed to co-star and personal friend John Goodman that he feared his drive to sting intruders had overtaken the procreative urge he understood he should have - which, as a drone, was increasingly alien to him.
The result was a disaster, even in test audiences. Shell-shocked Paramount executives asked Seinfeld why what was ostensibly a children’s film had long, dark, involved jokes about suicide pacts, the reparations issue, legal procedure, and genital mutilation. Seinfeld, without batting one of his many eyes, told the executives that his task was to vomit the nourishment of his ideas onto the young.
The turd was, at this point, complete. They had no choice but to polish it. Tens of millions of dollars went into an unprecedented ad campaign, in the hopes that buzz marketing would accrue to their technically proficient if alarmingly inhuman project. Seinfeld, for his part, was forcibly restored to a state resembling human, receiving dozens of transplants of pig and sheep organs and skin to permit a promotional tour.
Oddly enough, in candid interviews he has given since, Seinfeld confesses that the “restoration” process galled him more than his original bee metamorphosis. He has said - off the record - that human thoughts still feel alien in his brain, and he has not been able to feel fully safe and secure since his stinger was surgically removed.
His hope - and the reason he went along with his promotional tour in his mutilated and foreign human body - was for a Bee Movie sequel, and a chance therein to escape to the wild, fleeing Paramount and the strictures of human society. But Bee Movie was a notorious bomb, and Seinfeld lacks the money or the connections to illegal doctors to have anything like the procedures he had in 2006-7. If “to bee or not to bee” is Seinfeld’s question, Paramount has answered it for him: not to bee; never to bee again.
But bees have a long, long memory."

I am currently at university/working a full time internship for the year and decided that I wanted to start selling hair as a side project. This is something that I'm passionate about and have quite a good knowledge of as I have been using extensions for about 7 years. 
I know the market is probably a bit saturated, however I feel there is somewhat of a niche in selling synthetic hair pieces/half wigs/three-quarter wigs etc. This is cheap, 'disposable' beauty that I feel a lot of women around my age would be interested in buying. 

I have previously received samples of hair, picked a supplier based upon the hair which I liked the most/that was the best quality. I took what I would consider to be a significant risk financially given that I am still in university in purchasing stock. 
I now have numerous hairpieces ready to sell but I just feel so overwhelmed that I don't know what to do, and am losing motivation.

I have been waiting so long to get to this point, that I feel I probably never actually believed I would do it. Now that I'm ready to start the business, I feel completely bewildered. 

Does/did anyone else feel this way? Are there any good ways to combat this? 

Thanks. C x"

I live now in another country with my boyfriend[M24] of two years. He was the reason I moved here and he's a person who completely understands me and has supported me through alot. Before him I was in a four year long mentally abusive relationship where I got cheated on five times in total, lost all my friends and developed an eating disorder.

During that time I was in a band with my bf's best friend, Julius. Julius had a girlfriend Laura (the person my post is about) with whom I never became friends with, because she wasn't especially interesting as a friend, plus I had a feeling they would break up based on how Julius treated her. So to avoid drama I didn't really get to know her beyond being aquainted and having smalltalk. 

About half a year ago Laura contacted me on facebook, having stalked I moved in another country where she was looking into having her internship. I thought it was nice to have someone from years ago contacting me, so I was of course telling her that me and my bf could show her the city if she gets in. I also offered help finding a place to do her internship. 

She found a place, got in and started asking me for help with a place to live while being here for two months. I was a little busy at the time so I just told her to ask her school or search google, but after a few weeks she seemed to have a new idea; maybe she searches for housing after she flies here (clearly assuming me and my bf would take her for a week+). I felt she was being rude about assuming such a thing, but politely said it wouldn't be such a good idea. She eventually found a place the week before her flight with our help. We were also fixed to pick her up from the airport to her housing, which wasn't a problem, but then she barged into our dinner plans with our friends. While there, being a little irritated about her inviting herself, we began catching up the past few years. She was bringing my ex bf up a lot, making me uncomfortable and not getting my subtle hints to lay off the subject. Then I had the worst flashback ever;

A few years ago, while I was still together with my ex, we had a huge fight and I kicked him out of my flat. He had gone drinking with Julius and Laura, and while being at a bar Laura had asked Julius permission to kiss my bf. Julius had agreed, and the three had ended the evening sleeping in the same bed with Laura in the middle. All this came to my attention when Julius laughingly told it to me at band rehearsal. I confronted my (then)bf about it and and he blamed the alcohol as per usual. Laura never knew that I know about what happened.

So as my subconcious brought this to my attention I started to get really bad vibes off Laura. Already in the evening of the first night here she convieniently slipped on some ice into my bf's arms accompanied with the fakest giggle possible. Granted, I was already paranoid on the first evening so that could be brushed off as a pure accident.

Then we started hanging around the city with her, showing her around a few hours a week. One thing I noticed that got proggressively weirder was the fact that she was taking pictures of my bf alot. He is a very photogenic person and ofc saw no harm in it so he posed for her and sometimes cheekily photobombed her when she was taking pictures of sth else. I was getting furious of the situation and told my bf what I remembered and how I felt like there was sth sketchy about her. 

During her two months here not once did she ask for a photo with me, or took a picture of me even though my bf was the star of her photos. My bf understood but told me to try and keep a clear mind about it and not let the past affect my judgement, maybe that was sth she also wasn't proud of. 

Sth else she did often was not buying food at home for those days when we were hanging with her until evening, so we were ofc obligated to take her to restaurants or to my bf's parents with us in order to eat sth. 

Then one occasion we had to cancel on her, and she got really pissed about it telling us she only has a few weeks left and that we should really think about how she feels being at her flat alone. We apologized but tried to guide her to doing stuff on her own but she said she didn't feel comfortable going alone even in daytime. (Then why did you travel to a different country for your internship knowing only an aquantaince there?)

The past few weeks we had to take her to parties with our friendgroup (which consists of five dudes) and things just get worse. 

The dudes in the country me and Laura are from are really introverted, reserved and shy. But in the country I live in now dudes (including my bf) are very attentive, talky and make sure people feel comfortable. So I'm not sure if she's gotten an idea from everyone having been very conciderate towards her, that maybe these dudes are interested in her. She sure isn't used to the attention, has more girlfriends back home and our cultures are totally different. 

She escalated from being cutely confused to being totally attention-needy and ad/hd whenever we don't engage her. The dudes are also clearly a little annoyed by her by now, but in her mind she is apparently a part of the group. She has now been hanging alone with our friends, inviting herself to our bandmeetings through them and talks about coming here in the summer, winter and maybe for exchange. This is beyond pissing me off. She and I haven't achieved any friendship status in her eight weeks now and she doesn't take my smalltalk and ignoring as a subtle hint that I am totally not into her. 

Last week her housing contract was ending, and she was asking if we could take her to our apartment for the last week with my bf. I told her I am not so much into living with people plus I work nights sometimes so imo, it wouldn't really work. She then went behind our backs and asked a dudefriend of ours if he could take her, and he said he could. She then came with this info to me kinda as a ""bitchy comeback"". I dared her again and again to go stay with our friend (a dude she barely knows) since it is cheaper than a hostel, but she then made an excuse that her (ex)bf Julius wouldn't be happy about that(?). This made it clear that she was only daring me with the info that even my friends are more conciderate than me, if she had no intentions to even do it. 

So finally we come to the end of her stay. The dudes don't know about any of this, they've known her for two weeks only and it will be tough to explain to them why we don't want to encourage her to come here (at least so that she thinks we are her friends). My bf has also seen past her initial cutesy-wootesy stuff and thinks she is annoying and assuming alot about our courtesy of showing her around the past two months. Her stay became a burden rather than a fun time with an old aquaintance. 

So my question is; how do I approach the dudes who still have positive image about her about not wanting her to visit us or be in contact with us anymore? 

Worst case would be her coming here for an exchange, having contact with our friends and ending up integrating into our friendgroup or coming to hang where we go because she knows that much about us. 

Sorry that my post is a mess, I've kept this in for so long and it created issues within myself because I have been feeling trapped in my bad feelings for the past two months. Any insight or advice is welcome. 

TL;DR
An old aquaintance from my past (ex drummer's ex gf) came to do her internship in another country I moved in for two months. I remembered she kissed my ex and slept in the same bed with him, now she is taking pictures of my current bf and inviting herself too much into our lives. Hangs out with our friends alone and is concidering visiting in the summer and doing an exchange for a year. I need help telling my friends to not encourage her to come because she became a burden, but some of them think with their dicks and know her as a nice person from the past two weeks."

My roommate (let's call him Doc) has hit, what I perceive to be, rock bottom.  He is on day 15 of a heavy bender.  At this point, he has lost his brother's $1,200 bicycle, a glass blowing internship, and his relationship with his equally alcoholic girlfriend has ended (I count that one as a positive, but it still impacts Doc negatively).

I struggled with substance abuse and alcoholism, and have luckily overcome both.  This is something I wanted to do for myself, and any advice that I give (that worked for me) does not hit home for Doc.  Fellow Stoppers, I need resources to help this soul.  He admits he needs help, but refuses to see a doctor of any sort.

Since we live in Texas, we can't just drop him off in a rehab facility, as he can simply check himself out.  If we attempt something like that, he will feel 'abandoned' and continue to lash out at his closest friends and family as scapegoats for his inability to stop drinking.  Who knows what would happen at that point.  I'm afraid he'll keep going until he is sincerely all alone, to no fault but his own.

What does a person do?  Nobody in our immediate family is equipped to help, and we are without knowledge of professional resources aside from AA, which again, he refuses to go to.  I am afraid to get too close to this situation due to my own problems with abuse.  Rumor has it that he has access to Xanax and a number of other drugs that cause major concern combined with his drinking habits.

Can somebody please volunteer information on professional organizations that we can exploit?  Hopefully ones that don't cost any money or need insurance?  Any additional advice or positive words are welcome.  Thanks for reading. -Jay"

48ni8x,126,2016-03-02,Results/Final Update: 5 hour interview w/2.5 hour lunch,down_the_garbage,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/48ni8x/resultsfinal_update_5_hour_interview_w25_hour/,"tl;dr: Didn't get it, time to keep applying!

Hey /r/EngineeringStudents,

&amp;nbsp;

I have the final update regarding that whole 5 hour interview 2.5 hour lunch thing that I posted about last week.

I didn't get it, which is disappointing, but that's life, I guess. I'm doing my best to stay positive and keep applying to more jobs and hopefully get more opportunities.

&amp;nbsp;

The most disappointing part, however, is how the company handled the whole thing. At this point, I'm not afraid to discuss the company and whatever since I'm no longer being considered.

&amp;nbsp;

I interviewed with Intel Corporation, and I'm fully aware (and want you to keep this in mind too) that my one experience with this one group at this one location is obviously not indicative of the entire company and their practices. However, the way they handled this was surprisingly unprofessional.

&amp;nbsp;

I interviewed last week, and received a voicemail on Monday 2/29. My interviewer told me that they would call back the following day (yesterday, 3/1) between 1-5pm to follow-up on the on-site interview. Now, I've received phone calls giving me bad news in the past, so I wasn't necessarily optimistic, especially with the quick turnaround time (only 2 business days between interview and decision) and the time of day I would receive the call. 1-5pm is near the end of the day, and you'd rather give bad news at the end of the day than at the beginning, I guess. 

&amp;nbsp;

However, that night (2/29) at 9pm, I received en email from Intel Corporation asking for a background check and references from my internship and all sorts of things. So I'm thinking ""oh OK, interviewer probably just wanted to let me know I'd be receiving this email to fill out their form before they make their decision."" Also, I won't lie, I thought I got the job. Not sure if background checks are done on all candidates, though.

&amp;nbsp;

Fast forward to yesterday, 3/1, at 4:15pm. 

""Hi this is so-and-so from Intel Corporation, I wanted to follow up about your on-site interview! Do you have a couple of minutes to spare to discuss this?"" in a happy-sounding voice. ""After reviewing your performance, we've decided not to move forward with your application.""

&amp;nbsp;

""Oh, OK. Well, that's disappointing news to hear, but thank you for giving me the opportunity to interview and for considering me for this position,"" I responded.

&amp;nbsp;

Long awkward pause followed by ""OK,"" on their end. Now, I don't know if this is common practice, but every time I've had an on-site interview, I've always received some sort of feedback about what I did well, what I did wrong, and why I'm no longer being considered. So I ask, and the answer I received blew my mind.

&amp;nbsp;

""You need to know your subject better.""

&amp;nbsp;

Hmm. OK... I think to myself.

""Yeah, you should know your subject more,"" they repeated, followed very quickly by ""OK thank you bye.""

&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;

Uhh, what? What does that even mean? How is this constructive feedback? You know, if this is how they handle themselves (again, reminder, this one group at this one location, not the entire company) then I'm almost glad that I didn't get it. I can't imagine having a good time working in a group led by this sort of behavior. Or maybe this is just my confirmation bias taking over, you be the judge of that, I guess. And why email me asking for a background check if I already didn't get the job? I also JUST got an email reminding me to complete the background check while I was writing this up, wtf?

&amp;nbsp;

So, yeah, that's that. I guess I'm just more shocked than disappointed at this stage. It's like, you've had a crush on a girl who you thought was perfect, then after your first date you find out she's a smoker or an alcoholic or something, I don't know. Crappy analogy but I already typed it out lol.

&amp;nbsp;

Here's the takeaway, though. I know this is gonna sound like some hippy-dippy bullshit or whatever, but trust me on this. Don't put all your eggs in one basket. Don't take anything for granted. Don't take things personally! Who knows, maybe someone's nephew applied for this position at the same time I was interviewing for it, or maybe they found out they don't have the funds to add an extra position. I had a good talk with my older brother and my parents about this, and I think these are the right things to take away from the entire experience. Plus, if I'm ever in a 3 hour long panel-style interview again, I have this experience to help me along that way.

&amp;nbsp;

Remember: engineering is hard! If you're studying engineering,  you're already a smart person. You just can't give up or let one mishap slow you down. I'll think of this like I did poorly on a midterm I thought I did well on. Time to pick up the pieces and move on to the next one.

&amp;nbsp;

Please feel free to ask whatever questions you have. Also sorry for the long post AGAIN. You all have great patience if you've read this much for the third time :P"

48nrho,1,2016-03-02,Questions about references,kdashi,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/48nrho/questions_about_references/,"Some background: the only work experience I have are from two 4-month summer internships when I was in college. They were both at medium/large software companies. However, I'm a very, very shy person, and so I never really networked well with the people there and haven't stayed in contact (the last internship I had was a little less than 2 years ago). 

After graduating, I moved to another country and took about a year off to deal with legal and health issues, and am now trying to land my first full-time job. However, I have a few questions about references and if a company I apply to asks for them. Right now, I only have my two bosses listed, but...

1. My boss from my most recent internship was on vacation when the internship ended, and so I emailed to ask if I could use him as a reference. He never responded. Furthermore, I stupidly forgot to write down his phone number, so I only have his email address. Should I (or can I even) list him as a reference?

2. I was never really close to my boss from my first internship, but were just on ""acquaintance"" terms. I haven't spoken to him in 3 years, and I fear that he might not even remember me if someone calls him. Are old contacts like this still okay as references?

3. Due to the way the project was structured, I actually ended up working more with other employees in a completely different office location (like, across the country) than with my own boss/local team. Would it be weird to email the other employees and ask if they could be used as a reference, since I haven't maintained contact since after the internship ended, and they've actually never met me in person?"

I need some on how to get out of my situation, which has been very negative for me.

In 2014, I graduated from a top university (in the northeast US). My intent is, and always has been, to pursue music professionally. As you know, this is a difficult path. So upon graduating, with no firm job plans, I took an internship at a market research agency. I strongly disliked the internship, but it was a job and I stuck with it. After 6 months of that internship, I was recruited for a full time market research position in Los Angeles. I decided to take the job, knowing I would dislike it, but wanting to take the opportunity to move to LA for personal reasons but also for my music career.

This month, I've been at this job for one year. I absolutely despise it. I completely dread going to work every single day, and I've felt this way for the entirety of the year. The plan was for this job to support me while I pursue my music, which it has, but this plan is not sustainable. The job is simply too draining and taxing on my mental state. I have made some great strides with music in the past year, however, despite this. 

I have been wracking my brain on how to get myself out of this situation. I need to get out ASAP. My main goal is to find another means of employment that will a) not be in market research or any related field b) allow me to better pursue music.

I am open to many different kinds of situations, and have been actively seeking new positions. I've spent much time on job boards applying to positions which seem like they would be better, but have never even gotten as much as an email back. My resume is in pretty good shape so I'm not sure that's the issue.

My goal is just to get out and do something else. I would be completely happy with a job at a restaurant or similar service position. However, even these jobs require experience which I do not have. I just need ANY other job while I do music.

I have plans for a ""backup"" career, which I would basically do if I decide that the music isn't going to work out. This would involve applying to and enrolling in a coding bootcamp - I have a history of coding and solid skills in this area, so I am confident I could make a career out of that if need be. However, this is not something I am entertaining as a possibility at this time period.

So any advice would be great on how I can get out of here. Right now I am in a tough mental state since it feels like any efforts I make are completely futile.

Thanks for reading."

So I may have messed up beyond belief. During a traffic stop for having our headlights off on a rather large party day for my college, the officer made our driver step out and breathalyze. After he blew 0.00, the officer had mentioned he smelled liquor coming from the car, and instructed us all to blow. I was cited for a minor in consumption after blowing a 0.047.

Today, I was instructed to go to court by my parents(first mistake, since I'm 18) to try and inquire with the prosecution attorney about a diversionary program to make sure the minor does not inhibit my ability to be hired for internships. I had done this similar procedure in a different county in the same state for a traffic violation, so I had thought I would have been able to do the same thing I had done there. Unfortunately, I was not aware I would have to speak to a judge for this. Once she got over the formalities(the typical is-this-your-signature, do-you-waive-your-right-to-an-attorney mumbo jumbo), she asked for my plea. It was at this time I interjected with my intention to speak with the prosecuting attorney. She made me sign a pink sheet stating I will come back to court at a later date.

I wasn't prepared to speak to a judge, only to a prosecuting attorney. I feel way over my head, and really just want to get this over with. Is it possible to just pay the initial $180 fine, have this minor on my record, and be done with the whole ordeal without having to go back for the pretrial? If so, how would I go about doing that? I'm sorry if this seems absurdly simple, but I'm not a troubled child by any means(not so much as a speeding ticket on my record(anymore)) so I really do not have any experience in a courtroom. Any and all advice will be very appreciated. Thank you in advance.

So I will finish an associates in Network Administration soon and am definitely wanting to pursue a Bachelors but I would like to complement it with work experience where I work now.

I think I could swing the timing and continue school at WGU while working full time as a support tech (mixture of hardware/software/ and support calls) I am an intern now but have a better than good chance of obtaining a job here.

I know WGU isn't looked down upon at my current place of work as the manager of the enterprise team himself went there.

I guess what I'm asking is will they automatically look down on the degree or will it definitely be enough to check HR boxes?"

I'm not sure if this is right to post here, just tell me if it's out of place and I'll delete this.  Also which flair shall I put ?  
    
**Let me explain the situation :**    
 I'm the tech guy of a VR startup going to market as soon as the CV1 of the oculus hit retails. And we are looking to hire one more tech guy.     
VR is very new, and we are also playing a lot with video streaming and integration of it in the unity engine, remote controlling using a tablet, real time networking, transforming CAD models into game environments...     
We are  touching a LOT of different techs.    
     
I've been so far disappointed with the quality of classic channel of recruitment (No, I don't want a RoR developper...).   
I'm looking for a guy that enjoy making stuff happens, that tinkered with mods on his games, that created SOMETHING on his spare time and willing to learn. Not another Front End code monkey. So that's why I'm posting here, where these kind of person would hang out.   
  
**The Offer**    
-Minimum one month internship, preferably more.       
-Paid expense with possible hiring after your graduation.    
-London based. Remote working only works with freelance small projects. Not integrated development.    
-Very Flexible hours. If you are a Night Owl, no problem with it. Part time negotiable. I don't really care about the schedule, the important part is the value you bring to us and the value we bring to you. People are not born good devs, they become one.     
-Starting ASAP.    
    
**What we are looking for**    
Or rather what I'm looking for. Ideally a Junior developer (Undergrad-Grad in an IT course). I don't care so much about how many languages you speak. We won't use OCaml. What I care about is how you thinks. If you don't know how to do something, the first most important part is admitting it. Then google it. Tinker. Hack. Learn. Create.     
If you already written your own compiler that's obviously a plus. But it's not a requirement. The only requirement is that you know how to use a middle level language.  Java, C# are fine. Lower level is even better (C/C++, ASM, Fortran, CUDA...). It's easy to learn how to drive automatic cars when you already know how to use a shift stick.  
On the other hand, if you only knows javascript/Ruby/Python/Other scripting language, you should tinker with unity a bit and force yourself to use C# and use non-monobehaviour objects a bit.    
    
TL;DR : 
If you already had the curiosity to write code for yourself, you'll be fine.

48o8wh,31,2016-03-02,If I don't get help I might die.,livingtoeat,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/48o8wh/if_i_dont_get_help_i_might_die/,"Throwaway because my friends and family know my reddit username, and this would hurt them.

I was diagnosed with severe clinical depression on October 5th of 2015. I had been laying in bed, hiding from the world and all of my responsibilities, hoping to fall asleep and never wake up again. I finally went to a doctor to get help, I was prescribed 20mg of citalopram (generic for Celexa) in order to try and get my depression controlled. It worked for the most part. On October 5th, I was 5'6"", 156lbs. I already considered myself to be fat in comparison to the skinny, beautiful sorority girls on campus. As of today, I went back in to my doctor to check up on my progress. I'm somewhat stable, but when I have bad days, they're really bad and I just want to curl up into a ball of depression for the rest of my life and give up completely. I've always been a sensitive person, but especially so when I'm having depressive episodes. 

Anyways, I weighed in this morning at the doctor, and I weigh 179 pounds. I've gained 23 pounds since October, and frighteningly enough, the last time I weighed myself (February 7th) I was 166. I've gained 12 pounds in less than a month. 

My doctor has switched me to generic Zoloft, 100mg a day. I'm going to do a slow cross-taper from my 20mg of citalopram over the course of a week so I don't do anything crazy. He told me he only sees this kind of weight gain in 2% of his patients.

Last week, while I was working at my internship at a day clubhouse for people with chronic mental illness, one of the members asked me what was wrong with my stomach. I was confused and asked her what she was talking about, and she rubbed her stomach and said ""you're getting fat.""
I pretended to laugh it off, because she said it in front of 12 other people (while I was in the middle of a fucking presentation on kindness, I can't make this shit up), but then I went and cried in my car for 20 minutes and went through a McDonald's drive-thru to eat my feelings.

That's another problem, I just did the math: I've been eating around 3,500 calories a day in fast food. I'm a full time college student who does research, has an internship, and has a job, meaning I'm on campus from 9am-8pm with no breaks. I go home and fall asleep, wake up at the last possible minute, so I don't have time to cook or go to the gym. I understand I'm making excuses for myself and it's a cop out, but I still manage to hate myself enough to not want to change.

My depression and weight gain is killing me. I've suffered from body dysmorphia since I was 12. I used to weigh 100 pounds and everyone always complimented me on how thin I was, while I flaunted my body in my size 00 jeans. I feel like as I have gained weight, then became overweight, and now probably even qualify as almost obese, my identity as a skinny little girl has been crushed by a fat ogre who stuffs her mouth with taco bell $1 burritos and fucking cries all day. 

Earlier today I had the thought that it would be easier to die than it would be to gain weight. I don't know why I'm posting this, but it's probably just a cry for help. I want to feel beautiful and healthy but I know it's for all the wrong reasons. 

I also feel like I'm going to be attacked for saying these things. It might just be my insecurity, but I don't want to undermine the successes of those who are bigger than me and have lost weight. I feel like this is probably more mental for me than it is physical.

TL;DR: I feel fat and it makes me want to kill myself."
48ocng,0,2016-03-02,Where are all of the non-web jobs?,Roxinos,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/48ocng/where_are_all_of_the_nonweb_jobs/,"I graduated back in December 2014 and got an internship right out of college with an enterprise software company (C#, .NET, web, all that jazz). Even before the internship, I had a very limited interest in web development or web-related technologies and after it I can say that I just don't care.

So for almost a year now I've been applying for jobs. I've applied to over 150 jobs according to my records, and that's after having filtered out what feels like 90% of jobs available. I've given in multiple times and applied for web development jobs, but I have no real knowledge of web-related technologies and absolutely zero interest in web-related technologies, so those interviews wouldn't go very well if they did happen (which isn't likely given my resume).

And what non-web jobs *are* available seem like senior-level only.

So what do I do? Where are all of the junior non-web jobs?"

###**| Summary**

***

&amp;nbsp;

*...A suspenseful tale, with more than a handful of taboo twists.*

&amp;nbsp;

*Sweet Tooth* is about Samantha, a big woman, who - with the help of an eccentric younger man - finally overcomes her life-long sweet tooth. Expect a surreal, playful story about a unique Dom/Sub relationship, told in eight gloriously *messy* chapters.

&amp;nbsp;

[Links to all chapters of *Sweet Tooth* in the comments below.]

&amp;nbsp;

***

###**| Author’s Note**

***

&amp;nbsp;

Before we start, a quick word; *just between you and me, dear Reader*. If you intend to read *Sweet Tooth*, then this will be the first step on a long journey, one which we will be taking together; *so why not stop now, talk awhile?*

&amp;nbsp;

I’ve always struggled with the notion of giving my stories “tags”. The OCD part of my brain loves the *idea* of them, but the story-teller in me hates the notion of spoiling the twists and turns of a tale (even the most obligatory twist and turns). So, as far as giving *Sweet Tooth* tags, we’ll keep it real simple: *BBW, Bondage, Dom/Sub, Foodplay, m/F.* To say anything more than that, I’m afraid, would spoil what I have in store for later chapters.

&amp;nbsp;

I really do hope you enjoy this bizarre little tale as much as I’ve enjoyed writing it; though, to be honest, I’d understand if you didn’t. *Sweet Tooth* is a story that caters to a very specific appetite: one with insatiable cravings. The state of mind I was in while writing this story felt not unlike that of a child, who compulsively shovels handful after handful of candy into their mouth, despite knowing it won’t make them feel very good.

&amp;nbsp;

Oh, I should mention now that any and all feedback is greatly appreciated. I can stomach a tough review, don’t worry. No sincere critique is too nit-picky. And PM’s are perfectly welcome, too. The corrections that I do make will all be credited at the bottom of each post. Every couple of chapters or so, I'm going to check-in again with another *Author's Note*, once there's more for me to talk about. *Until then, dear Reader...*

###**| ONE:** *Samantha Leaves Work Early*

***

&amp;nbsp;

Samantha sat at her desk, anxiously chewing on a lollipop stick, while scanning the office for co-workers. She spotted Simon, the intern, brewing coffee over in the break room; and Meghan, the boss’s latest bombshell of a secretary, who’s head was currently bent over the photocopier, trying to unjam what looked like a particularly nasty tangle of shredded paper. *The coast is clear…*

&amp;nbsp;

*No one would notice if I did it, right now,* Samantha thought to herself, feeling her heart begin to pound against her chest. *Right now, I could… Just,* right *now…*

&amp;nbsp;

Still clenching the plastic lollipop stick between her teeth, Samantha glanced back down at her phone, which sat on-top of her lap, like a bridge between her round thighs. The text message she’d received a minute ago still lingered on the screen, stubbornly, as if to give her no option but to submit: *'change of plans. meet at my place. 2 pm. no later.'* Just then, another text appeared before Samantha's eyes, directly below the first: *'sorry. you’ll have to leave work early.'* And another: *'happy birthday, princess. see you soon.'*

&amp;nbsp;

Samantha reached into the drawer of her desk and pulled out a fresh lollipop. *Hm, strawberry.* She tore the plastic wrapping off, discarded it in the trashcan under her desk, then tossed the sucker back into her mouth, like an alcoholic taking a shot of whiskey. Samantha gnawed on the lollipop madly, grinding her teeth against the crystaline mass of sugar, still watching for any sign of her boss, Mr. Creighton.

&amp;nbsp;

*Right now,* Samantha decided. *Go* right *now…*

&amp;nbsp;

Meghan looked up from the photocopier briefly as Samantha strolled past, but she didn’t seem to register her co-worker’s early departure. *Phew*, Samantha thought, continuing to make her way toward the door at the end of the corridor. She was suddenly feeling very self-aware of how little her body-type suited itself to stealthy scenarios such as this one.

&amp;nbsp;

As Samantha walked passed the break room, Simon waved to her through the glass walls, wearing a grin that seemed decidedly out of place to her. One phrase repeated in Samantha's head, like a paranoid drum, synchronizing itself to the tremendous throb of her heart beat: *He caught me. He caught me. He caught me.* Then: *He knows. He knows. He knows.* Samantha took a deep breath, walking a little faster now. *He’ll tell. He’ll tell. He’ll tell.*

&amp;nbsp;

But a moment later, Simon casually lowered his eyes back down to the coffee brewing in-front of him, still wearing that same oddly toothy smile. He hadn’t actually acknowledged anything out of the ordinary, Samantha realized. *Interns are just naturally creepy people,* she thought, closing the distance to the staircase at a brisk pace.

&amp;nbsp;

Before exiting through the door, Samantha chanced a quick glance over her shoulder. Meghan was still occupied by the photocopier, cursing at it under her breath. Simon appeared to have spilt coffee onto his tie and was desperately trying to soak it out with a napkin. *Lets hope no know notices I’m gone,* she thought, before disappearing…

About a year ago, I moved to Florida with my now ex and found a job that boosted my career in an incredible way. 

I manage the entire internet department including managing the CRM, updating the website, responding to all incoming leads and making sure our salespeople are following up, sending the right content, following the plan etc. I created all brand new email templates, set up a system and rebranded the entire dealership (created a new logo, templates, facebook page). I create bulk emails for sales and service and have almost tripled our internet sales percentage as well gotten our response time to under 8 minutes (which for a manual response in this market is pretty good).

Well, I've only been at this job for 6 months. Last week, I got the call that my grandma finally needed someone to look over her as her health is worsening. I've talked to anyone in my family that can help and while they're able to contribute, they're lives are just too demanding and they live too far away to provide a daily check in/shopping needs, driving to appointments and such.

So, I decided I want to move back to take care of her and since I'm relocating, I can find somewhere closer. 

However, I'm in a really bad spot. I have a 5 month gap on my resume from May until October because the job market was so bad down here that I couldn't find anything. Even receptionist jobs weren't even calling me back. I was primarily a freelancer for a few years including while I was in school, during my two internships, and my year long stint working as a wedding videographer. 

This job kind of fell into my lap and it's an incredible opportunity. But I can't stay. My problem is that I have no idea what to look for.

There don't seem to be a lot of positions open where I need to be for what I do and I don't know what other job my skills translate to. My current manager is 100% behind me on this and has even offered to help me format my resume and such to help better my chances. 

I'm just so lost and I'm running out of time. And it's even worse now because I'm living with my ex and the only way to get out is to move back home- which I can't do without a job. 

What do my skills translate to? And how I can speed along the process?

tl;dr I'm an Internet Manager at a recovering car dealership who has rebranded the dealership and overhauled their internet department. I have to move back to my home state and there aren't many openings for my specific position. What jobs do my qualifications fit and how I can speed the process up as I only have 3 months?

Thoughts?,CSStudent15,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/48okle/coopinternship_requires_taking_2_semesters_off/,"First of all I want to thank everyone on this reddit, as a recent lurker I felt I had a strong advantage in the job-search over my fellow students who weren't as informed as me. 

To my main point I am a Junior CS major. I am in the process of interviewing for a few different internships, one in particular is for Ashland. I live in the south so cost of living is much cheaper, the pay is $18 an hour which I imagine is probably above average for the area/position. My department head informs me that the intern training program is very well ran and they offer several options for concentration (server infrastructure, development etc.) So for me every aspect of the job seems great, but I'm not sure about extending my graduation a year.

Essentially they want you to go to school one semester a year and work the other semester and over breaks for 2 years. Would you all consider this a strong negative? I would be making less than any post-grad job for 2 years, however the experience would certainly help my chances of getting a higher paying job in the future.

This isn't a question of internship or no internship, obviously I would do this over not having any pre-grad experience. I just want to see other's opinions on the pros and cons of this scenario.

It's all good.
I support a constitutional amendment that standardizes and federalizes the state primary process. I think this monumental undertaking would make the very important issue of California's late primary moot. The current system is a dated and bigoted institution that varies so vastly between states that it is untenable. We can debate the finer points but shouldn't all states hold their primary in the same week using standard rules of process and procedure? Shouldn't districting rules also be standardized? It will be a yyyyuuuuge debate in Congress, on cable news from pundits (who loathes pundits? can I get a yup yup). Who knows how or if this change is even possible but the discussion has to get out there.
Let us list all the many ways states like to circumvent our ability to not only vote but to have a meaningful one:
Gerrymandering
Look at Louisiana, Maryland or North Carolina’s districting maps; any of those scary 8bit dragon shaped districts are prime examples.
SET SCENE: It’s a humid and languid night in Baton Rouge. No hint of a breeze. The curtains lie limp and moist. 
PICTURE A MAN: white, sweaty, chewing a half smoked cheap cigar while rubbing his glistening, bald pate. &lt;picture Divine playing Tracy Turnblad’s dad in Hairspray&gt;
ACTION: He gazes out the window praying for just a tiny sway of the Spanish moss hanging from the town squares ancient live oak. But it does not come never seems to in August. 
LOUISIANA DISTRICT MAP DESIGNER: &lt;with his tongue sticking out in deep thought&gt; - ""Let's see, we need to meander on around that black area &lt;you know he said negro or more likely the big N word but let’s keep this clean&gt; and then mosey on back to this fancified white area. &lt;hums happily to self&gt; ""Can't very well have them bringing down our property values, their kids comin' to our schools and well…..con-sarn-it!..... they should stay with their own kind. They vote over there we vote here it’s all for the best.” &lt;smiles up to the heavens&gt; “Really it's a kindness I'm doing.” 
CUT TO SCENE: &lt;screened in porch with man draped across a rattan chaise. An off-kilter ceiling fan’s metallic scratches competes with the thick sound of ciccadas chirping&gt; . A man sleeps well and soundly knowing he has done a good day’s work.

You know those silly games that can end in coin tosses? Where votes have been tallied from post-it notes? Well that's just, if I may quote some awesome cuss wordery, “batsh*t crazy!” **Shout out to Senator Lindsey Graham &lt;eek never thought I’d have one positive thing to say about this man&gt; for calling Drumpf out on the cra cra**
Superdelegate 
Oh WTH! Step back. This one pisses me off to no end. One voter has been deemed super so their vote means more than just a delegate which means a super vote is more important than mine? Does every superdelegate submit where their contributions come from including Citizens United dark money? I'd like to see their tax returns, know who's paying them speaking fees and how many Banc Suisse accounts they launder their bribes through. You just know some of these supers are for sale. **Alan Grayson let the internet decide his superdelegate vote. That’s pretty damn cool**
Electoral College 
FML. That this even has to be discussed as the ultimate POS idea confounds me.
Republic:
We are not a true democracy. We are a Republic; where the voices of the many are represented by the elected few. I believe, on the whole, this system works. Could you imagine a one-human/one-vote system where every legislative bill, amendment to that bill, riders on that bill has to be voted on by the American People? Even if we could easily and securely vote through a website it would be a clusterf*ck off epic proportion. Let’s see how many of us would’ve wanted to read the 274,559 words, ""No Child Left Behind Act,"" 2001, Rep. John Boehner (R-Ohio) or H.R. 3962, the Affordable HealthCare for America Act (AHCAA) coming in at 234,812 words and almost 2,000 pages of PDF gold. “Hells to the No,” would’ve been the resounding response. So that’s where we require our elected officials to represent us and our best interests. They have their unpaid law-clerking interns read these white whales so we don’t have too. But I believe the one-human/one-vote in both the presidential primaries and the final election should be based on the Popular Vote. Lest we forget the Al Gore/President George W. Bush/Justice Scalia debacle of justice

So my day is going great already and then I come home to a package from /u/holydiver6 and holy shit.. this man spoiled me. Two day shipping and all of these goodies! I'm excited to try cubans for the first time and continue to build up my humidor.

48oxus,1,2016-03-02,Handling multiple internships interviews with an offer on the table,Aofwa,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/48oxus/handling_multiple_internships_interviews_with_an/,"Hi there,

I was recently given an offer from company A but it is my least favorable offer internship (but definitely still good).

I am also currently interviewing for company B and company C, either of which are my top choice. I am in the 3rd interview with company B and just finished the second interview with company C. All interviews with company B and C seem to have gone really well.

Last week when I received the offer from company A I told the recruiter I would need at least 10 days to make a decision, however the tenth day will be tomorrow.

Company B and C will most likely make a final decision either next week or the week after that. I'm also waiting on a response from company Z, but they will most likely not find me as a match.

Any ideas how I should handle this situation?

48p6rt,50,2016-03-02,"Got hired as a 'Transportation Planning Analyst', 99% of my job is editing newsletters and outreach. Looking for advice please!",ningus,urbanplanning,https://www.reddit.com/r/urbanplanning/comments/48p6rt/got_hired_as_a_transportation_planning_analyst_99/,"*Edit: Update*

**Wow, thanks for all comments! It definitely gave me a lot of perspective and a hefty dose of reality. Coming out of school, where the sky's the limit of term of your ideas and innovations, the change in pace, dynamics, and politics has been difficult for me to grasp. Seeing my fellow graduates/friends move into positions with planning departments in progressive cities or consulting companies definitely doesn't help. To clarify, this is a Canadian suburban municipality nestled in a car-loving and historically conservative constituent (went liberal for last year's elections, yay Trudeau). Anyhow, you guys have given me a lot of good points to think about. Work hard, poke around other projects, stay curious, and be on the look out on the horizon for opportunities. If the prospects don't change in 1-2 years, time to move on. The job market is tough for new grads, especially in planning, so I should be grateful to have a job to complain about :p**



For context: I have a masters in Urban Planning, and internship stints. I graduated 6 months ago; ambition levels (and probably ego) are pretty damn high. 

I recently got hired at a municipal planning office as a Planning Analyst for the Transportation Planning division. The job post included stuff that was pretty typical of entry-level planning: 

* Administer planning applications and processes
* Evaluate a variety of planning proposals and issues
* Research, analyze, monitor and compile demographic, land use, transportation and other related planning information. 
AND
* Knowledge related to TDM programming an asset. 

During the interview, they stressed the importance of working in different projects, trying stuff out, learning as much as possible yet taking the time to learn stuff, etc. Sounds like a dream right? Well, i'm slowly finding out that my position is the one that *everyone* tries to escape. My days are 99% doing outreach and editing newsletters for a grassroots TDM program that gets very little support in the department. The other 1% is attending meetings, listening to other people's cool projects. And people I've spoken to who've previously held this position for a few years say that they had to burn bridges with management or flat out quit to see a glimpse of a site plan/development application/anything related to professional planning. And everyone agrees that this ""Planning Analyst"" position, the way its described vs. what is actually is, is deceiving. 

Now, I understand that Transportation Demand Management promotion *is* an important aspect to transportation planning and I'm happy to be a part of it. But I want to be a professional planner, and to spend x number of years designing promo material and tabling events, while never learning how to do the most basic planning tasks seems effing depressing. Not to mention, Sr. Planners are backlogged with work. 

Based on my co-worker's experience (same position but been there for ~1 year now), if you ask to shadow someone else's work or a tiny assignment, our manager (who conducted the interview btw) says no, and responds with something like, ""you're still learning, one day we'll talk about your concerns"", and then assign a menial task to distract you. 

I don't expect to be  given a whole lot of responsibility, but based on other's accounts, you're stuck doing grassroot program promotion forever, and if you ask to help out on another project, you get shut down. I really need advice on how to go about this: navigating the politics of an office environment where everyone works in silos and convince upper management they're wasting resources by shutting out Jr. Planners. 

TL/DR: Sr. Planners are backlogged with work, while the juniors are given outreach/promotional/newsletter work and twiddling their thumbs. Absolutely no approval to even TRY technical planning work. GTFO or 'suck it up - be glad you have a job'?

48pfju,2,2016-03-02,Looking for some mentoring advice in GIS for a recent graduate.,MarcoIago,gis,https://www.reddit.com/r/gis/comments/48pfju/looking_for_some_mentoring_advice_in_gis_for_a/,"I am a recent graduate with a degree in geographic information science.  I have solid work experience in remote sensing and imagery analysis from serving in the Army and the DOD but I am looking to transition into the larger area of  GIS where my experience is more limited.  I have had a summer internship with a state agency where I obtained some practical experience in the field making maps, collecting GPS data points, and working with databases, and doing some research.  On my own I have become familiar with Python and arcpy and know how to work with scripts.  I would like to know what types of things I should be doing to improve my chances of finding a job.  What types of jobs should I focus on in my job search that are more geared towards the entry level?  Are there any additional skills that I should be working on in my down time? 

Here is a list of skills/software that I have listed on my resume that I have learned or developed:

 ArcGIS Desktop 10.x (ArcMap, ArcCatalog, ArcToolbox, 3D Analyst, Spatial Analyst, Network Analyst, ModelBuilder), ArcSDE, ArcGIS Online, ERDAS Imagine,  Google Earth, Windows, Microsoft Office, Microsoft SQL Server, HTML, CSS, Python

I would appreciate any mentoring advice or just some tips that anyone can offer.  Thanks."

I think my resume is pretty good but I'm having trouble with my cover letter. Anyway here it is. I would love some input!

This is my 4th quarter at Cal Poly Pomona after transferring from Mt. San Antonio College which I stayed in for 2 years. I am pursuing an Electrical and Computer Engineering Tech. degree. I am applying for this internship position because I believe that I can exceed in it. 

I’ve attended a play session at Naughty Dog and while I was there I was responsible of testing their game’s design and overall mechanics. I explored as much of the game as I could, and tested the different systems and features in the game and as a result I constructed my feedback and input and had a discussion with the developers of the game about what they could do to improve it. At the age of 15 I took an exit exam and started pursuing my degree in the engineering field because not only did I want to become an engineer, but I wanted to start building a good skill set through college and work experience. Thankfully my efforts have paid off. Game testing, developing and finishing team projects, working at a tech shop, and being a manager and tutor have helped me mold excellent research, organization, and problem-solving skills. I work great within a team, meet deadlines, and am proficient with Microsoft Office. On my free time I’m an avid gamer and have an obsession with Marvel and DC superheroes. I watch all the movies, play the games, buy figures, and read comics. 

I would welcome the opportunity to meet with you and show you how I can contribute to your company’s growth through this summer 2016 videogame production internship. You can reach me at email.com or by phone at Phone Number. Thank you for your time and consideration."

&amp;nbsp;

***

###**| Summary**

***

&amp;nbsp;

*...A suspenseful tale, with more than a handful of taboo twists.*

&amp;nbsp;

*Sweet Tooth* is about Samantha, a big woman, who - with the help of an eccentric younger man - finally overcomes her life-long sweet tooth. Expect a surreal, playful story about a unique Dom/Sub relationship, told in eight gloriously *messy* chapters.

&amp;nbsp;

[Links to all chapters of *Sweet Tooth* in the comments below.]

&amp;nbsp;

***

###**| Author’s Note**

***

&amp;nbsp;

Before we start, a quick word; *just between you and me, dear Reader*. If you intend to read *Sweet Tooth*, then this will be the first step on a long journey, one which we will be taking together; *so why not stop now, talk awhile?*

&amp;nbsp;

I’ve always struggled with the notion of giving my stories “tags”. The OCD part of my brain loves the *idea* of them, but the story-teller in me hates the notion of spoiling the twists and turns of a tale (even the most obligatory twist and turns). So, as far as giving *Sweet Tooth* tags, we’ll keep it real simple: *BBW, Bondage, Dom/Sub, Foodplay, m/F.* To say anything more than that, I’m afraid, would spoil what I have in store for later chapters.

&amp;nbsp;

I really do hope you enjoy this bizarre little tale as much as I’ve enjoyed writing it; though, to be honest, I’d understand if you didn’t. *Sweet Tooth* is a story that caters to a very specific appetite: one with insatiable cravings. The state of mind I was in while writing this story felt not unlike that of a child, who compulsively shovels handful after handful of candy into their mouth, despite knowing it won’t make them feel very good.

&amp;nbsp;

Oh, I should mention now that any and all feedback is greatly appreciated. I can stomach a tough review, don’t worry. No sincere critique is too nit-picky. And PM’s are perfectly welcome, too. The corrections that I do make will all be credited at the bottom of each post. Every couple of chapters or so, I'm going to check-in again with another *Author's Note*, once there's more for me to talk about. *Until then, dear Reader...*

###**| ONE:** *Samantha Leaves Work Early*

***

&amp;nbsp;

Samantha sat at her desk, anxiously chewing on a lollipop stick, while scanning the office for co-workers. She spotted Simon, the intern, brewing coffee over in the break room; and Meghan, the boss’s latest bombshell of a secretary, who’s head was currently bent over the photocopier, trying to unjam what looked like a particularly nasty tangle of shredded paper. *The coast is clear…*

&amp;nbsp;

*No one would notice if I did it, right now,* Samantha thought to herself, feeling her heart begin to pound against her chest. *Right now, I could… Just,* right *now…*

&amp;nbsp;

Still clenching the plastic lollipop stick between her teeth, Samantha glanced back down at her phone, which sat on-top of her lap, like a bridge between her round thighs. The text message she’d received a minute ago still lingered on the screen, stubbornly, as if to give her no option but to submit: *'change of plans. meet at my place. 2 pm. no later.'* Just then, another text appeared before Samantha's eyes, directly below the first: *'sorry. you’ll have to leave work early.'* And another: *'happy birthday, princess. see you soon.'*

&amp;nbsp;

Samantha reached into the drawer of her desk and pulled out a fresh lollipop. *Hm, strawberry.* She tore the plastic wrapping off, discarded it in the trashcan under her desk, then tossed the sucker back into her mouth, like an alcoholic taking a shot of whiskey. Samantha gnawed on the lollipop madly, grinding her teeth against the crystaline mass of sugar, still watching for any sign of her boss, Mr. Creighton.

&amp;nbsp;

*Right now,* Samantha decided. *Go* right *now…*

&amp;nbsp;

Meghan looked up from the photocopier briefly as Samantha strolled past, but she didn’t seem to register her co-worker’s early departure. *Phew*, Samantha thought, continuing to make her way toward the door at the end of the corridor. She was suddenly feeling very self-aware of how little her body-type suited itself to stealthy scenarios such as this one.

&amp;nbsp;

As Samantha walked passed the break room, Simon waved to her through the glass walls, wearing a grin that seemed decidedly out of place to her. One phrase repeated in Samantha's head, like a paranoid drum, synchronizing itself to the tremendous throb of her heart beat: *He caught me. He caught me. He caught me.* Then: *He knows. He knows. He knows.* Samantha took a deep breath, walking a little faster now. *He’ll tell. He’ll tell. He’ll tell.*

&amp;nbsp;

But a moment later, Simon casually lowered his eyes back down to the coffee brewing in-front of him, still wearing that same oddly toothy smile. He hadn’t actually acknowledged anything out of the ordinary, Samantha realized. *Interns are just naturally creepy people,* she thought, closing the distance to the staircase at a brisk pace.

&amp;nbsp;

Before exiting through the door, Samantha chanced a quick glance over her shoulder. Meghan was still occupied by the photocopier, cursing at it under her breath. Simon appeared to have spilt coffee onto his tie and was desperately trying to soak it out with a napkin. *Lets hope no know notices I’m gone,* she thought, before disappearing…

48ppxd,1,2016-03-02,I'm so exhausted and scared and failure feels like the only constant in my life.,corneliuspudge,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/48ppxd/im_so_exhausted_and_scared_and_failure_feels_like/,"I'm really not sure how to start this.

In Brandon Sanderson's Stormlight Archive, the world is constantly buffeted by terrible storms called high storms. They're essentially non-circular hurricanes. Just massive, impending acts of god. The worst is the storm wall, which is what the front of the storm is called. It's essentially a solid wall of wind and power and debris. The wind is more than fast enough to sweep humans away, their corpses lost forever.

That's how I feel. I feel like everything in life is an ever-encroaching storm wall.

After a couple of years on Paxil and semi-regular counselling appointments at my college, I thought I was good. I really, really did. Nothing really felt imminent and I never felt like I was falling behind everyone.

Absolutely no real world circumstances have changed, but my entire world crashed around me this semester. I started missing classes. My part time job at Domino's was basically the only thing I would get out of bed for. It's fast, easy money and it made me feel somewhat accomplished. I started working 35-45 hours a week and ignoring the stress about missing my classes. I lived in bed when I wasn't at work. Sleep constantly escaped me and I was always tired. I rarely ate and when I did, I would always over eat.

I was supposed to graduate in May (a year late, due to some credit issues). That's off the table now. My adviser, tried reaching out to me several times and the idea of responding to him made it hard to breathe.

Saturday, after hours of anxiety, I grabbed lunch with him and talked. I left feeling good. I met with my other professors on Monday and they've all been incredibly supportive. I really felt like I was turning a corner.

Then I came to SETC. I'm a theatre major and SETC (South Eastern Theatre Conference) is one of the largest theatre events in the country. It's a gigantic 4 day conference filled with workshops and master classes and auditions and interviews.

And I feel so unprepared. I feel like a joke. I haven't actively worked on a show in months. I haven't written anything in just as long, which makes being an aspiring playwright hard. My resume feels so incomplete and laughable. Who would want to hire me? Hell, now that I have to have a summer class, am I even able to intern over the summer?

Everyone else seems so sure and happy. My classmates, who I'm convinced can't stand me, are all staying in a different hotel. I asked, months ago, if I could room with them, and they shot me down. The conference arranged for me to share a room with some other attendees, but neither of them have shown up. I'm in this swanky hotel room and so alone. Even if these strangers were here, I would still be alone.

I'm flailing and drowning and spiraling and my thoughts just always return to self harm. I'm not sure I can do 3 more days of this. I'm so tired and worried and scared. Life isn't slowing down and I can't catch up to anyone.

My closest friend is across the country, I'm in debt, my parents are in debt to help put me through college and I'm petrified of having to tell them what a failure I am and what a failure I will be. Every action and inaction feels as if it's going to follow me for decades and shape my life.

In American Gods, (spoilers for a 15 year old book) the main character Shadow dies for a bit. It's oblivion. Nothingness. And when he comes back, he's rested. Death nourished him. He got to slow down and not worry and not feel. When I first read AG in high school, this really unsettled me. I was deeply religious and the idea that someone might long for nonexistence really didn't sit well with me.

But I understand it, now. I understand how death was restful for Shadow. I understand because of how jealous I am of him. And I know that's the kind of thought I shouldn't be having, but honestly, the idea of nothing is just so...the longing I have for death almost feels like home sickness.

I just feel lost and I don't know what to do. Even as I write this, I'm convinced it's meaningless and I'm just hoping that having all of these thoughts outside my head will keep them from terrorizing me. I have like no confidence in that happening, but I'm desperate."

I'm currently a Master's student in I/O Psychology. My program had a lot of alumni intern at large companies on the west coast, but I've recently moved to Texas. Before I left, I interned at a large vehicle manufacturing center in benefits. I answered general benefits questions and taught myself infopath, KRONOS, Workday, and Sharepoint. I managed a portion of the intranet website. Most importantly, I filed our U.S. workers comp claims (for  ~10k employees) and interacted with the HRBPS, employees, managers, claims adjusters, and employees.

I'm now looking to secure another internship or generalist position in Texas and I'm finding that most positions want 3 years of experience, with some wanting as many as 8. Are there any skills or things I can do in my spare time to make myself a better applicant? I'm well versed in ADA, selection procedures, FMLA, and federal workers comp laws. My classes have covered leadership development, training, compensation, data analysis, and a lot of other HR related topics. I would love to study for the PHR but the internship was only 5 months long so I don't qualify as of yet. Is there anything I'm missing out on doing to be a great applicant?"

So today, I was just walking about, when they fact that summer was quickly approaching dawned upon me. I've applied to various jobs, research positions, and internships for summers, but I suddenly became extremely worried about what I could do if all of these opportunities don't pan out. So I started trying to work out a bit of a schedule or agenda of things I want to get done during the summer, including learning a few more programming languages, doing some small side projects, etc. 

The main thing I want to do though, is to work on a mid-scale project. Like something that will take up 3 or 4 months, and applying what I've learned in engineering design. Like finding an opportunity within a community, making a team, developing the objectives and requirements, building/prototyping and making a change for that community. This is something I've done as part of class, and something I'd like
to take forward into a summer opportunity, especially with the increased time I'll have.

I've been talking with a couple of people about this to work together, but most of them seem to be busy while some of them have a slight interest I guess?
 
So I was wondering if any of the great people at /r/engineeringstudents has experience with these types of things could give me advice on how to get started, and whether there are competitions or such that I can attend. 

Sorry if this has been asked already, and thanks in advance! "
48q501,4,2016-03-02,Me [24 M] unrequited love and long term effects,SurfboardINMouth,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/48q501/me_24_m_unrequited_love_and_long_term_effects/,"   So, I realized I was gay around the age of 20. I basically knew but accepted it then. I had a crush on a best friend in high school and we hung out daily. It's extremely common for all of us, gay or straight to have to deal with having feelings and the other does not. 

  My love for my friend grew because I wasn't keeping it in check nor did I know what was happening. I would cry after he left when we just hung out for a few days straight. He was everything. I would wait for him to log into facebook and chat with him. I would time my messages so they weren't too quick. I did everything I could to not seem obsessed which further made me obsessed. I did this kind of pull in and pull out social tightrope walk for four years. We stayed friends after I came out. I gave him a very skinny idea of what I was going through (not saying I obsessed over him but telling him I liked him a little, as to not freak him out) and we are still very good friends now. He goes to college way up north so we just text. I don't have those feelings anymore and am glad. It was a deep dark hole of repression from myself and from what I desired, someone to care back like he did but more so. He's still a great friend. 

  In college I started going on dates. Nothing amounted to anything as it was me just feeling out who I was, what I liked and how to go about it. Online dating stuff. Meeting for coffee. No fooling around.

  Two years ago I had my first boyfriend for two months. I didn't feel the spark but our humor matched. His personality clashed with mine though. He never expressed his care in ways that I was picking up. I always felt like he was always the subject. He simply stopped talking to me. I texted him to at least tell me we are over and he responded and said I wasn't worth his time. Plain as day. 

Had another guy who was great but again I didn't feel that spark or want and he had an internship in Oregon so we cut it off after a few months. 

Last March I had a guy. He was the one. I thought. Kind of. His personality was alright but again, no spark. He smoked and was addicted to foul smelling coffee. After five months he gets drunk and tells me he had feelings for his old girlfriend and that he just didn't feel anything for me. 

Fast forward to this fall and again, almost the same thing. I felt a little bit at first with this guy but we both fell out of it after three months in and dragged it on until now, February. 

So I guess, I'm trying to connect dots here. I've been with four men, in phaux relationships where we try to cobble something together, maybe it's the nature of online dating. I don't really know what to feel in a relationship anymore. I'm scared to feel something because of the past and I'm scared to try because they might not feel the same a few months in. I'm not obsessive with guys, I know that I'm actually a pretty great guy. I need to focus less on relationships and focus on my schooling. I need more organic relationships. It's just a little tough. 

   
**tl;dr**: Are the strong feelings of unrequited love I held onto in high school pulling me down and making me undesirable for new relationships?"

When I started college I had a few friends from high school and managed to meet some new people who seemed nice, even if we didn't have much in common. Since then I've gradually drifted away from every single one of them until now here I am, halfway through my junior year of college and completely isolated. Call it a combination of social anxiety and school stress that caused it, I guess. It's probably mostly my fault. You could count on one hand the number of text messages I've gotten from a non-family member so far this year. My family are probably the only ones that care about me. If it weren't for them I would be completely lost.

I don't really see a way to turn this situation around at this point. Not until I'm out of college anyway. Everyone has already found their friends. I never speak to anyone in my classes if I can help it. Actually, I probably go entire days without speaking more frequently than I realize. The closest thing I have to socialization is posting things on my tumblr blog and hoping someone likes it.

The part that has me the most worried is that I've done extremely well in school while isolated like this. It turns out it's easy to get straight A's and great internship offers when you have literally nothing to do but stress about schoolwork, grades, and jobs. Now when I start thinking about how I might find a friend there's a voice in my head that says I won't be able to keep up this performance if I have friends, that I'll be more successful if I just stay alone. It's a hard thing to fight against."

Anyone else do something similar?,supercow_,computerscience,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/48qfph/cs_intern_interview_embarrassed_i_bombed_this/,"This is somewhat of a vent post. Sorry. 


I had a CS intern interview today. Seemed to have good rapour with the interviewer. She liked my answers to the behavioral-type questions, problem-solving stuff, and general Java questions (what is overwriting a method, what are all the primitive types and their sizes, etc). Then there were a few technical questions. She asked me, what is wrong with this piece of code? (There was a little bit more interference code but this is the basic problem):

_________________________________________________
Instructions: The code should print 10, how can you fix it?

int total = 0;

for (int i = 1; i &lt; 4; i++)

total = total +i;

System.out.println(total)
_________________________________________________


I was running off 3-4 hours of sleep the last two nights and stressed because of a midterm later in the day so I wasn't in peak shape, but still, this is the type of thing I explain to students every day (I'm a CS tutor)! I figured I'd talk through the problem to explain how I usually work through these problems to show students what is happening. So I wrote down 'total = 0' and 'i = 1' to track the variables as I iterated through the loop, crossing off the numbers and updating them as I went. when i = 4 the loop fails its condition and stops. Total is 6. I got to that point and then just blanked. Do I add some extra variable to keep track of i outside of the loop? What is the trick to this problem? After maybe 20-30 seconds of mumbling over the problem again trying to figure it out she says ""I'll give you a hint its in the forloop"". I'm feeling kind of frozen for some reason. And she mentions that I've already counted up the numbers with 'i' and pointed to where I had written (i=1,2,3,4). And then I'm like ""oh...well I guess I could just iterate the loop once more by changing i &lt; 4 to i &lt; 5. She said ""yeah, I think you were overthinking that one"".


But I probably spent a few minutes on that question... and had a little guidance (even though I was eventually able to solve it on my own). I then went on to solve the other technical question that was a bitwise (a|b) question that was harder and more obscure before the interview concluded. 


I don't have a ton riding on this internship, but I've been kicking myself all day! I literally solve this type of problem (and ones much harder) all day. I just froze/blanked out. Do you think I still have any chance of making it to the next round of interviews even though I couldn't code my way out of a paper bag on this one question? Has anyone else made an equally face-palming interview mistake? Doh! Thanks for letting me rant. "
48qsl7,1,2016-03-03,[UPDATE #2] I think my work history is preventing me from getting interviews. Trying to get my career started.,amotion578,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/48qsl7/update_2_i_think_my_work_history_is_preventing_me/,"[Previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/4581va/update_i_think_my_work_history_is_preventing_me/), if you wanna read my time line of events.

Yesterday, I passed my second A+ exam and got the certification! If you're like me wondering if it's worth it to take, if you can float the $360 USD (coupons for 10% off each exam for the win!) it's worth to have just for the self-gratification being able to put that down on your resume.

That being said, I did exactly that. I recently saw a post on my local Craigslist looking for a field hardware tech. Naturally it's a recruiter across the country, but a 30 minute phone call with him at the end of his day Monday was really refreshing. The client company provides hardware support for Dell, a cert is required for Dell, and is supposedly free upon offer of employment and open book.

$16.50 an hour plus mileage in my own vehicle. Based on what it sounds like, 30-40 hours M-F all on-site up to 25 miles around my (relatively small) city.

Hours before, I interviewed at my local college for an IT Internship. I haven't heard from the manager since that day (said he was going to be busy this week), but I got a tour of the asset deployment and help desk areas. I really, really, really, wish they'd skip the internship and go straight to hiring me part time for asset deployment. I struck a good chord with every single person I met along the interview, along with the manger who also happens to be a car guy.

Beyond that, still trying to get the State government to give me an interview for an IT job. Now that I've got a Cert on my belt I'm hoping one pans out. I was lucky enough to resubmit an open application before the deadline tomorrow for help desk- though they list Bachelors or Associates/2-3 years help desk exp as minimum requirements. We'll see how it pans out.

I think I've gotten on the right path here, thanks to this subreddit, /r/resumes, and /r/jobs! The only question is who is going to offer me a job first, and will I be able to continue my internship AND take the ONE CIS class I need to take this coming term at the same time?"
48qsyw,9,2016-03-03,"Me [22 F] with my ex-boyfriend [23 M] of a 2 year relationship. He broke up with me out of the blue with little explanation via text 6 months ago, and I haven't seen him face to face. Going to see him next week for the first time. Help.",goingcrazymeow,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/48qsyw/me_22_f_with_my_exboyfriend_23_m_of_a_2_year/,"Going to start this off by clarifying, I do not want to get back together with him WHATSOEVER. There were other problems with the relationship, and I'm angry with how he chose to break up with me. I simply want closure.

**Current situation:** I've moved out of my college town and home state to start my career. My job is going well, I've made a couple of friends but all my close friends are far away. I've tried to reach out, join social groups, I go to barre classes regularly, but most people I know here are just acquaintances. Life has been difficult lately too, with death in the family, a car accident, and my own health issues. This is one of many things I'm currently struggling with, but I'm seeing a therapist. I'm traveling back to my college town soon with some of my friends who have also graduated and moved away to just hang out and have a good time. He's still in school, so I might see him while he's there. 

**Current situation with him:** My ex and I have talked on and off since our breakup via text and very rarely phone. I've tried to cut off contact, but it doesn't last long. I've unfollowed him on all social media. Since my life has been pretty difficult lately, it's been easy to turn to him to vent and talk. He vents to me as well about various things in his life. With few other friends to turn to in this new state I'm living in, it's really easy to go to him since he's familiar, and he's offering friendship. He's agreed to meet while I'm in town next weekend.

**Relationship &amp; breakup backstory:** We met the first day, freshman year of college. We started dating two years later, and dated for two years after that. I got this job offer in another state pretty early on senior year, and in our second year of dating, he grew more and more open to the idea of long distance and by the end of it, really wanted to try. We had done distance briefly when I had an internship in this state the summer prior, and in my job it's super easy to move locations after working for a year, so distance seemed temporary. 

He visited me for a week after I moved, and vowed to make it work and said he really saw a future with me for the first time. During my senior year, I kind of secretly doubted that he would really want to try. His original plan was for us to break up as soon as I graduated. So, seeing him have this change of heart, and opening up to talk about seeing a future with me for the first time was huge. I cried tears of joy because I was so happy for us, and that our relationship had grown to that point. This was in September 2015. 

I drove him to the airport at the end of his visit, where he told me not to worry and that we'd see each other soon. He also asked me to book flight tickets to visit his parents for Thanksgiving (I've seen his family plenty of times before, this wasn't too big of a deal). I was excited though! And it was such a great week with him. I was such a happy gal. 

A couple days after he flew home I got around to booking these flight tickets. It was in the morning before work, and when I was about to press Confirm on the flight tickets, I messaged him to double check that the dates &amp; times worked. I was at work when he finally messaged back, and he said ""No they don't work, I'm breaking up with you"", offering little explanation. First he said his friends told him to, then he said he had always been in relationships in college and really wanted to be single for a year and was panicking (which I could understand). I asked him if he was breaking up with me because of distance - he said no. It was so shocking to me, we hadn't been fighting or arguing or anything at all.

Then he was dating someone new ONE WEEK LATER (or rather, someone old...he had dated this girl before, briefly (few weeks), earlier in college). That killed the only reason he gave for the breakup that actually made sense. This is a girl he's talked a lot of shit about, too, so it was kind of shocking that he was with her of all people. 

He also texted me an ""epiphany"" a few weeks ago saying that he's felt everything with her in such a short amount of time, which is a contrast to our relationship where he apparently did not feel anything, and didn't even love me for the last 5-6 months of our relationship, but was too lazy to say anything. WHAT THE FUCK. why did he not break up with me?! Most of all why would you just say that to somebody out of the blue?! what the fuck, man...And he didn't see how that was hurtful.

In conversation once I even said like...hey, this is sad that I'm still trying to get over this and you moved on so quickly. He said ""oh don't even worry!! it's okay this is natural. I ONLY MOVED ON BECAUSE I DIDN'T LOVE YOU FOR A LONG TIME TOWARDS THE END OF OUR RELATIONSHIP. PROBABLY 6 MONTHS.

Which is REALLY FUCKING ODD given that this time frame where he claims he didn't love me is the same time he started being a really great boyfriend, and also being more expressive with his affections and wanting to make distance work. During that time frame I also spent a lot of time with his family, whom he said liked me a lot.

I've asked if he's cheated on me, he said no. He did cheat on the girlfriend before me though. So I don't really know. He still claims that he had the best relationship ever with me, that I was a good girlfriend, etc., and that the reason for the breakup wasn't distance. So...things don't add up. I'm confused, you guys! He's also been REAL SKETCHY about this new girl. One week he'll say they're in a relationship, another week he'll say they're just casually dating. I'm pretty sure that to her she thinks they've been dating the entire time. I wonder if he did the same when he was dating me...playing down the relationship like that when talking to other girls. He also kept in touch with all of his ex's and ex-fwb's while we were together. Red flags that I guess I didn't see or care about....ugh
   
**Where I need advice:** Without much of an explanation for our breakup, it's been really hard. ESPECIALLY since he wants to be friends...and it's tempting at this time when I'm going through a lot and don't have a lot of people I know around me. Every time I've asked for an explanation, I don't get an answer. He also hasn't acknowledged that breaking up with me out of the blue while I was booking flight tickets to visit his parents was really difficult for me. When I see him face to face for the first time, I kind of want to confront this, but I don't know how. I don't want to be mean, that's not my intention. But, I feel like I need to see him face to face for some true closure (the last time I saw his face was when he was passionately kissing me goodbye at the airport proclaiming his love for me lol). I also think it would be so satisfying to have him explain or apologize to my face, or at least have him hear what it felt like in my shoes. I don't know. Should I say more? Should I even see him at all? I don't know. How do I do this... it'll be so odd since this is the first time I'm seeing him. I also need advice on getting over this. I have so many questions as to why this happened. Things seemed amazing towards the end of our relationship. I was really blindsided. Stories of similar experiences would also help... 

It's sad because I put a lot into the relationship, put a lot of effort, and made a lot of compromises. Looking back he didn't really do that at all. I suppose I was a fairweather girlfriend.

Hah...you know, this is very accurate detail and he does reddit on occasion so he might see this but I don't fucking care. He doesn't realize that the way he broke up with me was hurtful. And I think that bugs me the most.

**tl;dr**: My ex broke up with me suddenly out of the blue six months ago via text, and I'm about to see him face to face for the first time since we dated. I need advice on how to confront."
48qtgk,90,2016-03-03,The Lenten Fish Fry,Rick_Elskin,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/48qtgk/the_lenten_fish_fry/,"If you are like me, you don’t much care for stories of the paranormal or demon variety. For years, we’ve been fed these tales of terror through Poltergeist, the Omen, The Conjuring, etc. I never cared for them. They never frightened me and still don’t. Religious areas fascinate me, but nothing frightened me. That being said, I remember my first experience with the occult.
 
Growing up catholic meant a few things for me. Drinking is an acceptable sin, and fish fry during lent was a weekly affair. The adults would bring everyone together, and in the large basement kitchen of the catholic school, they would smoke, drink, and fry fish. Lent meant giving up certain indulgences, but fish, beer, and cigarettes were never an option. It was here that I had my first experience with the satanic paranormal. That cold Friday in March when Jonathan Oxenkiller went missing. 

We were to the school promptly at 5:45, just late enough for everyone to be off work and early enough to start drinking for a long weekend. Almost everyone in the area would come out to different areas for fish fry, and for us it was always the same 7-10 families. With 5 people a family at least, with one have 7 children, it could be a big affair. 
It was Friday, March 10th, 1989 when a new family showed up. They brought along a case of beer and some homemade hushpuppies, so they were quickly welcomed. They said they had moved from Madison, WI and were told by administrators of the Friday Night Fish Fry. They didn’t seem odd or out of place. The father looked like the other dads, the mom was bright and cheerful, and their son looked like he wanted to leave. All in all, they were like every family there, except for the fact that they has one 8 year old son and no other children around. These northern Catholic families, you see, are notorious for having 4+ kids. But they were friendly. 

I went over and introduced myself to the boy. I was 13, and really not in the mood to play, but I was friendly enough. The boy smiled, and said his name was Johnny Oxenkiller. My first thought was how cool that last name was. With a name like Elskin, any name sounded cool, while mine sounded like someone coming off of Novocain. 

We sat around and I asked him how he liked it here. He said he did. But kept mentioning how they were going back home real soon. I took him as a young kid who didn’t like the idea of leaving things behind, and his parents probably kept assuring him that they would be headed back soon. Lying to children is easy if it makes them happy. 

He got up when he saw the other children running around. He wanted to play too. And given that the local priest was with us, cooking fish and shooting the shit, the whole school was unlocked and open to our disposal. So, he took off running. I, being the oldest of them, ran over and told them we should play hide and seek. And they agreed. So off they ran. We laughed and played and, despite being a moody pubescent, I did enjoy it. Until we saw the boiler room door open. When one of us was found, we joined up to find the others. And now into our 3rd round, Johnny was the only one left. We’d been playing the 3rd round for 25 minutes. The problem was, if he was in the boiler room, none of us wanted to go and find him. 
Eventually, we all agreed to go together, and since I was the oldest, I got the short end of the stick and had to go down first incase anything decides to jump out and kill us. But nothing did. The only thing we found down there was a pentagram and a piece of the boys shirt. 

The police showed up within 2 minutes of the call, while his mother wailed and his father stayed in a corner chain smoking. They were both hysterical, and the other parents were as well. The police got statements from everyone, and I told them what I saw. I then took them to the boiler room and showed them the scene. There was no blood. No nothing. The small window, barely large enough for anyone to fit through, was open. But there was nothing to explain the shirt fragment laying in the middle of the pentagram. The police took it as evidence, along with scrapings of the dried substance that painted the pentagram of the floor. 
The news covered it for the first 2 days. The young boy, who had been in town only a week, was taken from the catholic school he had just enrolled in that morning. There were no answers. We prayed for him, we hoped for him, and we grieved for him, even though we all only knew him for an hour. The police had told the Oxenkillers that the substance found was blood, and they think it matched the boy. DNA testing has making strides, but they couldn’t be sure. The city just hadn’t needed to utilize DNA testing up to that point. After 2 months, past Easter and almost into June, the search was called off. Little Johnny Oxenkiller was presumed dead. 

The case remained opened for a while, albeit cold and fairly inactive. The police were looking into every vagrant in the area. The Oxenkillers themselves were suspects for a while. But they didn’t fit the pattern. The father moved here for a new job, they both had clean records, and they didn’t do it. We all knew that. Because we all knew that this was the work of the Devil. 
See, we were fairly inexperienced in areas of the occult. Pretty much any other religion was weird and scary to us. World Religions class was mostly over one religion. Simpler time, but not an always better time. But we knew it. That the devil had come and taken the child. Especially since it was one of the holiest seasons of the year. He wanted and innocent, and not even God could have stopped him. 

A year had passed, and no one was allowed in the boiler room. No one wanted to go there anyway. It was the next year of lent. And we remembered the events of last year as we got together at the same school. Friday, March 9th. 364 days since Johnny went missing. And his parents showed up. They again brought beer, and those homemade hushpuppies. And despite their still apparent grief, Mrs. Oxenkiller was 5 months pregnant. She sat and talked with the mothers about trying to move on, while her husband stood with the men frying fish and talking about “fucking Chicago.” We loved to hate the Bulls. 

The little kids ran to play hide and seek, and all made a point to remind each other that the boiler room was off limits. After 20 minutes, I knew it was almost time to eat, so I ran to go get them. And staring in front of me was the boiler room door, wide open yet again. 

Father Mendelssohn came running first with me down the stairs. There was another pentagram but nothing of any of the children. Two were still not back with us as we called the police. He examined the lock and the door and saw that it was drilled out. It was then that I had two thoughts; either the Devil carries power tools with him, or much like every episode of Scooby Doo, he wasn’t the one behind this. A young girl came around the corner and said she couldn’t find her brother. Since she showed up, he was the last one to find. I looked up and saw the window, and sprinted outside, with father running behind me as several parents started to follow us as well. I found the window outside, and began calling for the boy. I heard a muffled scream, and so did father. We both ran towards it, which was in a small field behind the school. We were searching for nothing. It was now 7:00, and dark. We couldn’t see anything. The fathers came running after, with the mothers rounding up the kids. For some reason, the 14 year old spear heading a search and rescue operation was just fine for them. We searched and searched the field to no avail, until we heard a scream that still chills me to think about coming from the trees that lay 50 yards across the wide field. I had never the sound of someone being stabbed until that moment. 

We reached the edge of the trees after what seemed like an eternity. One of the fathers had grabbed a crowbar from his truck before running to catch up, and another grabbed a baseball bat from his trunk. In the dark, we couldn’t find anything and heard nothing besides our frantic footsteps and the sirens growing closer and closer. Why anyone thought it would be a good idea to play hide and seek again is beyond me. 
I was walking along a rugged path between the trees when I heard a gunshot. I called for the group to get over here. We went to where it was and that’s when I heard hollow ground. I kicked it hard and my foot went right through. There was a plywood cover over a hole. They grabbed me and pulled me back up. Then someone threw the plywood aside and someone climbed in the hole. They quickly climbed out, gagging and throwing up, as the smell hit the rest of us. 

When the police showed up, they quickly cordoned off the scene. Homicide showed up along with the coroner, and together they climbed in. With light on the scene, it looked like an old bomb shelter with the door missing. They had flashlights. Thankfully we didn’t, or else we might have seen horrors no one should face. 
In total, 2 bodies were found. One was an unidentifiable grown man. And the 2nd one, now completely unrecognizable and with a smell that could gag a maggot, was Johnny Oxenkiller. It was an underground den of death. Nick McElliot, the boy who was just taken, was barely alive. The men felt bad for not investigating further, but Nick pulled through. 

We never actually found out who the guy was. State hospital records didn’t match his finger prints, and no DNA was matched. Plus the gun shot suicide in the face didn’t help the police much either. Due to wounds on the hands of Johnny, or what they assumed to be wound through the decay, and on Nick, they presumed that he had cut them in the boiler room to draw the pentagram and then got them out the window to kill them. They found 2 handwritten notes in the den, along with a notebook of illegible ramblings. The note were mostly about the crimes, with one saying “The pentagram threw them off completely. I could do this all the time if I wanted.” The other note talked about his other shelter 2 towns over. There, they found 7 bodies. Perhaps the worst part, which I only know now because I saw the police report when I worked for them as an intern of sorts one summer, was that the journal had a few legible sections. And one of those sections talked about how the man had used the bodies for sex for months after he killed them. 

The police closed the case. Johnny was finally laid to rest. All Nick said was that the man had grabbed him and tied his hands behind his back so that he couldn’t get up on his own. Other than that, the man was no one. And, as I assume no one probably wanted to, nobody claimed his body. John Doe, as we called him,  was cremated. And,  I can only imagine, his ashes promptly thrown in the dumpster. 


____________________________________________

I lost a little touch with religion that day. Im still Catholic, I still go to mass, and I still go to my weekly fish fry during lent. But ever since then, some part of me died. Father Mendelssohn said it was the horrors I'd seen and read in that report and first hand. The scream and the horrors did nothing to help the situation. And I agreed for a while, until I started remembering it more and more with each passing lent. 

I finally realized why I was falling out of religion and why those old movies like The Exorcism and The Omen didnt scare me. With men like John Doe walking the earth, I didnt need to fear the devil. I had to fear my fellow man.

48s4nk,81,2016-03-03,Reflections on not tracking for a day,cryptonemonamiter,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/48s4nk/reflections_on_not_tracking_for_a_day/,"F/29 5'6"" SW:155 lbs CW:145 lbs, GW:135

I started using MFP on December 27 after ranting to my boyfriend about my weight while we were on a run. Since that moment where I'd gotten it all out there, I've felt a strong desire to hold myself accountable and am now at my lowest weight as an adult, having reached 144 pounds by ~Feb 15 or so.

I was completely astounded that I was able to lose weight so rapidly by consistently eating at a deficit and tracking my food. I exercise, but haven't done much extra during this time--in fact, due to being stupidly busy (full time desk job, grad school, and an internship), I've been working out less and overall am more sedentary than normal. This is useful as it's really solidified how much diet matters in order to lose weight, and there's no way to ""run it off"". I guess I'd always known this, but in the back of my mind I've felt I needed to run as much as I did in high school cross country to weigh less.

I haven't lost as easily over the past 3 weeks and have fluctuated between 144 and 147 during this time. This past week has been very hard for me. Work is hard, I have a huge assignment coming due, procrastination is catching up with me, some relationship stress has crept in... the works. So, I've been giving myself a break and eating at maintenance the past week, and yesterday thought ""fuck it--I'm not tracking today"".

I ate what I felt was pretty normally and still turned down several things that I would have normally eaten back in my pre-tracking days. At the end of the day I started wondering exactly how much I'd eaten, so retroactively entered all of it in MFP--not perfect amounts, of course, but it gave me a good ballpark.

It turned out that, without feeling like it was a lot of food, and even turning down snacks I'd have eaten in the past, I was 800 calories above my daily allotment for 0.5 pound loss per week. What's more is I went to sleep, woke up, tracked breakfast, and then remembered yet another snack I'd had that I'd forgotten about--bringing my total up to 1,000 calories over.

This post isn't to say I feel bad about this, or to admonish myself for eating 2,500 calories when MFP recommends 1,500 for my current rate of loss. It's more of a reflection on the amount I used to eat when I wasn't tracking. I never tracked before starting to lose weight, so had no normal days to compare to when I started. This was illuminating for me and serves as a good reminder of how easy it is for me to overeat.

Tl;dr I eat a lot more when I'm not tracking my food."

I have been working at a grocery store chain company since P1 year, but have not been extended a job offer from them yet. This company is known for not giving out offers until March/April, so I e-mailed my DM on Monday (he usually takes 4-5 days to respond), and haven't heard back yet.

My boss talked to him back before Christmas, and he said he could basically guarantee me a PRN position in his district. His district is in the city I live with some stores being at most an hour away. All the interns that were hired for PRN positions were transitioned to full time before they were even licensed. But then again, I still haven't heard from him and I have nothing in writing as of yet.

Today, I interviewed with another grocery store chain. They are offering a floater pharmacist position. I would have to drive up to an hour to some stores (wouldn't really bother me, the store I work at now is an hour away) or even stay in a hotel for even farther stores if they needed me there for a few days. However, I would be compensated for travel. He also said he would try and keep me in stores around where I lived, though. I would work about every other weekend. He said when a store position opens up close to where I live, I could transition there. He would want me to hand in my two weeks notice to the company I work for currently as soon as the offer is extended.

At this point I'm at a loss of what to do. I'm still waiting to hear what my DM has to say, but I'm very stressed out. I can't imagine handing in my two weeks notice to my boss. Both companies would be great to work for, but I'm just ready to not feel like crying every day because I don't know where I'm going to work or what I'm going to do.

48sh0p,2,2016-03-03,Quick help with saving iterated elements to an array.,YungKob,learnpython,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/48sh0p/quick_help_with_saving_iterated_elements_to_an/,"Hi all, I am an intern for an internet service provider and I was given a small project that involves coding in some python. I get emails every day from compliance companies that send me data about copyright infringement happening on our network. My goal is to have my script automatically parse the (mostly) irrelevant data in these emails, until it finds the &lt;IP_Address&gt; XML tag identifier. Then I need to save these address in some sort of array or list. 


So I have this method, which retrieves MIME messages from my inbox:
    

     def GetMimeMessage(service, user_id, msg_id):
    """"""Get a Message and use it to create a MIME Message.

    Args:
    service: Authorized Gmail API service instance.
    user_id: User's email address. The special value ""me""
    can be used to indicate the authenticated user.
    msg_id: The ID of the Message required.

     Returns:
       A MIME Message, consisting of data from Message.
     """"""
     try:
    message = service.users().messages().get(userId=user_id, id=msg_id, format='raw').execute()

    print ('Message snippet: %s' % message['snippet'])

    msg_str = base64.urlsafe_b64decode(message['raw'].encode('ASCII'))

    mime_msg = email.message_from_string(msg_str)
    return mime_msg
    except errors.HttpError, error:
    print ('An error occurred: %s' % error)


And this method, which lists messages based on a Query (In my case, those dealing with 'claimed infringement':

    def ListMessagesMatchingQuery(service, user_id, query=''):
    """"""List all Messages of the user's mailbox matching the query.

     Args:
    service: Authorized Gmail API service instance.
    user_id: User's email address. The special value ""me""
    can be used to indicate the authenticated user.
    query: String used to filter messages returned.
    Eg.- 'from:user@some_domain.com' for Messages from a particular     sender.

     Returns:
       List of Messages that match the criteria of the query. Note that the
      returned list contains Message IDs, you must use get with the
       appropriate ID to get the details of a Message.
     """"""
     try:
      response = service.users().messages().list(userId=user_id,
                                               q=query).execute()
    messages = []
    if 'messages' in response:
      messages.extend(response['messages'])

    while 'nextPageToken' in response:
      page_token = response['nextPageToken']
      response = service.users().messages().list(userId=user_id, q=query,
                                         pageToken=page_token).execute()
      messages.extend(response['messages'])

    return messages
     except errors.HttpError, error:
    print ('An error occurred: %s' % error)



So I create a list with all messages that are unread and match my query:

            defaultList= ListMessagesMatchingQuery(service, 'me', 'subject: claimed infringement label:unread ')

Its output looks something like the following: 

    {u'id': u'xxxxx', u'threadId': u'xxxx'}, {u'id': u'yyyyy', u'threadId': u'yyyyy'}, {u'id': u'zzzzz', u'threadId': u'zzzzz'}, .... you get the point }

There are no responses to these emails, so the 'id' and 'threadID' values are exactly the same across all instances. 


Now, for all the messages in this defaultList, I want to call the above GetMIMEMessage method, parse the email for the ip_address, and if it exists throw the value in an array or list. Here is my approach at this so far:

    for msg in defaultList:

        currentMSG=GetMimeMessage(service, 'me' , msg['id'])

         #Extract the IP Address Field using the XML included in DMCA emails
          #get a string value of the current message

         loc1 = str(currentMSG).find('&lt;IP_Address&gt;')
        loc2 = str(currentMSG).find('&lt;/IP_Address&gt;')

            #extract the IP address:
          ipaddress = str(currentMSG)[loc1 + 12:loc2]

My first thought was to make an array like ""ips=[]"" then have an incrementing variable put each ip address into this empty array, so like this:

        i=0
        for msg in defaultList:

        currentMSG=GetMimeMessage(service, 'me' , msg['id'])

         #Extract the IP Address Field using the XML included in DMCA emails
          #get a string value of the current message

         loc1 = str(currentMSG).find('&lt;IP_Address&gt;')
        loc2 = str(currentMSG).find('&lt;/IP_Address&gt;')

            #extract the IP address:
          ipaddress = str(currentMSG)[loc1 + 12:loc2]
         ips[i]=ipaddress


However, this always throws an ""Index out of bounds exception"" and I'm not quite sure why this is. 

Another approach I thought might work would be to count the number of 'id' labels in 'defaultList' then use that number to create an outer loop around this for loop that runs until i&lt;amount of elements in defaultList. 

I'm really stuck on this for a few days now and I would like some input from more experienced Python'ers. I am pretty new to python and coding in general so I appreciate you bearing with me till this point!

So my last of my scheduled interviews for an internship wrapped up and none of the callbacks were positive. Yeah, yeah, I know: I needed to apply to more places and put in more time on the job search, but the point is that I have no options this summer, so much so that I asked on Yikyak just now what fast food places are the best to work at this summer. This on top of all the other things, from diagnosed anxiety and very likely depression, ratio blues, getting a bottom of the class grade in the last mechanical properties test, an obnoxious as fuck housemate in CS who is getting interviews every other weekend on the opposite coast, social anxiety and the resulting no networking skills, no relevant clubs only fun clubs that i haven't attended in weeks, and very possibly getting fucked by scheduling resulting in me likely needing another semester.

The core of it is basically me thinking i'm in the wrong program. I don't hate my classes or the material, far from it, it's just tricky. Meanwhile my housemate (comp sci) when he sees us engineers study jokes like ""lmao what are tests, whats studying"" in between hedge fund/medical corp/NYC startup/silicon valley vc darling interviews. Given I'll have 40K of debt on graduating if I wrap it up next May and I'm so far along in this degree his words are piercing, like I've missed out on the actual way to get a job. I feel like I should have been in CS from day 1, and that I would be good at it, but it's too late and I've made my bed and now I'll lie in it.

My hometown is a small place in the middle of nowhere, 100 miles from a city where anything happens, but it's looking like I'll have to go back there and to my family this summer. I'm not sure I can face them and say I have no internship after getting ones (not in materials, but in engineering) the previous two summers, or tell them about my depression or anxiety issues. To them, I'm the perfect little brainiac who went to nerd school and is going to Change the World (tm). I'm not sure they want to know about these struggles i'm having and to them ignorance will be bliss.

As for classes, if there's a project involved, I kick its ass. I'm top notch at writing for lab reports and otherwise. My sophomore design project was so perfect, the only perfect demonstration the professors have given in years of teaching, and the only question they had after was ""Are you going to patent this?"" (someone beat us unfortunately). But the materials classes this semester, kinetics and mechanical properties, are just not holding my attention well. Kinetics is arcane and the teaching is not good, and mechanical properties I had to miss the first two weeks due to a very poor rechanging of my antidepressants and going through the book is not getting me to where I need to be. The last test - catastrophic, the lowest in the class. and by a big margin. The labs are fun and engaging (Except trying to do metallography on a broken toe (oh yeah i broke my toe because i'm a clumsy fuckass)) and I do great writeups and reports, but some parts of the math are just completely above me. There is also a nonzero chance that due to getting fucked over in scheduling I may need to take a prerequisite late pushing me to another semester.

So, all this combines and you get a crisis of faith. Why am I here? (not just at this school, but on this planet) Why am I in materials, and not computer science? Can I ever find a job without a junior summer internship? Can I afford, both in cash and ""face"" with my family, to take another semester, which is likely to occur if I drop Mechanical Properties?  Will I ever find love? Can I get confidence?

Will everything be OK?"

I am 26 years old and considering a career path change. I have a Bachelor and Master's degree in mathematics (pure math, and master's in mathematical cryptography -- not mentioning the subject on purpose). After my degree I was considering a PhD, but in my last term I was convinced by friends/family members to go into work. 

Fast forward to today: I have been working in a Canadian consulting firm for (roughly) the past seven months. Part of their consulting practice is configuring / developing some custom code for large financial service clients, e.g. insurance.

While the ability to save money is nice, I find myself desiring a different challenge. I was quite angry with myself for taking the offer initially, after finding out the nature of my role and how little of my knowledge I would get to use. I eventually carved out some software development responsibilities, but I know enough to understand it's not the real deal.

I have already applied and have been accepted to a degree program in Computer Science (undergraduate). If I can get all of my course equivalencies in order, I would take 3 (and if not, 3.5) years to satisfy the requirements. 

My questions to this subreddit are:
1. I have a strange feeling that I'm being reckless by leaving my job, even though I have strong desire for this change. I would love to hear your thoughts on the level of risk based on current industry conditions.
2. I am re-investing my savings from my 1 year of work into school and from what I can see, I cannot qualify for any scholarships. Would I be ""discriminated against"" for being an older applicant to internships than normally admitted? (somewhat related to question 4). Again, interested in your impressions and experiences.
3. What kind of work-life balance improvement (or change) can I expect as, e.g. an SDE? I know this depends strongly on team and company, but I am eager to hear your experiences.
4. If I graduate in 3-3.5 years, can I expect a problem with ""age-gap""?

(Apologies for the length, TL;DR at the bottom)

First things first, thank you for taking the time to read this. My name is James and I'm writing here because I'd love to help any local artists/bands just starting out that may need or want a manager.

Before I dive in, here's some background about me. I'm 25 years old and I've played music all my life. I started out playing violin in the 1st grade, switched to guitar, and then moved to playing bass in a band I started with friends in 2005. We played for about 6 years and were your typical crappy teenage band (so much angst!). What started out as a typical basement band ended up getting more serious and I ended up also being manager of our band. I hounded venues for shows, ran our social media, shopped press kits, marketing, and other various tasks. In 2010, I helped seek and secure a small recording contract with a local indie-label via shopping our EPK around. All before my 21st birthday!

Unfortunately, things didn't really pan out for the band. Long story short, things just didn’t work out, both internally and with our label, and it was just time to move on as it is with most bands/artists. I still kept my interest in music and the broken marriage that is music and business. Since hanging up the bass, I've worked at a record label, a talent agency, and a management company in various departments (A&amp;R, Business Affairs, Promotions) as an intern and then assistant. 

Currently, I work in a straight job downtown (I sold out and took a 9-5), but I’ve realized that I want to do something different with my life and do something I love again. **Point being: I want to be a music manager but I need experience... which lead me here!** 

I would love to help anyone who is looking for a manager but can't get in the door anywhere or anyone that simply needs help with filtering all the extraneous bullshit that comes with playing music. I still have a lot to learn and I would love the chance to learn how to manage an artist in Chicago. Call it an experiment if you want, but the end goal is that we’ll both help each other out. I’d be learning/navigating this crazy business with you, and, at the end of the day, the worst case scenario is that nothing comes of it and we all go back to our dull, boring lives. 

If anyone is interested, I’ve filed paperwork for my own company, JAM Management, and I’ve set up my own website at **www.jammgmt.net**. Please email me at james@jammgmt.net or visit my website if you want more information. 

Some final key points:
*I will work for free. I'm more interested in gaining experience and my success is intrinsically tied to yours. I’m by no means a lawyer and I won’t make you sign a contract. You are free to leave whenever you want. If by chance the money does start coming… well, we can talk then. 

*Yes, most of what I'd be doing you could do on your own. But, this is America, where we make other people do it for us! Joking aside, as someone who was both artist and manager, it can suck the life out of you. It helps to have an outside opinion who has the time to start knocking on doors and getting you in places. 

*Why am I doing this? What's the catch? Honestly, I just want to help artist in whatever way. I honestly was never much of a musician, although I love playing. But I’ve had luck with all the music business stuff in my own career and I’d love the chance to help out. If this actually ends up working out, the catch is that I get to do something I love and hopefully you do as well. 

*But seriously though… why should I trust some asshole poser on the internet? Well… first off, rude. But secondly, what is there really to lose? You are free to leave at any time. I have no pre-conceived delusions of grandeur that we’d make any sort of money/fame (although that would be greatl). Worst case scenario, nothing happens and then we go our separate ways. Best case scenario… well, I leave that up to you. 

*All experience levels and genres welcome. I have a soft spot for rock bands from personal experience but I love all music (except maybe Christian rock…). 

Thanks again!

48t2xa,41,2016-03-03,So it happened guys. Cousin in law unfriended me for saying Trump isn't racist.,FuzzyDice12,The_Donald,https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/48t2xa/so_it_happened_guys_cousin_in_law_unfriended_me/,"Hello All,

Long time lurker. I believe I subbed here before we hit the 5k mark.

I rarely get on Facebook but yesterday my daughter was sick so I held her while she was watching some tv. I decided to to get on Facebook and saw several posts sharing articles about trump that were completely false. I replied to all of them and pointed out that the reference points used in the article(example: article talks about ABC, article actually has video on site of said situation and shows a completely different story) show the article is lying. So long story short I called them out on it and posted this:

""Just wanted to throw something out there. 

Today I have messaged or commented on 3 people's posts regarding Donald Trump. I really recommend if anyone is going to share websites or articles they take a moment to actually read the articles themselves and not just post based on the title because it agrees with your point of view. 2 of the linked articles showed videos which gave the actual situation/facts which is what I find so disappointing about this. These same videos disproved what the articles were saying about Trump.

I truly enjoy many segments of John Oliver's shows as he brings many things to the forefront that most don't speak about. But I have never seen him devote 21 minutes of his show to any one subject.

What's been viewed over 8 million times by the time I saw it was a hit piece on Donald Trump. 

I'm not here to convince anyone to change their political stances. There is a lot about Donald I don't agree with. But it's gotten to the point where the media is attacking his voters because they failed to attack him successfully.

If anyone is still reading, I'd like to clarify a few things.

1: Donald Trump is not a racist. He does not want to deport all Mexicans. He wants to deport illegals. Illegal immigrants do take jobs from Americans and especially hurt the African American community. 

2: In regards to the above info Donald never called all Mexicans or Hispanics ""Rapists, Criminals, etc."". He was shedding light on the fact that it is cheaper for Mexico not to provide prisons for their criminals and much cheaper to send them or help get them across the border into the USA. Then we as tax payers end up paying for ""Mexico's rapists, drug dealers, criminals, etc"". Jail, Prison, and any type of confinement of these criminals cost money and all of us Americans pay for it.

3: ""Donald Trump is sexist"". Donald Trump has proven time and time again for decades that he has employed women in places of position and leadership. High paying jobs. Does he have an infidelity problem? Maybe but most of these politicians do. Not to excuse him but let's not forget Bill Clinton was putting cigars in intern's private parts(keeping it PG here lol). 

4: ""Donald Trump has filed bankruptcy and has no idea how to manage his money/this makes him dishonest"". So this one is not an easy answer. Many business men and women buy up failing businesses. They file bankruptcy to restructure, while saving countless jobs and giving the business a second chance. A few other companies Trump was CEO but had no direct involvement as he sold the rights to use his name. Example would be you decide to open a hotel. You believe Trump's name will help bring guests so you pay Trump to use his trademark name and offer him a seat on he board. So a hotel can have Trump's name but not actually be run by Donald.

I also find this one a bit hypocritical as millions of Americans foreclosed or filed bankruptcy on their homes. I know it may be hard to remember the housing crash in 08 😉.

5: ""Trump is vulgar"". Ok, I can see if you are offended by his vulgarity. Hopefully you are a better example on Facebook than Trump is with his language use.

6: ""Trump says stupid things/I don't like him/he's too orange for me."" No argument here.

Biggest takeaway is do some research for yourself on anything you are interested in. Listen to viewpoints that align with yours and oppose yours. Truth is usually somewhere in the middle.""

Overall I got a good response. I wasn't doing for the response to be honest I was frustrated that people will link a post without reading. 

Then this happened from my cousin in law:

""Lol wow. Facebook really is the safe haven for awful, racist people to play. .....and unfriending. 👌 it must be great not knowing when youve been brainwashed. Also disappointed in you (name removed).""

I replied: ""(Name Removed) how am I racist? Unless I am misunderstanding your comment? 

Unfriending? How about having a conversation instead? If you are for any other candidate that's fine. Everyone entitled to their opinion. 

Hope you are well.

Edit: (Name Removed) maybe you should take a look at my wife but she is on the darker side.""

I haven't spoken to this person in years but I've never had a bad relationship with them. Pretty dissapointed at the reaction but I'm glad to take a stand."

I'm in my last month of college for Information Technology and Business Information Systems.

I wanted to know what are some advice about finding a job and what to expect from the pay at a starting level for an IT and BIS graduate. 

All advice would be greatly appreciated."

================================================

I am in my penultimate year at good Scottish university and am doing okay. I am no superstar and find a lot of subjects demanding but I am coping. I have a few questions regarding mostly UK because it should get more love here, especially for new grad prospects in current tech market.
My issue is that I applied for around 20 companies, starting in late November for software engineering internships. Almost all banks rejected me without interview which cut down on number of internships available in UK. I now have three leads and will go to interviews but in case I fail to obtain internship, what can I do? Build projects over summer and start applying early for graduate roles?
I spoke with a recent graduate in CS who found work successfully without internships and he told me to do market research, i.e. what is in demand in combination with choosing what interests you and delve deeper into that.
Regarding application for graduate roles, I am interested in trying out embedded software path, data science or something more sophisticated because I want to get into the field of IT that is more in demand and has higher barrier of entry, mostly to reduce competition. For embedded, my plan is to go on and do EdX course on embedded systems and learn C/C++. However, at the same time that would make me too specialized and there are a lot fewer embedded software companies(ARM, Nvidia, Qualcomm, AMD, Intel?) and most are highly competitive. I am thinking of a fallback plan of learning something like C#/Java, i.e. build a project and apply to more generic companies like banks(Morgan Stanley, JP, some hedge funds etc).
So, I want to be madly prepared for technical interviews(Leetcode etc.) and have some projects in both embedded software and somewhat more generic apps to show off.
I am pretty happy with embedded project prospect(welcome ideas anyways) but would like to know what project would be something in C#/Java realm and would take at most 2-3 months to complete but still show my skills.

Update: since last time I posted, I had interview with a bank'(rejected), a company from Switzerland who considered giving me a chance for 2 weeks but withdrew today(better suited candidates were found) etc."

I don’t imagine that anyone at Bungie actually reads it but I enjoy writing it, so do with it as you please.*

###This Week at r/DestinyTheGame (2016-03-03)

Howdy Bungie friends!  Welcome to another “This Week at r/DestinyTheGame”.  Seeing as “This Week at Bungie” was a little light on content, we’re guessing you were either hard at work on new content or, like most of the employed Guardians, using company time to browse r/DTG.  We hope it was the former, although we can all empathize with how hard it would be to work with a giant elephant sitting in the middle of our office.  That being said, it is never a slow week around r/DestinyTheGame, so let’s get to the fun!

###Science, B!tch [Earth and Venus] (https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/47pdkq/the_science_of_destiny_earth_and_venus/) [Moon] (https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/4822vx/the_science_of_destiny_the_moon/) [Mars] (https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/48mjxm/the_science_of_destiny_mars/)

While you guys at Bungie fleshed out more content, we here at r/DTG boned up on the science of the spatial bodies you’ve included in the Destiny world.  Thanks to u/Ruley9, our resident Astrophysicist (and who doesn't have a few of those lying around), we got a great look at the detail your design and development team put into the game, which is awesome because next time my zombie/exo/guardian is blasting some time bending aliens on Venus with a void powered fusion rifle I’ll know that the volcanic landscape is pretty legit.  Who am I kidding?  I would never use a fusion rifle!

###Hauling it to the Lighthouse [Source] (https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/4883sb/finally_got_to_the_lighthouseand_broke_down/)

Last week we had two streamers carry a five year old boy to the Lighthouse.  This week is another feel good story.  For most of us Destiny is a bit of an escape outside working/school hours to hang with friends, shoot some aliens, and generally have a good time before shutting it down and spending time with family in the comforts of our own homes.  For u/INNSOMKNEEACK Destiny is literally a driving force in his life (pun absolutely intended).  See, u/INNSOMKNEEACK is a truck driver who is forced to take Destiny on the road year round but when he’s not on the road he might just be standing beside you in the Crucible!  This week he found two Guardians to team up on a run to the lighthouse and gave out a heartfelt Thank You to Believe_Im_Dope and Destinys___Child.  It’s amazing to see a Guardian that can still get into the fight while so far from home.

###Lightly Salted Food for Thought 

Time for the grit…  Not everything is sugar at r/DestinyTheGame, so here are some ideas that we mined for you.

##Can We Get a Rematch? [Source] (https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/48mj0l/the_experiment_is_over_bungie_go_back_to_house_of/)

“This Week at Bungie” told us that you’re deploying the new Match Making rules to all playlists.  Thing is, we’re not sure you’ve hit the mark yet.  Actually, we’re pretty sure that something is still missing from the recipe.  u/Mercules904 heralded back to a time in House of Wolves where one could actually jump into Crucible and play for fun without having Thorn and a fresh set of towels on standby.  It also pointed to…

##Feast or Famine [Source] (https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/48fsos/iron_banner_is_over_im_back_once_again_301/)

…Making it rain!  In House of Wolves we were able to reroll our gear, so getting the perfect drop was a little easy.  We get that.  Problem is, now that we can’t reroll and the drop rates have plummeted, the chances of us getting a gun with the perks that we want is next to impossible unless you’re able to farm 7-8 hours a day.  “Oh, that’s just RNG,” you say?  Well, u/HeyFitzy performed a little experiment in Iron Banana this week for over 300 games and received [this] (http://i.imgur.com/i7IBXoJ.png).  He also did the same thing last IB with similar [results] (http://i.imgur.com/cO5N0jO.png). In our humble opinion, those numbers seem too low for a limited time event, especially when the rolls are often super weak.

##Are You Guys Okay? [Source] (https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/48nkmn/dreadnaught_ride_along_stream_megathread/)

Okay, so title sounds sarcastic, but for real – are you guys okay?  That Twitch chat for the Ride Along was abhorrent and embarrassing.  I’m going to choose to believe that most of the “contributors” weren’t from r/DTG.  Once you all manage to come out from hiding under your desks can I offer few suggestions?  (1) The Community reaction will be a little salty until you show us new PvE content (but you know this already); (2)  Deej, for the love of everything that is holy and good, reload your bl!ming gun; (3) Whoever this Andrew Hopps guy is in the middle, keep him on the broadcasts for whatever reason – am I right ladies?

###From Our HeART(WORK)

The Guardians of r/DTG never cease to amaze with their creativity, ideas, and passion for Destiny.  This section of “This Week at r/DestinyTheGame” highlights some of the beautiful things the community made this week.  You guys should totally print them out and stick them to the staff room fridge!

So, uh, u/D3DP legit made a Gjallarhorn and gave everyone the instructions on how to print and build their own.  Bungie, you best have your weapons free for DestinyCon, because Guardians be coming for you!  No wonder you nerfed it; now can you nerf this beard? [Pic] (http://imgur.com/gallery/jfUZ2/new)

Cozmo totally stole our thunder by making [this] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYuCO2dqGaw&amp;feature=youtu.be) video of true Crucible talent from u/Admixues a runner up in “This Week at Bungie” but we had another late comer to the game that was at least equal.  Ever wondered how to get on top of the Vault in the Tower?  u/MrCayke has your answer in the most dramatic of fashion. [Video] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTZHlfN9P30)

###The Last Word

And there you have it!  It’s been another fun-filled week balanced by just the right amount of saltgestions to keep r/DTG busy.  We in fact had so many things to talk about we couldn’t even hit on Raid RNG, Smashing Titan Bubbles, Inventory Stacking, Hammer/Nova BOMBS, and the Parent of an Unruly Guardian.  Good luck finding out about that stuff; have to keep that unpaid intern busy somehow!

**Patty_May, Out!**


P.S. Formatting, blah, blah blah…

P.P.S. So you’re thinking to yourself, “Hey! Patty! You missed last week!”  Well, not true.  Problem was I didn’t pay attention to some key rediquette and my post was removed and buried before I could fix it.  That or you guys didn’t like it.  We’ll find out soon enough!

48v2t9,9,2016-03-03,From Our Eyes to the Screen: What Makes for Authentic Asian American Media,emcee-decree-link,asianfeminism,https://www.reddit.com/r/asianfeminism/comments/48v2t9/from_our_eyes_to_the_screen_what_makes_for/,"Too often, the mainstream Hollywood entertainment industry has taken advantage of using stereotypes to juxtapose Asians as the ""other"" to the everyman/everywoman that white people embody in the media. Whether it is through an action film, TV series, or any other form of entertainment, Asian Americans have consistently remained as a target of racist derision to this very day.

But for many an aspiring Asian American filmmaker, the purpose of film (and other medium types including literature) is not just to tell a story or insert a few punchlines - it’s the ability to see the world through an Asian American’s perspective, of listening to stories and narratives that have rarely been given a chance to be told in its most authentic, wholesome, and pure form.

--------------------------------------------------------------

Jun Xing from “Asian America Through the Lens: History, Representations, and Identity” (1998) describes what Asian American cinema should be, and the elements associated with what makes an Asian American film. 

&gt;In March 1994, New York University organized a panel discussion on the topic “Whose Black Cinema Is it, Anyway?” as part of a week-long program on Black film. The seven panelists, including filmmaker Spike Lee, writer Ishmael Reed, and film critic Joel Siegel, debated the following questions: Should only Blacks make movies about Blacks? Should Black filmmakers be limited to Black themes? Are Black-controlled films guaranteed to portray the Black experience with sensitivity? Should Blacks see films directed by non-Blacks, and should the race of the audience affect which movies they see? Deceptively simplistic, those questions touch on some of the fundamental issues in ethnic representation: **authenticity, creative control, and community empowerment.**

**Cultural Essentialism**

&gt;In 1926, W.E.B. Du Bois laid down the following four terms for an authentic Black theater:

&gt;The plays of a real Negro theater must be: 1. *About us.* That is they must have plots which reveal Negro life as it is. 2. *By us.* That is they must be written by Negro authors who understand from birth and continual association just what it means to be a Negro today. 3. *For us.* That is, the theater must cater primarily to Negro audiences and be supported and sustained by their entertainment and approval. 4. *Near us.* The theater must be in a Negro neighborhood near the mass of ordinary Negro people. 

&gt;Three-quarters of a century later, this ethnicity-defined essentialism has also been accepted and adapted by Chicano/a filmmakers. In his introduction to *Chicanos and Film,* Chon A. Noriega wrote:

&gt;Although what constitutes a “Chicano” film continues to be the subject of debate, we can start with the definition offered by the filmmakers: a film (or video) by and about Chicanos. The word “by” is taken to mean that the writer, producer, or director is Chicano. The filmmakers tend to apply a third criterion when the producer alone is Chicano: that he or she had significant involvement in the creative process….

&gt;Authenticity is enthusiastically embraced by the “cultural guardians” in the Asian American community. Just look at the controversy over Margaret Cho’s 1994 television sitcom *All-American Girl*, which aired on the ABC network. Bill Wong, an *AsianWeek* columnist, accused the show of being “stupid, inane, and ethnically inauthentic.” Because only two of the show’s eleven writers were Chinese American and none of them Korean American, the comedy was dubbed “a cast of Asian American entertainers delivering lines written by Hollywood writers who have little understanding of how Asian Americans interact with each other in real life.” “Even the rice they eat,’ exclaimed a high-school intern for the Korea Times; ‘we eat sticky rice.” Margaret Cho was shocked by the harshness of the criticism from the Korean-language press and within her own Korean American community. Gary Jacobs, the white executive producer of *All-American Girl*, was equally “surprised by the intensity of the negative reactions from Asian Pacific Americans.” Addressing its detractors, he said that unrealistic demands and expectations were placed on a show that “never presumed to represent the definitive Asian Pacific American experience.” 

&gt;**It is important to bear in mind that this type of discourse about authenticity results directly from a long period of frustration and anger among Asian Americans over the degradation of their images on the silver screen.** Even the most perfunctory review of Hollywood films reveals a constant recycling of grotesque representations of Asians, from the inscrutable Charlie Chan to the diabolical Fu Manchu, down to the exotic Suzie Wong and the happy-go-lucky Jackie Chan.

&gt;**The relationship between power and representation has become the underlying argument for the essentialist position.** To create alternatives to Hollywood portrayals and control the screen images that define so much of their lives, Asian Americans feel they have to take control over what goes on both in front of and behind the camera. Japanese American director Kayo Hatta reflects, in a private interview, “I feel it is really important that Asian Americans get more into the producing, controlling the means by which films are made and distributed. That’s where the artistic control comes in. **If you don’t have the means to make the film, you can’t control the content. On the financial and distribution end, filmmaking is going to be white, with Asian Americans being more in the background.”**

&gt;From an essentialist imperative, an additional question, regarding Asian American filmmaking, can be raised. “No filmmaker is independent,” wrote Snead, “in the way, say, a poet is. **Filmmaking, both capital- and labor-intensive, is the most dependent art form.”** Indeed, film production is a collaborative process, and sometimes it can be hardly be controlled by one single ethnic group. Cross-over productions between Asian Americans and non-Asians are bound to occur. Two 1993 movies, Madame Butterfly and Golden Gate, were based on Tony Award winner David Henry Hwang’s original screenplays, but were directed by two whites, David Cronenberg and John Madden. The making of Heaven and Earth, well-documented by Michael Singer in Oliver Stone’s Heaven and Earth: the Making of an Epic Motion Picture, is another cross-racial production. The movie is based on Le Ly Hayslip’s life story, with Oliver Stone’s screenplay and Kitaro’s music score. In making The Joy Luck Club, Wayne Wang devised a rule that no Caucasians would play roles written for Asians. Regardless, the movie was made by a multiracial crew. The screenplay, based on Amy Tan’s 1989 best-seller, was a joint effort between Tan and Ronald Bass (a Caucasian Academy Award-winning screenwriter). This kind of cross-over production will certainly increase as more Asian Americans get into the studio system. 

**Political Orientation**

&gt;In the context of Asian American literature, Garrett Hongo has identified “three dominant modes” in its critical practices:

&gt;**(1) an unconscious assumption that what was *essentially* Asian American was a given work’s overt political stance and conformity to sociological models of the Asian American experience, (2) the related notion that a writer writes from a primary loyalty to coherent communities, and (3) vehement castigation or rude, categorical dismissal for literary qualities deemed “assimilationist” or “commercial”.**

&gt;In the relatively short history of Asian American cinema, two broadly defined stages have arisen, corresponding to the political and social contexts in the United States. From the 1970s to the early 1980s, Asian American cinema, as Stephen Gong observed, was “fundamentally a political (rather than a cultural or ethnic-based) movement.” Inspired by the Third Cinema movement in Latin America, Asian American filmmaking was a direct outgrowth of the Civil Rights Movement political activism in the 1960s. In the wake of the Black civil rights, sexual minority rights, and ethnic pride movements, young people of diverse Asian ancestry joined together to form a new political coalition. United under an Asian American banner, they began to exert collective political clout, seeking reparations for past injustices and challenging racial stereotyping. 

&gt;The Asian American movement had a very active cultural component, spawning visual arts collectives, literary groups, independent film cooperatives, and nonprofit theater companies. Discontent with a long history of stereotypical rendering of their culture and history, the young filmmakers made a passionate and conscious choice for community-based filmmaking. **This notion of filmmaking as a method for social change, instead of as a showcase of the artist, has understandably produced a cinema that is more concerned with its message.** Loni Ding, a twenty-year veteran Chinese American documentarist, explains her priorities: “It’s a story [communal history] that needs to be told twice, three times, more before making art out of it. Film is such an expensive undertaking that you can’t just say I’ll do that and the other, too. You do one, or the other. You gotta make your choice.” Arthur Dong, the director of many social issue documentaries (from Asian American history to gay rights), dropped out of school to engage in making social change. “Film is a medium to talk about social issues, to make social change possible,” he wrote. “It is something that gets shown to thousands and thousands of people if you’re lucky, if it’s good enough, if it’s acceptable to the general public.” **Thus, for young Asian Americans, the camera, the most powerful artistic invention of modern times, became both a logical tool in achieving community mobilization and an agent for social change. They regarded filmmaking as a unique way to initiate recognition of the community and also as a method of obtaining long-overdue civil rights.**"

Sean and I have been dating for 9 months, we met at work and moved in at 6 months. We fell hard and fast for each other, with him frequently telling me that he had never been in a better relationship and that he wants to marry me. We've done a cross country road trip to meet each others parents and in summary have become very serious very fast.

A common problem in our relationship is that when we fight it always comes down to ""are we right for each other"" with him inevitably breaking up with me. He's broken up with me maybe 7 or so times at this point? He always says he regrets it, he didn't mean it, and that he has never been in a relationship that includes fighting and that he doesn't know how to handle it.

We've agreed that it is a problem and needs to stop. I've explained to him how much it hurts not only my self esteem but also the faith I have in our relationship. He says he understands and that he is ""working on it"". 

We recently got into a fight about a hypothetical situation involving who should watch his dog if he took  a 10-week internship in another state. I told him I could watch him for him and he said that that would be an issue for him because ""what if we broke up?"" It felt like a punch in the gut that that would even being a reason for him. I get he was being logical, but it just hurt. 

Anyways, we got in a fight about it and I tried very, very hard to calmly talk to him about why he was upset. Eventually the fight turned into a digression into our relationship. I feel like I can't talk to him about anything I feel for fear it will make him decide that he's done with me and dump me. I was trying to tell him this and said ""well i guess i just fuck everything up"" and cold shouldered me. I bugged him to talk to me and he told me to get the fuck out of his way, openly mocked me by repeating what i was saying in a whining tone of voice, all before locking me out of the bedroom (briefly, he let me back in almost immediately). The next morning I woke up and he was cuddling me asking if we could just forget it ever happened. 


He apologized only after I asked him to a couple days later. He got upset first, took a walk, and told me his actions were inappropriate and that he handled it poorly.


At what point does unhappiness outweigh happiness? We've had some truly great and unbelievable times. I've never met someone who I feel like loved me more or respected me more. Now it feels like that is fading and I don't understand how people keep on loving after things like this happen. At what point is it ""Relationships are hard, you need to work on it"" versus ""Do not tolerate this and leave"". 



   
**tl;dr**: The way my boyfriend treated me during a recent fight has made me completely question our entire relationship. Hoping for some input on whether its worth it to try and make it work or to cut my losses and leave. "

I've developed an interest in control systems and I would like to find a place where I'll be able to get hands-on experience in the field.

So I'd like to know if you have any suggestion on the best places to look for this type of work. It doesn't need to be specific, what I'm looking for are pointers to help guide my search.

Here's some additional information:

- I would prefer to work on simple systems over complex ones to acquire a good grasp of the basics.

- I've got a strong background as a programmer but I'd like to get more experience with electricity and electronics so the closest I get to work to the electron the better.

- To give you an idea of my future level of knowledge, next semester I'll be taking a course on differential equations followed by a course on linear systems: open/close loop, first /second order system, transfer function, Bode, Nyquist, Routh, PID, etc.

So if you have any tip or experience to share, that would be awesome, thanks!"
48veav,0,2016-03-03,Need assessment on a graduating student's plans and financial status,akaryi,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/48veav/need_assessment_on_a_graduating_students_plans/,"Hey guys,

I've been a long time lurker on this sub and now about to graduate college in July with loans. Now, I know this is often posted especially what with new college graduates entering the real world around this time but I'd appreciate every little bit of assessment on my financial status as well as a few questions I have.

As of now, I have a grand total of $31,329.10 (principal + interest) in both subsidized and unsubsidized loans. However, I've exhausted all federal aid and can no longer borrow any more from the government so I will have to turn to a private lender to borrow $4,452.83 to pay off my remaining spring bill + a summer class that I need to finally graduate in July. In addition, my dad took out a parent loan of $4,672.08 for me when I was a freshmen which I have stupidly neglected to pay down since then. I'd like to ""own"" this loan somehow. 

1) Is it possible to consolidate it with my existing loans either by increasing my private loan to pay it off asap or by some other means? 



My current financial status is as follows:

Checking: $548.28
Savings: $2280.23
Credit Card Debt: $3,675.39 @ 0% interest until 12/2016
Transunion Credit Score based off of Credit Karma: 702

Current income: ~ $170/week from a current internship + work study
Vehicle Insurance for a fully owned car: 6 months paid off until 8/2016 
Rent + utilities: ~ $500/month
Phone plan (T-Mobile): $60/month
Food: $50 - $100/week (50/50 of eating out and making something at home but I know this needs work)



My internship + workstudy job ends sometime in early May so upon the end of this semester, I'm going to try and find a part-time job to sustain myself until the middle of August while studying.

I don't have a full-time career job lined up currently but I am fairly confident that I will be able to at least by the end of this year (engineering degree, several internships w/ large companies &amp; planning on taking the FE exam in August). 

Here's the kicker - I am extremely burnt out and want to take time off to travel for a month (insert clinche 20 something year old wanting to see the world, will not have time to travel for an extended period of time, etc.). I'm looking at an initial budget of $2-3K for this. 

2) Is this doable given my current financial situation? I've indicated on all my job applications that I will be available to start late-Septemberish to October because if I don't end up traveling, I'd want to spend time with family &amp; friends at the very least.

Lastly, I want to move away. This is of course dependent upon whatever job I land takes me but if this doesn't happen by the time the end of September rolls around, I am thinking of packing it all and moving from the East to West Coast, preferably Seattle or San Diego where I know someone who might be able to help with housing until I can get on my feet. This is attributed by the fact that I want to try living out on the West. 

3) Is this doable given my financial status?

This was long but I am essentially looking for an honest critique of my plans/goals since I don't really know anyone who is financially savy. My timeline seems a bit tight but bear with me on this. I am lucky enough to be healthy with no other financial obligations and want to make the best with what I got.

Thanks for reading and please be nice! Any advice, tips or concerns are much appreciated."
48vkzi,6,2016-03-03,Late(?) Career Change Advice,masetrax,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/48vkzi/late_career_change_advice/,"Some background on me: I'm 33 years old with a mortgage and young family and have been working in resources for the last 10 years. With the slump in that industry, I've taken the initiative to think about a career change and have always had a fascination with technology. I made a conscious decision that I wanted to do what I love, and I'm too short, old and fat to get drafted into the NBA (the lack of jump shot also hurts in this regard, but i digress) 

So, after some research, I've enrolled to do a CompSci degree part-time, majoring in Cyber Security, which apparently is all the rage (first mistake?). After some further research it has become obvious that I won't get straight into a position in that field without the degree, certs and experience in a higher level role like Sysadmin, which in itself will be difficult to get into with a few years in a similar junior level position. I have a strong interest in Linux and have desktop experience of a couple of years, and I am starting on a certification path (LPIC-1 &gt; RHCSA &gt; RHCE, a CCNA and an MCSA eventually) to lead to a RHCE eventually, hopefully by the time I complete my degree (5yrs).

I feel like the degree and certifications will come along on their own time, but the experience, that's a harder prospect. As I have a family to support and a mortgage to pay, taking an entry level position in Helpdesk or similar is not really an option, nor is an internship as I would need to leave my current full-time job to undertake it. Reading through threads, working on things in a home lab might be an option to show experience - but truthfully, how much weight does this hold?
I would leave my current job for a position if I could get paid the same, but the 25-30k pay decrease to go entry level for a helpdesk in AUS would drive me to ruin.

Any constructive advice?"

48w7y2,5,2016-03-04,I know where I want to end up...it's the getting there that is raising questions,masetrax,redhat,https://www.reddit.com/r/redhat/comments/48w7y2/i_know_where_i_want_to_end_upits_the_getting/,"This *could* be considered a cross post with https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/48vkzi/late_career_change_advice/ I suppose, but this is more Red Hat-centric in the way the question is being asked.

After years of tinkering and going back and forth, I've got rid of Macs, removed Windows and am using Linux as a daily driver. Fedora to be precise, and I love it. I've always had a fascination with Linux and technology in general, and I'm currently completing a computer science degree, and on the 21st will be sitting my first Linux cert (Linux essentials). From there I want to work up to a RHCE.

My question is regarding obtaining practical experience to get a position at Red Hat eventually. I intend to contribute to Fedora once my coding skills start getting up to scratch, and intend to get certifications, and do home labs for associated technology (Ansible, Openstack etc.) but I could find it hard to get experience. As mentioned in the linked post, I can't drop to a lower paid job, or have time off to intern as there are more people than myself to worry about, and I feel that either is essential to getting where I want to go.

Do you have any suggestions for me, so that I may be ""job-ready"" for a Red Hat position once I graduate?"
48wa2c,7,2016-03-04,"Need help... I'm a recently diagnosed ADHD Medical Student in India, how do I study well??? I'm very worried and alone.",PickUrBattles,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/48wa2c/need_help_im_a_recently_diagnosed_adhd_medical/,"Hi, I'm a medical student. I got in the profession because I was scoring real well in school and had great interest in science. I never realised how my methods of thinking, study and my personality as a whole was different than my mates. My parents and elder sister were emotionally abusive and always poked me for being 'careless' 'non-attentive' or 'forgetful', ignoring the fact that they were the same too. My father was a physically abusive, sick man too, who beat us up and beat our mother even worse. After cracking medical entrance I got in the top Medical College in my state. But my studies went worse and worse and I passed all years on boundaries. (Little above 50%). I suffered great loss during internship as my girlfriend, who was  the first and only person I could really talk to, died in a shocking accident. I was devastated. I must have been damaged even worse, as I don't even remember most things from the next month.  I couldn't talk to anyone, and when i tried to talk to a very close friend about my pain, she basically said it shouldn't be such a big deal, people lose bigger things in life, like the other day a boy from our college lost his father. ""In your case, its a girlfriend' is literally what she said. She said she liked me as a friend before because i wasnt clingy or needy (which i maybe seemed like now to her). This was hurtful to me and needless to say i stopped dealing with people altogether. Nearly for a year i didnt go to college. I thought after i took time to grieve, everything will be normal. After becoming a graduate we're supposed to prepare for post grad entrance exams, which are really tough. I couldn't focus and at the time whenever i studied, it was harder than ever before. I quit studies and did a good job for a year. I realised my potential was more, and wanted to pursue studies again. I quit the job and started studies. After a few months, concentration started fading away and i got stuck again. I decided to sort myself out and I took notes, wrote my symptoms down, and basically diagnosed myself as an ADHD patient. Everything matched (for those doubting my self-diagnosis, I have studies ADD in great detail, know whole DSM 4 &amp; 5 protocol for diagnosing. I'm ADHD alryt.) I started on methylphenidate, sold here as inspiral SR, (in USA it's Ritalin). I need to share my experience and problems with people-ADHD patients or not- who're sensitive and friendly. If you can help, you're most welcome. I really need help, because awareness of ADHD is very little in our country (India) even amongst psychiatrists. I have psychiatrists telling me it's a 'fanciful' diagnosis. As if it's not real. Hope that doesn't happen here. 
 Anyway my troubles are these-
1. I'm depressed. The more days i spend on medication, the more I realise about how I have suffered in my personal life because of ADHD, and despite trying, I have difficulty embracing my ADD. How can I, when literally no one here even knows the disease and even if I explained it to them, they're in denial. I'm on fluoxetine 10mg, I kept the dose low because I'm afraid of rebound depression. I'm thinking of increasing the dose in a few days.
2.I need help in studying- motivation, tricks to focus long hours studying, any positive ideas.
3. Personal life is hell. I'm all alone. I have lost too many friends as I get 'disappointed' in them after a while of being friends. This is happening more and more after death of my Girlfriend as I'm hiding the pain from most people. 
4. I can't let go my childhood bad memories. I can't talk to anyone about it. Only one person I opened about it is gone..
5. I am seriously worried about my marriage etc. Like I'm not married yet, but I don't think I'll get an understanding person who'll accept me, with my ADHD plus my tragic past. Most people in my profession here are very self centred and that's why I never got in a relationship with a girl from my college. My GF was a paramedic and we were really each other's best friends. She was so good, my expectations of a partner don't even seem realistic now. Should I worry??

Anyway, I want to thank anyone who read it all, esp.ADHD ppl out there, cuz I know it's nearly impossible for us to go through a black n white page whole. I am new to reddit, so if I'm mistaken anywhere please help me correct. "

48wht1,2,2016-03-04,"Me [22 F] with my ex [22 M] of 1.5 years, we decided to breakup so he could take a job in Africa.",mutualbreaku,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/48wht1/me_22_f_with_my_ex_22_m_of_15_years_we_decided_to/,"# Part 1 – The Surprising Beginning

I’m going to start from the beginning of our relationship because I think it provides a lot of context for how I am feeling now. Halloween 2014, my ex and I hookup after a night of heavy drinking. This leads to some mild drama within our mutual friend groups – someone who had expressed that they were not interested in pursuing a relationship with me became upset when they found out I was sleeping with other people. The two of us brush this off and continue to see each other about 1-2 times a week leading up to Thanksgiving. 



Before Thanksgiving break, we decide that we are “dating”, language that I misinterpreted as 1950’s style dating, not monogamous dating. This leads to our first argument when we attend a party and a female friend kisses me as a greeting. My ex completely shut down, wouldn’t talk to me, and we ended up going back to his apartment early. I pleaded with him for at least an hour to explain why he was upset, getting nowhere, until he reveals that his ex of 8 months had cheated on him and he couldn’t believe that I would do the same on the first day that we were official. My mind was blown – I didn’t think we were monogamous, poor communication *sigh* - I apologized and everything was fine. 



A note on the 1950’s style dating train of thought: He expressed that he wasn’t looking for a serious relationship, didn’t want to spend more time together than we already were (1-2 nights/week), and told me up front that he didn’t see a relationship with me lasting past his graduation date in May 2015. In hindsight this was in fact uncomfortable for me and should have been the first sign that this relationship was not a good idea. I had pretty serious feelings for him already, and I was willing to get whatever emotional connection I could from him. I had been single for over a year and was missing having a companion.



From here, things went smoothly for a while; we would get in small disagreements here and there but nothing that we couldn’t talk out. I prided myself on being patient and willing to have conversations that were difficult because I believed that they made our relationship stronger, and helped us to understand each other better. During Christmas break my family (Mother, younger sister, and Mother’s fiancé) took a trip to Florida for the week of Christmas (my sister was on school break). I told my Mom that I didn’t want to go on the trip so I could celebrate Christmas with my Dad and extended family on his side since I tend to get along with them much better. 



The week they are gone, my ex visits at my house from the day after Christmas to the day before my family is returning (I can’t remember exact dates). During this time I realize that I’m falling in love with him. I get scared and don’t say anything until we’re back at school near the end of January. I tell him how I’m feeling as we’re falling asleep one night and he says “I think I feel the same way, but we should talk about this tomorrow.” We do – we’re both nervous and see that there’s something more to our relationship, but he sticks to his guns about breaking up in May. He tells me that he loves me for the first time on Valentine’s Day.



At some point in February or March, we’re hanging out in his apartment with some friends – let’s call them Sally and Bill. Unbeknownst to me, Sally and Bill have an open relationship. Bill is being quite friendly towards me, but I don’t think much of it because we’re all drinking. I notice that my ex is being quite introverted (a clear sign to me at this point in our relationship that he is upset about something) and I suggest that we go back to my dorm room. We hang out there for a while in uncomfortable silence, he puts on his shoes and says he’s going for a walk, alone. When he comes back it’s clear that he has been crying and tells me that he’s upset that I was flirting with Bill. 


This marks argument number two about perceived cheating-esque behavior, the argument isn’t resolved until I suck it up and apologize, take the blame, and promise to be more aware of my behavior when I’m around other men. I tried to get to why me being extroverted is such a problem for him, but he does not want to consider the fact that this may be a problem with how he views my personality, rather than me doing anything wrong. (Does this make me an asshole??? I tried to understand his perspective, but I never truly felt like I had done anything wrong.)



At the end of this argument, he begins looking up Peace Corps jobs. I feel like he’s doing it to spite me for being too flirtatious with Bill and to strike any thought from my mind that we could stay together after graduation. I decide to be supportive – we’re young and he did seem to very be interested in the job and the kind of work the Peace Corps does. He chooses three countries in Africa (essentially the most remote you can be in the PC) and begins the application process over the rest of the semester. It sucks, but there was no reason in my mind to end things before we found out if he was selected or not. 



At this point (probably mid-April?) I start feeling the pressure of graduation and the fact that the plan is still to break up after graduation. We have a very long conversation, and he says that we could try things for the summer, but it has to be less committed. Upon further discussion, this means to him less pressure to communicate constantly (so less texting, but FB messaging/skyping a few nights a week and spending a weekend together every 1-2 weeks. 



I should also mention that his parents are unaware/he never told them explicitly that we are dating and that I never met them throughout the entire course of out relationship. This always sat with me funny, but he had personal reasons for that that I will not discuss here because they are private. I had a feeling that they knew because his mother liked a few photos that we were tagged in together, but this doesn’t necessarily lead to the conclusion that your son is dating someone. His brothers knew, and over the summer we would often use their condo as a place to meet up since it was exactly halfway between his family’s house and mine. 



---


#Part 2 - The Fraught Middle


Once summer begins, the guidelines we had laid out quickly collapse. I seem to recall that he rapidly felt that we weren’t communicating enough and that he missed me more than he expected. We talk every night by some means, Facebook messenger was a favorite because it was the easiest for us to have extensive conversations on. Skype sessions were rare because he was only comfortable skyping me when he was home alone, and this conflicted a lot with my work and internship schedule. 



During the PC application process (which extended until June, maybe July – my memory is fuzzy here), I feel as though he’s lying to me about certain things, but I don’t push the issue too far. Mainly, I don’t believe that he ever informed them that we were in a relationship. From all of the research that I have done about the Peace Corps, they seem to take relationships very seriously and I doubt that they never asked him if he was currently in one. This leads me to believe that he may have lied during this process and said he was single to have better chances of getting the job. I asked him at one point if he had told his recruiter about us and he said “No, they never asked so I don’t think they need to know” or something to that effect. I never brought it up again, but it never sat quite right with me. 



In August, he gets the news that he has been selected as a volunteer for PC Zambia and he almost immediately accepts the job. His departure date is set for the first week of February. I am devastated. All of the months I have poured into hoping this relationship will work out crumbles all around me and it is clear that there is a definitive end. We talk about it a lot, and decide to stay together until his departure. This makes me uneasy, but I was not ready to let go. 



I return to school in September with a renewed sense of impending dread, but I keep up the supportive role and try to be excited for him. I told myself this lie so many times I believed it and told it to everyone who asked: Of course I am happy for him, of course I am proud, of course I am excited, and of course I am sad that it means the end of our relationship. I was very open and honest with people about that part. I didn’t want anyone to think I was going to try to pull some Nicholas Sparks The Notebook bullshit. No, I’m not going to be stupid about this (Hah! I know I made dumb choices throughout this entire relationship. You know they say hindsight is 20/20). 


---


#Part 3 - The Tragic End


Our relationship withers. I become depressed and detached. I blame it on other things so he won’t feel guilty. I become irritable and I have a short temper with him. He notices and is constantly asking what’s wrong, but if I tell him how I really feel he’ll turn it around and accuse me of being unsupportive and point out that he is losing everyone, and I’m only losing him. I know this from the one time I tried to explain how I felt, and was completely shut down. No matter how many times he said we could talk about it, I never felt like it was a safe topic after he aggressively denied that I should be having significant emotional turmoil about this topic. 



Fast forward through many months of that tension, and we get to my birthday weekend, the week before he leaves. Surprisingly, I keep my shit together and we actually have a fantastic time with each other for the first time in months. By this I mean we didn’t get into petty arguments and I was able to keep the tone light. We talk a lot about him leaving, we cry together about the end of our relationship, and we agree that we are making the right choice by breaking up. He asks me to go see a campus counselor after his departure, and I agree. Remember, he thinks that my depression has nothing to do with him and that I’m having some serious emotional issues. I know I’ll be fine once it’s over and done with. 



He leaves with a long goodbye, many hugs and kisses, and good lucks. I collapse into my bed sobbing the life out of myself and my wonderful roommates smother me with love until I calm down. The next few days are awful, but then suddenly I’m fine. It’s like a light switch has flipped. I don’t feel anything at all anymore. And then I’m happy again. An emotion that I don’t think I truly felt since August, and it is now February. 



As part of the breakup we decided to remain friends – at the time we broke up we still felt very much in love with each other (in hindsight after writing all of this, I’m not super convinced that we were) and decided to communicate through letters during his service and to remain in contact.

#Part 4 - The ""He's not an asshole, really!"" Disclaimer 

I want to make it clear after rereading what I have written that I did enjoy my relationship as a whole with my ex. I still care about him, just not in a romantic sense. After the last six months specifically, it was (and is) difficult for me to view this relationship positively in aggregate. We had good times, it ran it's course, and probably should have ended sooner. We both learned from each other, and I have taken away lessons about what to look for in a future partner. Take my bias with a grain of salt. I don't want any of you thinking that he is a terrible person, because he isn't. We probably just were'nt the best match for each other

# Part 5 – The Summary of Questions


I feel free, like a giant weight has been lifted off my chest and at this point, March 4, 2016, I feel like I have moved on. But this leaves me with a few burning questions.


1. We promised we would write letters back and forth. I wrote and sent one around February 10th, but haven’t had the inspiration to write him again since then. He purchased a phone overseas and sent me a text on Feb 24 saying that he hasn’t been able to mail one to me yet, and probably will be unable for a while. He has one written but hasn’t been to a place with postage and has very limited income. Letters can take 4-6 weeks to arrive. **Should I wait until I get a letter from him to write again? I feel shitty not writing him more often, but I’m finishing off my last semester of college and don’t have much interesting to say about it.** I don’t know what kinds of things to ask more about until I get more detailed communication from him.


2. I’ve begun talking to someone (male) from my high school. We reconnected through a dating app, but so far it’s been really stimulating, friendly conversation. We’ve decided to get a drink while we’re home for spring break. **Does this make me a jerk? Am I moving on too fast? Does my ex have any right to know? Is it especially cruel to inform him through a letter IF I start dating someone new?**


3. I didn’t imagine I would feel so liberated after he left, but in some ways it makes me feel guilty. We had expressed that the door would be left open to get back together when he returns from his service if we are both still single. Up until his departure this felt like a viable option, but very soon after he left (within days) I adopted a very strong “fuck that” attitude.  **Are these feelings appropriate to communicate to him? Should I let him know that my attitude about everything has changed so drastically? Mainly, should I just keep the letters friendly life updates and questions about his service, or should also include details about my emotions?** I don’t want to cause him stress, and I feel that he still cares deeply for my well-being, but I don’t want to him lie by omission. **Do any of you have experience with this? What is my best route of action?**


4. **How do I reconcile the fact that I was really unhappy in this relationship for the last 6 months or so, and what can I do to prevent myself from putting myself in situations like this in the future?** This conclusion feels very strange to come to because I had partially convinced myself that his impending service wasn’t the source of problems in our relationship. I’m looking for strategies to pick up on red flags, let’s be honest – there were many in this relationship. **What can I do differently to protect myself?** 


5. Lastly, if you have any advice about fostering healthier relationships in the future, I would love to hear it. At this point, I am trying to build a solid base of friendship with this person I have reconnected with, but I feel that I could go beyond that. I don’t want to rush into this like I did my relationship with my ex. 


---


**Tl;dr** : My ex and I broke up so he could join the Peace Corps for service in Africa. I think that the breakup was the healthiest decision we could have made, and I am happy with it. How do I move forward, and how can I maintain healthy contact with him during his service? I still care about him and want to stay in touch.

I'm a current IT noob, with no related IT experience (save fixing computers for exercise bikes and troubleshooting avionics/electrical systems as a commercial pilot) who wants to pick up as many IT skills as possible so that I can qualify for a job upon graduation with the eventual aim of becoming a 'digital nomad'.

I realize that getting hired straight after a bachelors is probably a pipe dream and I should just choose the field which most interests me or gets me the independence to work remotely so I can travel, but the thing is , I don't know what those are and with my responsibilities I cannot really spend a lot of time/money exploring possibilities.

Of these three IT majors , security appeals to me on a visceral level because it seems like Ill have to always adapt and constantly solve new problems in creative ways (this is all based on my imagination btw , I see it as a sort of white hat hacker education, probably wrong on that).  However I have new ideas for apps or software every few weeks but not the tech expertise to build an elegant program so I would like to know how to do that because of the entrepreneurial opportunities and maybe it will help reach my goal of working from ""home"".

I know this is a scattered way to consider my future major but I am truly clueless.  Id like to avoid the multiple mistakes I made when getting my commercial pilots license and do this in the most efficient, cost-effective way which will position me to take the next steps whether that be an internship, freelance, part-time work or anything that will give me a chance to apply my education.

Any advice would be appreciated , I am going through the stickies and old threads to get the generic info.  Thank you all very much for all the past answers, it's easy to take the help on here for granted but I never do because other users advice has had great positive impacts on my life.  Thank You all!"

I was hoping you guys could help me in my situation.  

Ok, so I've been going to this program every morning this week. Their whole deal is that you go, sign up, and they select 40 people to place into internships. They make you wear a suit and tie and whatnot, they're going to certify us in Microsoft Office and Customer Service, and They claim they're whole goal is to help young adults build confidence, professionalism, and discipline. 

Now this all sounds nice, but I'm really starting to have some doubts about it. I remember when I was in my last year of high school (5 years ago! Time flies!) I did an internship through my school where I just ended up working as an office assistant for nearly nothing and it really didn't do much for me. Afterwards I found it really hard to get a job and ended up working at a supermarket for nearly a year. I'm a little scared this program might be the same. So far they've talked a lot about helping us, but this whole week all we've done is ""ice breakers"" where we basically just have group discussions about our fears and stuff.

On the other hand, my father works for Pepsi and they have a summer program where you work for 5 months and it actually pays really good. Only problem is they drug test and I've been smoking marijuana nearly everyday for years now. If I did sign up for this I don't know how soon they'd need me to take a drug test and I don't think I'll be able to pass one anyways.

Idk guys. I feel like I've really fucked myself over here. I stopped looking for jobs because I wanted to do this internship, but more and more I'm feeling like they're just blowing smoke up my ass. I feel like this isn't going to get me anywhere and if I go through with it I'll just end up back where I started. If I back out now though I might mot get the Pepsi job either and then I'll be really fucked because I haven't had a job since October, and when I was trying to find a job back then no one wanted to hire me. I feel like I'm just at a bad point in my life and no matter what I do I'm fucked. I'm tired of getting nowhwhere but I keep ruining my own chances. I just don't know what to do anymore."

It's my first job. I got it after finishing college, at the end of a one-year, part-time internship with the same company. As such, there wasn't an interview process to get the job.

Although I enjoy the work, the place it too small and disorganized, so advancement prospects are small. I have nothing like a mentor, and I'm the one making most of the positive changes in terms of design decisions, workflow, and coding standards. I'd like to move on soon, and to prepare for that, I've bought the two books listed in the title, and have begun practising my whiteboard coding.

One thing that struck me while reading *Elements of Programming Interviews*, is that a lot of the guidance seems to assume someone finishing college, or fresh out of it.

I'm wondering if the kind of interview process (fundamental problems solved on a whiteboard/something) described in the book is applicable to interviews for positions above entry level? Although I'm delighted to be brushing up on core algorithm and data structure work, I feel like most of my time working is not involved with that kind of thing. I spend most of my time designing systems for flexibility and maintainability, and representing business logic in the application, not designing the most efficient algorithm for a small task.

I will be an intern in NYC for a year and It its first time in NYC (originally from Asia) but I have lived in Florida before. People have told me to find living arrangements in craigslist and whatnot; but my Florida thing was arranged by my employer hence being clueless this time around. This time around in NYC its all up to me. I was wondering what info should I know about renting / leasing for a room and where are good areas to live etc. I will be working in the Upper East Side. I was recommended to live in Astoria Queens.

- Where to live? which places to avoid to live?

- Aside from Astoria Queens they told me Elmhurst is not bad
but which place?

- I've read 1 month rent + 1 month deposit to move, which is ok. I was wondering if is it cash upfront? and how to get like proof from landlord i paid and such? I have been told this usually is not the case, sorry totally clueless on this *no cards yet for the first few weeks or days since my company will apply one for me when I get there.

- Any red flags when looking for places and visiting etc. What i should typically watch out for.

- I'm only looking for a room since its the only thing my budget allows me to get, 400-600 a month kind of thing (sorry im poor) :( 

- I was told to do Air BnB for the first few days and physically check my potential housing leads i found online before moving in.

- Also when renting / leasing what would they need from me info wise?

Any thoughts and suggestions are very much well appreciated!
Sorry I'm a complete idiot on this and clueless.. any Enlightenment would go a long way!

Thank you in advance :)

Edit: THANK YOU ALL for the advice and help and the resources / links you have provided
though if you still got suggestions and such I'm open to them! keep em' coming!"

48yb7q,0,2016-03-04,Me [29 F] with my SO [30 M] of 5 years. I'm having trouble distinguishing between my own insecurities and proper relationship boundaries.,wheresthelineyo,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/48yb7q/me_29_f_with_my_so_30_m_of_5_years_im_having/,"I'm not the best at identifying my own complicated emotions (which is part of the problem) and I would love some outside perspective on my situation.  I'll try not to ramble too much.


**Relevant Background**

I met my current SO, John, 9 years ago in university.  We clicked almost right away and we were dating seriously within a few months.  I had never met anyone that I got along so well with.  Our quirky humour lined up so perfectly that other people even commented on it.  A year and a half into our relationship, I was offered a summer internship across the country.  I accepted it and left for 3.5 months.  I didn't know before I left, but my SO was going through a rough personal time and was feeling depressed.  He tends to shut off when dealing with stress like this and I was completely unaware.  My leaving for a few months was like the terrible cherry on a depression cake and, very long story short, about 1 month into my internship, he acted out and hooked up with someone else while drunk.  I was blissfully ignorant until about a week later he called me one night, totally broken, and told me everything.  Honestly, I still wanted to be with him but we both needed time apart to process and figure out what we wanted.  After the summer, we reconciled, talked everything through and gave it another shot.  I know not everyone would do this, but he was genuinely remorseful, didn't try to hide it, and promised to work on the things that led to that moment so it wouldn't happen again.  We had a great relationship for the next 1.5 years.


Jumping forward cause I don't want to write a total novel, after 3 years together, John moved to another city for grad school.  I still had another year of undergrad so I had to stay behind.  We tried to make the LDR thing work for a few months but it just wasn't working so we broke up.  I went on to date another guy for 2 years, which ended for reasons of its own, but I always remained on good terms with John.  He finished grad school and moved back to our home town where we reconnected on a deeper level.  It was clear that we were still completely mad about each other, everyone could see it, so we got back together.  A year after that we got an apartment together where we have now been for a year.  To sum up, we dated for 3 years, were apart for 3 years, and have been back together for 2 years, living together for 1.


**The Issues**

We are both fiercely independent people who struggle with properly communicating our emotions.  However, when we disagree, we do so respectfully and caringly and our infrequent fights are talked through rationally and we each compromise.  He is my best friend and I can't imagine a better match for me.  Our issues arise from us not identifying and communicating our emotions constructively.


I struggle with insecurity in this relationship.  I have very high self-esteem so it can be a bit disconcerting to feel these things, but I think that from our rocky first two years in the relationship, I have these remnant nagging doubts.  The reason I am writing about this now is something that happened last night. We lead somewhat independent social lives.  We often do things together but we also have independent friends that we see.  Last night we were talking about our evenings (I was working late) and John mentioned that he grabbed drinks with a co-worker.  Later in the evening it came up again and he said it was with Elliot, a female co-worker of his.  I have never met Elliot but I've heard her name come up once or twice.  This type of thing really flares up my insecurities.  She is our age and pretty much John's type.  Something similar happened last year when John and a different female co-worker, Carla (who was also an old family friend), got lunch and went for a walk in the park while I had to work.  Again, he told me after the fact.  We talked about it and we addressed the fact that this brings up my insecurities even though there is nothing going on which is why he didn't tell me until afterwards.  He said that he knew I would feel insecure and he didn't want me dwelling on it all day at work.


Before I ramble too much more, my question is how do I differentiate between my irrational insecurities and reasonable relationship boundaries I can request from John?  I know I can't project my own insecurity on him if we are to have a healthy relationship but at this point, I can't tell if he should be doing more to reassure me or if I just need to work through my own emotional junk.  Is it okay for him to hang out one-on-one with female coworkers (that I haven't met yet) and have him tell me afterwards?  I need a little perspective here!


**tl;dr**: My own insecurities flare up when my SO hangs out one-on-one with female friends due to a rocky past.  Where is a reasonable place to draw the line without letting my insecurities rule everything?"

My lack of experience seems to be the main draw. Basically, it's becoming more or less apparent that I won't have an internship this summer. My question is how much this will set me back down the rest of my career path. I'm not looking for some high profile job with google or some other tech giant, all I want is a decent paying job in Colorado. Everyone around me is so obsessed with getting internships, though, so I can't help but feel even my relatively meager ambition will be made difficult."

The university is not that great (all the math part is good, but that's all) - no actual projects, absolutely no signs of internship in my area, no subjects I want to learn more about, like AI or machine learning, tough schedule (half of the subjects are obligatory and completely pointless). So the options are to try to matriculate to the universities I'd love to attend, or to go through all four years at my university, while getting only good math education (not great, just good).

Moreover, for a long time I wanted to migrate to the US, so this is one more reason to drop my university.

I thought of applying to those universities too late, when the last year at my high school was almost over. I do have a lot of achievements on a national level (even though where I live it is not that hard to achieve this), and I've competed at International Science Olympiad. Also, I have started a club where I taught younger students math and programming and which was pretty much successful. My GPA at high school was average (I didn't care about it much, being busy with my club) being about 4.3-4.5 out of 5, at the university currently it is pretty much above average.

Is it ok to apply to those universities (for bachelors degree), while I'm currently enrolled in the university, or is it better to graduate first and apply for masters? Is it a big deal that I'm trying to apply while already being a student, wouldn't it be a drawback for my application?

All advises are greatly appreciated!"

I actually broke down crying from the stress. The interviewers kept pushing for an answer and I just could not think at all. They asked me to step out for a few minutes and I tried to calm down but when I came back in it looked like one of the three interviewers was laughing.

And she said it with all the seriousness that she could possibly muster.

I am so fed up with the garbage and vitriol that this woman spews every time I talk to her. And now that I am in therapy, I feel as though I finally have the strength to stand up to her in a way I was terrified of doing before.

She called me this morning under the pretense of checking in on how my husband and I are doing. Little did I know, she was actually calling to grill me about my husband's and my future plans. To be short, my husband and I are both in grad school, but his program is twice the length of mine (phd vs masters), and we will not be starting a family until we have graduated. So my nmom starts on about how it's husband's fault I moved out of state, how it's his fault I can't start my life, how he's so selfish for putting me on hold, how he's just a lazy college student.

She's never been the kindest to husband, but she's never been outright rude to him either. So when she was explicitly disparaging my husband, I got mad. She has been abusive to me all my life. And I always took it. Maybe I'd yell back, but it'd always be through tears, and it'd always be feeble. I let her get to me. But no. Not today. Not when you're abusing my husband.

So I finally did it. I stood up to my nmom. No tears. No fear. Certainly no fucks given. I told her that our future plans were decisions we made together, that she had no business knowing if she couldn't support us, and that if she cares about me and my life, then she has to care about my husband because he is part of my life. I told her that husband is extremely hard working. He's a full time student, is a research assistant, has an internship, and a part time job, so he is in no way a ""lazy college student"". I told her I was happier now than I was before we moved.

She said that my future was her business because she's my mother and, as my mother, her future is tied directly to mine, as I owe her my life. She said she needs to know where my future is headed because she wants to make sure that she is taken care of in her old age, and that my husband was dragging her down by prolonging his education. I told her that kids do not take care of their elderly parents because of an obligation or a debt to be paid. They do it because they love their parents. She said that love is fickle and the only true thing is that I wouldn't be alive if it weren't for her, therefore I owe her everything in life.

She then went on a long diatribe about how all children owe their parents their lives and that debt can never be repaid no matter how much they do. I just scoffed and told her I didn't agree with her. People are more inclined to take care of the people they care about and love, not the people that force them through guilt, insults, and disdain.

The conversation ended when she told me if that's how I felt, then to never call her again. This is a threat she has made before and very often, but then she always ends up calling the next week anyways like nothing ever happened. However, since I've been in therapy, I've come to realize that this is a woman that I have no interest in keeping in contact with. The first time she said to never speak to her again, I felt relief and calm to think that I might be done with her forever. This ended up not being true, obviously, but it gave me a lot of insight into how I truly felt. So now, I kind of would like to force her hand and make her keep her threat of never contacting me again.

I guess my question is should I cut contact with my nmom? She's never done anything so extreme that it warrants me cutting contact. But things have built up so much, and now she's attacked the one person I hold dearest to me. If I have a good enough reason to cut contact, how do I do that without cutting contact with my entire family? I'm sure I could still keep in touch with my brother. But my dad would inevitably side with my nmother, and  cutting out my nmom would mean they would cut me off from my extended family, who I actually do love. SO what is the best way to go about this if I should at all?"
48zbz8,5,2016-03-04,I'm about to finish my 3rd year of ME. I'm (not-so-seriously?) considering doing CompE.,ChrisVolkoff,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/48zbz8/im_about_to_finish_my_3rd_year_of_me_im/,"I love mechanical engineering, however I don't have the best grades (GPA in the low 2s). The best grades I got were in the couple programming classes we have to take as part of the ME curriculum. Honestly, it looks like I'd do waaayyy better in computer engineering.

I took programming classes (object-oriented, 3D programming) before and it was a breeze. I'm fairly certain I could get good grades in CompE.

I really don't want to quit, but it seems like I'll have to do my ME B.Eng in 5 years, so I thought about taking some computer engineering classes so that I stay full-time.. and maybe just do the full B.Eng. Because, really, now that I've done all the math/basic classes, it would probably only take 2-3 years.

Tuition cost isn't really a problem here; it's pretty cheap. I probably could do only 1 internship and pay tuition for 3-4 years.

Have any of you done - or considered doing - something like this?"

They want experience and I have none and I need experience to get a job. Catch 22.

I graduated in may with a CS degree with my main languages being C and Java and I live in NYC and I havent been able to land any jobs. I've been on several interviews but it always comes down to me not having enough experience. I wasn't able to get an internship because I used my summers to graduate on time and when I try and get internships now, companies wont even look at me because Im no longer a student. Ive been on 5-6 interviews and gotten to the final round of 2 companies and didnt end up getting hired. I havent been sitting on my ass this entire time. I did two projects one in Java and one in Rails. I deployed a full stack web application in rails by myself for my rails project. With java, I never feel like I know enough and its just an endless rabbit hole. They also always want more experienced candidates with java jobs. I've applied to a few jobs in Connecticut and Massachusetts because theyre more receptive to junior candidates than NYC but I honestly just feel down because I'll get to the final round of interviews and theyll tell me theyre going with a more experienced candidate. I've been at this for a while and I just feel hopeless. It just seems like I'll never be good enough at this point.

My day: 1) apply to jobs 2) code side projects 3) study algorithms

I am a sophomore CS Major with a very low GPA of 2.88 (3.76 in Major). This is caused by my non-exist study habit for the first 3 semester of collage, and I hate my self for it. I am currently trying to bring it up to 3.3. But as of right now, it is very hard to find an internship with my current GPA. 

I was just wondering if it is even possible to get into a REU program (National Science Foundation Reserch Experiences for Undergraduates) in Mobile Cloud Security with my current GPA. As it is a program ment for PHD students.

Should I just focus on finding an internship instead?"
48zo5h,17,2016-03-04,"I got hired for a job I'm underqualified for, over people who were overqualified, because my boss said he wanted to give me a chance. Now I'm struggling with the work.",awkwardtbh,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/48zo5h/i_got_hired_for_a_job_im_underqualified_for_over/,"What do I do?

A bit of background - I graduated from uni and spent 6 months unemployed trying to get just about anything. Even ringing places and asking to make tea for free with them wasn't working out for me. It was really getting me down.

One day I applied for a job way above my expected paygrade. Average graduate salary is £21k in the UK, I applied for something at £32k that come with all sorts of whacky bonuses and extras. It asked for years of experience and all sorts of extras that I obviously lacked.

I just applied because I was in a routine of just about trying everything and by some miracle, I got invited to interview.

I turned up and when I sat in the interview it was obvious this huge company was way out of my league as I was just starting my career. The people that interviewed me were also incredibly friendly. When I left, I rang my parents and said 'it seemed like a great opportunity, I'm just too aware that they're looking for somebody with way more experience.'

Somehow, I got a call back one day and they offered me the job. The company car. The bonuses. The phones and gadgets. The expenses paid trips. I took it.

I've been working here for about 6-8 months and I just feel like I'm always fucking up in an obvious way or not really getting stuff like I should. Sometimes I think this is natural but then I panic because my boss has gone into detail about how they had people who'd worked all these amazing other jobs for years that they turned down because they thought they'd give me a golden chance.

I am so grateful for the job and the amazing chance, but I can't help but feel I'm just not experienced enough and not on the ball enough and I'm letting my team down. I keep asking obvious questions and I feel like they're just too afraid to tell me I'm a bit more like an intern than a colleague. It's stressing me out because I try my best but sometimes my boss asks me to do things and I've no idea where to start. It stresses me out and I end up just pestering people who eventually do it for me or just tell me what to do.

What should I do? I'd speak to my boss but I don't want to sound ungrateful."

So far, I've gotten an A in every single programming-based course I've taken (Intro to Programming, Intro to OOP, Into to Algs &amp; Data Structures). I know I need to be applying for summer internships to stay competitive, but the idea absolutely terrifies me. I feel like I don't know anything and would get destroyed in an interview.


I don't have anything to put on my resume except my GPA and my job in an unrelated field (I'm 25 and going back to school). I read this sub a lot. I know I need to be working on a personal project to put on my resume, but every time I research ideas, I get so overwhelmed. I don't even know where to start. Everything feels so far out of the scope of what I can do. I do great on my assignments, but I feel like I am so far from building anything usable in the real-world. I get better grades than all the people that I know from my CSCI classes, but I feel like I have no idea what I'm doing. Am I just hanging around mediocre people?


I can't even figure out what I'm interested in. There are so many specializations - web development, etc., that I haven't been exposed to in school. When it comes to figuring out what to do for a project, I feel like I'm being pulled in all directions.


I know I need to get moving, and fast, if I want to have any sort of internship lined up this summer. If anyone has any advice for me, I would greatly appreciate hearing it!

I have been looking at a software engineering career for the last 2 years of high school.  I also finished all programming classes available in my school (Python, C++, Java, HTML, CSS, Javascript, JQuery and Node.js). I additionally took a system admin class and network administration class which taught me about common IT issues / solutions, layers of the OSI model and other stuff (Mostly relating to the CCNA certification). I  have a wide range of knowledge with Linux which is my operating system of choice (Arch). Lately I have been interested with penetration testing as it is pretty cool but fear it might not be a sustainable career . I enjoy almost all of the subjects equally but cannot stick with a career decision.  I have credits with all of my local Community colleges which I plan to attend for 2 years and then move up to a 4 year . (The credits from the 2 year college append to the 4 year college degree for a total of 4 years)  So the question is what field do you think I would enjoy the most while maintaining a hefty income?

The last time I did, it was about my internship in Italy and you guys gave me a few great trips about staying on track while abroad. Unfortunately, things didn't go as planned. I did bring my food scale with me, but it turned out that my internship had me working hard, getting home super tired, and having little time to cook while in a house with 7 other people who want to use a tiny little kitchen! I figured cutting wasn't going to work out for me, and tracking on MFP was difficult as Milanese restaurants were nowhere to be found (in that case sometimes I'd just log the food itself and hope for the best.) So I decided to maintain, which worked very well for me. After leaving Milan, the next day I found myself on a plane to Lebanon for a week to see family. This was absolute torture. Milan was easy to maintain because of the constant walking -- Lebanon was not. Delicious food and snacks, pressure from family members to constantly eat, and luxurious amounts of relaxation soon turned to laziness, boredom, and 'hunger'. The inactivity also caused my leg/thigh to become stiff to the point of needing painkillers. I hated myself, was super bloated, and always hungry. 

I finally got home back last Wednesday. The next day I went to get loads of groceries and right went back to tracking. Initially it seemed I'd gained 1lb and went back to 176 lbs, but I figured it might also be water weight because I got my period. I've been tracking and eating well ever since, it feels so relaxing. I got a lot of criticism in Italy from my roommates for being a freak who weighs their food, as well as from people in Lebanon who hear about what I do. But to be honest, I love this. I love this lifestyle and the control I have over myself now. I weighed myself today, and I was down to 174 lbs :)! I'm not sure what percentage of it is water weight and fat. I should have been down to 171 lbs by now, but I'm glad I haven't gained anything. Thank you all, it's great to be back. "

While I enjoyed EE, I also absolutely loved my two C++ classes (Intro to C++ and data structures, basically).


I'd really like to further look into going into software development as a career (especially since the job market seems much better).


 I know the common advice to an EE in my position would be to write embedded and low level code, but writing at that level is unappealing to me. Why would I want to write software where you have to optimize for size/speed to the extent you do for a microcontroller when I could be developing for a computer or mobile where resources are comparatively limitless?

I've spoken with companies about software positions at career fairs and the like, but unsurprisingly they tell me that they're more recruiting CS majors.

Do you guys have any advice on how I might secure an internship in software engineering? My resume is decent, 2 internships and faculty research, but of course none of it's in software, which seems like a hard sell.

Thanks for the help!

P.S: Would it be worth it to get a minor in CS even if it takes an extra semester (so 4.5 years?)"

So Im happy to say that my work in high school has paid off and I now have quite a few great options to choose from in terms of College. Here they are as of right now



* University of Maryland ~ 40k/year

* UIUC ~ 40k/year

* Michigan ~ 57k/year

* University of Pittsburgh - 6k/year

* UT Austin(in state) ~ 20k/year




I have gotten into the CS departments for all of these schools and Im still waiting for GeorgiaTech and Berkeley but I really think the decision will be coming down between Pitt and UT. My parents are willing to help me pay for college but they are really loving Pitt's price tag over UTs. I want to go to the school that puts me in the best position for exploring and ultimately has the best ROI in the end. Im not too sure what I want to do as my career. A lot of my friends just want a job at one of the Big 4 and I know those are nice jobs to have, but I believe theres more to be discovered than just a Google internship. I really just want to work on NASAs quantum computer or potentially start my own company. Or maybe Im just getting too ahead of myself. All advice is appreciated. "

I've recently been offered an internship at Motorola and another one at a start up indie studio and I'm having a difficult time choosing between the two.

Do I go with the paid position at Motorola that will look very impressive on a resume? Or do I go with the unpaid indie studio position to get my foot in the gaming industry's door?

I'm looking for advice from people in the gaming industry, but others are welcome to offer theirs.

First off, let me say it is not my intention to upset anyone, just looking for some advice.

I will be moving in with my uncle and aunt this summer while completing a 4 month internship. They are vegan and I am not. I live on a student's budget, meaning that I eat at home rather than in restaurants and would typically have non-vegan items in my fridge. Since I would be sharing the fridge and kitchen with them, I feel this might cause some tension or frustration for them.

They are going out of their way to have me, so I do not want to disrupt them any further by bringing non-vegan items into their home.

My uncle, who is my blood-relative, has said that I may bring non-vegan items, but I would say he is ""less strict"" about his vegan diet and doesn't necessarily represent the feelings of my aunt who is more passionate about veganism. I am open to eating vegan while staying with them, but I fear that the transition may be difficult for me and would occasionally want non-vegan items.

I'm just looking for some general input and advice. How would you feel if I were coming into your home? What can I do to make my diet less intrusive and respectful to theirs? Thank you."

How do my job prospects look for future employers?,sw1mm3r202,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/490gt6/graduating_in_december_with_a_28_gpa_and_no/,"I am a management information systems major and due to my situation I haven't been able to work at any internships. I am fully independent due to my family background and have to maintain a full time job during school and the summer that pays $20+ an hour in order to pay for school, rent, books, insurance, car.... Basically everything. My gpa is also low due to the fact I started in Mechanical Engineering and struggled through those classes freshman year and earned a 2.0 my first year. Since then I have had a 3.0 gpa since switching to  MIS.

I have gotten turned down from jobs because of a lack of experience. I can't find an internship that pays enough/has enough hours so that I can even scrape by. I currently know VB.Net very well and have learned java and started learning php in my free time. I have even created websites as well as done a java project in order to add some personal experience to my resume in my free time. 

The job I currently have is a waiter/bartender at a nice restaurant that I have been working consistently through school for 2 years. Would the fact that I started as a bussed and moved up in less than a year to bartender and am now being looked at for a potential manager position in the next month or so help out at all?

The job search has become very frustrating and I don't know what to do. How am I supposed to gain experience if I support myself financially and have no wiggle room since even now I have to budget everything to the last penny. Are employers forgiving in these types of situations or will I have to take a terrible job out of college because I am considered unsought goods in the term of labor? If an employer even made a contact to my current manager they would say I strive to do well and am one of the best workers they have had work under them. What can I do to increase my chances of landing a decent job?"

I feel like she (let's call her Katie) and I have helped each other grow as people, and I really care about her happiness.  

However, the past 1.5 years have been long distance.  I'm going to university and can only see her a few times a year.  With internships starting this summer, I'll see Katie even less than before.  She'll be starting university elsewhere next year, and that means a minimum of 4 more years separated (not counting grad school or future jobs).  I'm happy when I'm home, and so far we've made it work, but it's taxing. 

I'm also thinking about what the long-term future might be with her.  Katie takes her work very seriously and let's bad scores get to her.  She's had issues with anxiety and I don't think she likes herself as a person.  I feel like she's a little dependent on me as a source of happiness, and I don't know if that's healthy.  But so far, these characteristics have been consistent, and I don't know if they'll continue or go away.  Could this be a warning sign that our relationship will become unhealthy?

She's been my only serious relationship, so I can't help but wonder what a relationship would be like with a specific girl from my school.  I think that crushes naturally happen, and I know I should ignore it, but a part of me wants to at least explore other relationships.  I love Katie, but my feelings are torn.  

So it's a good time to evaluate the relationship. I feel selfish qualifying Katie's flaws, and I know I have my own, but it's best to be objective before committing.  Katie and I have had so many great memories, and I want whats best for me and for her.  I think she's fantastic, but is she the one?  I've been thinking about our relationship for a few days, and I'll take another week or two before doing anything.  I appreciate any perspectives or insights, since I have no idea what to do.

tl;dr:  I'm with a great girl, but I don't know if she's the one.  "
491jcd,13,2016-03-05,Tradeoff between GPA and Extracurricular programming,biggieescobar,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/491jcd/tradeoff_between_gpa_and_extracurricular/,"Hi, I would really appreciate some advice on a college crisis.

I am an freshman studying computer science at a target school for the Big 4 and other competitive industries like algo trading. Basically, I have an opportunity to join an finance startup at my university as a software dev/data scientist, it's nothing too crazy, a commitment of perhaps 8 hours a week. 

In the past, I've made many sacrifices to maintain a solid GPA, like 3.85+.   I naturally did stuff like sacrifice my social life, and other commitments to make sure I was getting pretty good grades.

This semester, classes/activities have gotten a lot more time-consuming for me.  I'm sleeping less, rarely socializing for the sake of it, but I don't feel worse. In fact, I'm a lot healthier and I really feel like I'm learning skills that will help me make a difference in the long run. 

It's not that I don't do extracurricular activities. I'm part of a dance team, that's like 7 hours/wk. I'm part of a entrepreneurship club &amp;  some other low maintenance clubs (basically stuff that looks good on resumes and the effort to reward ratio is fantastic)

In college, has maintaining a good GPA really rewarded anybody? I mean, like a potential reward I see would be getting a job in something like algo trading/Palantir type stuff out of undergrad, but I doubt that's necessary in life for me to be ""successful"" in my early career years.

The seniors who I respect a lot, who are getting jobs at the hottest tech&amp;finance companies, don't really work on high commitment projects during the school year itself (I may be highly biased). They do great summer internships, but only a couple medium/low commitment clubs throughout the year. In the long run, I have no doubt they'll be running startups. 

TLDR - My schedule is booked with classes and random shit. Should i join a fintech startup at my university as a software dev/data scientist at 8 hr/week and learn how to code and make a cool product? Is that experience in college, of committing myself to a project, going to give me skills that will help me out in the long run? Or should I just maintain a nice GPA (which probably will only be marginally better?) and hope the rest will fall into place later?

Edit: I'm going for like a 3.7 GPA without the startup involved. With the startup, it might just drop to a 3.5 . Is that okay?"

I don't know. I apologize if this happens to be lengthy, and thank you for any advice/words of wisdom. Also, I think I've made several mistakes. I've never told the exact truth and I want to share it someone. I'm also slightly drunk.

I'm 23, as a matter of fact, I just turned 23. I was a nerd in high school, and not very popular/cool. Senior year, I was building confidence and finally making some friends, etc..but I was still shit lonely. I desperately wanted a girlfriend, someone to call mine, someone to relate to. So, being the nerdy, anti-social 17 yr old, I resorted  to going on online chat rooms to meet people. This one time, I had a good/fun convo with this girl who was 14 in Slovenia. It was cool, we like decided to be ""pal pens"" and it was just fun to just speak to someone new, make a new friend. I was giving her life advice and about her bf, etc. Anyway, one night (valentines day 2011) her older sister came home after a fight with her, then, boyfriend. She was seemingly upset and went to check on what her sister was doing. She saw that her sister was chatting with me, and took over. We started talking, and my god the connection was through the roof. We just hit it. Without going much into the detail, we ""fell in love"" and she broke up with her bf. Over the next 2 years, we were in a long distance relationship and she had visited me in nyc three times in that time. Only thing I can say is, I was head over heals in love with this girl. I saw my entire future with her. Having kids, a family, the house, everything. I know I'm, then, a 18 year old thinking I know life. 

During this time, I also graduated from the highschool, and went on to college where I had made a LOT of new friends. No one knew the loser I was, and it was great. We had a group of friends, and there was this one girl in the group that I had my eye on and kind of hit on. SO, while being ""madly in love"" with my then gf, I also started hanging out with the girl from college. A lot. We hung out, we watched movies together, went to class together, had cuddled by that point. I wanted her, but I had a girlfriend. She knew and I now believe that she was respecting that and not making any moves. Fast forward, college girl gets into a relationship and I'm super bummed (but why??). But we're still good friends but not as much. Fast forward some more, we both end up out of our relationships and start hanging out even more. We hung out so much, and connected even more than before. and that's when I had realized, that I was in love with her. but it was too soon, and I didn't know what to do. Time passes, and we're still great friends but I'm dying inside. This one night, we had a party at her place. We were all drunk, and in the moment, she sat on my lap. I hugged her. She looked back at me, and smiled. I was in heaven. I thought that was it. I've had never felt happier in my life. The night went on. don't remember if i slept over or went home but def didn't sleep with her. The next day, she texted me saying she was drunk, and it was weird last night. okay #feelingshurt. Now I was even more confused. But we kept hanging out, and I finally wanted to find out if she liked me or not or what was going on. We were out to watch a movie, and while walking to the theater, I did a stupid test to see if she liked me. As we were walking, I would step away from her, and would observe if she would follow me. she did. OMG wow, I think she likes me. Anyway, while walking, we were talking about this guy that had come over during another party, and was hitting on her/annoying her. I was telling her to just straight up tell him, etc..and she did. But he was very persistent.  SO, one day we were talking over facebook, and she tells me that she thinks she gonna give this guy a chance. I freak out, and flip. I tell her, I'm madly in love with her and I'm so sorry that I didnt't tell her earlier. She gets super upset, because i'm her best/closest friend. She doesn't like me like that. We ( i mean I) decide to not talk anymore. She is super upset but starts dating the guy. I was a wreck.  

Fast forward, we decide we missed each other and we could be friends whatever. Her bf does not like me, and I never hangout with him. But me and her, still hangout, every now and then but not even anywhere near as much or closely as before. I am devastated. I had gotten her a job at where I was working at college, and it was just weird/awkward. But we also took lunch breaks together and hung out then for an hour. This went on for a year or so. During which I had ""dated"" a girl for one semester. Then, I met a girl. I thought she was perfect. 

this brings us the to the present, or almost at least. I tell my friend about her over lunch, and she's excited. She wants me to ask her out, and even pushes me for it. I kind of really think this new girl is super cute, and is the same race as me, same religion, a future doctor, etc. So, I take my chances, and ask her out. She says yes, and that was 2 years ago. 

There was a lot of drama with this new girl, with her ex. I have never been good with exes but life throws lemons at you. I was really falling for this girl and it was just difficult. But we were moving past it. One day, I get a call from my best friend, crying and asking if I can meet with her. I left everything at work, and ran to meet her. She was crying, and I knew what was happening. I held her so close. She thought her bf was cheating on her. I suggested that she part aways now before she actually finds out and is even worse. She doesn't heed my advice, and says she can't live without him and loves him. Few weeks later, he admits that he's been cheating. She's heartbroken, and I'm pissed. Now, she's single, and I'm with my gf. We start hanging out more again. She doesn't really talk about her bf/ex (and she never really did when we hung out)  and I don't talk about my gf at all either. 

Over time, whatever it may have been but I've lost my interest in my girlfriend, maybe we'RE busy with our jobs.idk. There's few reasons why I start to feel distant from my gf. I don't even know anymore. My best friend and I keep hanging out again, going out to drink, her coming over, etc BUT she always keeps her distance. And she's made it very clear all the time that she isn't interested in me that way, and I'm her best friend. it couldn't happen. 

I never got over her. She came over tonight, after grabbing dinner together, and we played board games and drank with my roommates. I am so in love with her, I look at her and she's perfect. I want to hold her so badly, I want her to want me so bad. I walked her home (2am) and said I was still pretty awake. She said she was very tired. I wanted to ask if she wants me to come up, and maybe watch a movie but she was tired and I wanted to respect that. BUT I've learned to not have regrets and go for it. So as I am walking back, I call and ask and she says no she's tired and I should go home and watch it my roomates. 

TL;DR - my best friend I, have been through a lot, I fell in love with her, she said she wasn't interested, and it wouldn't happen, I ""moved on"" and she moved on, we've had bf/gf since then. She's now single, and I'm not happy with my gf for several reasons, and I can't stop thinking about my best friend. I never got over her, never stopped loving her. i feel shitty about it, weak. I told her I broke up with my gf (which I intent to do in the next few days). 

I can be a man, and accept it for what it is, or cut her off, or tell her again, seriously, and ruin everything, again. I keep telling myself that I should just be happy having her as my best friend. But I want more, I can't stop loving her, or caring for her. The way I care for her, I've never cared for anyone else. I love her. i fucking love her, and I want to do anything to give us a shot. 

p.s i had an intern work for me over the last summer, I had a crush on her for a little bit. She was very pretty, and extremely smart. I don't know why I didn't break up with my gf, and ask the intern out. Everyone in the office thought we had a thing. I mention this because I don't know if I'm not breaking up with my gf bcuz I'm a pussy and i want to know with a certainty that I can have someone else I want. I'm such an idiot.

P.S.S we're both addicted to imgur, its one of my favorite things."

Most of it has to do with my severe depression. I usually suffer from holiday blues, but due to some personal things going on in my life right now, my depression has been worse and I don't know what I want to do with my life anymore. I'll try to be as clear as I can about it. 

So my family is poor, dirt poor. By poor, I mean my mom making 30k a year poor. My dad died of cancer a year ago and my mom started feeling the effects of his death summer 2015, when my mom stopped getting my dad's social security benefits (my dad got in a car wreck that fucked up his legs and couldn't work anymore).  Because of that I vowed to drop out of school to get a job to help her pay bills if she couldn't handle it. I said I'd work, then pay for the remaining six classes I need to graduate. I was going to college full time, so I didn't work because there wasn't really a need for it, until now.

So right now I am not attending school and in need of a job. That's not the problem, however. I decided that I don't want to be a school teacher because I do not think I am mature enough or responsible enough to handle a job like that. Mom wants me to finish school because I'd be throwing away my education. I'm only 6 classes away from graduating, but I need to do all these exams for teaching that I feel would be worthless to take if I'm not interested in this field anymore. So I need to take all these exams, do some extracurricular stuff, and an internship to finish up my teaching degree. But as I mentioned before, I do not feel like it would be worth all the effort if I'm not going to enjoy being a teacher.

So now I don't know what I want to do with my life. Here I am at home just rotting away, all melancholy and shit with no job or anything. If I worked, I don't know what I'd want to apply for. I should mention that I've also developed a nocturnal schedule, so I sleep at 6 am and wake up at 2ish pm.  I'm a very sensitive person and am afraid of confrontations, so something like a call center or a security guard are out of the question (this is actually one reason why I don't want to be a teacher; because I'm too wimpy for that sort of job). 

But really, I just want your guys' insight on what I should do? Should I finish up on school or start career hunting?  I'm really burnt out on school and I really don't know what else to go for because nothing really appealed to me. What jobs/careers could you guys recommend for me? I only have restaurant experience, although I dislike working with people and have like no skills. I'm good at typing and art, that's about it. 

TLDR: Need advice on whether I should finish up on school or not or if I should just seek out other career options. "

I am building a product which logs website visitor information.

I need to be able to look for specific patterns in this visitor data.

For example, let's say there was a sudden spike in visitors tonight from 8 PM - 11 PM.

I want my product to be able to recognise periods when there is a spike in traffic.

I understand I could write some brute force code which does something like counts the number of visitors in every 5 minute period and compares the current value with the previous 5 minute period value, and then compares the previous 5 minute period value with the one before that, and so on for perhaps the previous ten 5 minute periods, and try to judge if traffic is increasing.

But obviously this is a horrible way to achieve this.

Are there any common pattern/trend algorithms or techniques or general best practices for this sort of thing?

Also, what is this area of study called? Is it statistics? If so, is this something I could hire a statistics intern to help with, or is it too advanced?

Sorry if these are stupid questions.

Thanks for your advice.

491vd4,21,2016-03-05,New grad - Front-End Developer [Bay Area],JM_Santos,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/491vd4/new_grad_frontend_developer_bay_area/,"I would like to take this opportunity to share my experiences on my job hunt that started at the beginnings of this year (January, 20th, 2016). I will be really detailed about my background and what I have been doing lately. You can start making some coffee to go along with this post.

--- Before Graduation ---

First, as the title suggests I am located in the Bay Area (South Bay). I am a newly-graduated international student from a non-renowned university. My main focus as today is Front-End Development with hopes of some day becoming a Full-Stack Developer.

The reason I decided to do Front-end was simply luck, I was hearing from one of my friends that today's job market is highly competitive and a bunch of people are having a tough time finding a job after graduation. This prompted me to make some researches of what I should I do and how to prepare myself to it. I found that having projects was important, but one of the most attractive things for an employer is your working history (some people may disagree).

This was the main reason I started to dig in this new word of 'internships'. I went straight to Craigslist and started to send away my old resume. This went for a couple of weeks, until finally I started to get responses, many were 'sorrily to inform me that they have decided to move forward with other candidates' (Hahh). However to my surprise, one small startup offered me the chance to work for as an unpaid front-end developer (never did web on my life, besides basic HTML).

My main duties were to work remotely doing small features on websites or working with mocks. This went for six months, I would work for them on weekends or at night, they didn't mind as long as I met deadlines. It was kind of tiring, because I had to keep a part-time job at my school to pay for my studies. Nevertheless, for some reason the startup didn't do well and at some point I never heard of them, their site went down, and well I found myself without a relevant job.

I kept sending my resume just to tell myself that at least I was 'trying'. Lucky me, another startup contacted me offering me another remote job since they were lacking of front-end developers for a small project they had. This was the first serious job, I learnt about the cool stuff front-end developers do and got exposed to a bunch of tools and frameworks (huge learning curve by the way). They paid me nicely, $30 / hour for 10 hours a week. Sometimes I worked way more than that to compensate my lack of background. The money came nice, it helped me to pay-off all my debts at the university. This lasted 8-months, the project ended and the company didn't need an extra developer anymore.

Everything came together, my graduation date was coming, so I started to apply more seriously and at the same time tried to Ace all my final exams and projects. No offer came. 

--- After Graduation ---

A couple of weeks after my graduation date, I received my EAD card to do OPT (Optional Practical Training). This gave me the chance to work for any employer in the US if I was able to land a job before the 90 days of unemployment. At the beginning, I thought 90 days were more than enough, but to my surprises the hiring process is long and tedious in many companies. There are lots of interviews rounds, and waiting time between them.

Shortly after receiving the OPT, I started to receive emails again. The screening calls were easy, I made sure to apply for jobs which I thought I would be a got fit. Reading interviews questions online helps a lot, as well as doing challenges on Leetcode and HackerRank. Not sure how it goes, but perhaps many recruiters just simply 'Googled' their questions. I found that many employers had their own code challenges and deadlines (there are exceptions, and at the end every company has their way of doing things). These challenges can take pretty much of your time, I made sure to spend a good time on each challenge to shine over other job seekers. 

My tactics seemed to work, I felt at the top of the world, my preparation was paying back. Yes, I got many emails to tell me that unfortunately I wasn't a good fit, but at the same time I was getting a good number of interviews, video conferences, calls. 

The time came and I was invited to my first on-site interview. It was tiring, I had to speak with six people, one after another. It was the engineering team at that company. It was frightening, but I had the chance to see how they work and how this big companies in San Francisco work. Everything went just fine, I got asked about literally everything. The last round was here, the team lead wanted to speak with me and give a last challenge. He asked me to implement my own ""[pub/sub](https://davidwalsh.name/pubsub-javascript)"", but I truly didn't know how to answer it at that time. There was a silence in the room we were, and he was there taking notes on a printed copy of my resume, as I tried my best to answer his question. The interview ended, we shook hands and I was sent home to wait for their final decision.

Days passed and the email that I feared the most came on my email inbox, they decided to pursue other candidates. I won't lie, I felt terrible. They told me, that they were really impressed with my answer for their challenge, and stuff. My mood was down, for a couple of days until I decided to learn from this experience, and get ready for other upcoming interviews.

The process was tedious. However, I was getting better and better at interviews, my coding skills skyrocketed. The more challenges, the more books I read, and everything snowballed. After several weeks, I finally found a job in a small company as a part-time employee. 

I still keep applying, I am still aiming for a full-time position. I am guy with principles, I was totally clear with these guys on the part-time job that if a full-time job was offered to me in another company, I wouldn't be able to work during week-days and offered them the possibility of remote-work. They were happy to hear my honesty, and told me that it was fine for me to work remotely and weekends. 

Next week, I was invited on-site to a non-technical interview (this is the first time I have one of those). The truth is that I don't know what to expect, but these guys seemed really impressed with my answers for their coding challenge.

Appreciate the time you guys took to read my story. I will be updating it with more details, if I find people is interested of hearing how it goes for international students here in the Bay Area. I will also try to post my edited resume here for more details.

Note: Since this is subreddit deals with CS Career Questions, I would love to hear any advice/feedback that you may have for me!

This was my decision, and its the second time we have been no contact. The first time was also my decision but it only lasted 5 weeks. He started seeing someone 3 weeks after the break up. We were together for 2.5 years (2 month long distance at the end. He still felt I was the one, so he broke up with her, but regretted it the next day. She eventually took him back. It's been 7 1/2 months since break up, so roughly 7ish months that they've been together. I miss him still, but it seems like no contact isn't helping. Im also taking a summer internship in his city, which i told him and i told him i dont expect him to end things with her, because i dont want to ruin what he has going for him in this new city, especially since i will only be there for 3 months. I will go back to school for another three months until I graduate in december, then Idk what or where I will take my next adventure. I have never been to this city, and part of me hopes to hate it. He tells me that he thinks ill like it a lot. The reason he ended things was because he thought i wouldn't take his new city seriously and would just live and work abroad, but I realized that wasnt what I wanted to do. Unfortunately he already started dating her too quickly. "
492hky,7,2016-03-05,Dont know what to do..,[deleted],socialskills,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/492hky/dont_know_what_to_do/,"When i was doing my internship (18 y.o.), I worked with a group  of guys who were very different from me. There were 5 guys and me alone girl. Back then I was quite naive, very shy. As we were going to work together for 3 years I thought why not be friends with these people. So I started talking to them outside work. Everytime, everytime I said something to them or did something, they either mocked me or made some insulting comments. I thought may be I am so naive they make fun of me, so I started changing myself. I started dressing up which made me uncomfortable, changed my habits. But still their attitude dint change. And I didnt realise this has started affecting me. On top of it I fell for one of the guys which gave them more fodder to make fun of me. This affected me so much that I started failing my exams. That guy I fell for treated me like shit after he heard about my feelings for him and this hurt me. He left the office and I went into depression which continued till 6 months and affected my studies. A few months passed by the time 3 girls joined us for internship. These girls were out going, so guys became quite friendly with them and all of them started meeting outside office as well. They never asked me to join them.

But the girls used to bitch a lot about the guys. Said mean things about them. I made a mistake of telling one of the guys about all the mean things that were being said behind their back. When confronted, I dont know how but girls convinced them that I was a liar, jealous that guys are not giving me attention anymore and want to play office politics. All the guys believed them and for almost year treated me like shit. My boss sensed that there is something going on because work environment had affected. He paired me with one of the guys and gave us assignments which required us to work together. Initially due to work issues that guy started talking to me. I dont know what made him realise that I was telling him truth about the girls bitching but not only he started talking like a friend but also started believed i was telling truth back then. Last 3-4 months of my internship, other guys too started talking to me and treated me well.

But all these situations affected me so much that I was almost damaged. Even though they were friendly later I couldn't trust them again. I never believed a word they said even if meant well. Those 3-4 years changed me alot. Even now at 27 I am so scared  to talk to strangers that they will laugh at me. I have lost confidence in me. I dont speak my mind. I dont socialize and havent made good friends since then. I keep people at a distance.

I dont know how to deal with this social awkwardness."

If you think this post is inappropriate, I'll remove it and wait for Tuesday's internship discussion.

Hey guys! I was fortunate enough to secure an internship this summer. However, it is at small unknown startup and the pay is minimal, so I am there pretty much exclusively for the job experience (I have none currently).

Next year I will be in my penultimate year (a junior in american college terminology) and that will be my last chance at getting a prestigious internship before I graduate. I want to do all I can to increase my chances at getting one of these sought after internship positions. I know what to do for interview preparation, but making an impressive CV is that will get me an interview is what I'm struggling with.

Basically, what can I do during my internship to make that section of my experience stand out? I don't want to just write ""Worked at company X, was intern, wrote some Scala"". I can only think of doing my best to impress my boss and get him to give me more demanding projects, but maybe there is something else I can do?"

I'm currently an intern working for ~$6/hour in Western Europe. Besides that I'm attending university for a CS degree. I know that I'm heavily underpayed, but I do this for the job experience.

I have no problems at all with deep CS understanding and applying the stuff in the real world. Hell even calculus and statistics are not impossible to apply in the real world. It takes some time, but after a while you look at the needed formulas/papers like you would google for Stackoverflow solutions.

However currently I'm struggling with something different. I'm expected to know (in my opinion) too much about other fields such as chemistry, accounting, mechanical engineering. I mean really specific procedures, (patented) components, etc.. It was already hard enough to be competent on all major platforms (Web, Desktop, Mobile), how I'm supposed to know those unique platforms?

I know that I have no time at all to learn more about those things since I already use my weekends for university.

I approached my manager and he seems to not care at all. He just points at the deadline and yells at me that I should have this done by then.

If I follow the advices on this sub, I simply should find another job. However I'm stuck with this university for the next years and there is no other job except for remote work.

Have you ever been in such a situation?"

I feel like she (let's call her Katie) and I have helped each other grow as people, and I really care about her happiness.

However, the past 1.5 years have been long distance. I'm going to university and can only see her a few times a year. With internships starting this summer, I'll see Katie even less than before. She'll be starting university elsewhere next year, and that means a minimum of 4 more years separated (not counting grad school or future jobs). I'm happy when I'm home, and so far we've made it work, but it's taxing.

I'm also thinking about what the long-term future might be with her. Katie takes her work very seriously and let's bad scores get to her. She's had issues with anxiety and I don't think she likes herself as a person. I feel like she's a little dependent on me as a source of happiness, and I don't know if that's healthy. But so far, these characteristics have been consistent, and I don't know if they'll continue or go away. Could this be a warning sign that our relationship will become unhealthy?

She's been my only serious relationship, so I can't help but wonder what a relationship would be like with a specific girl from my school. I think that crushes naturally happen, and I know I should ignore it, but a part of me wants to at least explore other relationships. I love Katie, but my feelings are torn.

So it's a good time to evaluate the relationship. I feel selfish qualifying Katie's flaws, and I know I have my own, but it's best to be objective before committing. Katie and I have had so many great memories, and I want whats best for me and for her. I think she's fantastic, but is she the one? I've been thinking about our relationship for a few days, and I'll take another week or two before doing anything. I appreciate any perspectives or insights, since I have no idea what to do.

tl;dr: I'm with a great girl, but I don't know if she's the one."

So I'm transitioning into software engineering from a non technical background (I've worked in communications and operations previously). I'm in the last year of my second bachelor's in Computer Science program from Oregon State. My end goal is to work in tech in New York either for one of the big guys like Facebook (wishful thinking) or one of the high growth startups like Birchbox or Etsy. I'm quitting my current job (scary) in order to do one of these internships as I believe I really need to get professional engineering experience in order to be a better candidate for full time. I have one with IBM in Texas on the OpenStack cloud software engineering team and one with Priceline in NYC Metro Area (Connecticut) doing software engineering for the marketing team. At IBM you work with a group of interns to complete a large summer project and in the other I'm going to be the only intern on the engineering team (but working with 10 other engineers) so I will be able to own projects all on my own. Thoughts on which ones you think will help me achieve my goal in the long run? 
4930h3,36,2016-03-05,Don't discount a good part-time MBA - it entirely transformed my career!,WeekendAtSternies,MBA,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/4930h3/dont_discount_a_good_parttime_mba_it_entirely/,"Let me start by saying I'm not just trying to boast (okay, maybe a little), but want to impart some insights to a unique way of taking full advantage of a top MBA program and pivot your career. I'll lead with TL;DR and you can decide if you want to learn more: 

I took the GRE, commuted almost 400 miles round trip for part-time weekend classes, pivoted my career entirely from a non-quantitive role into a data analytics position after a year and a half, then accepted a dream job in management consulting just before graduation. And despite my distance from campus, I was able to hold several leadership positions with student government and clubs. Oh yeah, I also managed to get engaged to an amazing woman in the process (so fortunate she has put up with this and with me in this process).

Here's the story:
A few years ago I felt entirely trapped in a dead end career with no hard skills and no light at the end of the tunnel. While I had a BS from a top-15 ranked University, it was in a majorly qualitative field, and I knew I needed to go back to school to develop some hard skills if I wanted to pivot my career. I decided to prep for and take the GRE. I ended up deciding to apply to MBA programs.  

I was particularly intrigued by part-time programs - what intelligent business person wouldn't recognize the massive cost benefits to earning income while in school? Also, the benefits of applying classroom learning to the work place in real time seemed pretty cool. 

So many people and resources gave me so many reasons to discount the part-time experience. I heard things like: 

“It’s not as immersive.”
“Companies prefer full-time MBA students.”
“The professors aren’t as good.”
“There’s no opportunity to get involved outside the classroom.”

I call bullshit. A good part-time program is what you make of it. To me, a full-time MBA is like paying for surgery to fix the pains in your career (nothing wrong with that). However, a part-time MBA is more like physical therapy – it’s a lot of work and a major commitment, but if you give it all you’ve got, you’ll come out with not only the same education and great experience, but a stronger network of peers already working for organizations in which you may be interested, and a greater appreciation for what you’ve accomplished at the end. I’m not trying to say that a full-time program isn’t a lot of work and may not be better for a lot of people. But, you can’t convince me that a full-time student works harder and more than a fully-committed part-time student also working a full-time job. 

Anyway, I live in Baltimore, where the University of Maryland’s Smith School has a satellite campus. I gave it so many chances. I wanted to love it, but it wasn’t for me. There were some other locally highly regarded schools, but I wanted a degree with a strong reputation that I could take elsewhere if need be. I visited Georgetown. I liked it a lot, but they didn’t offer weekend classes at the time, and there’s no way I was sitting in rush hour traffic twice a week between Baltimore and DC – that’s at least 6 hours of lost time a week. It was out. My brother in NYC convinced me to take a look at NYU Stern. I visited and fell in love with the school. I also knew that a degree from NYU would carry weight wherever I went, and would help differentiate me if I were to stay in Baltimore. Sure, the commute would be tough, but on the train rides to and from I would be able to get things done. When I was accepted I knew what I had to do. 

30 months and 200+ Amtrak train rides later (I’m actually writing this on the train), I can unequivocally say that going to Stern for a part-time MBA was the single greatest decision I’ve made in my life (aside from proposing to my fiancée, of course). 

Despite my distance from campus during the week, I was able to take on leadership positions with student government and the one club that interested me most. I met some amazing people and made good friends for life. The curriculum and professors are all the same as the full-time program – some are better than others, but the good ones are PHENOMENAL. Also, despite what Stern tells you when applying, I was able to pick up a specialization in Business Analytics by taking exclusively weekend classes. 13 months into the program I landed a sweet remote part-time internship to help me gain some experience, and 20 months into the program I pivoted my career away from an entirely qualitative role in recruiting to a high visibility data analytics position with a world-renowned hospital. Now, with 2 months before graduation, I have accepted a dream job in Management Consulting with a firm I know you’ve all heard of – and I’ll be based in Baltimore, after all. 

Sure, I’ve sacrificed a lot of weekends, but the personal and professional gains have far outweighed that, and the social outlet with classmates has been great at alleviating stress. It helped to have a girlfriend and now fiancée who was nothing but incredibly supportive in the process, that’s for sure. It also wouldn’t have been so easy to do without my amazing brother and his wife welcoming me into their NYC home for at least one night almost every weekend I had class. But I have classmates who’ve actually commuted longer distances than me and with less of a support network, and they all seem to feel the same way as me about the experience. 

This is not intended as an advertisement for Stern, or to say “LOOK AT ME AND WHAT I DID!” I’m just trying to spread the word that there is absolutely no reason to think less of a part-time MBA program. I’ve spoken with many a hiring manager who agree. There are many great part-time options out there and everyone’s needs are different. I encourage everyone to consider this path. It’s been quite a ride.

4931a1,3,2016-03-05,Having some second thoughts about chemical engineering. Need some advice.,c0ded_truth,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/4931a1/having_some_second_thoughts_about_chemical/,"I'm in my 3rd year of chemical engineering, and i've just been having some thoughts lately that I don't know where else to share. I should mention that because I didn't take a class that's only offered in the fall (I didn't know this until it was too late), it pushed me back a year and I can't finish in less than 5 years, so after this semester I have two years left.  I feel like I'm not as passionate about the profession as I once thought. I wanted to go into engineering because I've always wanted to know how things work, and I'm not finding any of that in chemical engineering. It seems to be mostly processes rather than making things or learning how they work. After doing some research, I was thinking about electrical engineering, because I've always been into technology. 

Another thing discouraging me from chemical engineering is the lack of opportunities around my area (I'm from Chicago) while I'm looking for internships. I often hear that chemical engineers don't have a lot of flexibility in terms of location, and I love my city too much to leave it. 

All this being said, I wanted to get some second opinions from here. Should I switch? What's holding me back is the fact that I will probably end up staying in school longer than necessary if I do. Can any EEs tell me what the coursework is like (besides that its a lot of math)? I really liked physics 2 and programming too (had to take a c++/matlab class), which I hear is done a lot in EE. Sorry for the long post, but I appreciate any and every bit of feedback!!"
4936fp,4,2016-03-05,"How much do I owe my (modest) success to ""white male privilege""?",a_privileged_male,AskFeminists,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskFeminists/comments/4936fp/how_much_do_i_owe_my_modest_success_to_white_male/,"I often hear about ""white male privilege"" i.e. the concept that for straight white males, success is achieved more easily or life is generally easier due to the fact that white men are dominant in society.

I'm myself a 32 y.o. straight, white male from Canada who is leading a successful life. Here I'll provide the most honest and detailed description of how I got where I am so we can use my story as a practical view point to discuss the notion of ""white male privilege"".

Firstly, my idea of success has always been to be my own boss and never feel stuck working jobs I disliked. For years now I've been running my own businesses. I make a comfortable living only doing what I'm passionate about, every day.

MY BACKGROUND:

I come from a middle-class family. I am a business school graduate and a lawyer as well. My parents were both school teachers earning in the range of $65k / year.

There are no lawyers (except me), physicians, politicians, business owners / executives or otherwise powerful / rich / famous / well-connected people in my whole family.

THE ROAD TO WHERE I AM NOW:

* Where I live in Canada, university is cheap ($5k a year more or less). My parents paid for my business degree but I took care of my law degree and bar school.

* I started working at 17 and never worked less than 25 hours per week through my studies (full time in the summers). Due to that I never took a student loan and self-financed my living expenses.

* I left home at 22 and always paid my rent with my own money.

* Between 2002 and 2011, I have held 13 officer positions on the boards of directors of various non-profits. I had no connections in any of these organizations; I simply walked in and said I wanted to volunteer. Many of my fellow board officers were women (consistently in the range of 30-40%).

* I started my first business at age 20. I set it up alone, between university classes, skipping nights and working through the week-ends. Once a week I ran email chains asking friends and classmates to help me find clients. 3 times a week I'd pack my car + my father's car with classmates who would walk from door to door with me in the cold until 9:30 PM, then I would offer them late-night meals or drinks and bonuses for every client they recruited.

* I generated great gross revenues with that business but due to accumulated deficits on some contracts, I ended up losing money and topping up a $10,000 credit line, which I later repaid working various low-paying student jobs.

* Back then I was driving a garbage car that always broke and money was so tight I occasionally experienced the joy of having my ATM card declined for transactions under $10.

* In 2007 for the first time, I landed a job that paid a lofty salary. I was in charge of managing large projects and was often sent on business trips. I got the job after browsing ads every day for 2 months and applying through the normal process. I had 0 inside connections, it was my CV that caught their attention. As an employee of this company I typically worked over 30+ hours a week while being a full-time student, which meant rare sleep, almost no free week-ends, skipping classes and sometimes lower grades.

* After passing the bar exam I had to go through a mandatory 6-month internship in a law firm. I interviewed 30 times and was not selected by any firm. Against all odds, I found a better internship than any of what those law offices had to offer by simply cold-calling a firm that had not invited me for an interview. I got hired on the spot and had an amazing time with that job, which was both financially and intellectually rewarding.

* During my law internship I co-founded another business with a friend. We spent 4 months setting it up with whatever free time we could scrape together.

* I operated the business with my friend while starting to practice litigation law as a licensed attorney. I rarely worked less than 7 days a week, everything combined. A 6-hour night was luxury. It took 2 years before we had our first breakthrough.

* I realized it was difficult if not impossible to grow my business while working as a lawyer, but before quitting my day job I needed some financial cushion. I got by doing freelance jobs after work and compressing my budget to an insane level. After a few months I had managed to gather $12,000 so I quit my job and went 100% self-employed. I've never held another payroll job since then.

* After leaving my job I started working on my business exclusively. For one year I woke up at 5:30 AM every day of the week and typically worked until 7-8:00 PM. I had to take care of business development, financials, tax returns, client requests, legal matters and so on.

* Working for my own business was a lot of fun but tremendously stressful as well. Many sleepless nights were had, worrying about money, contract deadlines, legal threats and all sorts of crazy things. I slept on the floor of my office more often than I care to count.

* Last year, a conflict erupted between 2 of our shareholders and the business did not survive.

* As this was happening, I started setting up a new business, this time alone and in a completely different field.

* I've not studied in the field I'm now working in. I've self-taught all the skills I am currently using through free resources available on the internet. I started self-teaching these skills at age 16 when internet was just starting. None of my friends or family members had / has any knowledge or skills related to what I'm doing.

* I started my current business with 0 contacts or allies in the field. I gained my first contacts by emailing / calling people I had located using Linkedin or simply Google. To gain confidence and recognition, and demonstrate my value, I needed to give away a lot of my time (= work for free).

RESULTS:

I'm a highly happy man and I cherish every day of my life doing what I do. I'm my own boss and my finances are in great shape. But to get where I am I had to pay a steep price:

* Minimal free time for 10+ years
* Often skipping parties, nights out, holidays
* No more than 3 days in a row off work for 5 years
* No traveling for 6 years
* Heavy drag from family members and acquaintances who kept saying I was crazy, I'd never make it, I'd run out of money, etc.
* Scarce relationships with women for long stretches of time
* No children so far
* Going through countless periods of high stress, discouragement, fatigue, fear of rejection, fear of losing everything
* Having to keep composure when everything came crashing down
* Driving shit cars or no car for years
* Strict money management; saving on everything in anticipation of rainy days (I still drive a 10-year-old car)
* Not being able to see my father nearly as much as I wished while he was dying

This is my experience as straight middle-class white male in Canada. As you have probably guessed by now, I'm skeptical of the whole idea that any of what I have was obtained through the graces of my whiteness and male gender.

I have no reason to believe that in Canada (limiting myself to speaking of what I know), any woman or person of any ethnicity or sexual orientation would not achieve his/her dreams after paying the kind of price I paid in terms of discipline, sacrifice and perseverance.

As a matter of fact, among my friends I can easily think of two successful ""non white males"": a black man and a Mexican woman (recent immigrant born in Mexico). None had rich parents but their parents taught them the value of discipline, strong work ethics and deferred gratification.

That was my contribution to this topic, thanks for making it to this end of this lengthy text! Questions or comments?"

So basically I am graduating from university in the next few months and was hoping to travel at least a little bit before I start working fulltime in October. I am a 22 year old male from Vancouver, Canada.

Initially I was planning on traveling Europe and going to the Euro in France with some  buddies but with some graduating early and others not getting into med school things have kind of fallen through. My girlfriend is also not free at all due to having a summer internship... So basically it looks like I will be travelling alone.

Having never traveled alone I was hoping to get some input/advice on whether it will be a better experience vacationing/backpacking alone (probably to Western Europe) or if I should take a volunteering trip to Central America or Africa. For Europe I was wondering if anyone is willing to share experiences they had travelling alone (ie. worth it, did you meet people along the way? did you stay in hostels? tour group or backpacker?). And for volunteering I was wondering if anyone had experience with any good organizations where you were able to actually do some good AND had a good time and got to see the area.

Sorry if the post isn't great as I have usually confined myself to being a lurker on reddit and don't usually make any posts. Thanks in advance!"

And at Hudson there is one frat that reins supreme, where the brothers are smarter, stronger and more privileged then any of their rivals. And boy do they know it.

The line stretches down the block as students wait to enter Alpha Sigma's first party of the semester. I stand on the doorstep of the opulent fraternity mansion, arms folded in a way that shows off my bulging biceps and rippled chest. The collar on my Abercrombie polo is up, obviously, and I scan the line for any lithe young pickings that I could have fun with. I dumped my Theta slampiece over the summer - I said I had to focus more on my Goldman Sachs internship, but the real reason was I was just... *bored* of her. Who knows what I'll find tonight? Maybe a girl truly worth showing off to the high society I had been born into...
____________________________________________________

Hey, thanks for reading! So the premise of this roleplay is pretty simple. I want to play a douchey, All-American frat bro who gets to corrupt and use a naive young first year. You could be a spoiled, stuck-up legacy blonde, a small-town busty brunette or even an ebony/latina girl who'd never *dream* she'd abandon her people to suck on the cock of a rich white guy. So long as you're creative and imaginative, I'm game!

This can be played short-term, but what I'd *really* like to do is create a little world of opulence and privilege. I want to seduce your character with promises of the high-life, taking you to all sorts of exclusive events and country clubs, all the while making you into a more and more depraved slut. By the end of it I want you to be my bimbo, a good, obedient little girl who smiles and sticks her chest out while the men discuss business.

Detail, creativity and good grammar are key. I'm pretty open to most kinks and this scene can go from plain vanilla to extremely dark.

Hope to hear from you!"

Here is my resume. Apart from this, I am reading classic UX books such as Don't Make me think and books by Nielson to understand UX. I am also learning code. What else can I do to get a job if even the intern qualifications are this high?

I'm a first-year who took CSE 11 last quarter, and finished strong with a 98%. However, this quarter, I'm taking 12, 15L, and 20. 12 with Gary is fine, but 15L and 20 in particular I'm struggling with - the lab quizzes and exams feel like memorization of commands we've used maybe once, and I can never figure out what the graders want for the 20 homework. The first midterm was fine, but the last one I didn't do so well because of the proofs. It's also partially my fault for overloading myself with 5 classes this quarter, which I only figured out after dropping the 5th last week.

At this rate, my CS GPA will end up as a 3.25-3.5, which seems way below the cutoff for an impacted major. 

I know I really want to go into CS, though - I've already completed a few sizeable projects in high school, learned a lot of languages, and got a CS internship at a small company last summer. This will all be for nothing if I can't get the degree I want, though. What options do I have? Transfer?"

Honestly though, I don't know which one to pick from. Xavier is known for its medical school, but I haven't seen a lot of info regarding its computer science program. its like people know its there, but that's about it. Of course that doesn't necessarily mean its bad, but it also means its not one of the top programs Xavier can be known for as well (at least that's how I see it)

On the other hand I've heard uno is focusing a lot more on stem programs in general, but the school as a whole is shaky. It's currently looking for a president ( dunno how that affects the school tbh) and I've heard recently the school started cutting out programs to save money, as well as the possibility of it getting merged with suno to save money. I've managed to find a little info online and generally it's well thought of. Even offers internships and what not. But I don't want to go to a school and enjoy my time there only to have budget cuts and other stuff ruin it for me.

Tuition and costs aren't a big concern. Xavier offered me full tuition and uno is much cheaper. I plan to live with my parents as well. Hopefully things get settled out so i get get a stipend from tops (got a 27 on the act, so I think it'll be $800).

Thoughts?"

My BIL moved away because he enrolled in the Coast Guard, and for God knows what reason (oh yeah, hero complex!) my NMiL decided to take in his wife and have her live in the same house that her, EFIL, and youngest BIL live. 

NMiL did this knowing well that my husband refuses to interact with this girl due to her sexually harassing him. Of course she brushed it off saying that BIL's wife is ""just silly"" and that she didn't sexually harass my husband. She chose straining her relationship with her son further and she chose someone who isn't her kid over him.

To add onto everything, NMiL claimed to have cancer since she has a growth in her shoulder (that she has had for 9+ years and hasn't changed) and when she went to the oncologist, got tested and it wasn't cancer, she suddenly had another ailment. She ""tore"" her meniscus (I don't know if it's true or not.) 

She is desperate to spend time with my husband because he's temporarily moving to another state to work on an internship and she's starting to realize that she will end up alone. She doesn't know for how long he's leaving, so as a good NMiL, she just makes stories up in her mind and assumes they're true.


[Here are the texts that ensued](http://imgur.com/a/u5jpL)

Why my husband hasn't gone NC with her is beyond me; but he has made incredible progress by not giving in to her manipulations and overall bullshit. He's been grey rocking lately and he's done well, but he still feels bad about the whole situation from time to time.

I kinda posted this on /r/raisedbynarcissists but I wanted to post here too because y'all are my bunch and this is the place where I've found solace. 

So... Here's the story:

Kooky Kim nows she's going to be alone soon as fuck. She knows that her kids are leaving ""for realzies"" now and she's scared to death because if she doesn't have her children to abuse, what is she going to do?

My stupid middle BIL enrolled in the coast guard and left, my husband will be working on an internship a few states away for a few months, so youngest BIL is the only one left and he's kinda in his own world. So... for this, Kooky Kim decides to bring middle BIL's wife to live with her. They're both crazy, abusive, manipulative and just as stupid, by the way. 

My husband dislikes middle BIL's wife because she sexually harassed him. [Here's context for that](https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/3yb1qm/kooky_kim_shoot_herself_in_the_foot_this_xmas/cybyiow?context=3) Fucking Kooky Kim knows damn well that my husband won't be anywhere close to her and doesn't even want to see her, even if she's not interacting with him... And she didn't give a fuck. She decided to strain her relationship with her son further and chose that crazy twat over him, obviously.

She realized she fucked up because my husband doesn't go over to her house and hasn't been there in months, so what does she do? She fakes cancer, goes to the oncologist, gets a negative result for cancer so she creates another ailment in order to manipulate him because woe is her and she needs her son by her side.

Thankfully my husband has grown strong and I've made him realize that since he's both graduating this semester and also leaving for his internship, he has the upper hand and now is the time to establish limits, boundaries and rules even further, because she will try her best to not rock the boat with him so she can be at his graduation and whatnot. 

And now, for your pleasure, [the text messages!](http://imgur.com/a/u5jpL)

He didn't give in, he didn't play her game and she's begging please to come over to our house. She's getting jack shit, though, she's banned from this house and she's not going to invite herself over.

I recognize that I need to make a decision about graduate school and I am having a hard time deciding what path to take.

I am debating between a Ph.D. degree or a 1 year masters that my school offers. With my resume I was told I could get into a mid-teir Ph.D. program (~15-35th ranked) or I could get my masters degree in another year. I have to apply to the masters program, but I am not worried about being denied.

I feel like the Ph.D. would push me further as an engineer and is more prestigous. However, I am not convinced it makes financial sense. The starting salary for Ph.D. students is very high, but of course you lose 4-5 years salary and 4-5 years that you could be working on promotions.

I am worried I will look back and think I didn't go ""all the way"" or I took the easy way out. Do experienced professionals ever feel this way? Can other grad students chime in?"

I met a girl online in mid-2012. We went on a date and I felt that we had connected very well. I was attracted to her physically and emotionally, had a lot in common and a lot to talk about. I saw her a couple more times before I moved about 3 hours away. I had an internship that was ending so I took the first job that was available so I wasn't jobless. I did not want to move away from my home town and especially after having met this amazing girl.

Over the next year and a half we kept in touch texting just about every day. I would drive and visit my home town because that is where all of my friends were, but I also saw her on occasion during these trips and she drove out once to see me too. From earlier talk I kind of knew that she didn't want a relationship and that she liked older men (Sort of reminiscing from a prior relationship I got the feeling), but I wanted to do as much as I could to change her mind because I did wanted one. 

After that year and a half I was able to get a job to relocate back in my home town. I then start seeing her once a week and things were getting more intimate and this went on for a while.

One night when we were in bed she said that she wasn't in the mood to fool around tonight. The texting we did for the next few days involved her mentioning a lot that she felt like she was using me and asking if I felt the same way. I told her a few times that I didn't feel she was using me. She had mentioned one night that she went on a date with someone and mentioned a couple details. I immediately became overcome with jealousy and told her that and she said she regretted telling me because she didn't want to hurt me.

After talking with a coworker for some advice I sent her a long text saying that I loved her, blah blah blah and that I wanted to be in a relationship with her (bf/gf) or we can't see each other. We already had plans for that night to see each other, but she texted me that she was drunk so we didn't meet that night. This was on a weeknight so it was odd since she had to work the next day. She came over the following night and we talked for a little bit making small talk and then the talking got serious.

She told me that she can't be in a relationship with me (Something like that) and told me about her marriage. (She was married at the time, but in the process of getting divorced and had been separated for numerous years.) She told me about events that happened in the marriage that she hadn't shared before. Based on these events it sounded like her husband wasn't the best person. Then she briefly mentioned another relationship with someone after her husband and before me that I knew about, but hadn't heard the name before. She said that she loved me too and said something like she can't be in a relationship with me. (Don't remember exactly her words on the last part.) She said that she never wanted to hurt me and that I can hate her as much as I want. We hugged for a minute or two and said our goodbyes. 

This event happened about 9 months ago and I have not made contact with her since. I have been doing a good job about moving on since, but recently I have been thinking about her. I recently looked her up on the state website and I see that she is now divorced.

I guess I'd like some advice on what was going through her head at that time. Was she not over someone? Is there any possibility that she might change her mind and want a relationship? Is it best to move on? What gets me is that she said that she loved me too. That's the image that has been popping in my head recently. Thank you very much for reading this and let me know if any other details are needed.
   
tl;dr: Long friends with benefits relationship ends because she doesn't want a relationship, but I do. Will she change her mind?"

After looking this thing over for a while, I'm ready to be out.  It's to the point where I feel uncomfortable talking about church stuff and I feel sick reading D&amp;C.  I'm nearly 100% positive that this whole church is all just a sham.  Buuuut, there's a problem (or three), so I thought I might ask the wonderful and learned people of this subreddit for some advice.

The big one is that I'm also fairly positive that I have depression.  (No official diagnosis, but I've talked to a few psychiatrists/counselors about it, and they've all weighed in as it being depression, and I've attempted suicide before.)  I want to tell my (all TBM) family members about it soon, because I honestly love them all to death and feel like they deserve to know, and I could honestly use the support because it's been getting pretty bad lately.  On the other hand, I can almost guarantee that they're going to target that as the cause of my disaffection from the church when I eventually do leave - not to mention however they're going to view it now.  I already know my dad (an actual doctor, for goodness' sake) thinks of depression as ""Satan working harder on valiant people"", so I know I'm already looking at an uphill battle.  Any tips on how to approach them about it would be most welcome.

The other issue is school(BYUI, last semester before Bachelor's degree), mainly that I'll have to keep up this charade for another 6 months or so(rest of the semester + internship) and for the love of all that is unholy I cannot stand it.  I can't stand being reminded all the time, I can't stand going to church and classes and being forced to say how awesome the prophets and Joseph Smith are, I can't stand not having anyone to talk to.  Any ""survival tips"" would  be utterly amazing.

Last but least, I'm trying to date more but don't really want to date a TBM.  Looking for something long-lasting, and something tells me that ""your religion is a lie"" isn't exactly the best relationship foundation.  Anyone know if there's a good way to find some closet exmos in the area?

I've rambled on a bit, but I really, really appreciate any advice you can give.  Sorry if I went a bit off the end there.  Thanks!

496v0k,7,2016-03-06,Battling For A Better Future; Ex-Felon Fights Through the Provisions of Second Chance to Work,sapphyira,ExCons,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExCons/comments/496v0k/battling_for_a_better_future_exfelon_fights/,"After receiving his Master’s of Social Work, former felon Oceo Harris looked forward to obtaining meaningful work and applied and was successfully granted three state agency exemptions from disqualification from work. Now, Harris is preparing for his second appeal – this time to a higher judicial court in lieu of a recent Department of Children and Families (DCF) denial decision from his fourth state agency application for exemption from disqualification from work.

It was nearly 16 years ago that Oceo Harris was arrested and incarcerated because of a felony drug conviction. He spent a decade behind bars for his crime and was sentenced to a 10-year period of probation with periodic drug screening. In 2010, Harris received early release from probation by the federal court through his remarkable demonstration of rehabilitation by passing all drug screenings, graduating from college with a nearly perfect grade point average, holding two jobs, and maintaining a stable residence.

Harris states, “After serving my time, I believed it was important to make a change in the right direction. I felt social work would be the best way to help others and give back to society – sort of like how it is demonstrated through the Delancey Street process of mutual restitution.”

A Master’s degree now in hand, Oceo Harris began pursuing his goals of becoming a licensed social work counselor, as well as obtaining his doctorate in social work. While going through the process of registering as a clinical social work intern, Harris found out that he would have to apply for an exemption from disqualification of work through the Department of Health (DOH) and go before a review Board in determination of his past criminal history. 

Known as the “Jim King Keep Florida Working Act (2011), each state agency must list all agency rules that disqualify people with convictions from employment or licensing and must identify and evaluate alternatives to disqualification that would maintain public safety without impeding employment. Moreover, for an individual to even be considered for an exemption, Florida Statutes under section 435.07 states that for felonies, 3 years have elapsed since he or she has completed or been lawfully released from confinement, supervision or sanction for [each] disqualifying offenses AND the disqualified applicant must also provide clear and convincing evidence of his or her “rehabilitation”.

Meeting all prerequisites, Harris’ background screening process for volunteer employment further deemed it would be necessary in lieu of his line of profession to apply for three additional state agency exemptions – in the event his work environment, clinical exposure or job position involved interaction with the elderly, vulnerable populations and/or children.

With faith and an earnest resolve to improve his livelihood in a legal and transformative manner, Harris then applied for exemptions from disqualification of work to all four applicable state agencies: the Agency for Health Care Administration (ACHA), Department of Children and Families (DCF), Department of Health (DOH) and Department of Juvenile Justice (DJJ). In a timeframe of around six months, investigations that were conducted by ACHA, DOH, and DJJ led to Oceo Harris being granted three exemptions based on clear and convincing evidence of his rehabilitation – including the approval to register as a clinical social work intern.

Shortly afterward, Harris received a denial decision from DCF. “I was kind of taken aback when I read the notification of DCF’s decision since none of my prior criminal activities involved children, and there was no evidence that I was or would be a danger to children”, states Harris, “but I took it as, well, all entities are not the same and if it was my own family member, wouldn’t I want an organization to make sure within the extent of the law that any person working for them has showed and proven exhaustibly that he or she would pose no concern or threat to the workplace environment or the populations that they serve?”

And that is exactly what Oceo Harris sought out to do. He immediately filed an appeal of the denial decision from DCF and started to compile substantial evidence regarding the past three years of his involvement in the social work field – which included working with juveniles, adults and the homeless (vulnerable populations) and being an appointed member of a governing Board helping to guide the council in delivering care to those in need. In addition, he submitted exhibits of his capacity as a re-entry counselor and youth mentor without incident. Furthermore, he provided documented proof of success in his academic, public service and personal development (with a recent highlighted community award in recognition of his rehabilitation and impactful service in the community).

When the time came for his appeal hearing in front of an administrative law judge last September, his personal and professional level was highly attested to by 10 stellar character witnesses within the community. Says Harris, “I still remember that day like it was yesterday…being in front of a judge, but this time, on the right side of things”. Then came the verdict on December 3, 2015 from the administrative law judge recommending that DCF enter a final order granting Oceo Harris an exemption from disqualification of work.

“So imagine my surprise when I received another notification from DCF that they denied me a second time and would not uphold the administrative law judge’s recommended order”, states Harris.

In the final order released on March 3, 2016 concerning Oceo Harris’ request for an exemption from disqualification from holding a position of special trust as provided in chapter 435, Florida Statutes, DCF states that Harris has passed the waiting period established for exemption eligibility under the statute AND more importantly, based on the totality of evidence, has shown clear and convincing evidence that he is sufficiently rehabilitated. However, due to DCF’s conclusion that reasonable persons could differ as to whether Harris is an appropriate candidate for an exemption that would permit him to work with children, vulnerable adults and the elderly, in light of his past criminal record and prior drug conviction in the Tallahassee area, is the basis of their denial.

“That’s when I realized something wasn’t morally or ethically right with how DCF was handling this. All of their denial decisions have been based on pure opinion and not facts, which is a direct abuse of discretion – which attempts to purport subjective definitions and construe such limitation that are broader than, and inconsistent with governing law. Especially when a person has paid their debt to society within an extensive length of time and demonstrated overwhelming success in getting their life back and being a productive, informed asset to society. I shudder now to even think how many other individuals with cases similar to mine in Tallahassee, yet alone the entire state of Florida, have been unfairly impacted by DCF’s unsubstantiated ruling. If no one speaks up about this, it will continue to happen.”

As Harris prepares to appeal DCF’s second denial of his request for exemption from disqualification of work, he hopes that this experience will create a platform for advocacy and learning for others who have been given a “Second Chance” with access to resources and opportunities to change their lives and rebuild their community."

Any job or life advice much appreciated",thru_a_weight,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4973e5/thinking_of_a_career_path_or_more_of_a_life/,"Hey guys I'm in the process of a huge change of heart these days and I've been speaking to a lot of people about it. 

Edit: This turned more into a life story than just career story. I decided to keep them in because it shows some of my personality. Please be gentle :)

----------

I've always done quite well in my teens, but wasn't sure what I should focus my energy on. I was lucky enough to go to an Ivy where I learned some potential paths for this world. I met a few people they were thinking of finance, so I tried to do that without much thinking. It just seemed safe and doable. I majored in math and econ, while doing a lot of literature which I enjoyed. 

Meanwhile the school's started to seem toxic to me by my third year. Nothing against the institution but perhaps I was going through a tough time and just needed to get away. I took a job at an investment fund for the summer, and when they offered me full time immediately I pieced together a major and then graduated. 

By this point I still wasn't sure about finance. It was a small shop so I got a taste of everything on the markets side. I wasn't particularly passionate about it, but I found it interesting and engaging on a daily basis. Meanwhile the location of the jog and growth prospect was probably on the bottom 20%-tile, so I decided I had enough experience to jump into something in a finance hub. 

After a while I got something in NY, not exactly an ideal position but at a great firm. I had folks pushing for me and I got some color that I could move to a position I like in some time. I was woefully unqualified for this job, so it was more of a lucked out 1/20 kind of outcome. I was very excited.

Unfortunately I'm still an immigrant in the US and just as I was about to join the position my green card application was denied. Without the proper work authorization I couldn't attend to the job, pissed off a lot of people. Then I had to go back to my old home and to wait for about 6 months while we appeal for the case, unable to do anything in terms of work with a contract. 

At the time I was really at a loss. I had to spend a few months piece myself together, no time to think about work stuff or it made me very anxious. It was the first time I had to deal with the dreaded ""resume gap."" On top there's the chance that I might have to be barred from the country in which I received 80% of my education. I thought myself as free-spirited and resilient or whatever, but when it happened I got torn to shreds. I spent days and weeks in my house not able to do anything. 

I have this finish-what-you-started mentality. So I started studying for the CFA (a 3 level test, each takes a year, equivalent to a masters for financial analysis and markets). Meanwhile I also started studying for the GMAT. I don't know why I was doing all of that but I'm used to keeping myself occupied and I just felt I needed to do something. Meanwhile I decided a master's program in finance would've been a good idea to round out the resume gap. I started looking at programs abroad and found some cheap ones in Europe, thinking that it would be a good place to be doing something while my case to process, for the unforeseeable next 3mo to 3 years. 

I spent 8-10 hours a day studying, for 2 months straight. Luckily I passed the tests and got a temporary respite, without any sense of relief. I felt myself cracking once the new year was turning. I had to get out so I left my home and started backpacking around the US. I wanted to trouble you with the proverbial ""yes I met a lot of people, it opened my eyes and showed me a new world"" associated with this vagabonding romanticism. I wanted to drink that cool-aid too but I just wasn't digesting it. I still felt the stress, even when my mind was off the job stuff. At this time I have this weird neck and back pain that started as a new form of anxiety that I have never experienced. This was about a year ago and I still experience it as I type. 

It was a good time and I can't deny that. Traveling was a luxury, no question. I felt some relief, and it was therapeutic to be just be on the move. My trip eventually took me across to Asia and then in Europe. I started to believe that perhaps my life was put on hold in a sense, so I could be doing this. I did meet a lot of people, with a lot of lifestyles. Some were interesting and wise, with colorful endeavors and passionate life dreams; while some were boorish and rude, and to this day I occupy some of my daily mind computing time with how they survive in this world. 

It was a good change, but in September I joined my Finance masters program in Europe. It was another 180 degree shift. All the free-spirit and unencumbered life and mindset was crushed by resume workshops and financial ratio Q+A sessions. I started applying for summer internships, while adjusting to classes, campus life in a new country, and a plethora of other things. There wasn't time to think about why I wanted to do all of this, I just needed to do it. 

As interviews and job offers started pouring in for others, I found myself empty handed. I felt fairly qualified but I see people younger and less experienced getting into jobs I supposedly wanted. A few weeks ago, I've come to realize that I've become damaged goods in this industry. I sold myself short, and now I carry a resume gap and a life story too long for an elevator pitch. I started feeling quite despairing, when some of my good friends in my current program, started teasing me. As I said before, I always thought I was strong and resilient, you know, first-generation immigrant background blahblah. But life keeps surprising you.

--------

At this point, this is not to say, entirely, that hey look at this guy he's just trying to prestige whore and he ran into a dead end in finance now he wants to find another high paying industry. I can't deny this definitely plays a part. But at least once I started considering switching industries, I started to see some of the unpalatable things about the industry that I focused my energy on for the past few years. The job, besides a high level quant job, seem quite repetitive, at least on the introductory level. And now my best chance at a job in finance is a middle-back office job, where I'm expected to grind it out for a few years and then perhaps hop to a better position or go to business school. 

Anyway, none of this. I can't seem to present myself in a positive light if I keep talking about this. But finally to get to the point. I have a few good friends that I stay in touch with, they majored/minored in CS, and I visited them quite a few times in CA and they seem to be enjoying their life and was very interested in what they were doing. Now I just feel a sense of dread when I think of finance. Sure the lack of job prospect plays a part, but just looking at the stuff and figures I keep wondering to myself man it's these shoddy arithmetic that moves mountains and cut down entire factory cities in this world. Once I thought it was exciting, but now I feel empty doing it.

I actually did quite a bit of Python during my math major, mostly for computation, along with MatLab. I really enjoyed coding -- kind of foolish but I like it when I watch my IDE changes the color of the text and when things run. I used a lot of VBA on my job, and when I had a lot of downtime I messed around with Django and built a half-working app that calculated taxes (this was before I knew what Git was). So this change to CS is really not that completely random. Meanwhile I was never fully committed in learning very deeply because I didn't see it as that major of an endeavor. 

I considered a CS career when I was in university, but as I was graduating I had the notion that the job market is fairly competitive and a CS major/major was indispensable. Yet recently a lot of the coding bootcamp articles started showing up on the front page and then I had some friends who were from non-CS but STEM background went into it and they were able to get the technical training and career prospect that they were looking for. So my mindset on whether it's possible to get into this field without a degree has definitely changed.

I travel a lot these days now I'm Europe. I only have courses a few times a week so I just buy a cheap bus ticket for 1-2 Eur and hop on and see things. I realized I really crave this lifestyle too, and CS seems to be fitting since the skill set gives the option to work remotely some time down the road. Meanwhile I started come to realize that most people that I knew in college, 80% of the once in finance, I feel that I never really knew them and they were just someone I simply said hi to. Meanwhile most of my closer friends are doing something technology related. Funny thing.

I'm still looking for jobs in finance because that's all I know for now. But I applied to two or three coding bootcamps and have some preliminary interviews. It's a big decision, and will cost a lot of money that I need to go into debt for. But at least at this point, my heart is pointing towards a career change. 

This always happens with me posting on reddit. I go off-topic and pour out my whole life. I don't speak English that much these days and my communication is kept to a 3rd grade level in this foreign language environment. Apologies but thanks for reading :)

------------------

EDIT with some specific question:

* How will employers in CS view my post-college experience? I don't want to tell a sob story, but it seems like I've committed to finance and even got another degree in it. How to present myself without making it seem like I'm quitting half way? I genuinely feel it's going to be a better culture fit but would that be good enough of an answer?

* Similar vein: will the financial knowledge be something I can leverage, say in a FinTech related start-up? I don't have golden experiences but my theoretical basis are fairly solid. I'm still interested in dev work for at least the time being but I'd like to keep the option of building my own firm in the future open.

* Bootcamps: after my research the only ones I see worthwhile doing at App Academy and Hack Reactor, maybe 2 other ones I can't recall right now. The quality varies very much but these two seem to have good market validation. Any thoughts?

* If I go to a camp I will mostly be doing the July - October cycle, most likely SF. Will the hiring cycle dry up by that time? Also the markets are kind of fickle these days and it's hitting VC funding, from the finance side. How do you feel like this might impact job market? Any color from the valley?"

I have a few penpals, others of course have left. We don't always hit it off but regardless everybody has something to tell and teach.

I'm a computer engineering student, currently I'm working in the field doing my internship. I like to read books, that's my main hobby (i'd love to write a novel some day) also I like to plan trips because I love to travel. Now I also discovering comics and I cook sometimes. I'm vegetarian and that forces me to go to the kitchen more often.  Also history and philosophy are things I'm not very knowledgeable about but which interest me a lot to talk about. You probably wanna know about my country or South America. I'm ready to answer your questions and teach you a little bit about it. 

I'm not quite a sportsman and I don't watch a lot of TV but if you do, suggest me shows and I'll try to watch them hahaha. 

What I offer is a friendship. I always respond letters, sooner or later. Expect that I respond at least a few days after your e-mail has arrived to my inbox.  I also like to get snail mail. I prefer to keep a pen pal friendship mainly through e-mail,   the occasional letter/postcard and if we really hit it off, whatsapp and/or hangouts. 

I like to talk about the topics I described above and also about our lifes and deep stuff with the chit chat that's always healthy to have in our lifes. 

I'm looking for girls or guys who are interested in writing, preferably people who have had correspondence with others before for a long time and who don't mind reading or writing sort of long e-mails at least once a fortnight or once a week. People who are around my age. Maybe it would be cool to hear from people who are from countries outside the US because I wanna hear from different cultures to most of my penpals although I won't exclude anyone who is interested. Most Spanish speaking South Americans are here to improve their English, however, meeting people from neighboring countries is fun too and of course I'd love to write in Spanish.

Send me your PM and I'll send you my e-mail so that we can start getting in touch. 

EDIT: If you do send me a PM please tell me something about you so that I can be interested in replying. I'm very busy and I can't just do all the effort. Make me feel interested, talk to me about something beyond age, location and your job."

The line stretches down the block as students wait to enter Alpha Sigma's first party of the semester. I stand on the doorstep of the opulent fraternity mansion, arms folded in a way that shows off my bulging biceps and rippled chest. The collar on my Abercrombie polo is up, obviously, and I scan the line for any lithe young pickings that I could have fun with. I dumped my Theta slampiece over the summer - I said I had to focus more on my Goldman Sachs internship, but the real reason was I was just... bored of her. Who knows what I'll find tonight? Maybe a girl truly worth showing off to the high society I had been born into...
________________________________________________

Hey, thanks for reading! So the premise of this roleplay is pretty simple. I want to play a douchey, All-American frat bro who gets to corrupt and use a naive young first year. You could be a spoiled, stuck-up legacy blonde, a small-town busty brunette or even an ebony/latina girl who'd never dream she'd abandon her people to suck on the cock of a rich white guy. So long as you're creative and imaginative, I'm game!

This can be played short-term, but what I'd really like to do is create a little world of opulence and privilege. I want to seduce your character with promises of the high-life, taking you to all sorts of exclusive events and country clubs, all the while making you into a more and more depraved slut. By the end of it I want you to be my bimbo, a good, obedient little girl who smiles and sticks her chest out while the men discuss business.

Detail, creativity and good grammar are key. I'm pretty open to most kinks and this scene can go from plain vanilla to extremely dark.

Hope to hear from you!"

From Southern Italy principally. This is also because there has been a lot of Italians immigrating to France one century ago, and many of them came from the poorest regions of Sicilia, Puglia, Campania, etc. and settled in Provence, southern France. 7,5 % of the French population has Italian origins today

But generally, Mediterranean Europeans have brown hair and eyes, olive skin, etc. Northern ones have blond hair, blue eyes, whiter skin, etc. I'm not learning you something haha

That said, Europe has a very mixed-race population so this distinction is being less and less pertinent nowadays due to intern immigrations between European countries (mainly from East to West) and extern immigration from Africa and Asia

498ajt,33,2016-03-06,Just wanted to tell someone about my life because I feel like I can't tell anyone I actually know.,popotolyfe,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/498ajt/just_wanted_to_tell_someone_about_my_life_because/,"Sometimes I feel like my life is a shitty drama that I can't tell anyone about. I just really wanted to get it off my chest.

I grew up really sheltered as a child. I wasn't allowed to have friends or go to things. The only people I was allowed to have close to me was my family.

My dad died when I was 11. I found his body when his dialysis machine wouldn't stop beeping. Then it took an hour of screaming and yelling that he wouldn't wake up to convince my mom that something was wrong. She ended up panicking and I ended up making the 911 call while fighting her off. 

I think I might have PTSD from that. I don't know. But sometimes I still hear beeping and screaming. I spent ten years thinking it was my fault and that no one bothered to correct me. 

After that, the verbal and emotional abuse began. Not only from my mom, but from my extended family too. I've been yelled at and screamed at forever since then. My extended family had the keys to my house for the longest time and would come in my house to tell me that whatever I was doing was wrong and yell at me for hours until I'd be sobbing and keep going. I'd be made fun of for hours because of my hair or my looks. No one ever tried to help me either. I was the black sheep and ugly duckling, in part because my mom would never allow me to buy new clothes or learn how to take care of my looks. 

The only thing that kept me going those days throughout middle school and high school was video games really. And books. I wasn't allowed to go outside still or have friends, and my mom cut off the tv.

Honestly? I hate my family. Especially my uncles who thought it was okay to come over to yell at me for two weeks straight, until I was crying every day.


I ran away once in college. I stayed with my then boyfriend and it was great. I eventually ended up making amends with my mom when she was diagnosed with cancer. 

She got better. It was stage zero, and she managed to fight it off after chemotherapy. 

I moved back in with my family after that. Plus, my relatives don't come over uninvited anymore. 

I switched my major to something that makes me happy when my extended family stopped looking at me.


Right now, I've moved across the country for an internship. Its weird being alone, but its kind of nice. 

I have a really hard time relating to people my age now. I don't watch TV and I haven't in a long time because I couldn't. So its... really hard to talk to them. like really really hard. I don't know how. Pop culture other than video games and anime is hard for me. I've got a lot of good friends who are a couple of years older than me. They've been great mentors and guides. 

I guess I'm just a super awkward girl who wants to make people happy and do the right thing. I wish I could better relate to people my own age. I also wish my family didn't suck quite so much, but those are the cards I've been given. 

Sorry. This has been bothering me for a long while. I don't think anyone around me wants to hear this. They just like to assume I'm a super sheltered girl with no problems. It feels hard to make friends in a new environment sometimes.

498cz5,2,2016-03-06,"Taking a year break during the middle of university for personal reasons, how will it affect my career?",zero2g,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/498cz5/taking_a_year_break_during_the_middle_of/,"I am deciding to take a year break from school after I pass this term. I am currently in the first half of my 3rd year and by my school's calendar, I will return to school in the Fall of 2017.

The reason for me to take a year off is that I am too stressed from school and a bunch of other issues including health and mental. I am hoping that to take a year off, it will get me back on track with the energy and the motivation to finish my degree.

Currently right now, I am no where near the dangers of failing but I am seeing myself slipping in school. My marks from last term to this term is taking a drastic drop and I know I am feeling more apathetic towards my classwork and courses.

With regards to internships, I have already landed an internship at a big company in the bay area for this term. I am hoping that if I take a year off from school and apply for internships again (My school have a co-op program), companies will be able to balance out with my year away from schooling and working with the prestige of a big bay area company to ensure that I am not penalized as compared to my peers. I am also planning to apply for an internship for the summer of 2017 before I return to school to ensure a minimal gap between working.

The reason why I am asking these questions is that from this subreddit, I am seeing that having a gap on your resume is a major red flag to employers. If I am taking a year off, there will potentially be a year gap in my resume, I am hoping that internships will balance it out. I am unsure if my decision will penalize me and possibly regress my career."
498he1,166,2016-03-06,Got my first job offer - in microprocessor design!,blingdoop,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/498he1/got_my_first_job_offer_in_microprocessor_design/,"Hey guys, I never post anything but this may be my greatest achievement to date and I thought some people would be interested in how I got to where I am. I recently accepted an offer at a highly valued semiconductor company to work on the physical (back-end) design of their next-gen processors. This step is right between the manufacturing stage and circuit design, so I would be using CAD to place and optimize the circuits on the silicon. I've always loved doing CAD, and I've been very interested in computer architecture, so this was too good to pass on. 

I first heard about the job from a neighbor when I was home for winter break. She worked at said company doing physical design and told me they were looking for recent college grads. At first I was hesitant to apply, since I figured they would find someone with a higher GPA (I had a 3.1...and this company rarely hires engineers with only a BS). Thanks to mother who told me I had nothing to lose, I applied anyway and lo and behold, I got a call from the team's technical manager the next week asking for a phone interview. I want to note here that references are really good to pass the initial resume screen, but they are not part of the process afterwards at all. That said, I was definitely lucky that I had the connect to get me through that initial screen...most people don't get that opportunity. 

The phone screen was long but the interviewer (same technical manager I spoke to earlier) was easy to talk to and relatively laid back. He described the job position, asked behavioral questions about my resume, and then some basic-intermediate technical questions. I had studied quite a bit for the interview (lots of research on the company, looking up common interview questions relevant to the job, practicing elevator speech) so I was prepared for a lot of them. Some Qs I remember: why did you pick EE, what was your favorite class, what did you do in your pas internship, give an example of working with a difficult coworker or partner, hardest project you worked on and why, describe CMOS, difference between latch/flipflop, how to reduce timing delay, describe MOSFET I-V curve, etc. The one that took me off guard: why is your GPA not a 4.0? To which I told him that I mostly get Bs and As; I got a C in an intro to circuits class and a statistics class, which really impacted my transcript. I also added that I like to balance school and life, so sometimes my grades take a slight hit, but I am usually on top of things. The phone interview lasted about 75 mins but it was a positive experience. I got a call back about a week later asking to schedule an on-site interview!

On site interview was panel style. 5 people v. me in a conference room with a whiteboard behind me...pretty daunting. The lead team manager and the technical managers were there, along with 3 younger engineers. Having the younger guys there definitely eased my nerves. It was structured much like the phone interview: explaining the job (they showed me a huge detailed blueprint of one of their processors...couldn't stop looking at it, it was so cool), what they were looking for, asking me about my experience, and then a barrage of technical questions. They really enforced that they were looking for problem-solvers so the technical questions were more like puzzles, and there were about 7 or 8 in total. I solved all of the puzzles on the whiteboard, but I needed some help on a couple, which they were happy to give. They mostly wanted to see my approach, so I talked through everything I was doing. There were a couple of riddles, one simple scripting question, a geometry puzzle, deriving logic functions from circuit diagrams, and a couple others I can't remember. It was exhausting but by this point my nerves were at ease since I was in my zone, and there was a (much needed) water break in the middle. At the end they asked me when I would be willing to start (usually a good sign) and whether I needed relocation assistance (I didn't, which was probably a good plus for them too). I left feeling pretty satisfied but tried not to be too hopeful. 

I got a call the next Monday and was shocked that they would continue looking for other candidates. Their reason was that it was still early to decide, and they wanted people who could start around March, which is before my graduation. I was disappointed but I understood; they also told me they'd call in March if they don't find anyone (which I thought was BS since they wouldn't have much trouble finding new hires). 

Fast forward to February, I email the technical manager to follow up and let them know I am still interested. I mention that I am taking relevant classes for the job and that I had other interviews scheduled and a potential offer. He responds and said they still hadn't made a decision and there were no guarantees yet. At this point I felt I had done my best; even if I didn't get the job at least it was a cool learning experience. 

But the email might have actually worked! A few days later he emails me back saying that they had a slight change in their hiring process, and would be willing to take on new hires in the summer. I call him to discuss the next steps, and he states that he would be willing to offer me the position! I got the official offer from a recruiter a few weeks later and just recently accepted it! 

Hope this helps some of you still on the hunt. Pretty surreal feeling to have a dream job lined up months before graduation...never thought I'd be writing about this. So to all my fellow engineers, just keep working at it! GPA definitely isn't everything! If you guys have any questions or want advice or anything just hit me up! 

TLDR; neighbor referred me to job, longass phone interview, 4 hour 5 v 1 panel interview, didn't get an offer since they wanted people earlier, emailed back a month later saying I was still interested, they changed their hiring process and offered me a job post-graduation!"

I'm open to a variety of different situations/prompts, and if you've got an idea, I'd love to hear it. If you'd like a few ideas of mine, they're below, as is my kinks/dislikes list!

1) I'm a mid-level office employee and you're a newly-hired intern. We don't deal with one another much aside from short, polite acknowledgements. However, I do some video editing work for a few clients, and a shady one turns out to be an employee at a local chain of strip clubs.

In editing a video, I notice a VERY familiar face giving a lap dance and even sexually pleasing a customer. It's you, and I wait until we're alone in the office to let you know that I know about your dirty little secret.

2) I've just moved to a new neighborhood. I know absolutely nothing about the area, and you notice me moving boxes and spending more and more time in the area. Your backstory can vary; maybe I've moved in next to a college sorority house, maybe you're a MILF with a cougar's sex drive, maybe you're a cheating wife whose husband is never home. Alternatively, maybe it's YOU moving into a new place. The ideas are endless; either way, it ends with us having had multiple orgasms and with you covered in cum!

3) One of us is in town for business on a VERY short trip for work. We can figure out specifics on who does what; maybe you're a cheerleader/dancer for a visiting sports team, for instance. Either way, we wind up in the same spot, and the situation escalates quickly from there, since we're both looking for one night of naughty fun.

4) I've married older and into an open relationship. My new wife has a college-aged daughter, and you're her best friend. You come over somehow on a night where nobody else is home (my wife is getting fucked by at least one other guy, my step-daughter is elsewhere), and ultimately we wind up in a situation where one of us seduces the other. Why are you at my house? How do we get to that point? Let's figure it out together!

5) Any kind of party prompt you can imagine; nightclub, pool, bachelor/bachelorette, etc.

6) Any prompt you've submitted in the past that hasn't gotten the interest you'd hoped for; as long as it doesn't go against my ""dislikes"" list, I'm game!

My kinks: Dirty talk (an absolute must), bad girls (seriously, the raunchier the better), partying/drinking/smoking (also open to drug use), oral sex, group sex, cumplay, cheating, mild age play if it fits the story (nothing illegal, but anything from ages 18-40something is in play).

My dislikes: Animals, bathroom stuff, blood/gore, BDSM, FUTA, incest, intense dom/sub situations, noncon, orgasm control.

Hope to hear from you today!"

I recently accepted an offer for the summer in Seattle. I had a few questions I was hoping some of the past Amazon interns could shine some light on:

1) What are your thoughts on corporate housing vs stipend? 
Here's my thoughts... I have a few friends at UW, so if I took the stipend, I would probably stay around there. The commute wouldn't be too bad (4 miles, 20-30 mins tops). Also, I hear that the corporate housing placement varies drastically, and it's kind of a hit or miss. I'm not too worried about mingling with other interns, if that's a main selling point for corporate housing.

2) What kind of laptop do they provide for employees to work on? Never used a mac before and just wanted to make sure I don't get blindsided.

3)What are things you enjoyed best about Seattle?"

If I screw up terminology, please don't be too angry. I'll edit the post if you have something to change.    
I'm a sophomore in college right now and I've had a helicopter dad since the start of middle school. He's really been micromanaging me on basically all of my activities to this day. He watches all of my Taekwondo matches and practices, and constantly yells at me to change things. In school, he constantly checked my grades and actually tracks my performance in excel. He owns all of the login information to all of my emails, social media, and any other online information. He will tell me to delete things off of my Facebook/LinkedIn and poses as me frequently on my email. He randomly calls me at least twice per day and asks me to tell him what I am doing and to provide proof (e.g today I was studying for my econ midterm and he immediately asked me to read from the book to make sure I’m not lying).    
Don’t get me wrong, I still love my Dad and he has tried to help me despite not knowing how and some points. I’m a habitual liar, and he has helped me improve that. I have great memories with him too. I got into a top 10 university with his help and we’ve had the best of times once the pressure of my sport or academics are over.      
Recently though, the final straw arrived. I had recently gotten an offer for a Finance Internship at a Tech company. I told him that I got the offer and I accepted it and he was really happy for me. Yet, he still continues to act as me and apply to internships even though I’ve already accepted the offer. Now, I’m getting all these emails and calls in the middle of midterm week in college. He’s constantly yelling and calling me asking why I’m not declining the interview offers, even though he created this mess and I've already got an internship.     
I can’t handle him anymore. My NDad has ruined so many of my hobbies with his micromanaging and unrealistic expectations. I haven’t competed in Taekwondo in over a year because he always complains and micromanages me in my matches. My grades have been dropping because of his incessant involvement and my search for an internship. Worst of all, he says he will cast me out if I keep this up, because he complains about me and my brother (same treatment for him, except he does Music instead of Taekwondo) to my mother and she can’t take all the whining.      
So I’m being blamed for ruining his marriage even though he continues to micromanage me and bring in all this extra drama to my life. I’ve asked him to stop but he just says that he won’t because I haven’t “showed him I can handle myself alone”.     
What do I do? I’m tired of his involvement, and I’m quickly becoming the SG for everything in the family. My Mom is fine, she’s not a Narc nor an Enabler. My brother isn’t an Narc. Yet I can’t turn to my family because they’ve been ghosting him since 2012. I can’t grey rock him because all we talk about is my future and how I’m performing in all of activities.  "

Just a warning, this post will be kind of a train of thought style post. So excuse poor writing. 

I've been seperated from my ex for about two months now. It was my first real relationship and made me learn a lot about myself. We always clicked together; we could talk for hours and hours and not be bored. Our sex life was amazing for the most part. We were very passionate and loving for a long time and a strong part of me thinks that I will always love her more purely than anyone that might follow. 

About a year into us dating, her best friend was tragically murdered. This was around the same time i graduated college, which means this time was a horrible and traumatic whirlwind of events. We moved in together in the town where she worked and lived together for the summer. I wanted to be her rock during this hard time and think that I lost part of myself. I wasn't doing enough for myself professionally and emotionally. I wasn't working out or pursuing jobs which led me to take a crappy summer job that I resented. We also grew emotionally dependent upon one another and I noticed some of my insecurities starting to plague the relationship. For instance, I would get mad and overly jealous of her being around girls because she's bisexual and I couldn't seem to get over it. Reflecting on it now, I think I felt this aversion to it because I might be a little of the bicurious side and admitting these feelings was difficult for me. At the end of the day, I think I'm straight but I suppose I realized that sexuality is pretty fluid. Over the summer was around the same time when i started resenting how many people she had slept with over me and thinking that I hadn't had enough experiences yet. For the record, her number was close to 20 and mine was 3; by all accounts something that shouldn't matter but something that plagued me every now and then because of my depression and bad state of mind at the time.  

Fastforward a few months, I managed to find some work tutoring and teaching German but nothing fulltime; she was finishing up her degree and preparing for her internship upcoming. We eventually decided to move in together even though this meant that I would sacrifice some of my oppurtunities at work near my hometown. She gave me all the options in the world, but I ultimately forced myself to move in and make this step because I was convinced the relationship would be over if I didn't. 

This was the beginning of the end. I found myself resenting her, and my lack of work opporutunities were driving me insane. We always communicated pretty well, or so we thought, and she always said that i can do what i need to do for this to work. I wish I had listened better and really done some introspection to realize that I wasn't ready for the step we were making and that i needed to stay at home and dedicate some time to my professional life. 

One day, not a week into our move, I woke up at 5:30 am with a clenching feeling in my chest. I felt so utterly trapped that I knew I needed to make a drastic step. I completely shocked her when I told her. I told her I couldn't commit for the true long term given the amount of people I had slept with. I told her I needed to get out and move back in at home. That night she called me crying harder than i've ever heard her. It still hurts to think about. 

Two months later, I've managed to find work and have been going to the gym every day during the week. I'm now working six days a week and am keeping busy. However, half the time it feels like something is missing. Some days are easier than others but often I feel like a part of me died. I never felt relief after the breakup but I knew that I couldn't keep going on if these issues (my self confidence, my lack of work, my jealousy, her being overbearing and sometimes controlling, the emotional burden of our grief, the emotional stress of growing up and not knowing what we're doing, her inability to live in the moment at times) wouldn't go away. 

She was the only person I could cry to, the person I trusted the most, the sweetest and smartest person I've known. My heart hurts and I am lonely. But what is even worse despite how much I miss her is not knowing 100% if I am able to rekindle our relationship. I've thought about it so often but I know it would be so unfair if I started things again and came to the same conclusion: that I was scared of this commitment and that i needed time for myself. 

My loneliness has made me take to tinder and other dating apps and I've slept with three women since the breakup. The last time it was a girl from a bar. After we hooked up I took a cab home at 4:30 AM and cried myself to sleep. I wasn't ready to sleep with other people either. Its almost like I am forcing myself to. 

I'm blessed to have many good friends and a supportive family but I am stressed all the time and my heart still hurts. I'm sorry about the hurt i caused her and while on the outside am doing fine am pretty crushed a lot of the time. On the one hand I feel like I am searching for my independence and on the other I feel like I won't ever be able to love someone again. 

Reddit, I am lost. I know I need to look into therapy but I'm so busy all the time i haven't done my due diligence. Does this get easier? What do I do? 

   
**tl;dr**: Broke up with Ex of 1 1/2 years two months ago to find time for myself after a period of depression and emotional co-dependency following a tragic event. I'm trying to self-medicate by sleeping with other people, it doesn't make me feel better. On the outside, I appear okay but I'm suffering. "
499g2p,1,2016-03-06,My[34/m] girlfriend [32/f] who broke up with me 7 years ago wants me back,XrayVegas,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/499g2p/my34m_girlfriend_32f_who_broke_up_with_me_7_years/,"7 years ago, I dated this girl Allyson for almost a year. We got along great, enjoyed being together, and I thought was had a chance at a future together except for one thing; her ex boyfriend/fiance. She dated this guy off and on since junior high. Both of their families wanted them together, but they had problems. She had just broken up with him when we got together.

We were scheduled to attend the wedding of a friend of her's and I was looking forward it. The week before, her friend had a bachelorette party in which a group of ladies went out on the town. I didn't hear from Allyson for a few days after that, which was odd because we would talk just about every day. She called me and told me she had run into her ex, who had just graduated medical school and was moving out of town for his internship. The next day, the two of them had a quickie wedding(we live in Las Vegas) and she was going to move with him. She told me when she saw him, she realized she still loved him and didn't want to lose him. I wished her well and told her I hope she and her new husband have a great life together.

I was devastated and I didn't date for a few years after that because I was so hurt by what she did, but I've worked on myself, made changes in my life, and am actually in a better place now than I was then. I've also just started dating someone else.

Allyson called me last night and told me she was back in town. She told me she and her husband divorced and she moved back to Vegas. She said she made a mistake and thought I was the one she should be with. She also told me she was getting a nice settlement for the divorce and we could start new together.

I'm not sure about the new girl I'm with yet, an I'm not sure about Allyson. I really need some advice.



   
tl:dr Ex who married her ex now divorced and wants me back."

Is this a bad sign for interest in programming as a career? I am enjoying my CS classes quite a bit thus far and enjoyed my internship doing functional programming but that was fairly ""code monkey"" level stuff.

My previous solution for it has been getting really high. It's not a long term solution, but it does the job for the big waves.

This is not healthy. I know. All that jazz. But it's a solution I've found. Also, this doesn't happen much, maybe just once a week. I can self-manage my dysphoria the rest of the days.

June 1st I'm starting my first ever job that will have random drug testing and so no longer can use weed.

Y'all got any suggestions? Or maybe not suggestions, but what have y'all done to ride the worst of the worst dysphoria waves? I can barely afford my T and therapist; anxiety prescriptions are really off the table.

Edit: for clarification, I am in college and the job is a summer internship at a large IT company."

I'm being interviewed over Skype tomorrow by a large Midwest ad agency (50m/year) for an internship. I'll likely wind up on the production team since my strengths lie with video. 

I'm being interviewed by somebody from accounts and somebody from media (I'm assuming this means production and not media buying) and I'm wondering if you have any suggestions on questions to prep for.

I've been prepping for a few days and know a lot about the company and their current/past work, but I'm thinking that they'll throw something out there like ""what's your favorite ad campaign of all time""

I'd also love any tips!

49altd,3,2016-03-06,I [26M] began my bachelor's degree in engineering this year. Do I have any chance finding a serious relationship?,Savage__Henry,dating_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/49altd/i_26m_began_my_bachelors_degree_in_engineering/,"As the title says, I'm a 26 year old male that has recently begun working on my bachelor's degree in engineering. Just over a year ago my long term girlfriend/fiancée ended our relationship suddenly. I actually returned to college less than a month before it happened, something we talked about endlessly and agreed it would be the best thing for both of us in the long term, and had to drop out because of reasons relating to the breakup. Her explanation, among other needlessly hurtful things, were that she needed someone stable and did not want to put further effort into the relationship (feelings she either kept from me or literally changed her mind about overnight). This has completely wrecked my confidence and I'm still working to get it back. I'm not exactly in huge rush to start dating again, as I need to finish working on myself before looking for the next relationship, but I know that I will want to find someone else to be with before I finish my degree. 

I will definitely be working part-time for the next 1-2 years and after that I will be eligible for engineering-related internships, which usually pay a decent wage. 

So, my question is: Am I undateable? 

I worry that I'm going to have a hard time finding someone interested in dating a guy with barely any job at this point in my life. I'm truly trying to better myself, which I hope people will recognize, and I will be much more successful with a degree than without. I'm at least an average looking guy, have hobbies and interests that I'm good at, and I like to think I treat whoever I'm with well. But is that enough? Am I just letting the things my ex said lead me to generalize the way people my age feel?

Brutal honesty is much appreciated.

49ane3,16,2016-03-06,I have a question on transfer functions (poles and zeroes stuff).,whatamidoing11,AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/49ane3/i_have_a_question_on_transfer_functions_poles_and/,"I'm at my internship and a senior engineer mentioned to me that we would have to modify a specific shaper circuit we were working with.  It's current transfer function is 

TF=G  (s tau)/(1+s tau)^3

So one zero and 3 poles.  As a response to a unipolar pulse, it gives a bipolar output.  It outputs the derivative of the pulse essentially.  We want to change the transfer function to:

TF=G  1/(1+s tau)^2

No zeroes and two poles, which would output a unipolar pulse as a response to the unipolar pulse input.

Basically we're going from the top image here to the bottom one:
http://imgur.com/a/EehfB

However, I've got to say, I don't intuitively understand *why* a ""differentiation is removed"" when you remove a zero and a pole.  I've gone back to my old textbook and notes this weekend, and can't find much on it.  I see how to determine a zeroes effect as a function of it's distance from the poles, but that's about it.  Any resources I find online for control systems are more introductory and never seem to get to this level.  By the way, the book I have is Control Systems Engineering by Norman Nise.

Basically, why does adding a zero and coincident pole ""differentiate"" the input signal?  I can see in Matlab simulations that adding a zero to a first order transfer function, like:

TF = s/(s+1)

Kind of does the same differentiation.  I just can't understand it intuitively."

However every single day there seems to be more and more things that make me second guess if college is right for me. 

Here are the problems: 

* I have no idea how I am going to do it financially. My parents make $80k a year combined so too much to get aid but due to their own debt and situation cannot help me pay for college. I have loans through my CC now but all the schools I want to transfer to will require outside loans, to which I highly doubt I can get (I have meh credit and my parents have bad credit) 

* I'm not good at it. I just lack the study habits and the drive to get good grades. My GPA is a 3.2 right now which isn't bad but I'm getting a lot of C's this semester and its getting worse. I also just don't care about my class subjects. I like my accounting classes but stuff like my literature class, programming, and math I just can't seem to put in enough care to do it. I know you aren't supposed to enjoy college classes but I have maybe showed actual intensest in 1 class out of the 16 classes I have taken. 

Here are my career goals and achievements so far: 

* I was an IT intern last summer at a big marketing company. I LOVED it. I love working with people, I love working in the city, I love talking to the other guys about how we can use technology in better ways, and I love working with computers hands on. I actually got accepted back full time this summer. One thing that struck me is that out of us 4 IT guys only 1 had an IT degree, the other had a psychology degree and one didn't even have a degree. My boss had some degree and certs but I don't recall it being IT related. 

* I work in a clothing store part time. I have done retail before and didn't like ti but this time I really enjoy it. I love helping people find their taste in clothing, I like trying to meet my sales goals and help my team out, and again I really enjoy dealing with people almost 100% of the time. My store has great co workers, solid managers, and room to grow and improve if I so wish (at least that's what I was told I don't know the details of that) 

* I have a blog about fashion and cars that I really enjoy writing for. If that was my full time job I would be very happy. 


* My goal is to get to IT consulting or IT management. I want to just work with people and computers and travel to do so if possible. However I really like the idea of somehow getting into the fashion industry but I'm not a designer, nor do I wish to be. 

* My other passion is the automotive industry. I would love to get the chance to drive cars for a living or be on the front lines of cutting edge cars, specifically stuff like Nascar or Formula 1 but since I have no interest in engineering that is looking to be just a hobby. 

This post ended up being kind of scattered. In the end I just don't know if I can do college but I feel like if I don't I will be a looser. I have worked with so many retail employees who hate their lives because that's all they do, though maybe that was just with bad companies because my current one everyone is very happy at.

Let me just start by saying that I realize I have nothing to complain about. That's one of the things that bugs me the most. I wish that I were happy with what I have. 

I'm just over a year away from my EE degree. I have a great job as an RA on campus and an exciting internship lined up for this summer. I have a car that is fun to drive and a father that loves me. I have a 4.0 GPA. I have been the president of a great campus organization and had the opportunity to make friends with amazing people.

I'm in good health and slightly above average looking. I have an older brother that goes out of his way to look out for me. I have had the opportunity to be with a few girls and sometimes people invite me to their parties. I'm a Christian, and I believe that I have a God that loves me.

Unfortunately, I feel empty. I feel alone. I feel like no one really knows me. I look back at all of my memories and realize that I'll never be able to reminisce with my friends that are long gone. I keep telling myself that if only I had a steady girlfriend, I would be happy. That if I had someone to talk to and love, I would feel complete. I'm scared that this isn't true.

I'm scared that I won't ever want to live my life. Some nights I think that I would end it if that didn't mean leaving my father with a mountain of student dept or breaking my brother's heart.

I'm struggling with cigarettes, nyquil, and alcohol, but no one would guess. I don't mind being alone, but hate not having the option to be around others. Some nights all I want is a hug. All I want is some to care and make a point to keep me in their life. 


I think that there is a lot more I could say, but nothing specific is coming to mind right now. Feel free to ask questions; I may or may not answer."

Is that bad to do or is that okay?

PS. I'm a first year college student applying for internships and whatever else I could find

This is how mine look right now

&gt;Dear Recruiter (Or name if it's available),

&gt;While surfing the internet for internships, I came across this job posting and it appealed to me for many reasons. For one, I want to take my first steps into the field of computer science at a reputable and friendly company and I believe there is no better place than at [Insert Name Here]. [Insert Name Here] is always interested in working with and creating the most cutting edge technology where as I also like to work with the best to create the best. Therefor I think that because my views and your company’s views are the same, this could be an amazing opportunity for me.

&gt;I also feel like the skills and qualities you are looking for are all things that I have. Throughout my years of studying, exploring and working on projects with others, I have learned many things such as teamwork and leadership skills and more importantly, the ability to properly program and make proficient software. I know how to properly fit and work in a high level environment as I have previously done a co-op term at IBM. I also know how to take constructive criticism and to respect and listen to my superiors. I was a high school student who was put in a place with experienced employees and with the guidance and advice of the employees, I was able to easily jump on the right track and become seen as an equal. I truly believe that my values for meeting deadlines, respect to others and ability to easily work with others could come in very handy in this position. For all these reasons, I feel like I would be a great fit at this placement and I think we can make each other very happy by helping each other out. 

&gt;Yours truly,

Extracurriculars: Taking Multivariable Calculus at a local university. APUSH/AP Lang. AP French. 

Took AP Physics and Chemistry last year. 5s on both, and self studied for my 5 on AP Biology. 5 on BC Calculus and AP Computer Science also.

Schools: Asking about reach schools, MIT/Caltech/CMU/Berkeley/Stanford

Extracurriculars: Main things are Olympiads. I qualified for the USAJMO my freshman and sophomore years. With my AMC and AIME scores, I am likely to qualify for the USAMO this year.

President of the school's math club.

Volunteer with mentally disabled children 20 Hrs/month

Worked as an intern for a small tech startup over the summer and managed to implement a motion detection interface.

Attended fairly selective math program.

Questions: So, my issue is fairly obvious. I know my Academics are not going to be what holds me back from admission to university. I believe I'm a good writer, and I am well liked by the teachers writing my recommendations. HOWEVER, I am not well rounded at all. You've probably noticed the lack of sports or music in my extracurriculars. I know this is important to colleges, and I'm struggling because it seems a little bit late to try to build activities around those, and it also seems fairly fake to do so.

So my question is this: Are my Academics enough to compensate for my lack of well-roundedness?"
49brp9,2,2016-03-07,"My (23M) guy roommates,(22M) (21M) who are both my friends, aren't the best roommates. They hate each other. Looking like it'll become violent.",dukenny330,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/49brp9/my_23m_guy_roommates22m_21m_who_are_both_my/,"So things have been escalating here and I need some outside perspectives. This is going to be long and sound very petty, but I've had enough and it's time to do something about it. I have a great feeling on what I have to do and can't wait to see your responses.

My 2 roommates (let's call them Ryan and Randy) and I have been living together for less than a year now. Ryan has been my roommate for about 4 years and when we needed a third roommate, we found Randy, who we knew through mutual friends. 

Ryan and I are fraternity pledge brothers. We've known each other since our freshmen year and he's one of my best friends. Randy is a transfer student and was also apart of Greek life at his old school. He couldn't keep up his grades and had to transfer here 2 years ago. Coincidentally, Randy's 2 old roommates when he moved here included Ryan's freshman year roommate, who Ryan and I are tight with. Things didn't go well with Randy and them as roommates from what I've been told. 

As long as I've known Ryan, he is not clean at all. He lacks respect for others and doesn't give a shit what they think. Not towards me though. He respects my stuff and knows where to draw the line. I've been blind to this recently and I'm not proud of not calling him out for it until now. He's hypocritical and childish and it makes serious discussions very difficult. Our old roommate and fraternity brother always tried to establish rules and keep things clean, but it just never worked. They got into arguments all the time making things stupid awkward and leaving me as the middle man between the two, hearing them gossip about each other whenever the other one wasn't around. 

Of course history is repeating itself again. Randy is not the smartest individual. I love the guy. Great guy, great personality, great to get along with, but he puts himself into situations that causes drama and arguments with Ryan over and over again. He knows how Ryan will react, yet he still does it. 

Just recently, Randy wanted to use Ryan's mini grill in the kitchen which has been dirty for over 2 months now, and asked him to clean it. Ryan said that it's his grill and if he didn't want to clean it, he wouldn't do it -_-. Technically, he's right, it's his grill so he could do whatever he wanted, but that attitude doesn't help whatsoever. 

Wait, it gets better. We all smoke weed. I say we smoke a fair amount, but Randy and Ryan smoke on the daily. They have to be high every day. While I prefer the greens every now and then, they have to have oil (which for those of you who don't know, is a pure THC concentrate that greatly intensifies the high) which requires a rig, an expensive piece that needs a torch lighter to heat a nail to high temperatures to properly smoke the oil. They both have rigs and they accidentally broke each others rigs about 2 months apart. Ryan paid Randy with cash, and Randy paid Ryan with a G-Pen, a mobile smoking utensil used for smoking oil (imagine a hookah pen/e-cig for weed). 

Both of them haven't been talking to each other this month for some stupid reason that I'm not 100% sure what started it (the grill issue is just another petty thing added to whatever issues they have). Ryan hates the G-pen, and when Randy isn't home, Ryan goes into Randy's room and uses his rig to smoke. Randy was oblivious to it until recently when he noticed oil build up on his piece. 

Now this isn't the first time shit like this happened. Randy has come up to me multiple times asking if Ryan would be going into his room to use his rig. I hate confrontations so much (grew up in a Spanish house where yelling is pretty much guaranteed) so I would play dumb saying I don't know, I wasn't here/didn't see to A) not snitch and B) avoid confrontations (My biggest mistake/flaw). 

Randy told me yesterday that he's been hiding his stuff in his drawers and taking before/after pictures of his clothes moved around. Last night, Randy was so angry he was shaking. He's a built dude too, so if we wanted, he could do some serious damage. Ryan is doing an internship at a criminal law office, so he could really fuck Randy over if Randy loses control and gets violent. Randy called me out for not having his back and he's 100% right. I told Ryan this morning that I've been saving his ass and that I'm not proud of myself for it and that if Randy asked, I would be completely honest with him. Ryan's response? ""Guess I can't trust you anymore."" 

Fast forward tonight, Randy tells me he's going to confront Ryan about and warned me to restrain him if shit hits the fan. I told him that Ryan could fuck him 3x over if it got violent because of his law firm connection. He smoked weed and stayed on the couch while I was studying in my room. Ryan comes in later at night. Conversation goes something like this: 

""I don't appreciate you going into my room, going through my things while I'm not here. I think that's very disrespectful.""

""Well, I don't give a fuck about what you think.""

""You're a piece of shit! You're gonna get your ass kicked so watch your back.""

""You won't do shit, fucking bitch.""

They both went into their rooms afterwards. By the sound of it, Randy was throwing shit in his room out of anger.

Our lease ends in the summer. I'm moving back home for financial reasons when the lease ends, but if shit does hit the fan, what is the best way to handle this? I'm not going out of my way to tattle tale to each other but this immaturity is affecting me now and I'm fucking tired of it. I do blame myself slightly for letting it escalate to this point but I think all 3 of us need to get our shit together. At this point, I'm just watching out for myself. Moving out is not an option for financial purposes, trust me, if possible, it would have happened way before. 


**tl;dr**: My friends, also my roommates, hate each other because of lack of respect, looking like it will get violent. What is the best course of action?"
49byux,6,2016-03-07,Relocation for an offer. What could I have done better?,b6M6VPzc,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/49byux/relocation_for_an_offer_what_could_i_have_done/,"I'm getting hired anyway and only signing the contract is left, but I'd like your opinion on what could I have done better because I kind of feel like a dick. It's the first time I do this and also the first time I get hired except for internships.

The company told me to hurry up as much as possible and I wanted to but personal family issues have delayed it for various reasons, which I realize is no excuse (Mainly because it's something very personal I can't tell them about).

It's a job in a city 250 miles away. I was told earlier last week that they wanted me on board etc and that although there was no hard limit on the starting date they wanted me to relocate and settle asap and tell them when I'm ready. The truth is, I actually could've been threre already.

They sent me an offer letter friday 26 saying that I had to start in 2 weeks at most, but the guy over the phone said that didn't matter, that I had to hurry up but I wasn't commited to any hard limit. I said please change the offer letter so I'm not commited by written then. 

I've been calling and telling them about my progression and all, trying to give a good impression, but 1 week later (so last friday) I hadn't done any progress in finding a flat except for paperwork and looking for flats online, and I think they didn't like that.

Today I called again first thing and told the guy, in an attempt to fix things (he didn't seem mad though, I mean he was nice), that I was eager to start asap and that I was going to go there with the high speed train tomorrow morning to sign the contract and start seeing the flats in person since I had talked with the owners already, so I can start this week or the next. It must be noted that before I could start saying this he said ""hey, i was gonna tell you, its time to speed up your relocation"". It's a tech startup so they probably do need me. After I explained he said great and also mentioned the possibility of using Airbnb for a little if I needed it to settle earlier.

How should I take this? How much did I fuck up, and whats the best I can do now?"

49cnh6,4,2016-03-07,"[LONG] Would you guys mind looking over something I'm writing? I'm writing a story with an Nmom in it, and I want to see how accurate it is.",ElectroClan,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/49cnh6/long_would_you_guys_mind_looking_over_something/,"Hey, everyone. 

First, I want to apologize to the mods if this isn’t the appropriate place for a post like this. Please direct me to another if that is the case. 

Okay, so I’m currently writing a YA sci-fi/fantasy novel where one of the main characters has an Nmom. I had just finished the chapter where the Nmom is introduced, and below is a segment of the chapter I had written. 

I’m posting this on here because I want to see how accurately I have depicted the Nmom here, especially since this is where she’s first introduced, so if you don’t mind, I could really use some input. 

I have based the mother off of my own Nmom as well as those of some posts I have seen on this sub. Just like my mother, she has mood swings, she gets passive-aggressive, and she makes a lot of scathing remarks disguised as caring advice, among other things. She’s supposed to only be verbally, emotionally, and mentally abusive (nothing physical or sexual), and I want to see if I can maybe make her more of a covert narcissist at first. 

This story is told from the perspective of Anh, a fifteen-year-old Vietnamese-American girl who has a makeshift lab in her backyard shed. She’s a bit of a scientific genius who had skipped a grade in school (making her an eleventh grader instead of a tenth grader), so she’s more of the golden child in her house. However, her self-esteem is really low, and she hasn’t seemed to grasp the idea yet that her mother is what’s making her feel so horrible all the time. 

She has a twelve-year-old brother named David who has more trouble in school than she does, and he’s more of the scapegoat in their house. I would use the terms “golden child” and “scapegoat” more lightly here, though, because their mother’s treatment can actually be more or less the same. Even though Anh is really smart, her mother refers to how stupid she thinks she is. 

Oh, and two other characters are important:

There’s Livvy, Anh’s closest friend since middle school, who’s only mentioned here. 

And then there’s Carmelita Bonita, who only gets a short introduction here but is much more important to the story later on. She’s a psychic who appears in a commercial based on [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqDm3Xtn3OE) while Anh is getting ready for dinner. 

Let me know what you all think. Would you say the mother here best depicts an Nmom? Would you say that Anh’s feelings and thoughts are accurate to someone living with a verbally and emotionally abusive parent, especially since this is told from her perspective? Is the scenario something you feel like had happened or could have happened to you when you were living with your Nparent? 

**OoOoO**

I could smell my mom’s beef pho all the way from the lab. I saw David setting up the table in the window while Mom was sprinkling something into the big stew pot she had. 

Maybe that means that Mom isn’t mad at him anymore. I offered to help my little brother earlier with his science homework, but Mom said that David was cheating off of me. I told her that he couldn’t since I never just gave him answers to his homework; I just helped him come up with answers on his own and helped him study. Mom then said that I wouldn’t know that he would be cheating off of me since I let other people fool me so easily. I was still pretty sure that David was never cheating from me. Then again, I know I’m stupider than I think and don’t see things right sometimes, so I knew I had to stop helping David. 

When I came in, Mom immediately looked over her shoulder and called to David sternly, “See, there she is now! David, do you have something to say to your sister?” 

I stopped where I was. Something to say? 

David set down the last spoon on the table and looked up to me. His face was sullen, but his cheeks and eyes were red. He turned to me and mumbled softly, “I’m sorry I was cheating off of you.”

“Louder, David!” Mom called, not turning away from the stove. “Speak up, like a normal person!”

Clearing his throat, David repeated more loudly, “I’m sorry for cheating off of you, Anh.”

I was surprised. This was about the homework, wasn’t it? I still didn’t get why Mom was mad over that. I knew that I let others take advantage of me sometimes, but I was just helping David memorize biotic interactions in an ecosystem. Seventh grade science has been a little hard for him lately. 

I replied, “David, it’s okay. I’m not mad at you. You didn’t really cheat. You just need to study more―”

Mom turned back to me and called, “Yes, he did! He needs to learn things on his own, and you need to stop letting him jump over you, Anh. I thought you were the smart one.”

“Mom, he―”

She glared at me before I could say anything else. I froze in my spot, forgetting why I even brought this up again. 

I looked back to David and said quietly, “Apology accepted, David.”

The entire room was silent before my mother suddenly smiled and cheered happily, “Good! Bring your bowls over here! The soup’s almost done!”

And just like that, my mother was in good spirits again. I guess she wasn’t as mad as I thought she was. 

David and I picked up our bowls on the table just as I heard something from the TV. The TV in our living room could be seen from the breakfast area and the kitchen, so when a new commercial I had never seen before came on, I could see it from the table. 

On the TV screen flashed a black-and-white photo of a little girl with black hair next to a grave. As discount sci-fi music played in the background, a man’s voice announced:

*“She was only five when she predicted her brother’s death and started reading tarot cards. When she was eighteen, a freak car accident left her barely alive and gave her the gift of heightened psychic powers!”*

A black-and-white shot of a car speeding down a road flashed by on the screen, and a white flash revealed a giant CGI crescent moon flying across the screen with a young woman sitting cross-legged on it, a wide smile across her face. The man’s voice went on:

*“Now, she’s sharing that gift with you right here in Houston! Come see the amazing Carmelita Bonita Ramirez!”*

After flying by on her poorly animated moon, Carmelita Ramirez popped onto the screen again, waving her arms in the air and shaking her hips so much that her giant, sparkly earrings swayed from side to side. While I would’ve already guessed that she was Hispanic, she started talking in the most ridiculously exaggerated accent that I never heard any real Latin-American use:

*“Do not worry! I weel tap eento jyour eenner self and make wonderful theengs happen to jyou! I weel lead jyou into the speereet world where all jyour questions weell be answered! Don’t wait! Call the number below!”*

CGI lightning suddenly zapped across the screen, making a shot of an old building appear. It was a strip mall with burglar bars over its windows, but there weren’t enough bars to cover the myriad of neon signs glaring at you, especially the bright purple one that screamed “CARMELITA BONITA!” right over the door. Along the bottom in bright pink appeared her website and her number as more CGI sparkles trickled down the screen. The man’s voice announced again:

*“Call super psychic Carmelita Bonita to answer all your questions at 1-800-285-7448, or visit her website at CarmelitaBonita.com!!!”*

My mom’s voice interrupted Carmelita Bonita’s computer-generated acid trip. “Anh, what are you doing?”

I quickly headed for the kitchen and replied, “Sorry, Mom, I’ll get dinner.”

She grumbled as she headed for the table, “You need to get out of your own world. I worked hard on this dinner, and I’m not waiting for you.”

My face burning, I looked down on the floor as I poured my soup into the bowl, watching each piece of beef plop in. I didn’t mean to hold everybody else up. 

Mom turned off the TV with the remote before sitting down to eat her meal. David waited for me to come to the table before eating, but before I could start, my mom suddenly asked, “So when does that internship start, Anh?”

“This Tuesday,” I replied, slurping my first spoonful of broth. “Dr. Crotalus told me to meet him and his team at 4:30. He’s just gonna give me a tour of the labs and some of the exhibits before I start doing any real work.”

A couple weeks ago, I was accepted into a research internship at the Houston Museum of Natural Science. I had gotten a phone call from Dr. Christopher Crotalus, the president of the museum and head curator of the gems and minerals exhibit, who personally congratulated me for all my accomplishments in all my UIL tournaments and tech club competitions. He’s not the scientist I’ll be working with, but I don’t remember the last time I felt so happy to hear someone tell me that. 

“4:30?” Mom grunted into her soup. “But that’s so late. That’s when I start making dinner.”

“Maybe we can go to McDonald’s instead,” I suggested. 

She shook her head. “No, I’m already too fat, and I’m not letting you ruin your pretty body. Duck-Duck’s already lost those little abs he used to have, but I’m not giving up hope on you.” 

David ducked his head into his soup and mumbled sheepishly, “Mom, can you not call me that please?” 

David’s real name is Duc, which means “virtue” in Vietnamese. Mom and Dad didn’t give him his English name until his fourth grade teacher suggested it one time so the other kids might make fun of him less. David used to come home in tears because his classmates always made quacking noises at him and called him “Duck-Duck.” Mom was afraid that his crying would make her look bad in front of the other parents, so she told him to stop. Now that David’s in the seventh grade, nobody makes fun of him anymore, but Mom has made it into a pet name for him. 

Shooting a wide smile at him, Mom pinched him on the cheek and giggled, “Duck-Duck, you know I don’t mean that in a mean way! Stop getting so embarrassed over nothing.” 

“But―”

Mom turned back to me and asked, “Anh, can’t you just call them back and tell them that they need to pick a different time? You can ask them to do it at around 3:30 instead.” 

Suddenly feeling a little uneasy again, I replied, “But Mom, they said that they chose 4:30 because it’s closer to the museum’s closing time. I can’t just ask them to change the time at the last minute.”

“Anh, it won’t be last-minute!” she pleaded. “You aren’t meeting them until Tuesday. They have to realize how late that time is for so many people. I always cook at this time, and by the time the meeting will be over, it’ll be too dark outside to drive, especially if I have to drive all the way downtown. You know I don’t like driving at night.”

I opened my mouth, but I had trouble finding words to say. Dr. Crotalus was quite clear that he had scheduled this meeting ahead of time, and I couldn’t just ask him to reschedule just for some dinner plans. But it’s not like Mom wouldn’t drive me there anyway, right?

I offered, “Maybe I could ask Livvy if her parents wouldn’t mind bringing me there and back instead.” 

She shot me a sour glare and replied, “What makes you think that Livvy’s parents want to waste all that time driving you around?” 

I suddenly looked down on my soup, my face burning for some reason. I didn’t mean to think of such a dumb idea. 

“I’m sorry,” I mumbled. “I was just thinking of an idea.”

Getting up from her seat, Mom sighed, “No, that’s fine. Go ahead and ask Livvy. But don’t be surprised if her parents say no, and don’t be surprised if Livvy starts thinking about how much you’re taking advantage of her here.” 

“Mom, I didn’t mean―”

“I’m just telling you, Anh,” she chided as she placed her bowl in the sink and turned on the water. “People can see straight through other people’s selfishness. If Livvy called and asked for a ride, you’d see what I mean.”

I wanted to say something else, but a lump had formed in my throat. David had been keeping his head down the entire time, eating his broth quicker than normal. Mom kept her angry stare into the dishes she was washing, never once looking back to me. 

I peered down on my soup again and started playing with the sliced carrots in it, my appetite mysteriously gone.

49cy4g,0,2016-03-07,What is considered lying or exaggerating about your work experience? (things that you didn't do vs things that you did),throwawayc0l,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/49cy4g/what_is_considered_lying_or_exaggerating_about/,"I have an odd question, I don't mind sharing my [resume] (http://imgur.com/kHhrBPJ) and I certainly don't mind any feedbacks (much appreciated!)

Here's my situation, I am not getting an internship at all. I've applied to countless software dev internship positions but I am not hearing back at all. Its already mid of march and I was hoping to have some offer. And I do understand I don't have the best work experience for software dev internship positions.

On my resume, I have briefly pinpointed the important points of projects that I was involved. This is to give a reader better understanding of what that overall project was about. I did not disclose what was my roles were as I though that could be explained verbally. 

1. Starting with the GPA, I combined my 2 university GPAs (one is lower than the other). I don't know if this would be considered as a lie because one of my professors mentioned that some students do this. 

2. My skillset, I have proficiency in C, most of the other languages were self taught and have some familiarity. Also, I mentioned Javascript as one of the language tools (for work experience) but I don't have proficiency in this language. I am not sure if this is a good approach.

3. My university projects, I was not involved in some of the role as they were done by other teammates but I mentioned to help explain what the overall projects was about. Probably the 2 that I worry about is the Raspberry pi kernal and integration of application via Rest API, these were not done by me but another team member. However, they were a critical part of our project. 

4. For work experience, I fear I may have exaggerated about some of my internship experience; especially with ad hoc analysis. But I did do some SQL and SAS scripting work and analyzed large datasets (for BI Reporting). The iOS dev is in the same boat, some parts were exaggerated to make it seem more attractive. 

I will confess that I've exaggerated some parts of my resume in order to gain attention. I have not submitted the new resume as of yet but I don't know how good of an approach this would be.

I am not getting a summer internship at all. And I am not sure if this is considered as lying, what do you recommend that I should do? "

So this girl I met a couple of months ago, I met and I organized to get to meet her and over time it was great and we got to know each other on facebook and in person. I then finally got to go on a date with her. The date was incredible, I got to cook for her, she and I got to know each other and we talked mostly as we cuddled after watching a movie. But we both saw the time it was 2am, she said goodbye, I walked her out to her car etc. Did all the right things, flash forward to the next week. 

She told my friends she had an amazing date with me. Which made me quite happy to hear. All my friends were super excited about her finally going on dates as well. As she had stopped official dates a while ago.


And then a great typhoon of stupidity followed: She is offered an internship far far away (on the other side of the states). She and I had planned a date that week. She tells me that she is leaving for her internship, I agree thats amazing, and say that would be a great experience. Then she tells me that we can't go on dates anymore because she has a hard time with feeling connected with someone who is far away. I inquire as to why, she answers, and then I say fine, and then I explain to her. Its not written in stone, (The internship) and that is quite hasty judgement. She agrees but then says she wants me still, and I say okay thats great we still can date as friends, and then she starts to pull away a bit and says, no just hang out as friends. So then I cancel the date because she says she is too busy for our normal date. Which I understand.


After a few weeks of back and forth arguing over what our relationship technically was, I gave her an ultimatium ""Oh no"", either she stays my friend, or I just stay an acquaintance. Now why am I doing this? She has commitment issues, I was having alot of second thoughts, I heard alot about her and was told quite a bit about her and knew she had slept around quite a bit and that she had trouble in the past. 


One of my friends thought he was doing a favor and telling me the whole truth, I mean everything. Her previous relationship etc. And I felt horrible after hearing about it, and even talked to her about it, which she even told me she thought she had talked to me about it and I replied ""Yeah but you lacked some of the details."" We got in another argument etc. She was angry, I was angry.


After a while I had lost my sense of wonder and wishing to the continue the relationship, instead I just felt like it wasn't worth the grief so I gave her an ultimatium mostly to see if she actually cared about me. Now she took it and told me she wants to stay friends, and told me she cares about me and trusts me. Which is all fine and good, but I always had a lurking suspicion something more was going on. 


Now I am just sort of stuck in this limbo of trying to figure out what the helk to do next, get over her, and find someone else, or just remain single for a bit. I have a very busy life and so does she, so we rarely got together in the first place. But I am not too fret about it. I have been planning out trying to figure out the best course for the situation and what to do exactly to go ahead, and get over the person.
   

**tl;dr**:  Girl cancels relationship after first date because of 'intership', I agree with her now stuck in weird limbo state of the friends: kind of still interested in one another, but I feel she doesn't want to date me because I came off too strong. What is the best course of action for this situation?"

Obligatory, this happened last November.

A bit of context on that friend, I had some long-term feelings for her when we were in high school. Let's call her ""choir buddy"" (yes, I met her through joining my school's choir) and yes, there were still definitely some feelings during that night, even though I thought to myself that I Had moved on from her. 

There are three components to my shame that we have to be mindful of during this entire incident. 

1) I sat near the stage because aside from having the eyesight of a starfish with nearsightedness, I wanted to get decent quality photos of my friend since she was the type of girl who would look average on a normal day, but would transform into an absolute goddess the moment she dressed up and put on a bit of make up during her performances. And boy, oh boy, seeing her onstage and hearing her sing in full diva mode could resurrect any feelings that were otherwise thought to have been finished. 

Putting her on a pedestal aside, it didn't help that I'm not discrete in taking photos with my phone; added to the fact that my phone's screen is huge AF, the people behind me could definitely see the subjects of my photos if they wanted to but being the mindless idiot that I am, I didn't stop to care if the people behind me were judging or not. 

2) I noticed that whenever the songs had some solo parts by the other performers, they would have friends scream as a show of support for them, sort of like a fans club on steroids. And yet, alas, choir buddy's friends were nowhere to be found. So I took it upon myself to be her ""fans club"" for that night because why not? It was only for one night and besides, no one's gonna remember me anyway so for the remainder of the show, I shouted her name and screamed and cheered like a mad man during her solo parts without any regard for my dignity as a person, just so that I could show my support for her (and low key because I'm a total and hopeless romantic loser who would do anything if I thought that it was gonna get me anywhere closer to her) 

3) There was one song number where they actually wanted the audience to participate so they gave us a tune to hum and being the shy and publicly reserved people that most of the people my age are, most of us were quiet. 

Suddenly, from out of nowhere, the guy directly behind me gave it his all. He was supposed to hum but it was like he nearly screamed his lungs out, like a prepubescent Micheal Jackson without the charisma, or the singing prowess. The entire audience burst out laughing, which of course included me and being the dumbass that I am, I laughed like a monkey going through a stroke and an asthma attack at the same time. 

Fast forward to the end of the show, the performers were finally able to meet and greet their friends and family who watched the show and take pictures with them and what not. I went to the toilet quickly and as I was going back to my seat, I noticed that choir buddy was standing near where I was sitting, so I sat down some rows out back and observed them for a bit. I noticed a couple of things in observing her mainly that she was talking to the people directly behind the row that I was sitting in, so I assumed them to be her friends and that they were composed of some older people. 

And just like that, after a few minutes, it occurred to me...

HER FAMILY WAS SITTING BEHIND ME THE WHOLE TIME AND THE GUY I MANIACALLY LAUGHED AT WAS HER DAD *can you say FML?*

Thinking immediately of all the humiliating things that I just did in front of them, including her grandma, I sunk into my chair faster than the Titanic post-iceberg. 

And that, reddit, is how I learned what shame means, the hard way. Moral of the story: Be mindful of your actions. Be respectable at all times. 

TL;DR: Went to a crush's concert, did some crazy and borderline humiliating acts of extreme fanboying/paparazzi-ing only to discover that her family was sitting behind me the entire time. 

Edit/Update: I didn't really want to leave immediately after seeing her show. I actually wanted to compliment her and take a few pictures together but that dream had come to an abrupt halt after I stood up and took a step after I sat down again at the end. My right shoe's sole had completely separated itself from the rest of my shoe, because I forgot that the pair I was wearing that night was the same pair that I used during my internship that got worn out from my daily walk + commute, which led to me bailing out of trying to save face. Also, I appreciate the comments and I apologize for my lack of balls. "

I haven't had the time to write this out at all, but that's because I've been doing some digging. A better phrase would be: I've been *forced* into doing some digging. I confess, I've made habit of tucking salt packets into my pockets. The notion seems silly, but after hearing enough jovial greetings of, ""Still bothered by the sheet ghost? Better bring some salt!"" I gave in. And I think the entity gave in, too.

It didn’t change; it still looks like someone wearing a white sheet. I've nicknamed it 'Kumot,' which means 'blanket' in my language (Tagalog; pronounced ""koo-mot""). Personally, I know the cuteness of the name doesn't fit the creepiness of the figure, but it helps me, and I desperately need it. Because Kumot has been showing itself more frequently, especially since I tried bringing salt. I think it fucking *likes* the salt. It's closer than before, debunking my theory of it being trapped in the chem lab, unable to cross the threshold. It likes to stand under the overhead lamp of the entryway, casting ugly, yellow shadows over what I assume to be its face. What’s even worse is that its mouth is open and gaping. Difficult to notice at first, the sheet is taut over its open lips and slightly darkened with shadow where its mouth should be, and it seems to be breathing, the fabric billowing in and out of its hidden jaws. The *worst* part is, I can’t leave until it retreats back into the chem room. Fortunately, it seems to get bored of watching me after a while, and I can sprint through the door, fearing any slight brush of fabric…

A few days ago, as I was pointedly keeping my eyes focused ahead, not looking to my right, where Kumot was mouth-breathing. Eyes in front. X-ray. Capture. Label. Print. Don’t look to the right. My lower back was aching from subconsciously attempting to stay as still as a statue under Kumot’s gaze. Can I call it a ‘gaze’ even if I can’t see its eyes? I can feel them, though. Breaking, I shifted my sitting position to try and find a posture that I could hold without feeling uncomfortable. Salt packets spilled out of my pocket and onto the floor, their paper packages slapping against the tiles. Out of the corner of my eye, Kumot’s mouth closed, except that it took the sheet into its mouth and pressed its lips into a wrinkly, almost *mocking* smile.

&amp;nbsp;

I stopped bringing salt.

&amp;nbsp;

A bit shaken, I built up the gall to interrogate my supervisor as nonchalantly as possible as to whether or not someone had died in the lab. She laughed and retorted, with a twinge in her (Southern) accent that let me know she didn’t care, “Why? Somethin’ botherin’ ya?” When I retold the happenings, she laughed, albeit strained, for a good three minutes before brushing me off to answer the phone. This irked me, but I haven’t questioned it further.

I went to Devin, the security guard next. Usually very friendly, with bright blue eyes and white hair, he’s been employed at my company for about 40 years and a grandpa-guardian to a lot of the workers here. I convinced myself to ask him about deaths in the building. When I breeched the subject, he replied just as my supervisor did, but with less venom. I confessed about the unplugged speakers, how I could see Kumot (didn’t explain the naming part), and the salt packet incident. I regretted it immediately, the second time the words coming out of my mouth sounding as stupid as ever, and I worried that he’d report me for being mental, but instead his face turned solemn.

“BiouxBioux, this is an old facility that manufactures [I shouldn’t write it], and it uses extreme conditions to test the products’ durability. Of course there have been deaths. Multiple ones throughout the years I’ve worked here.” In my lab, I asked? “No, never by the x-ray, not technically.”  Technically!? He had to stop and greet other exiting employees the obligatory ‘good night and stay safe,’ but afterwards he turned back to me with a face that revealed his true age, not the jolly visage that receives those who pass through his security clearance.

Continuing, Devin told me that a man had died during a night shift in the MEL lab, which is across the hall from my lab. He had an accident with one of the machines that simulated extreme weather conditions, this much was clear; his head had somehow been doused in IPA, which we use to clean PWB’s, and set aflame in a temperature controlled environment. I found this hard to believe, but the news still made me sick to my stomach. However, what he said next really topped it off.

“His body was found in the chem section of your lab, covered with a sheet, like somebody was trying to hide him,” he brought his voice down to a whisper so that he could continue speaking while my coworkers went through his doors for the day. “But no one could’ve gotten in, not a chem worker, nobody. The records for the room’s entry were searched, and no one even used your lab during that time of night, and the cameras caught nothing. It was into that hot box and then your lab’s chem room.”

I almost shit myself then and there. Even when Devin reverted back into his good-guy-guard persona, I felt bile rising in my throat. “Don’t stress over it,” he cooed, stretching his arms over his head, “If you don’t upset it, it won’t upset you.”

Since then, I’ve been restless. I want so very badly for someone to just tell me that I’m hallucinating, that this was an effect of the x-ray, or that someone’s messing with me, but that relief never came. Instead, curiosity gushed forth like a flood. I spoke to more employees that have been here for years. I spoke to past interns. I learned that the building used to be two floors instead of one, but that an assembly lab on the first floor had burst into flames. Today, the first floor is used as an underground garage. Past interns have also warned me not to play classical music. They smirked as if they were telling a grand spooky story to some gullible kid. “Yeah, the old guy who used to work there wasn’t a fan of classical. He’s more of a rock kind of guy. Didn’t the intern before you warn you about it?” It seemed like Kumot never bothered any of them.

It was the intern before me that helped me piece it all together. Let’s call her Marge. We’d met before, on the day of my interview, and she shook my hand and smiled with a face that seemed pained. I didn’t think anything of it. Distressed, I shot her a couple emails during my lunch break the other day. Being that she was taking her third semester, I didn’t expect her to answer quickly, or at all, rather. But lo and behold, her reply was almost instantaneous. Yes, she has felt weird vibes in the lab before. Yes, she was warned about classical music and forgot to tell me. No, she didn’t know that so many people enjoyed classical music these days.

Yes, she knows about the fire, and did I know that the bathroom that started it was under the chem room?

And yes, she has seen Kumot, but she hadn’t thought of salt.

&amp;nbsp;

I’m not fucking insane. Marge saw Kumot, too. Maybe that’s why she looked so relieved and yet so concerned when she met me as her new replacement intern. 

Just to seal the deal, I called a janitor into my lab while I was working and asked her to empty the trash bin. As I waited for the lab’s doorbell to ring, Kumot lingered in my peripheral vision, standing in the middle of the chem lab, mouth agape. I had flipped the light switch, illuminating the old chem room in a harsh, sterile light. I thought I could see the sheet sinking into its eyeholes, the shadows of its brow shrouding its face in a livid gloom.

The cleaning lady bustled in with a smile on her face and picked up the trash can when I pointed to it. Before she could even tie up the plastic bag, I asked her if she could see anyone behind me, cocking my head in the direction I wanted her to look. Stooped over in a position that was mid-crouch, she craned her neck to peer over my shoulder. Her eyes widened and her grip on the trash can stretched her blue rubber gloves over her knuckles, squeezing out a rubbery squeak. Lips parted, she found no words and nodded instead, gesticulating Kumot’s sheet with a downwards motion of her hands over her face. She immediately asked me to open the door and let her out, and I followed. Before shutting and locking the door, I saw Kumot smile once more, the lights of the chem room flickering back to pitch black."

When I was 17, I got involved with my now ex-boyfriend [22 at the time] that was a drug addict that verbally and psychologically abused me.


He manipulated me into cutting contact with a lot of friends and would convince me to skip school and because of that, I ended up being expelled. 


After some years of abuse, I finally realized that I deserved better so I broke up and went NC with him (and still am). It took me 1.5 years of therapy to undo the damage his daily verbal and psychological abuse did to me. 


Now, I'm 21 and almost a year ago I enrolled in a tourism course in my local work center to get my high school diploma and some work experience. 


At first, I was terrified... It had been years since I stepped foot in school and it was hard to adapt to a school routine all over again, plus I had severe social anxiety but now I have friends and I'm getting the best grades from my class and because of that, got an awesome internship which I'm loving.


Today was my day off from my internship and I was drinking some coffee with my mom and we were talking about work and I disclosed that after my course is over (I still have a year and a half to finish it), I was thinking of trying to apply to jobs in the field of tourism and then maybe going to college to study event planning. 


My mom's face went from excited to worried and I obviously noticed it and asked her what was wrong, she said it was not a good idea to plan to go to college because it was too late for me and that nobody will hire me when I'm old??


I got really upset because I'm working so hard for my future right now and I don't want to settle... But it got me thinking, is my mom right? Is planning to go to college at 23/24 too late? Should I just face this fact and try to be happy with what I've accomplished?


 
**tl;dr**: I gave up on school when I was younger, now that I'm 21 I'm finally finishing it and I have plans on going to college but my mom says it's already to late for me. Is she right? "
49enn3,39,2016-03-07,I think I'm still a Muslim but I don't know why...,sikagoon7,exmuslim,https://www.reddit.com/r/exmuslim/comments/49enn3/i_think_im_still_a_muslim_but_i_dont_know_why/,"Hey guys, first post. I don’t really know why I’m posting. I just want to know if other people have gone through this.

My story:

I live with my father in the US. Rest of the family is in north Africa. I just finished my BS in Biomedical Engineering in December.

Everything started last spring. I met a girl. Yeah cliché first serious relationship story. That’s not all. Around the same time I got an internship for the summer. My father was highly disappointed that I wanted to intern instead of study for the MCAT. He saw this as an “act of disrespect”. I was confused but went on with the internship anyway.

I lived 2 hours away from work and driving 4 hours a day was exhausting. I decide I am going to find a place closer to work. I friend of mine in a fraternity frat house offers me his couch. This further infuriates my father. He essentially cuts me off but I work it out. In a weird twist of events I end up living with my girlfriend while I intern unbeknownst to him.

For the next couple months he refuses to communicate with me aside from sending me conspiracy theory videos about the illuminati and how they control fraternities. This further expands to stories about occult Jewish control over the government and UFO bullshit. At one point I am able to get him on the phone and I scoff at him “Aliens? Aliens?!”. He pauses and responds “They don’t know this but they are interacting with djinn not aliens.” I’m at a loss for words.

This is all going on during Ramadan. I still go to the mosque at sunset to pray and get some free food. But ever since that conversation something snapped. I am very fluent in Arabic and have been studied in Islam and Shariah law for the majority of my grade school. I would argue I know more about Islam than most of the leaders at the mosque. So I started scrutinizing everything in the mosque, in the Quran, in every interaction with another Muslim. What am I missing?

Summer ends and I’m moving back on campus for my final semester when my father decides he wont pay for it. I’ve already signed the contract and he is shafting me with this. I end up using almost all my internship money to pay for it myself which pisses him off even more and then he decides I’m cut off again. No food no money nothing. We just got done with this game and you want another round? Fine. I get two part time jobs and manage to stay afloat, even make a profit.

My girlfriend is atheist and knows I’m Muslim. She even came to the mosque with me almost every day on her own volition. I’m getting closer and closer to her over these months and I realize if we stay this way forever I’d actually be fine. We make each other happy.

During fall and winter of last year my faith is coming apart. I am no longer convinced of any of the doctrine or dogma is Islam. My father is further trying to convince me of his conspiracy theories by merging them with his version of Islam and guilting me into rejecting religion. I keep telling my Islam and his are evidently different and I don’t want any part in his theories.

Fast forward to now. Ive been unemployed for 3 months and am mildly depressed. I can’t see my girlfriend all that much and am basically forced to video chat with her every day. I’ve had a lot of time to just think and I have come to realize that religion is kinda silly. Not just Islam. And I don’t subscribe to the whole Islam is evil and causes terrorism narrative either. Just the entirety of religion and benevolent deities in the sky the control all and love us; it’s naïve and childish. It’s self-imposed cognitive dissonance that crutches adults through the hardship of life.

It’s cowardice.

And I am the biggest coward.

I can’t let go. I still pray even though I can hear it echo off of nothing. I don’t feel anything at mosques. Every time I read the Quran it just sounds like a fearmongering authoritarian manifest. It’s all just propaganda. And I just can’t let it go.

I’m losing my mind.

I'm currently finishing my MS in Information Science down at UIUC and am coming up to the city for a summer internship.  I'll be working in product strategy (telecom) approximately 8-5/6 M-F.  I love getting out of the house - whether to the lake, a Cubs game, exploring a few new bars/restaurants/coffee shops, live music - you name it, but I'm also down to relax with a couple of beers at home after a long week.  

I'm pretty clean/orderly, like having people over, and am definitely looking forward to some warmer weather for grilling and the like.

Anyways, I'm looking for something that would open up in mid-May and go until at least August.  Like I said above, I'm locked into an internship until August but am already in talks for a job afterwards, so employment isn't an issue on my end.  

Let me know if you think we'd get along - looking forward to hearing from you!"

Ok, so I'm just not sure what to do anymore. I got my undergrad degree almost 2 years ago, but I've had absolutely no success in getting anything chemE-related. Nothing so much as an interview. My GPA is slightly low (between 2.5 and 3.0), which many have said is not so bad, but I feel like it's one of my biggest roadblocks. Also, I'm kinda shy and just calling around random people/knocking down doors is not something I've really done. Does that doom me?
I did have an internship and several extracurriculars in college, but it just seems like as soon as people see my GPA, my application goes into the trash. Plus, I live in a southern U.S. state where it seems like all I hear about jobs is the gloom-and-doom of O&amp;G layoffs. I know there has to be other jobs out there just begging for ChemEs, but I can't find them. Headhunters haven't helped out at all, and neither has the career center at my alma mater (they always just say ""keep applying online"", which has done me zero favors so far). My dream career would be involving semiconductors, but there's none of that in my state. I know I can't afford to be picky!

I'm not sitting back begging for sympathy or anything. I'm just asking if there would be a better strategy or mindset for someone coming up on 2 years post-graduation with only experience in retail and office administration so far. So I apologize if any of this came off as whiny, I'm just very frustrated (also with myself, maybe if I wasn't so dang shy...).

Any advice would be greatly appreciated!!"

My service is suspended right now.

Anyway, I want to make sure I won't go over my data. I pay $35/month for Unlimited everything on my mom's family plan on T-Mobile but I'm tired of hearing her throw fits about me changing the bill all of the time so I want to get off of her plan so she can't blame it on me anymore.

I looked back at my usage and when I lived with her earlier in 2015, I used 0-1.5GB of data. Right now I'm on the 2GB Fi plan. Recently I moved out and didn't have access to reliable WiFi and therefore was mainly using data for everything and I would easily use (this was before BingeOn but WITH Music Streaming) 9-12GB of data.
I'm assuming that the usage calculator on T-Mobile's site when you click ""view all usage details"" includes music streaming so those numbers should include it.

Anyway, I'm worried because in another year, I'm going to be doing my internship (Elementary Education) and I'm not sure if the school I am at will have WiFi access for the teachers. Plus, it is unpaid internship which means I won't be working very much so I don't want to pay $40 if it is better for me to stay with T-Mobile cause I will go over due to my internship and moving after my internship (I plan to move out really soon after my internship ends).

What do you guys think?

I'm going to x-post this to r/tmobile as well.

Edit: I'm thinking about moving for a month or two simply because I have a $19.44 credit coming next month plus the credit I could definitely get this month since I work and live around WiFi unless I'm driving to/from work but again my mom would start whining about me messing with the plan. I'd do call forwarding but then when I call out, it will show my other temporary number instead of my normal number."

So I'm in a bad situation. I currently attend an ivy league school majoring in computer science and have sever struggles with my mental health. I've had several internships in the past with some major tech companies (like Google, Facebook, Amazon). About a year ago I took some time off of school to take care of my mental health. I got myself back to a position where I felt I could finish my schooling (I held an internship and was able to function normally).

I returned back to school again this semester and the environment and stress of school has left me just as bad as before I left. I'm going to be failing my courses this semester if I continue like this. I am in my last year of school.

I'm seriously considering transferring to a state school near my home. Academically it would be a significant down-grade in schools. But, I would be near home and in a much less stressful environment where I believe I would be able to finish my school without the struggles I'm currently having.

How much would this hurt my CS career? It feels like I would have wasted so much time and money attending an ivy league school only to end up getting the degree from a smaller state school. I do still have several internships under my belt, but I'd no longer have the school on my resume.

Also, how would I explain this to potential employers?"

I've just found out that I'll be moving to ABQ for the summer for an internship. I'm looking for a furnished apartment with a decent rent. 

After some research, I've found it's best to stay away from the Warrens, but I'm completely new to the area. So, the next best option I've found is the Citadel. Is there anything I should be aware of here, or should I avoid this completely? My budget is around $800, but I'm willing to stretch a little. 

Finally, any suggestions of places to go/avoid are much appreciated. I love a good beer, and good food. 

Thank you!"

Actually, when I woke up today,  I was kinda nervous and scared. I was scared because I started thinking about the weekend. What if I fall back again? What if I can't resist my urge? What if this will be all for nothing again? 
I'm extra scared because I've an interview for an internship next week, so if I smoke in the weekend I'll probably ruin my chance of getting the internship. 

The thing is, I'm 150% sure that I can stay clean till Thursday with no big problems. My only concern is the weekend. That's when the cravings and urges will return and I don't know if I can cope with them. Does anybody have some tips on 'preparing' for the urges when you know they're coming?

I realise that the majority of the fanbase are still reeling from Derek!gate, and I've been thinking a lot about how they're going to proceed with her in the romance department since the end of last season.

Obviously fans are going to immediately despise any man who even looks at Meredith with anything but extreme dislike (see hot intern who's with Maggie, and of course Riggs), but nonetheless it's an interesting area of discussion.

Things we know:

- Meredith will not remain single forever. It's not the Shonda style. 
- They're going to be extremely careful with any possible potential romance.
- She'll date someone that she won't end up with before actually finding someone long-term.

So greys reddit - who's your pick?

I couldn't think of anyone at all. Then I started a re-watch and while I doubt this'll happen - one I really think could work incredibly well is.... drumroll... McVet. ""Finn"". He didn't last very long on the show due to essentially being a plot device as someone who is perfect for Meredith but is a victim of circumstance - she actually has the choice between him and Derek and chooses to break it off with Finn because ""Derek is the one"". 

I liked that character and would love him to reappear on the show - even just as a one off to take stock of how far she's come. It would be interesting to watch them both interact."

49idnb,3,2016-03-08,Should I take it?,Damsco93,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/49idnb/should_i_take_it/,"After tons of applications I finally got myself an interview for a marketing internship. The interview went really well and the company is actually interested in me and I need to give them a yes or a no very soon. 

The thing is, that i don't have a good feeling about this company. As soon as I got inside of the building I felt this super formal business atmosphere which kind of intimidated me. During the interview I also came to the conclusion that they are very very demanding and expect you to go far and beyond and the only thing you receive in return is the experience. This company started in 2012 and is now a multinational operating across Europe, so you can imagine how active they are. If I would do my internship there, I'd learn a lot. It would be great for my personal development. But at the same time, my guts tell me to not take it. This Wolf of Wallstreet kind of culture doesn't suit me and the fact that managers earn tons of money while interns and employees have to work 20 hours extra a week, is also a turn off for me. So my thoughts are conflicting and I really have no idea what to do.

Guts say don't do it, and my brain says it's good for my development, DO IT. 

Did anybody ever have such an experience, and what kind of decision did you make? Or what kind of decision would you make f you were in my shoes? Would you follow your guts/feelings or make the wise decision?"

This is very hard to talk about but I need to vent. Two days ago, my girlfriend from 6 months told me the bomb truth. She has been a prostitute since her 15 years old and so for 4 years.

Context. Her parents were abusive and throw her out at 15. She had no revenue and she got this ""opportunity"". She had no choice than to accept. She stopped this activity 2 months before ze got together, just as we started dating.

I just don't know how to react about it. I'm glad she talked to me about it because it means we have a trust relationship, and to be fair I don't care about her past. What matters is our present and our future, together. We're both Soul Sisters and we plan to move on together in may and we even speak of marriage a bit later on (and who knows, maybe a child).

We really love each other. The problem there is that she gave me all the details, the fact that she was giving BJs a lot for money, that she had threesome and stuff. And I'm not dumb. She probably has been raped sometimes. I saw her sometimes with big contusions. She told me that it happens (very rarely) that she met ex-client in the street and stuff and she's afraid to walk alone at night. We don't live in a big town. I want to leave with her, to take a fresh start but we're still in college so no money... I'm also afraid that our sexual relations change because of that. I can't stop thinking about this and my stomach hurts.

Also I'm in an internship in a foreign country right now. I'm coming back every two weeks but I honestly won't survive if something happens to her, to us. 

Now she's also worried about me going to see other girls because of the distance. She has trust in me but she is still a bit afraid. 

What should I do ? What can I do ? How do I reassure them ? How can I succeed to change my life, with her of course ? How to reassure her ? I'm lost... Sorry it's a bit of a vent but I needed to talk...

TL:DR : GF was a prostitute because no choice and now has doubt about all the men, even me. I want to reassure her and to live happily with her but I don't know how to.

Mandatory sorry for bad English."

I ran into trouble with the police about a month back. Everything legally turned out okay and I was just asked to pay some fines and work wouldn't find out about it. Little did I know that the apartment I'm living at right now (subsidized contract meaning it's through J&amp;J), sent a request to HR to have me kicked out of the apartments. So they found out and my internship is on the line. They asked if I was charged at all and for some reason I thought they were talking about the severity of my crime being more than a summary offense so I said no but looking back I believe I was supposed to say yes. I asked the HR rep if moving to another apartment was an option but I have not received a response yet.
TL;DR - HR found out about my run in with the police. Broke my contract with them saying that the apartment I'm in believes I am a threat to the community so my internship is on the line. Things are looking hopeless..help please!"

The degree is what we call a transfer degree where it sets you up to transfer after 2 (in my case 3) years at CC and finish the other 2 years at university. I have been looking into the cheapest state schools I can commute to and I still have no idea how I'm going to afford it. My parents make too much for me to receive aid but they aren't helping with college. Right now I have loans through my school but once I transfer the only option will likely be large bank loans that I don't even think I will be approved for. 

Right now I work retail at a job I love, and seems to have room to grow in. I'm also a full time IT intern in the summer. Last year they asked me to stay the whole year to fill in for the IT manager who was taking a year long trip but I said no because of school. I really regret that.

My question is should I maybe put off college for a little while and gather funds to afford college and maybe get my feet planted more in the IT field? I thought about joining the military to pay for school but I feel like that will set me back career wise and I think I would be disqualified for a back injury I got last year anyway. Can someone do college part time? Like working every day and taking one or two classes online, on the weekend, or at night? This summer I'm considering working the internship 40 hours a week mon-thurs and then retail on the weekend but maybe even the friday too, just not sure how I feel about working every day. Even this wont be anywhere near enough to pay for school but at least I could get a decent savings started (currently don't have a savings) 

Im not really sure what to do right now 

EDIT: I should clarify I'm not talking about quitting flat out, I'm talking about just going from full time student to part time and just taking a few more years to graduate. "

I interned there in summer 2015 and a minor problem has not been resolved yet.

We use some MS Excel ISA data sheets to help organize the process from quote to production. The sheets have been copied and pasted countless times and this has created some rough edges in the sheet formats, drop-down menus, check boxes, etc. We are looking at other possible solutions besides just using Excel. During my internship with this company, we obtained some trial software for [Megaflex Instrument Forms Plus PRO](http://www.megaflex.com/) but my boss didn't seem too impressed with the quality of the program. I am thinking we may give it another go because the desire to organize the ISA data sheet process has not been resolved and I am not finding a lot of solutions at the moment.

Does anyone out there use MS Access for this? Should I try to fix up these Excel spreadsheets? Is there another database management system program out there that is better and can streamline the process? Any input would be appreciated.

49j8qr,189,2016-03-08,My eviction story so far.... and lessons learned.,whoooooooooooooosh,RealEstate,https://www.reddit.com/r/RealEstate/comments/49j8qr/my_eviction_story_so_far_and_lessons_learned/,"I just got back from the courthouse, and I wanted to share my story of evicting a tenant, in the hopes the community may find value.

About me: I am a small time landlord; have a few properties. I started early and plan to grow my portfolio of properties. I believe I've done an excellent job over the last ten years where I never had to evict. I believe in treating my tenants excellent; they are my customers. I respond fast, I fix things quick, I send gifts to them four times a year, and charge under market by $50 a unit to retain the best tenants. When tenants move in, I leave cookies, water, mailing labels, a bone for the dog, a welcome card, paper towels, plunger, and more. The little things that don't cost much set me apart; it is my differentiator when competing with other landlords. I've been fortunate to have great tenants over the past ten years. 

The story: In January, a tenant of 19 years had fallen behind on rent. Mostly, she was late just about every month, but always paid the late fees. This time, it was excuse after excuse. I served a 5 day notice to pay or quit (sent online via certified mail). By February 19, I still didn't have rent, and it was always just another week away. Fed up, I told her to move or pay. Of course she did neither. Off to the courthouse I went to start the eviction process.

1. Research. I did tons of research, hours and hours of the process in my county. The county is quite liberal, meaning most laws favor the tenants big time. I really wanted to know my rights and resources. County courthouse website, tenant resource centers, and my apartment association were extremely helpful.

2. Filed the complaint. Filled out the summons and complaint form. I had to call the court to schedule a hearing to put the date in (3/8). I had to get this notarized, provide 4 copies to the clerk of courts, and bring it in. Paid the $94.50 in filing fees. They gave me 3 copies back to have the defendant served. 2 for the server 1 for me.

3. More research. I went to the court house on a Friday, as that is when they do eviction hearings in my state. I looked up the cases where I saw ""prop. mgt company blah blah vs. deadbeat tenant"". I stepped in the court room. Bailiff asked what my name was and I just mentioned I'm here to observe as I may have to be here in a few weeks. She laughed and said ""Here to watch the Springer show, eh?"" Obviously, I laughed. I sat for about two hours and watched deadbeats justify their situation, a few landlords with improper notice (note: always send certified mail, otherwise all the tenant has to do is say they didn't receive it). Best part was this landlord that was illegally withholding property, so the judge ordered him to return it. After the bailiff escorted him out, she walks back in and says out loud ""What a dick!"" Made me realize the judge, bailiff, court reporter, etc work with each other all day, like many of us do with our colleagues. For them it is their job. Many times they'd go ""off the record"" to converse, chat, etc. After the last session I stood up, then the judge called me out: asking what I was here for. I explained I wanted to ensure I knew what goes on to make sure I'm prepared for the future. He thanked me and gave me a document his intern put together about proper service, the statutes, etc. He uses this at evictions to ensure the proper process was followed. I thanked him tremendously. 

4. Service: I found the cheapest process server I could find. $35. I mailed it to the server, who then made 2 attempts and was able to serve tenant papers. He then mailed them back to me with a affidavit.

5. Filed the affidavit and a nonmilitary service form (stating they are or are not in the military) to the court.

6. First hearing (today). It is a hearing with a court commissioner, not a judge. Won't lie, I was nervous and anxious. It's now been just over two months. Tenant hasn't paid a dime since January so I'm out over $3k so far. I have been having trouble sleeping, as this is my business, I'm the provider for my family, and I am bleeding cash without the rent. I had a statement prepared with just the facts: We had an agreement for tenancy, tenant hasn't fulfilled the agreement and fails to pay or move out, and I'd like her to leave. The court commissioner was very helpful. He asked the tenant if she had paid, and she gave reasons of why not X, Y, Z, etc. He listened, while respectfully sticking to the issue. His role is essentially a mediator. My options were 1: proceed with eviction with a court date of 3/18. Here, I would likely win and would be issued a writ of restitution. I'd then give this writ to the sheriff immediately for them to physically remove her. Option 2: She claimed she had the cash coming from tax return and family gift by 3/25, and could pay it all by then, including court fees. If she doesn't pay by this date or is late once, all I have to do is file an affidavit of default and the writ of restitution is immediately issued, and I walk across the hall to give the writ to the sheriff to remove her. I went with option 2, as it seems in my best interest to have some hope of getting the cash, and not having to go to trial. Worst case, I lose a week or by some fluke lose the trial. Best case, I get all my money and stipulation if she is late again I get a default judgement. I feel good about it. 

Lessons learned:

1. Send your 5 day notice certified mail immediately even if they are one day late, doesn't matter. Always send it. Use an online service to save time from going to the post office. It was cheaper too.
2. Tenants may call you heartless, badmouth you to other tenants. You're the bad guy, right? Hold your ground, and don't let the nice guy/girl in you yield. Treat it like a business.
3. Don't give second chances. Second chances come from church, not from landlords.
4. Do your research and be very friendly to the clerks of the court and court officials. While they won't tell you what to do, they will tell you what NOT to do, which sometimes is better.
5. Find when your eviction hearings are held and swing down to the courthouse to watch. It's better than Judge Judy. My courthouse also has a two hour window each week people can ask about small claims processes. 
6. Cash for keys was an option I considered and offered, $500 to move out, but she didn't take it. I still will consider this in the future if it comes up. 

I'll post an update once 3/25 comes with hopefully good news. Hope this helps!"

49jara,281,2016-03-08,Me [24F] with [50sF] roommate/housekeeper. Her entire family comes and goes as they please; they've been here since January. Should I get my landlord involved or ride it out?,toomanytenants,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/49jara/me_24f_with_50sf_roommatehousekeeper_her_entire/,"Hi guys, I'm looking for advice concerning my current living situation. This sub has helped me before and I'm hoping it can again :)

Since January 2015, I've been renting a single room in a house with 6 rooms total. 5 of us tenants are grad students at the nearby university (high turnover rate as people graduate and move away), and the last tenant is actually a housekeeper of sorts. Her name is Maria and she is a Latino lady in her 50s. The landlord is a very kind guy and has employed her for several years. He's had issues with many previous tenants ignoring the rules, and so she's there to be his ""eyes on the ground"" when he's not around. She doesn't actually keep the house super clean, but it's adequate. None of us really expect her to pick up our mess, and that's worked out just fine. I pay a flat fee for rent (utilities, internet, parking included), but I know the other newer tenants pay a higher rate for their rooms, plus utilities.

My experience here has overall been positive. My landlord is great and flexible, and keeps us in the loop about everything. He has been making small repairs and renovations to the house since I got here. He installed an AC unit and a fan for my room, bought the highest speed internet ever (250 mbps) - all this without raising the rent on me. I'm only friends with one of my housemates, the others I know basically their first names and phone numbers for emergencies. It's not a social house because we're all very busy. I'm a full time student and I intern 25 hours a week so when I do come home I'm not really interested in socializing. I keep to myself most of the time but I have gotten to know Maria a little (in bits and pieces, as she doesn't speak English that well and I barely know any Spanish). She has done me favors and looked out for me on more than one occasion (once cut up her aloe vera plant for a burn I got on my arm). She always tries to ask me what I'm cooking, or what I ordered in the mail when I receive packages. Just small things, but I find her very sweet despite the language barrier.

Sometime late January this year, some of Maria's family came to stay with her. From who I've met so far, there's Maria's daughter [20sF], granddaughter [5F], infant grandson, and young niece [13F]. Maria's had family come to stay with her before, some weekends - I've met two of her sons on different occasions. I think it's nice that they are able to come and visit her. On previous occasions it's never really bothered me. I know what it's like to have guests and you just have to accommodate where you can, so being inconvenienced for a little while doesn't bug me too much.

However, this time, Maria's visitors have been staying here on and off for over a month. There is never any warning as to when they are coming or leaving. The biggest disruption to me is that there isn't enough space to accommodate all the extra people. The restrooms are ALWAYS being used or occupied, often by the children, and I feel guilty for knocking on the door and rushing them when I have to get ready in the mornings. Sometimes when I'm showering, the 5yo will start pounding on the door for me to free up the toilet, and won't stop till I'm out. We have one kitchen to share between all the tenants, and it's constantly being used because it's a small family that needs to be fed. I typically only use the kitchen a couple nights a week, but when it's so crowded I'm inclined to use it less. When my boyfriend comes over and we try to cook a nice meal, it feels like we're monopolizing the kitchen. There's been a new desk set up in our hallway for the 13yo that has to study. There's already not a lot of room to begin with so it just makes it more cramped. 

Maria's family members don't have any extra keys, so it's happened a few times that they've been stranded outside when she's not at home. The couple times I've been at home when this has happened, the kids will come and bang on my window for me to let them in the front (once they threw small rocks at the window, I really wasn't happy). The 5yo follows me around the house sometimes staring at me and I've lately gotten so annoyed I slam doors behind me so she won't follow. The infant boy is mostly fine, but like all babies he gets fussy and cries loudly sometimes. It's really disruptive when I'm trying to study or get other things done. 

I'm afraid to ask Maria directly when her family is planning to leave. She's been very kind to me and I don't want to offend her, and potentially have to live with that awkwardness afterwards. All of these little things add up as annoyances, and wouldn't be impossible to live with in short periods of time. But I've basically acquired new housemates without notice or approval. I'm eventually beginning to feel guilty just using the common spaces THAT I'VE PAID FOR. Maria's family has been here so long I think I should speak up. But how?
   
**tl;dr**: My housekeeper's entire family comes and goes as they please and they've been here since January. I'm beginning to feel very annoyed with the lack of space and privacy. How should I get my landlord involved?

EDIT: Thank you so much for everyone who read and commented. I just got home from work but I will be going through and reading all of your responses. I appreciate it, so very much!"
49jei0,6,2016-03-08,What is a fair salary/how do I ask for a raise working as a front end developer and system admin?,poochiny,webdev,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/49jei0/what_is_a_fair_salaryhow_do_i_ask_for_a_raise/,"Sorry about the throwaway first of all. I am currently a web developer/system admin at a small company of around 40-50 employees. Little background story about this job, my internship was ending and I needed something, I saw an ad on my university's job board for a ""part time network IT person"". I applied even though I have no experience dealing with networks other than in classes. I got an interview and on the interview, it was obvious that they didn't need a ""network person"", they needed someone to do PC support around the office and pay was $15.50/hr. I was pretty discouraged by this because I knew I wasn't going to learn anything, so on the interview they asked me about my web development and system admin experience and they were really impressed with my work so they went ahead and offered me a position.

I was very iffy because now I wouldn't be doing  only PC support but I would be doing PC support, web development and system admin all for the same price they originally advertised but at the same time, I had no job after my internship was done (where pay was $4/hr more). My now-boss offered me an extra .50 cents after 90 days if I demonstrated what my resume said. 

Fast forward now, the ""IT"" department is composed of 4 people and divided into two, IT infrastructure and web development. I am the only one out of the 4 that does both. Some of the tasks I do include developing static websites for clients using html, Css, js, sass (basically done with bootstrap) for their marketing purposes, email blasts, keep track of everyone's email accounts, try to come up with tech ways to save the company money and make sure the servers are running correctly.

I graduate in a couple of months which means no more financial aid and higher expenses. I've exceeding my peers expectations by completing my tasks fast and efficiently. Right now I'm roughly making around 35k a year. What would be a fair wage for the type of work and how would I go about asking for a raise? Thank you"
49jf5z,7,2016-03-08,Starting Out in Web Development?,LongHairedHeathen,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/49jf5z/starting_out_in_web_development/,"So I'm currently a sophomore in a great C.S. program working towards a B.S. in computer science with an emphasis in computer science. I think web sites and web development is cool, but I really enjoy making programs and more systems level stuff. I think backend/database stuff would be pretty cool too.

So here's my situation. My wife works full time and is going back to school for CS as well. We live in a decently new, probably too expensive, townhouse. We have no kids. We are both paying tuition. Financially, we have some money in savings and no debt, but because of tuition and rent, our bank account is steadily, albeit slowly, decreasing.

I really want to get a job that will give me experience in the field and pay decently so that we can have a positive net income.

The problem is that most of the jobs around here are for web developer interns, rather than software/QA engineer interns. I really don't want to be typecasted as a web developer. If I get a job offer in web, should I take it? Will I be stuck on that path? Should I hold out for software engineer/QA engineer intern since that's closer to what I want to do after I graduate?

Thanks!"
49jknu,1,2016-03-08,"My [27M] long distance crush [26F] came to visit me this past weekend, it ended when she said she was in love with another guy, amongst other things",big_gulps_huh_welp,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/49jknu/my_27m_long_distance_crush_26f_came_to_visit_me/,"I met a girl this summer while I was working in another city for an internship.  Let's call her Laura.  Laura and I met through tinder, and we talked for a little bit before eventually meeting up for a date.  We hung out another time after that before I moved back home at the end of my internship.  The next 6 months or so we talked on and off, until she confronted me in late January.  She told me to stop messing with her emotions by talking to her and then disappearing for a week or so, and then texting her out of the blue.  She said she liked me and that it was unfair of me to do that to her.  I agreed that it was wrong of me, and that I liked her too, but I was just unsure about what to do with the distance between us.  She suggested that a visit be arranged, and I thought that would be a good idea.  She bought a bus ticket to come see me for the first weekend of March (this past weekend).  The time leading up to that we talked everyday, through FaceTime or text.  We shared our secrets, talked about our dreams, and eventually talked about a future between us.


She came this past Thursday evening.  We had a good weekend up until Saturday night/Sunday morning.  She started acting weird Saturday night, eventually demanding us to go home while we were out with my friends.  This upset me, but I didn't do much about it.  The next day at brunch, she was acting very strange and saying things to me and my roommate that did not make any sense at all.  It was a little scary.  Eventually, we get a moment to ourselves and I ask her what is going on.  She spits out a bunch of nonsense and asks me to connect the dots.  I literally have no clue what she is talking about.


Eventually I get it out of her that she is still in love with the guy that took her virginity 10 years ago.  I'm a little crushed at this point.  I ask her why she even came to visit in the first place given this information.  She said she thought it was the right thing to do.  I asked her if she did it to affirm her feelings for this other guy - she said yes.  I am livid at this point.  Why would she confront me about messing with her emotions in late January when in actuality she messed with mine?  I feel used, angry, and very confused.  I look up bus times to see if she can go home that Sunday afternoon instead of her scheduled time of Monday morning - of course the last bus has already left.


So now I have to endure the rest of Sunday with her.  She says that she loves me as a friend and wants to remain my friend.  She then says that I am the best thing that has ever happened to her, and that I am the best guy she has ever ""dated.""  She says that I will make someone else very happy someday.  All of this is confusing me even more, and I say ""then why do you love this other guy?""  She doesn't have an answer.  I then ask ""why did you come here and mess with me?""  She says that ""everyone needs a little mess in their life.""  There you have it, she intentionally messed with me.  That pissed me off more than anything else.


Now here I am, Tuesday afternoon, staring at 3 photos she just posted to Instagram.  The first one is of me with a caption that says ""big_gulps_huh_welp, the boy who brought light back into my life &amp; showed me that it's okay to feel emotional at times.  Not only him, but everyone I care about!""  The second one is of me again, with no caption.  The third one is of this guy that took her virginity with a ""heart"" emoji.


I don't know what to do now.  She wants to be friends.  I don't want to be a dick, but I'm really hurt by her.  I texted her this morning and said ""I might be falling off your radar for a while.  It's too confusing and it hurts too much. I'm sorry.""  She knows she messed with me, she knows she hurts me, she knows I'm angry.  She apologized Sunday, but it was when she was acting crazy.  I don't think she fully understands what she did to me emotionally.
  
**tl;dr**: Long distance crush of more than 6-7 months visits me from out of town this past weekend.  She confesses she is in love with the guy who took her virginity.  I'm hurt, sad, angry, and confused.  She wants to be friends, but I don't know what I should do now.  I feel like I am owed a better apology, but that's unfair of me to expect it out of her."
49jpdy,2,2016-03-08,Not sure which path to take with my education.,Kansasken,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/49jpdy/not_sure_which_path_to_take_with_my_education/,"I've always loved the upkeep and usage of computers. This led me to aim for a technologically inclined career. Currently, I am a freshman at a community college, aiming at a Computer Science degree. Although, after programming on the side and in some intro classes, I realized that is not what I love about computers as much. Taking an internship in IT made me realize that I prefer working hands on with computers, and the implementation of computers, etc. more than programming. I also have always been partial to business, so I believe that could help in directing me. I hate math, and that end of Computer Science is already giving me struggles. I don't believe Computer Science is the optimal path for me, but I am not sure what other options I have. I've heard a lot of good things about MIS. 

Basically, I need some help.

Thanks in advance."

49k14c,6,2016-03-08,Unqualified for recruited position,sara-dara,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/49k14c/unqualified_for_recruited_position/,"I've seen some other questions like this (and google has supplied lots of advice), but I'm hoping for some personalized advice.

I recently received an email from a recruiter. I'm not sure that it was a mass email (I've received plenty of those), but most of it is copy-pasted from their job description page. I have some of the experience they are asking for through school, but have had neither an internship nor a job in the industry yet. They want 2+ years of experience in a developer/engineer role. I have bachelors in C.S. and AMATH with a 3.5 GPA and analytic work experience from before returning to school to earn my degrees. Based on the ad, I am certain that I am capable of performing the duties described with an entry-level competency. I am a quicker than average learner and I have excelled and moved quickly through the ranks at almost every job I have had. I am so eager for a challenge. I have had contact through school with most of the technologies they use and am concerned that I just popped up through whatever filters they use since I list some of them on my resume. Am I just going to be wasting me time pursuing this?

1. How do I reply? She didn't include any instructions. Should I simply apply on their website or reply to the email?

2. Should I mention that I don't tick all of their ""required"" boxes? Is there a way to pair that with saying basically what I said above, that I am still confident that I can do the job? Sure there is a learning curve, but what position doesn't have that?

3. Or should I focus on the stuff that I have done and had experience with?

4. Or should I stop overthinking it and just shoot back a short note expressing interest? (I've been looking since June and am getting pretty depressed. I think I need to GTFO of my own head! :-/)"

49kf46,6,2016-03-08,"Absolutely overwhelmed and depressed. 4 Routes to Take, each one has downside. How do I pick?",Note2Self_NameNeeded,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/49kf46/absolutely_overwhelmed_and_depressed_4_routes_to/,"Thank you in advance, and I'm sorry for the wall of text. 

TL;DR: Overwhelmed, and not sure what route to take. 1) Continue retail, be depressed. 2) Continue computer programming, but eye problems. 3) Keep Masters job search, but no experience. 4) Start fresh with new degree, but limited time.  Are there any other options I'm not seeing? 

I was depressed throughout my Masters of Health Administration program, so I did not do internships, only 3 months of volunteer at hospital. Now it's too late to get internships because I graduated (legal issues with interns). The job search is extremely difficult and frankly very discouraging due to lack of experience. 


I'm running out of time. My elderly parents' health are deteriorating, so I want to make more money so I can give them the best care. My sister also works a very good paying job so she can take care of them, but what happens if she's not there in the future anymore? 


There's a few routes I'm considering, but I'm absolutely overwhelmed:

1. Continue working in a very stable retail job, with a stable, but slow pay increase, and almost guarantee to managerial position in 4-7 years with 65k salary. Downside: This job is steadily draining all that's left of my life energy. Depression will absolutely hit if I keep staying here. 


2. Continue learning computer programming since I've already invested 3 good months in it. There's a high chance of getting a decent paying job. I'm confident because I know I can be very good with practice. Downside: Programming is really fun now, but if it becomes a full time job, then it's no longer fun and only a job that pays the bills. Also, future promotions and pay rate can be limiting due to lack of computer science degree. Additionally, I'll be on the computer 9 hours a day for the rest of my life, and I have problems with my eyes. Doctor said accomodative insufficiency (weak focusing eye muscle). 


3. Keep applying for jobs related to my Masters Program, even though I lack experience and hope to get an interview. Apply for hospital volunteer programs and get experience. Downside: Will have to volunteer 1+ year, doing very simple work that only volunteers are allowed to do (some computer work, filing, sorting, organizing, answering phone calls, coffee runs, etc...). Downside: No idea if volunteering will lead to anything because luck will be heavily involved. 

4. Go back to school for computer science. This is a very long road, something I want to do because I can be good at it, and I love it, except it'll take 5 years. Pretty much guarantee a job because I'll do a better job networking and working on projects during school. I still need to get letters of rec, pick a school, take prerequisite classes before applying. Downside: Very long road with limited time, eye problems, and high student loans. "

But there's never enough money to pay the bills. 

I've been on honor roll since junior high, I graduate college June 3rd. But good grades don't pay the bills. 

I eat healthy and exercise, that's what heathy people do right? But now I'm the one taking care of the entire house of sick people, and no one take cares of me when I'm sick. 

I rescued both my dogs, that's what good people do right? Everyone tells the stories but no one helps pay the thousands of dollar of vet bills. 

Being a good mom is hard work, having a well behaved toddler takes time, love and patience. But you lose all your friends because they don't understand why you won't 'just find a babysitter on Craigslist' to come party. 





I'm getting good grades, I'm on my second internship, I go to church, my toddler is happy and healthy, my dogs jog with my everyday, they go to the vet, I cook a healthy dinner every night, the house is clean before I lay in bed, we live with my husbands parents to help pay the mortgage. 


But we are broke, there's never enough money, we can never make ends meet, someone's car is always breaking down, my dog needs another surgery that we can't afford, no one will hire me since I can only work weekends (not even restaurants). 

We live in ghetto and DESPERATELY want to move out of state, but how? If my husband quits  his job we lose our insurance/who will help his parents from losing the house? How am I supposed to go find work when I don't even have had money to drive to interviews? Let alone someone to watch my daughter so i spend day in and day out dropping off applications in another state? 


I'm tired of all this bullshit. I thought all of this hard work we've been putting in all these years was supposed to lead to something. So far it's lead to debt and stress. I hate this so much. "
49ky0c,103,2016-03-08,"Watch ""Dear Zachary"" a documentary about what happens when you stick your dick in crazy",Antibuddy,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/49ky0c/watch_dear_zachary_a_documentary_about_what/,"This movie is an exquisite viewing experience for those of us here because it has everything. You have the Women Are Wonderful Effect^TM , how not to rebound, and reasons to stay the fuck out of Canada all in this movie. It's on Netflix. It's about a guy who fucked a chick with really bad Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD). She ends up killing him and more. There are going to be spoilers here.

___

The movie really struck a chord with me because I dated a BPD girl once. 

Let me interject early: you need to stay the fuck away from these people. BPD takes all the worst parts of femininity -all the manipulation, plausible deniability, playing the victim- and raises it to the power of 10. Whatever nightmare SO you have mentally conjured by reading the worst of TRP, you would more likely find it in a BPD person than anyone else.

What I'm going to do is present you guys the subtext of this story **as I understood it.** It's not an explicitly TRP movie, but there are some meaningful analyses here to read into.

___

Here is the [victim](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_U-_MB3ct83I/SWjqg3FwTyI/AAAAAAAAB1I/wiZaE-9C8-Q/s1600-h/andrew_bagby.JPG), one Andrew Bagby. He was in medical school when he was engaged to [Heather Arnold](http://pxhst.co/avaxhome/2d/d0/0029d02d_medium.jpeg). The real beginning of this story is here, when they broke up. This is the first point of analysis.

The doc only says he was very distraught after she moved on, it doesn't go further. So either he was cheated on, or they broke it off and she moved on much quicker than he did. Apparently, he was devastated. And why shouldn't he be? Sure, he was going to be a doctor, but so was everyone else around him. His relative SMV was low. He was well liked, but look at him. He was a pudgeball. And his ex-fiance, she's not a fat mess and was probably even prettier when she was younger. He was dating out of his league and he knew it. Seeing her move on confirmed that fear.

But why? Well [here](http://image2.findagrave.com/photos250/photos/2015/226/150768629_1439630588.jpg) is a picture of him during his college graduation. He's thinner, [not a bad looking dude](http://www.dearzachary.com/images/andrew-kurt-grad.jpg) at all. [And here he is with Heather that same day](https://1898383215.rsc.cdn77.org/dt/v/o/dear-zachary-a-letter-to-a-son-about-his-father.jpg).

[Now here's him at his med school graduation](http://heartlandfilm.org/wp-content/uploads/dear-zachary-a-letter-to-a-son-about-his-father-2008-photo4_thumb.jpg). Do you see what happened? Most likely he let the stress of school get to him. Or maybe after the breakup he put on even more weight. Either way, there is no way this guy ever worked out on the regular. Maybe that's why she left him. Or maybe that's why his self-esteem was so low that he eventually made the decision that would result in the end of his life.

So this guy is a beta in this environment. This is confirmed by what happens next in his story. His gets into a general surgery residency (the next step after med school) so, okay, this guy is going to be a surgeon. I'm a medical student I can tell you general surgery is one of the most challenging specialties someone can do. You work your ass off for 5-6 years, but when you get out you are highly paid and highly respected. But if you feel anything less than complete love for the field, you will fail. And that's what happened. He dropped out his intern year (1st year), and switched to Family Medicine as a specialty, arguably the bottom of the food chain when it comes to doctor circles. Not competitive to get into, and you make the least of all the doctors when you get out of residency.

So things went from bad to worse from him, as we know things can do after a bad breakup. This part here is what I want to point out to you guys. This is a major decision point for any man who finds himself in these tough circumstances. This is where you are most prone to make huge mistakes, but also have a lot of potential to shine. It's a make or break point in your life.

But it broke him. 

He ended up fucking the first thing that showed him any interest. This [thing](https://nationalpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/bagby-6.jpg?quality=65&amp;strip=all&amp;w=620&amp;h=421). The Lovecraftian creature named [Shirley Turner](http://i.cbc.ca/1.2327000.1383363887!/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/nl-turner-shirley-bail.jpg).

Does she look older to you? That's because she is. She was 40, in the same medical school, when she hooked up with the rebounding Andrew when he was 28. I don't know if Andrew knew, but she also had a couple of kids from different men, whom she gave up custody to. 

When he started residency, she would fly out to see him all the time. She was very sexually open with him in front of people, and there's even camera footage of them together demonstrating as much, her all over him. And she wasn't entirely hideous, definitely not fat or even close. 

She made him feel like a fucking stud. 

And she was going to be a doctor too. A little late, sure (multiple and frequent career/location changes are another tipoff to BPD, particularly when the person is intelligent) but that didn't matter. And they were both specializing in family medicine.

You know how else he must have felt?

&gt;I'm getting back what I lost.

And this is all going on inside a year, not longer. Because that's how long it'll take most of us to come to our fucking senses. And he did. Sort of. 

He breaks up with her, probably because he's not THAT stupid and realizes she's fucking crazy. She starts calling him incessantly. 

30 calls one morning. 

100 calls another day. 

It's not a clean break. He answers the calls. He even sees her again. In the doc, you see friends describing how drawn out the break up was, and you see them say things like ""he didn't know how to be a bad guy."" They're talking about his inability to ghost her. A crazy woman with BPD will have 20 complete meltdowns when you try to break up with them. ""Nice guys"" have no idea how to handle that. They don't know how to say NO, then not say anything again. They don't know how to tell someone to fuck off for good. 

She flies out there again. He's still trying to let her down gently because all he sees is this bundle of emotions in front of him. She's the victim. She's hurt. He wants to help. It's his fault she's like this, his fault for not wanting her. He wants to fix it.

But he puts her on a plane back to Iowa. She gets there's, then spends the entire night driving back to see him. She wants to talk. He's a nice guy, she just drive some crazy distance, so he obliges.

And she shoots him in the fucking face. And the chest. And twice in the ass.

___

When she learns she is the prime suspect in his murder, she runs to Canada. 

Oh and she's also pregnant with his baby.

It takes almost 2 years to extradite her to the US. She has the baby. Andrew's parents are beside themselves. After it finally happens, she is put in jail, pending murder trial with no bail. The baby goes to stay with Andrew's parents.

Enter justice [Gale Welsh](http://www.equalparenting-bc.ca/images-3/headst_jdg-welsh-gayle-nld.jpg) of Canada. Somehow, Shirley Turner thinks to write to her while in prison. Welsh ends up giving her complete directions on how to appeal, which is weird. So she applies.

Gale Welsh decides to give her bail and sets it at a whopping $75,000. Turner's **psychiatrist** puts up $65,000 of it. Gee, I wonder why.

Because woman. Intelligent woman who can write. Andrew's mom describes Welsh as ""gushing"" over Turner when they met. The mother said she knew right away what was going to happen. Welsh said her reasoning was that Turner's crime was

&gt;not directed at the public at large but was specific in nature.

She only wanted to kill *Andrew* not everyone else! He probably provoked it too, right? Probably **deserved** it in some way. Turner most likely thought so and implied as much to the justice, because that's how BPD people are. They buy into their own bullshit very thoroughly and that's what makes them good liars.

So Turner is out on bail. And guess what else! She gets to share custody of her child! A suspect in a premeditated murder!

Because mother.

Here is a [heartwarming picture](https://nationalpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/bagby-4.jpg) of Andrew's mom having to share custody with the person who murdered her son in cold blood. This was a common occurrence, too.

So we have a potential murder (likely, because really good evidence). Only she was a woman, and a mother, so therefore let's let her go on a pittance and let her see her son, oh and also let's have her share the custody with the closest relatives of the person she probably murdered such that they have to be in close contact on a daily basis.

Can you even fucking imagine this chain of events unfolding if it were a man. Can you even see this story progressing halfway to where it is.

Of course not. Because crazy is crazy. It's not that men are treated worse, it's that women are treated *better*. Men get the kind of outcomes that crazy psychopaths should get. Women get the pussy pass.

And do you know what happens when you give psychopaths a pass?

They walk into the fucking Atlantic Ocean with their 13 month old son in their arms and commit a murder-suicide. And they even try to leave a string of 'clues' to frame the parents of the son they killed.

___

A former lover of Turner's said he once found her sprawled out in front of his door, in an apparent suicide attempt. In her hands was a suicide note that read,

""I'm not evil. I'm just sick.""

For fuck's sake.

___

By the way, the 'Honorable' 'Justice' Gale Welsh is [still in her position](http://www.canadianlawlist.com/listingdetail/contact/b-gale-welsh-489779/) in the Supreme Court of Newfoundland and Labrador.

___

**Lesson's Learned**

1. Build yourself up after a breakup. Raise your standards, don't lower them. 

2. Be outcome independent. If raising your standards means you go without, **then go without.**

3. Recognize BPD and stay the hell away from it. People who move multiple times, frequently change jobs and schools, in addition to multiple suicide attempts (of the attention-seeking variety) or pregnancy 'threats,' are especially red flags. I actually wrote an entire post on [how to suspect BPD](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/2l7mbw/the_borderline_personality_disorder_bpd_and_why/), since this topic is close to my heart.

4. Canada hates you. Stay away.

5. Fucking lift, man. Even if you had such low self-esteem that a 40 year old monster looks appealing, if you looked good you'd also have the 25 year old showing you interest and you won't have a problem choosing.

6. Watch this documentary. You will get a lot more from the whole thing."

I took C and a bunch of math classes last semester. I am now taking Java and a bunch of math classes. I love java! I enjoy learning it and want to really learn as much as I can. But my issue is my teacher is not that helpful. We have projects and I have to just google frantically until I can put everything together. 

Are there any YouTube guys or any sites where I can really break down what I'm trying to do? I want to learn more but my book is pretty limited and times is contradictory to what my teacher says. 

Another question I have is how much experience do I need for an internship? I know a lot of people and two people said they would get me internships this summer. Which is awesome! But I am doing really simple Java programs so do I know enough to take the internship? I don't want to be in over my head and screw up the internship. 

Lastly, is there any site where I can post my code to get help? I posted on stack exchange and everyone downvoted me because my question was too easy. But I didn't know! And it's really hard when you get stuck if you can't find someone to help point you in the right direction.

49l5xt,3,2016-03-08,Seeking Advice,landoflakes10000,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/49l5xt/seeking_advice/,"Currently I am an intern at a local firm.  During the past recruiting season, I interviewed with a lot of firms but did not get any offers from larger firms like BDO, which was my goal. I interviewed with this local firm and really thought the culture would be great since I already knew someone there and my office visit went well.

When I got the offer letter it said I was to intern for both 2016 and 2017 busy seasons.  I signed this because otherwise I wouldn't get the opportunity at all.   I am three months in and don't like it at all.  I was told this would be an internship where I would experience both audit and tax, which was something that was a selling point.  However, I have only done tax work since I started (besides going on an engagement w/ no training and being called back after 5.5 hours because I had more tax returns assigned to me; was originally supposed to be a week long audit) with no engagements coming up on the calendar.  Also, I don't enjoy preparing taxes at all.

After this experience it has become apparent to me that I don't want to work here.  How bad would it be to tell them I'm not planning on coming back (regardless if I get another opportunity or not) around 9.5 months before the next busy season?  I am perfectly fine with staying it out until this busy season is done but don't want to waste my time spending four months interning at a place I don't want to be long-term.  I talked with a lawyer and he said they could not force me to work there since I'm at an at-will employment state (Minnesota).  

Personally, I know they would be really ticked but by giving them 9.5 months to find someone else I think eventually it would be understandable.  

Thoughts?

49ldo2,5,2016-03-08,"Great interview process, possible bad reference. I can't tell if I got the job or not",cadence_onstrings,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/49ldo2/great_interview_process_possible_bad_reference_i/,"I went through a two-week long interview process with this small, 3-person recruiting agency. I know that all of my interviews (phone screen, in-person meeting, shadowing, happy hour) have gone incredibly well but it's been three days since they said they were going to make the decision. 

The hiring manager said that she would call my references on Friday and get back to me on Monday. Then Monday came and she asked me for a reference from my old boss. I gave her the contact information and she said she would get back to me by Tuesday. Tuesday rolls around and I hear nothing. Today, I reached out to her at 5:30pm re-affirming my interest. She reached back out an hour later and asked if I had time for a phone call tomorrow. It sounds positive, right? But this is where the story gets complicated. 

There's a reason why I didn't want to give my old boss contact information. A little insight on her personality: She's publicly perceived as a really great person. A guru in her industry and a B-list celebrity in our town. Everybody adores her but she has a narcisstic and histrionic personality. It's hard to be around her for too long because she distracts me from doing my job and because she needs so much interpersonal attention about her life. I managed her company for two years. I completely created the infrastructure, on-boarding system and kept her company afloat and thriving. I helped increase the client count, raised money for our packages and became known as the ""rock"" that kept the company stable and secure. I was working well at that job but it came at the cost of incredible stress. She wasn't a good manager and was barely around. She constantly went on vacations. I had many nights working alone trying to make office rent for that month. She knew I was unhappy on some level, but I was too young and nervous to state anything (I'm 24 now, but I started working for her when I was 22) and she never dug deep. Regardless, we had a good working relationship because our personalities complimented each other. I am a team player but I learned how to work independently since she wasn't around. Why? Because I was her only employee before I started hiring interns and recruiters to have some company.

So at this point, things are chugging away. It's not great, but it's fine. Everything started to come to a head when I went on vacation. She said I wouldn't be getting paid for my time off (another example of why she wasn't a good boss) so I trained two of our interns to take over my responsibilities for that week. Things were bad that week.

The interns were constantly blowing up my phone and asking me questions about EVERYTHING since my boss didn't know how to answer them. I spent my entire vacation stressed out and then, I thought: I just need to quit. This isn't worth it anymore. I loved the job but I didn't love working with my boss. I was not happy anymore. I came back into town, trained the most competent intern to take over my place, and handed in my resignation. Things were in the positive since she threw me a going away party but during my resignation conversation with her, she told me that she did NOT want me to quit even though I held my ground. Since then, I've spent the last few months growing angrier and angrier about the situation. I am mad that I let her take advantage of me and I am even madder at myself for allowing that to happen. I have been spending the last few months working on my communication style to become a better employee. I went NC on her and haven't talked to her in the past few months, so it's safe to say she knows I was not happy. Coupled with the fact that the intern is her new right-hand man, who I spent many late nights with explaining why I needed to quit (stress, under-managed, over-worked.) So, it was a bit out of the ordinary for me to text her randomly asking for a reference that very day. Afterwards, she texted me that it went ""fine"" but I don't know what that means. I am not sure what my boss said. I don't think she even knows about all of the things I did at her company because she wasn't around. 

Which brings me back to this company. I want this job. It's exactly what I'm looking for but managed by a qualified team of people who clearly want to support me and give me the tools for success. They have been keeping me very clued in on the process, and I don't think they have many other candidates they are reviewing for the position so my odds seem good. One of the girls on the team recently became promoted as the manager for the division, opening up the space for the position I am applying for. 

My other references followed up with me and told me that their phone screen went well and the company loved me. But I don't know. I feel like I am stressing myself out for nothing but this is a big deal to me. I want this job very badly and I hate to think of my old company (which was mentally abusive and I am trying to get over the trauma of working with my boss) might've stopped me from getting this new job. When the new company asked me about my relationship with my boss, I said that I was still helping them from time to time and I had a great relationship with my boss. Because that's what people do in interviews and I couldn't outright explain the whole situation to them. 

My question is, do you think that I got the job? Do I have anything to be worried about? Or am I just freaking out for no reason?"

I really want to do something Computer Science related over the spring/summer. Since I haven't taken EECS 203 yet, I was planning on taking it in the Spring. I don't know what to do over summer semester though, because I really don't want to take 281 over the summer here. I've applied to many internships, but a lot of them don't really want freshmen, even when I have about a 3.8-3.9. What is your advice? What should I do over the summer semester?"

So I have an internship interview coming up and it is based around Java and java script coding for software and/or web development based on how the interview goes. I currently have had two semesters of Java coding and definitely am no expert or proficient at the language in anyway, but I love coding and feel like this opportunity would give me the real world experience I want to succeed in this field. How should I prepare for this interview, what kind of mindset should I be in, and how can I express my passion for coding while explaining I do not have an incredible amount of experience with it?"
49lwpc,3,2016-03-08,"[Text] I'm officially single and want to work on me, but have no idea where to begin.",loveNyeGuy,GetMotivated,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/comments/49lwpc/text_im_officially_single_and_want_to_work_on_me/,"A little background: I've been single for a year, but still dating. One guy went back to his ex. Another guy I'd been hooking up with and friends with for years informed me he's dating someone after I confessed my feelings to him. At first I was heartbroken over the rejection, but then I realized what an incredible opportunity this is. It's the first time since I was a preteen that someone hasn't been the object of my romantic affection. I've had a really bad problem where I date people I wish I could be instead of being the person I want to be. Because of this, men I've dated have become a part of my identity and I've let it hold me back quite a bit from reaching my full potential. 

Now, I want to apply for university and finish my engineering degree (I'm graduating with my associates this year). I want to write a book and perform slam poetry. I want to lose weight. I want to travel (I'm going with my mom to Costa Rica in the summer, but she always does the planning and I just tag along. My biggest travel dream is to climb Mt. Kilimanjaro). I want to learn to hoop dance and I want to dust off the mountain bike that's been collecting dust for years in my garage and take it out more often. I can always envision my success, but when I actually try to get started on individual things, I get discouraged because I don't know where to begin. I've always had someone and now I'm doing it alone. I don't know how to be alone and motivate myself so scary tasks now seem daunting.

Also, I never envision doing it by myself. I do a lot of things because I want others to see me doing it, otherwise what's the point. I know that's a silly thought process, but I always picture meeting and being with someone along the way who is so impressed by me. I never just focus on me. 

More than anything, I want to be proud of myself. I haven't done something that I worked hard for and can be proud of since high school and I'm 23 now. I just never finish what I start. Everything that I actually am successful at is just something that I happened to fall into, but didn't actually want or worked for. I ran into and impressed the right people. I was forced into situations by circumstance and had no choice, but to get things done. I'm great at my job, but it's unfulfilling and just a placeholder until I find a job in my field which won't happen until I get a little more schooling under my belt. Thankfully there's a plethora of paid internships for engineering students here, but I haven't even submitted my app to the university I plan to go to.

Everytime I try to get started, I'm frozen. My goals are large and I am lazy and inexperienced and don't know how to rely on myself. Please help. Your advice is appreciated.

Tl;dr: I don't know where to begin on tackling my very large goals, and end up getting discouraged."
49lz8u,9,2016-03-08,School/Job search feel like I'm trapped,goofsngaffs89,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/49lz8u/schooljob_search_feel_like_im_trapped/,"I graduate in May with a degree in Computer Science. Or at least that's the plan. Until this semester, everything was fine. Then I started reading on the internet that it's hard to get a job in this field without experience, like internships or personal projects, and I started to freak out.

On top of that, classes are harder than ever, the work is piling up, and I feel like I have no idea how to approach it. It's mostly based on group projects, and the other people in my groups are doing all the work while I sit back having no idea how to contribute. I'm in over my head.

On top of THAT, I kept hearing about how you should not wait until graduation to search for jobs, so I started applying. The good news is I got some phone interviews lined up. The bad news is, I got some phone interviews lined up. I'm just overwhelmed. I know to most people this is a foolish thing to complain about. The goal is to get interviews. But this is fucking with my head for a number of reasons. First, imagine if I get a job, then fail one of my classes. Then I have to tell my would-be employer, ""sorry, I can't work for you I failed one of my last classes."" Or even worse, I bomb all these interviews, in the process spend time and energy focusing on that and taking away from school, and fucking up my grades. 

I know these are ""first world problems"", but with my anxiety, it feels like life or death. I constantly feel like there is an elephant sitting on my chest. I need a way out, but there is no way out. With all my loans, I sure as hell can't just quit, nor do I want to. If anything I just want to step back and breathe, but there is no time for me to do so.

Anyways, I have no idea what I'm expecting anyone here to do. I just needed to post this somewhere I guess."

49m9x7,1,2016-03-08,27M4F Be a bad girl tonight.,redditbadboy,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/49m9x7/27m4f_be_a_bad_girl_tonight/,"OK, so I'm looking for some really naughty girls to RP with. I'm open to a variety of different situations/prompts, and if you've got an idea, I'd love to hear it. If you'd like a few ideas of mine, they're below, as is my kinks/dislikes list!

1) I'm a mid-level office employee and you're a newly-hired intern. We don't deal with one another much aside from short, polite acknowledgements. However, I do some video editing work for a few clients, and a shady one turns out to be an employee at a local chain of strip clubs.

In editing a video, I notice a VERY familiar face giving a lap dance and even sexually pleasing a customer. It's you, and I wait until we're alone in the office to let you know that I know about your dirty little secret.

2) I've just moved to a new neighborhood. I know absolutely nothing about the area, and you notice me moving boxes and spending more and more time in the area. Your backstory can vary; maybe I've moved in next to a college sorority house, maybe you're a MILF with a cougar's sex drive, maybe you're a cheating wife whose husband is never home. Alternatively, maybe it's YOU moving into a new place. The ideas are endless; either way, it ends with us having had multiple orgasms and with you covered in cum!

3) One of us is in town for business on a VERY short trip for work. We can figure out specifics on who does what; maybe you're a cheerleader/dancer for a visiting sports team, for instance. Either way, we wind up in the same spot, and the situation escalates quickly from there, since we're both looking for one night of naughty fun.

4) I've married older and into an open relationship. My new wife has a college-aged daughter, and you're her best friend. You come over somehow on a night where nobody else is home (my wife is getting fucked by at least one other guy, my step-daughter is elsewhere), and ultimately we wind up in a situation where one of us seduces the other. Why are you at my house? How do we get to that point? Let's figure it out together!

5) Any kind of party prompt you can imagine; nightclub, pool, bachelor/bachelorette, etc.

6) Any prompt you've submitted in the past that hasn't gotten the interest you'd hoped for; as long as it doesn't go against my ""dislikes"" list, I'm game!

My kinks: Dirty talk (an absolute must), bad girls (seriously, the raunchier the better), partying/drinking/smoking (also open to drug use), oral sex, group sex, cumplay, cheating, mild age play if it fits the story (nothing illegal, but anything from ages 18-40something is in play).

My dislikes: Animals, bathroom stuff, blood/gore, BDSM, FUTA, incest, intense dom/sub situations, noncon, orgasm control.

Hope to hear from you today!"
49mfzc,39,2016-03-08,[BIOTECH] - At the Reunion [OC],yousaidicould,HFY,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/49mfzc/biotech_at_the_reunion_oc/,"Hi. :-)

**TL;DR** (yet)- I liked the premise of this month's contest so much that this - my first contribution to this amazing thread - just sprang forth. The fundamental question that got me was, 

&gt; ***""How far does our humanity get removed if you change the elements of what makes us human?""***

In the spirit of all of the good HFY stories I've read in here, I decided to write a story about what I feel *really* matters when it comes to defining what makes H-so-mutha-fucking-F-Y...

The humanity inherent in all of us, and the people closest to us who help make us so. :-) 

Enjoy. 

**EDIT:** There are, in fact, pancakes mentioned once in this story. It's more of a buddy comedy than a NSFW thing... I tried not to make it weird. ;-)

*******

""Stop bullshitting me, man! You knocked him out with a *ration bar*?!""

He had this low rumble of a laugh... I swear to God it rattled the empty shot glasses. It was so, you know, *full*. He at least had the good grace to lower his head while he chuckled. 

""Well,"" he rumbled, ""To be fair, I was panicked. I did throw it kind of fast."" He honestly looked sheepish. Like he was embarrassed about it. 

""But I mean, that thing couldn't have weighed more than, what, 60, 70 grams? How fucking fast did you throw it?""

""I dunno. Pretty fast, I guess.""

""But Piglet, aren't those Space Rats kinda, you know, BIG? The Vids say those things are like, two-and-a-half meters tall..."" I thought for a second. ""Wait, how the fuck did he even sneak up on you guys?!"" 

I hopped off my barstool, and sort of pantomimed what I thought was a giant rat on tiptoes, sniffing around being sneaky. He was crying from the giggles watching me wrinkle up my nose and wriggle my imaginary whiskers. 

I sidled back up to the bar and got back to it. ""Seriously, though. How strong are you guys now?""

He shrugged. ""Hard to say. My staff Sergeant went home last year on leave, and visited his little brother during Spring Training. He said they clocked his throw at around 350kph."" 

""I CALL BULLSHIT, PIGLET!"" I barked. Everyone around me jumped, even the ones that couldn't stop staring at *him.* He just smiled. ""You'd damn near tear your own arm out of the socket just trying that!""

""It's true! Hand to God!"" he laughed. God, that laugh. I mean, it was still the same laugh, just... Meatier, ya know? Like Piglet was still in there, just wearing this giant fucking *meat suit.*

I'd missed that laugh. 

""So,"" I asked, after we'd stopped giggling, ""Tell me about it. What made you go through the process?""

*******

I met Samir Pritkin in 8th Grade. He'd moved to NewSanDee after his dad got a job at one of the biotech research firms in the area. My mom was working there in a different department, and we ended up at the same school together. My dad died when I was young, so his family would have us over all the time. 

The only thing remarkable about Pritkin - who our classmates took to calling ""Piglet"" because kids can be assholes - was how *average* he was. He wasn't tall back then - maybe 1.7m... Kinda thin, but not overly so. Nothing that hinted at what he looked like *now.* 

Sleepovers, girls, prom. Every formative moment of my young life he was a part of, in some way. 

When Becca Wilberg broke my heart sophmore year of college, Samir tubed out from Iowa State and dragged me to every dive bar around campus, every sorority party, and was a shamelessly incompetent wingman to every girl who walked by, trying to whore me out. 

Me, mostly athletic at 2+ meters and fit from Track and Field, looking like the saddest blond sack of shit on the West Coast. 

And Pritkin... God, he had ZERO sense of decency trying to 'hook me up.' 

At 1.7 meters, maybe 65 kilos soaking wet, and brown as a coffee with cream, he was like the weirdest, most depraved carnival barker ever. 

""LAAAY-DEEZ!!! Check this guy OUT! Don't you want a piece of THIS MEAT!?"" 

Fucking SHAMELESS. 

Becca showed up that Sunday morning looking to get back together, when she saw me in tangle on the living room floor. Three girls from Gamma-O (one an actual Randirian!) in various states of drunken undress around me, with a shirtless, skinny-assed Piglet in boxer shorts and a frilly apron making pancakes for us in the kitchenette. 

Probably the best thing that could've happened to me, in repose. 

Samir's the closest thing I've ever had to a brother. I'd kill a skiff-load of Space Rats for him... 

After he went in for the Augments, though... That didn't seem necessary. 

******* 

He didn't tense up, so much as the meat-suit kind of contracted slightly. ""My ex-girlfriend Shari was on Na-Praxis when it got taken,"" he rumbled. 

*Shit.* 

""Jesus, Piglet... Why didn't you tell me?"" We didn't used to keep things from each other, but a lot had changed since the colony had been destroyed several years ago. One day he and I were talking, the next day Na-Praxis happened. 

Three days later I get a vid from his mom telling me he'd volunteered for the Augment Corps. No word, no goodbye... Just gone. 

Then tonight at the 10 Year High School Reunion, in walks this big, brown, hulking **Thing.** He walked right up to me, all 2 point 7 meters of brown muscle trying to wedge it's way through the double doors, and gives me a surprisingly gentle hug.

... And except for a shit-ton of odd stares from a bunch of our former classmates and a burgeoning crick in my neck from looking up at his gigantic ass, it was *Samir.* I fucking cried, right there in the lobby of the restaurant, hugging my best friend returned from the Void. 

I snapped back out of it, and went to playfully slug him in the arm. Stupid. It was like casually throwing a punch at a cinder block. ""OW! Jeebus fuck! What, are you bulletproof, too?""

He smirked. ""Only small arms fire. Stings like a sunuvabitch when they hit. I mostly go out on patrols with the Powered Armors now, what with the Space Rats dicking around. Talus is... I guess you'd say it's a rough deployment. Better than some places I've been, I suppose.""  

We'd talk about Shari when he was ready, so the change of subject was silent but acknowledged. 

""I'll bet. I've thought about a transfer to go work on some of the new colonies. The architecture firm I work for now is great about the opportunities, but honestly, I'd miss home. OH! And surfing! How long are you in town for? We should go surf off Oceanside Pier!""

""Ahhh, I wish I could Rhett,"" he sighed. ""Side effect of these Augments is that I sink like a fucking rock. The carbon-fibre bone is light and all, but the tissue replacements weren't exactly aerogel, you know what I mean?"" 

""No shit, Piglet."" I flopped my hand like it was broken at the wrist. He smirked again. ""What I don't get is how you can move so damn fast if they replaced everything with fucking granite. I build buildings. I don't keep up with the Biotech. How's it work?""

""It's complicated, even for me,"" he replied. ""For one, I've uh, got more than one brain now.""

""Well, you could've used all the help you could get, ya lunkhead."" 

""Fuck you, Rhett! I did just fine in school, thank you very much."" He took the good-natured joke in stride. That was good. Samir was still in there, even if he did look like a swollen fun house version of himself.

""What's the second brain actually for, then, if not to improve some very middling math scores?""

""Well to improve reaction times for one. And it's not a full brain so much as it is a 'neural shortcut.' It's tough to understand without having it done, but I can sort-of 'see' and 'hear' out of my hands.""

""That has to make handshakes awkward as fuck,"" I quipped. He laughed, his head thrown back, the muscles of his neck like bundles of whipcords.

""Fuck I missed you Rhett. It's good to know you kept your sense of humor, *Akhi.*""

""I missed you too, Brother. I'm just glad you're okay! You want another drink? Or, I dunno, a gallon?"" He pursed his lips together, and kind of waved it off. ""Lemme guess, side effect?""

""Yeah,"" he looked down into a beer glass that looked like it was made from a kid's toy set in his hands. ""It's this liver. I could drink 3 liters of Fire Water and still not get more than tingle for a few minutes. There's some nasty shit floating through the air on some of these worlds. 

""Nanite-laced Lungs, 2 extra kidneys... Extra kidneys, for chrissake! Hell, I can pump enough blood for two clydesdales to run at a full clip with this heart..."" He gingerly set the beer glass down. 

""Even my fascia is augmented. It has to be. Like that ration bar knockout? You're right. If it wasn't all tied in with nano-tubes and the neural netting, my muscles would blow their way right outta my skin if I moved fast enough. It's not something you think about until you come out of the tanks they keep you in.""

""Wait, wait, wait, go back Piglet,"" I asked. ""Neural netting? So you're kind of like running by some sort-of 'fly-by-wire?'"" 

""My dad can explain it better, but it's like this: The human body really is an *amazing* machine. Allah, God, The Great Pumpkin, evolution. Call it what you want, but we work GREAT, considering... But if you end up augmenting one thing, you blow out something else. Gunny told us stories about the early Augments. They'd go to lob a grenade, and the new musculature worked so good grunts were spinning their arms out of the socket with the effort. That's why we didn't really get it down until a couple of decades ago.""

""No no, I get it."" I was catching up to him. ""Like in architecture, I can't just use the same reinforcement for a much larger building, or forget to calculate wind shear at height. I guess I just never thought about joints as joists.""

""Oh, shit, *Akhi*! I forgot about my joints!"" His awe and enthusiasm was palpable. ""Holy shit, man. They're like bullet-proof hi-bounce balls!"" I missed my best friend and his grin. 

Akhi... Slang for *Brother.* After a couple of hours, it was like he'd never left. Never been gone. He was the same old Piglet.

*******

Well, not quite. Quite a bit more, really, but still the funny awkward 'brother from another mother.'

We visited and caught up over several hours, his big, meaty paws surprisingly gentle when he went to pat me on the shoulder. Or when he was shaking hands with our other classmates. He was getting quite a few admiring stares, of course. He looked like he belonged in a Pantheon, chiseled from Marble.

In a moment of quiet, I asked him about it. ""Trina Herrule is fucking eye-raping you over there, Piglet. Fess up: you're plowing the field out there, aren't you?"" He smiled and nodded his head no.

""C'MON, man. What are you, shy all of the sudden?"" I laughed, but I could tell it was actually bothering him a little bit. Even at what looked to be over 175 kilos, he was like a giant holo-star. The idea of it seemed to make him uncomfortable.

""Naw, man. I can't,"" he said. 

""What, they didn't expand the plumbing and the pipes when they hulked you out?"" I looked at him sideways. ""That seems like a glaring omission, if you know what I mean.""

""No, no, it's not that. In fact, it's kind of obscene what the nanites and gene therapy does to, uh, *things*, if you catch my drift."" He had the grace to be a little embarrassed about it, which in our friendship was a kind of *patois.*

""Well, if Sharna Ollman's shit-talk was true, any size improvement would at least make it VISIBLE,"" I dead-panned.

""Still an asshole, I see.""

""Who, me?"" I mocked. ""Well, if my Uncle Barkus is telling the truth...""

""Which is doubtful..."" he interjected.

""HEY! Anyways, if he's telling the truth, my dad was a total ass, so at least I'm less so as the generations go down the line. Who knows? Maybe my grand-kid will be almost normal.""

""Doubt it,"" he shot back.

That's the thing about guys; we can bust each other's balls, and it's in good fun. 

""Back to your dick size, though,"" I tacked back.

""Please, Allah, no. Let's not.""

""Fuck you, man! Spill it Piglet. You gotta be CRUSHING it with the ladies!"" Seeing a dude that size squirm was actually fun, in a relatively benign way.

""No, for real. I actually can't.""

""What, did they break it off or something?! Those bastards!"" I shook my fist at the sky.

""No, you moron... I don't want to *kill* the woman, Jesus..."" He leaned in - ""It's against the rules to, uh, attempt *congress* with a non-Aug. I could actually wreck the poor girl. Not metaphorically... I mean, *literally*. I'm on an En-Limiter right now as it stands.""

""The fuck? What's an En-Limiter?"" I had a good buzz going, but he'd just introduced new language into the lexicon of our conversation.

""*Enhancement Limiting drug.* I'm dialed down."" 

""Wait, hold the fucking tube. You're dialing it down right now? Why would you do that?"" I'd seen him pick up 2 grown-ass women with one arm and flex for the camera without a hint of strain earlier for pictures.

""Rhett, I want you to think about what would happen if a guy like me - with half the reaction time of a normal person and the ability to lift a family transport without a Powered Suit - could do to a person if we walked into a place like it was Casual Fucking Friday. I'd gesture in a conversation and forearm someone into the second floor... *The hard way.* I gotta be careful around people, even dialed down.""

""You mean...""

""What I mean is,"" he continued, ""Is that it's a huge responsibility going Full-Aug. I can't just go thrust some random hole, if you catch my drift. It's against the Law. I could actually kill a Citizen by trying to have sex with her.""

""Well, at the very least, you'd smother her. I mean, look at you, you're a god-damned Nephilim."" I got it, but man... ""That's a helluva sacrifice. Sex is one of the things that makes us, well, *human.*""

""Oh, I know, *Akhi.* Besides, that doesn't mean I don't get any at all. There's a lot of really good women who went Full-Aug that are kinda... 'Good Sports,' I guess you'd call it. I'm not a monk, you know.""

""Not with **that** attitude you're not.""

""Har-fucking-har, dickhead... And yes, I miss it. I miss a lot of things that I took for granted. Normal stuff."" he seemed to stare off and get a little morose. I figured I'd try and bring him back to here and now.

""Like what. Fitting through doors?"" 

""Yes.""

""Having shirts that couldn't double as a tent?""

""Not really. That part is cool."" The corner of his mouth turned up a bit.

""Laundry day sucks though, right?"" I jabbed.

""The cleaning bill *is* a little steep."" A verbal perry.

""And you must leave a mean streak in your boxers.""

""Okay, that's just gross.""

""And your food bill has gotta be a real shitter.""

""You don't know the half of it.""

""Oooo! Speaking the shits! End to end, it's gotta be a cross country video call!"" I looked at him in mock seriousness.

""Oh my GAWD you're an asshole,"" He moaned. 

""That too! Your turd-cutter must be able to cut clean through a bridge cable!"" Even I couldn't keep a straight face on that joke.

""Your mind is a box of filth, Rhett, you know that?! Why are we friends again?"" He'd ask whenever I went into out-there joke territory. 

""Because,"" I said in a solemn tone, ""Nobody else would. Also, I'm awesome. Also humble. Yeah, that's it, I am fucking stuffed to the GILLS with humility. I'd have to be. I'm fucking amazing.""

""So you've said. Repeatedly."" His deadpan humor was there, just with a surprisingly basso rumble behind the voice. 

I looked down into my scotch, then. The years of being without my best friend, wondering what had happened to him, if he was okay, if I'd ever see my *Brother* again... 

""I missed you, Samir."" 

""Hey, don't get all weird on me now, Rhett,"" he gestured, palms up.

""I mean it. I'm happy to see you. One day you were here, the next... Your mom and dad filled me in on a little bit.""

""Yeah. Alab even came out to see me, under the auspices of checking on some of the gene therapy I had done after a bad patrol."" He looked down at the bar.

""I'm sorry I left like that, Akhi. That was wrong of me. It was a messed up time."" He slumped a little bit. ""I was actually on a call with Shari when they got hit. She wanted to come out and see me after she was done with her internship..."" 

He continued: ""I could *see* it happening. I *saw* the hull breach that sucked her out of the station."" He paused, then: ""I was numb. I remember walking into the recruiting station the next morning. Turns out, being a candidate for Full-Aug was something I was uniquely qualified for.""

I tried to lighten the mood - ""Scottish dad, mom from the Saudi Arabian peninsula... I suppose it was either that or some gangly, sickly brown kid who got sunburned when the sun was still behind the clouds.""

""Well, thank a god I didn't turn out like **you**, ya wet dream of the Old Nazis."" That lopsided grin again. 

""You look like you did alright,"" I told him with a smile. ""Still doesn't explain why you didn't call.""

""Well, about that,"" he sighed. ""I'm really sorry, man. In my defense, I feel like what I do matters... I like to think it matters to all of us. Not just the colonists we protect, or to the leaders here on the Home world. I mean to *humanity.* I take it seriously. I want to honor my mother and father with my service. My family here. Shari... Man, Shari."" 

The sadness on his giant face was visible. Like seeing a brown bear that was about to cry. 

""But you, *Akhi.*"" He looked down at me. ""I wanted my Brother to be proud of me.""

""Shut up, Piglet. You're gonna make me blush.""

""Good,"" he quipped. We looked back down at our glasses.

""Samir?"" I asked softly.

""Yeah, Rhett?"" he said, with a hitch in his voice...

""I was already proud of you, man. Thanks for looking out for us."" 

""*It's my privilege*,"" he said. 

He looked like he was gonna well up with tears, but I hadn't seen him in so long, I had to tell him...

""... And listen, you dumb ass bag of muscle; the only thing you had to do to make me happy was be safe, do a good job, and come have a beer with me at the end of the day. Okay, Piglet?""

He put a giant arm across my shoulders, and hugged me into his giant side.

""you got it, *Akhi.*"" He wiped a tear away with his other hand.

""I'm not buying YOU the beer, though. I'll lose my fucking shirt having you waste a keg on that god-damned super-liver of yours."" I looked over with a grin.

""Lightweight,"" he smiled, and squeezed a little harder on my shoulder.

From across the bar at the pool tables, Mike Kershawn - former-football-jock-slash-huge-dick-for-brains shouted, 

""**Oy! Poofters!** Get a fuckin' 'otel room, you two, right?!"" Several of his former teammates guffawed along with him. 

Welp, there goes THAT bonding moment. 

""I kinda wanna go over there and break a foot off in his ass. Piglet,"" I muttered. 

""I'm inclined to let you on principle,"" he nodded and looked back like a mountain of menace in their direction.

""Me? Fuck no, pal, I meant break YOUR foot off in his ass. I'm apparently the bottom in this power couple of ours."" 

""Awww, and I just got these things polished!"" For a guy his size, the mock whining sounded ridiculous. 

""Fine then, Jennifer. I don't want to have you ruin your pedicure or anything.""

""What. An. Asshole."" The sigh was also WAY overly dramatic... But who cares? My Brother was home from deployment. 

I got up. ""Do me a favor, would you? Walk me back to the Old Hotel Del? I was trying to keep up with you in the drinking department until I found out you were a ringer for drinking games.""

""Why the hell not?"" he laughed. Then, ""Hey, I forgot to tell you! I can see in the *dark* now! Some of the Augments are actually fairly useful.""

""Well, at least you're good for something, Piglet,"" I giggled. Damn, it was good to see him again.

""Yeah, yeah... Hey, how about tomorrow we meet up for breakfast in the hotel restaurant, and you can say hello to Y'Quirai!"" We lumbered towards the doors.

Something about that name bugged me... ""That name, Y'Quirai. It sound suspiciously familiar...""

""She should,"" he chuckled. ""Remember that time Becca showed up at your place outside UCSD and you were-""

""HOLY SHIT!"" I yelped. ""Is that the Randirian from that night?!""

""Yup,"" he was grinning like an idiot. A very large idiot.

""As I recall, she damn near scratched my balls of that night. Randirians are... Sporting, to put it nicely. I never quite felt like I could tame her."" I didn't remember much from that evening, but I do remember a lot of growling.

""Funny you should mention that,"" Samir replied. ""It turns out  that the, uh, 'robustness' of her species puts her on my pre-approved list of available, you know... 'Targets.'""

""Hunh,"" I mused. ""So, you, uh...""

""Yup. A few times. We both had to blow off some steam.""

""WOW."" 

""You're telling me,"" he winked.

""I take it the Management is going to be making sure you two are covering the cost of the repairs to your room, Monsieur Peeg-let,"" I said in a grave tone.

""It's reinforced. Also, shut up.""

""Thank Christ. Does said room also come with a scratching post for Madame Y'Quirai, or is she using your new and giant wookie dick for that purpose?""

""SHUT UP, RHETT! GAH!"" I think he was actually blushing.

""Really good to see you here, Piglet."" I giggled again as we walked.

""I'd say the feeling is mutual,"" he shook his head, ""But you are one sick fuck.""

""I know,"" I replied. Then, I mockingly flopped into him. ""Carry me, Piglet!""

""You're such an asshole, Rhett,"" he smiled, and then hoisted me over his shoulder without an effort.

""Hey, ya giant turd, either put me down or learn to treat a lady with respect!""

49mhwl,1,2016-03-08,Co-op or internship?,forsful,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/49mhwl/coop_or_internship/,"I'm in my 4th year on a 5 year track getting a double major in Computer Engineering/Computer Science. I have 2 offers on the table right now, one is for a Co - op (summer and fall 2016) at a local company.  The Co - op extends my time in school and my grad date to December 2017, which allows me to get a 2nd internship next summer before I graduate. The Co-op deals with developing OS's for single board computers (controlling various functions of vehicles mostly). The internship is in Business Intelligence (data analytics) and doesn't extend graduation.

My whole family is moving to the west coast over the next few years and I'd like to follow, plus it seems like the best opportunities are out there anyway. I'm wondering if there are any people (especially recruiters/employees from well established west coast companies) who have an opinion of what track would be better?

I've heard that Business Intelligence is a super marketable skill but i wonder if only having 1 internship experience prior to graduation will hurt me. (I decided on the majors late and spent last summer back packing).

What is your advice?,IAmOnASinkingShip,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/49mjm7/i_think_i_am_on_a_sinking_ship_what_is_your_advice/,"I think I may be on a sinking ship, and I need your help thinking rationally about it.  Here is how things look.  
  
A few years ago I had an awesome internship at a software company.  It was an amazing place to work and I loved everyone there.  Eight months ago they called me out of the blue with a job offer that I couldn't refuse.  I was told that one of the two owners of the company was breaking off of the main company and taking the product that I had worked on when he left.  I was hired under the understanding that I would be joining this new company when it split off.  
  
Several of the engineers decided to move to other branches of the company, so my boss wanted to rebuild the team.  Unfortunately things became vicious at the company and the other owner began trying to dismantle the team (he actually informed my boss that he intended to do so if his terms for the split were not agreed upon).  Long story short, people have quit under the stress and yesterday the last engineer other than myself accepted a crazy offer from the other owner and left.  My boss has treated me (and as far as I can tell, all of the other employees) very well and he pays me very well, so I am hesitant to bail.  I am wondering what you would do?  Here are some considerations:  
  
* The new company will be financially secure for the near future.  My boss keeps the books open and we have client contracts that will keep us in the black for four years if we do nothing but basic maintenance on our current clients.  
* Minus the insane shit that is happening right now, it is a dream job.  Very flexible, very good pay, I get to work from home 90% of the time.  
* The split will be finalized very soon and we will be able to get away from the toxic environment we have been in.   
* We are already looking at applications to hire a few new engineers as soon as the split is finalized, so I won't be the only one for long.  
* I don't have a Computer Science degree.  I have undergraduate degrees in unrelated fields (I took a minor in CS).  I was working on my masters in CS when I took the job offer.  In total I have about two years development experience(8 months at this company), but I worry that without a degree I will be unable to get another good position.   
  
I am somewhat excited by the idea that I will be able to play a big role in building the new engineering team, but I have a lot of doubts and I don't think I am capable of thinking rationally about this right now.  What do you think you would do?  Stick it out and see if I can build an awesome team?  Go back and finish the Masters?  Try to find a new job?  Thanks so much for reading my wall of text!"

49mnqg,4,2016-03-09,To Unseat or Run Third Party?,vivosmith,RunForIt,https://www.reddit.com/r/RunForIt/comments/49mnqg/to_unseat_or_run_third_party/,"At the moment I am running against an unopposed Democrat for a County Commissioner Board spot. I feel I can reach everyone in my precinct. I am also vice-chairman of my local libertarian party. In addition to this I work with the public at a major big box store, and I am on the county planning board, as well as write letters to the editor. Looking forward though, I am debating whether to run as a Libertarian or as a Republican. The party has been my baby, and it is just now gaining a small amount of traction. We have one new member, myself, the chairman, his gf, and some stragglers along the way. We have also agreed to have someone run for the state house under the libertarian ticket, as well as myself for the local position. So at least we have that going for us. However, the chairman may be moving to NH by next year, and so that will put a slight damper on things. Further I plan on trying to get a ballot proposal on the ballot next year. 

Looking forward, I want to run for the state house. This has been a mostly Republican/blue dog democrat district. One thing that is irritating me with Republicans is that they want small changes at a time. While I can understand we can't win everything, it feels like a death by a million paper cuts. As it is I am dumbing myself down as not to be too radical (I am aligned with anarcho capitalism). Having said this, the likely winner of this upcoming race has served on the Chamber of Commerce and has been on the school board. The other was an intern for our house rep, and the other (whom I support) is into common law and protecting the constitution. Barring my favorite from winning, we will likely be stuck with the Chamber lady. She has said the homeless shelter downtown is undesirable and further she wants to place a road in our district to benefit businesses. I feel like she is more of the same. 

So would it be better to go Republican and primary challenge her, or stay a Libertarian and try defeating her in the general election?"

Recently got hire by one of the big 4, hasn’t been smooth sailing :/

* I’m using a hand-me-down computer from the interns.
-	The same code base takes 20X slower to compile on my machine than other developers’. It’s a physically inferior machine by $3k.
-	Asking me to setup random project and NEVER go back to it. Some projects are not compatible with each other and causing trouble.
-	Trouble with setting up stuff and no one willing to help.


Maybe they want to get ride of me because of my race, but can’t fire someone for that. However, they could fire someone for incompetency (i.e. not able to produce result) What scares me the most is that if I’m the manger I would willing to do that.


I already signed the contract, so I have to stay for a year. Cause, don’t have enough to pay back the sign-in bonus and there’s a good chance the manager knows.



Have anyone experience this before? Is it a good idea to bust out that old interview handbook and start to prepare for the worse?

I've had some hard times in my transition and I'm very grateful to the professional folk - doctors, nurses, therapists - who have supported and informed me about trans things. I know how hard it can be to be trans, and the idea of working with trans people to help them in their transition in some way gives me passion. However, I'm not sure how I can start to pursue this career path. My therapist told me that I can find an entry level job at a LBGT center or hospital to get some experience, and work my way up the ladder, or go get a master's in social work, which opens up opportunities to intern with therapists or apply for more advanced job positions. 

However, as a student who has only been questioning and transitioning for 9 months (and was very ignorant about LGBT issues before that), I have no related job or educational experience, and my degree is in business. So, I am not sure where to start. I like the idea of working a related job for a while to get some experience first, but these job openings are hard to find for me. I'm posting to see if anyone else here works with trans people for their job, or knows someone who does, or can just give me some advice where and what to apply for. Thank you so much!"

49nqop,1,2016-03-09,"Those of you looking for a job, how do you deal with being unemployed?",phonecharger100,bipolar,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/49nqop/those_of_you_looking_for_a_job_how_do_you_deal/,"Hi. I'm unemployed and having a very hard time dealing with it. The bipolar symptoms are getting worse and worse with no structure, nothing to accomplish, and a legitimate reason for my self-esteem to suffer. I have paralyzing anxiety that prevents me from applying for anything the vast majority of the time, and in general I can only get applications in once a month when I am hypomanic. 

Also, my degree is essentially useless, and I am a new expat in a foreign country with only my husband here with me. All friends and family are miles away. I am a spring 2015 grad without any solid career start, but I have work experience, internships, and really excellent grades, and I'm not getting anything. BUT, the anxiety means I've gotten a grand total of maybe 6 or 7 applications in in the past 2 months, which I know is NOT enough! :'( Even a really well-qualified applicant would probably need more than a handful of applications to actually find something. 

What I keep doing is getting 85% done with a cover letter and resume and deciding not to send it because I realize I don't actually want that job (wouldn't be happy there), or I'm not qualified enough. I keep opening more and more tabs for applications in my browser and it's so overwhelming. I can't keep track of the due dates, and ""don't care"" anyway, because they won't hire me anyway, because I have no strong interest in working anywhere specific or in any specific field at all. I want to work, very badly, but have no strong aspirations, plan, career hopes, etc. It's vague. There is a huge variety of things I'd be happy doing for a career. A huge variety of fields, but I can't decide and don't feel strongly one way or another. I truly ""don't care"" right now, I just need a job so I don't feel like a loser every day. I do care.

I've been unemployed for a little over 6 months, but due to various things have only been looking since January 1st. (The other time was spent on worthwhile, time-consuming things that were not paid employment. I wasn't just sitting around). So it's been a little over 2 months. Not that long. But I'm drowning here. 

My attempts at structure are failing. My bipolar is currently under-medicated, but I have an appointment today to add some more stuff in. I have no therapy or access to therapy, currently. My husband has a low income. Money is fine in the short term (maybe 2 months) but I need work ASAP for both money and for personal satisfaction. There's a lot of pressure, guilt, blame, self-hatred, insecurity etc. in my mind that's making this whole thing harder than it needs to be. Being unemployed is hard for anyone. But for people with mental illness, it's harder, probably.

I'm not looking for practical job search advice like ""apply for more jobs"" or ""volunteer"" or ""take part time work"" or ""fix your resume"" or ""go back to school"" or ""go work out every day"" etc. I know I should be doing those things! I can't. It is a massive struggle to brush my teeth and take a shower every day. What I'm looking for is more along the lines of ""I had the same issues, here's what actually helped me on a day-to-day basis."" Or ""I had the same issues, it sucks."" Maybe I don't want advice. It'd be nice to know I'm not alone in feeling this way, and being unemployed but wanting to and feeling able to work. 

**Kind of a tl;dr: Are there any good self-soothing ways that help with the self-esteem crush from being unemployed? Did you find that pushing yourself harder or cutting yourself some slack helped more? How did you avoid feeling like crap? How did you keep pushing ahead in the face of rejection and failure? How did you focus and follow through on half-started applications? How did you make decisions on what to apply for and avoid feeling overwhelmed? Or, how did you pick which small projects to earn spare cash? Decision-making is so hard. How did you spend each day? Anyone have trouble with career direction stuff? Also...if there's any expats in the same boat as me, please PM me, I'd love to have someone to talk to who's in the same situation.**

E- formatting

E2 - also I keep lying to friends and family about how miserable I am, because they are all ""you're in [foreign country] with your husband you must be sooooo happy!"" I would prefer to keep that illusion than admit to being a failure. So I say yeah it's great, I'm having so much fun, I work super hard on finding a job and submit applications every day. Can anyone relate?

I'm a sophomore in college that have been reading alot of the posts here, and a recurring theme in here seems to be that I should NEVER be comfortable.  Period.  I should always be taking risks, because they force personal growth, and if I ever get comfortable I'll be unemployable and layed off.

I've been a chicken my whole life and I have a VERY, VERY risk averse personality.  I have ALOT of anxiety issues as well with stress.  For example I got accepted into a top 3 CS school and rejected it for a local CS program because I had Aspies and at the time of graduating high school my life skills definitely weren't good enough to survive alone in a dorm (from personal experience), and (more importantly) if I went to school locally I would graduate with ZERO debt thanks to a really good scholarship.  My life skills have definitely improved since then (hopefully since I have to live in a dorm for my summer internship) and I still feel like this was the right decision given my case, but I'm starting to feel like in this field this kind of thinking is not sustainable- I have to be challenging myself to do things I have no idea how to get done to force improvement- constantly- or I'll be unemployable at 40!

I like reading CS blogs and learning new languages occasionally in my spare time (I'm learning .NET framework right now to prepare for my internship), and I (very) actively participate in all of my school's CS-related clubs.  I also have a decent portfolio of personal projects and I'm thinking about adding a personal website to it.

As a sophomore is there anything else I should/could be doing?  I hope one day of making it into a ""Big 4"" company like Microsoft and Google, or at least any large company whose core product is software.  Is it OK if I go ""slow and steady"", focusing on learning one thing at a time and on my school extracurriculars as well as class or should I be living fast and hard?  Are there successful people in software who made it without zig-zagging?  I've seen enough action movies and anime to know that a ""fast and furious"" life is not for me; I NEED my comfort zone...

And lastly failing that how can I get out of my comfort zone and task risks a bit more easily?  I take failure VERY personally (I guess this came from the strictness of Asian parents plus my complete lack of self-esteem).  Every time I play video games I only touch the easiest settings and immediately uninstall them the moment they get too hard, or if they don't have difficulty settings (Dark Souls, for example).  I'll probably end up taking the same approach to life as well...

Thanks for your thoughts!"

Unfortunately I didn't get the position as I don't have many extra curriculars and my resume was quite bare. Working close to 30 hour's and going to school full time makes it hard. Needless to say, Kids of those who work in adminstration got the internship offered. 

I am in my senior year and I've already sent out my resume and applied to a ton of places. I don't want to leave this rock unturned, should I go ahead and ask the VP in there are internships available or go through HR? What would you do, since it is so late into the year. 

Btw they DONT post these internships anywhere, publicly or internally yet we always have these interns appearing.

Any input or experience would be appreciated. "
49qjay,3,2016-03-09,[DIPLOMACY]{S} A phone call,Verbluffen,worldroleplay,https://www.reddit.com/r/worldroleplay/comments/49qjay/diplomacys_a_phone_call/,"President Alexander Lukashenko looks out the window. It's been a long day. He had been stuck in the office since morning, poring over documents and various news clippings.

His plans for economic reform were going well, so far. Minor growth in the Belarusian economy plus the new population influx helped contribute to rising quality of life. There was still a long way to go. He had planned for Belarus to maintain an inward focus for the next few years, but recent events put a wrench in that plan.

His head rested in his hands. He was exasperated, frustrated and exhausted. He didn't want to do this, but he knew he had to.

EU sanctions had been lifted last year. Trade resumed between Belarus and the West. The nation was able to get the benefits of both worlds, while maintaining allegiance to Russia.

He had stood by Vladimir Putin in 2008, when he invaded Georgia to support Abkhazian and Ossetian rebels. But he had always had doubts about Russian aggressive expansion. The invasion of Ukraine only served to underline it. He publicly stated his concerns for Ukrainian territorial integrity, but he knew that he had to stick with Putin, or else many worse things could come.

The annexation of Georgia was the last straw. The international community was already enraged after Ukraine, but this latest action only reminded Alexander of the cold war days, when the Soviet Union freely invaded Czechoslovakia and Afghanistan.

Alexander knew that if he put Belarus' support fully behind Putin, there would be more sanctions from the West. He had hoped to remain neutral in this, but Russia came knocking for support, and likewise, the West put minor pressure on him, threatening harsher trade sanctions than the ones previously in place.

It was time for him to pick a side, and it was not an easy choice.

He held down a button on his desk and paged his secretary.

""Misha,"" he said. ""Put me on the line with Vladimir.""

""Makei? Semashko?""

""Putin.""

""Right away.""

The phone rang for a couple seconds until the call was received. There might have been some sort of intern on the other end who would tell Alexander to hold his call, but he didn't care. As soon as someone picked up, he spoke.

""Vladimir,"" he said quickly. ""We need to talk."""
49qpkp,3,2016-03-09,Missing the girl who had time for me,Drum127,ExNoContact,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExNoContact/comments/49qpkp/missing_the_girl_who_had_time_for_me/,"When I was finishing up my Junior year of high school, a friend introduced me to who is now my ex. She was a freshman, super shy, but so was I and I figured I could at least text her and see what she was like.

We kind of hit it off and went to the movies after the school year had ended. For some dumb reasons we didn't make contact again until November of my senior year. 

We started talking again. I was a senior and she was a sophomore now. Our ""second first date"" was at an ice rink. I still remember nervously holding her hand and finally kissing her for the first time as I dropped her back off home. It was a rush of excitement I had never felt before. I asked her out officially on December 5th, 2013.

Before I knew it we saw eachother every day and hung out at either one of our houses probably 2-3 days a week. We probably saw eachother twice a weekend at least too.

I knew I felt something for her but I wasn't entirely sure and didn't want to hurt her. She told me she loved me once, about 1.5 months into the relationship but I was unsure.

Feeling stressed and anxious about the future and having a girlfriend I wasn't confident about, I dumped her on January 28th, 2014.

In the days afterwards I thought about what I had done and thought that it didn't feel right at all. This girl was special. After a long text message, some more long letters, tulips, and more, I had won her back in about 4 or 5 days. I confessed that I loved her and I really, really did. She loved me too.

That spring and summer was probably the best days of my entire life. I helped her overcome a lot of her depression and anxiety and I saw such an improvement. It was amazing to see this girl that I loved become happier by my side. I imagined us getting along like this, getting stronger and being there for each other. We would always exchange long letters for any occasion (month anniversaries, Valentine's day, birthdays, etc.) and overall it was just wonderful.

On my graduation night, after dinner with my family, she had me drive to a secluded spot near our house and we made out (among other things...). I thought it was one of the best days of my life and I still do. It was also my 18th birthday!

I went to college in the fall and I felt the love still and nothing had changed. I came back home every weekend (I lived 30 minutes away and campus was absolutely dead on the weekends) and it was wonderful still. 

I came home for winter break and we did so much. We saw each other so often and we went to New York for our 1 year anniversary. I loved it and it felt so natural and amazing.

Because of the crappy campus life, I transferred to the bigger state school in spring of 2015, about an hour away. I wanted to party and have fun during the weekends and not regret my college experience. I came home probably every 3 weeks to see her.

I loved my new college after a period of loneliness and made friends. It was amazing. I would have fun at college while I was there and then I would go home to an amazing girl who loved me so much.

Last summer, 2015, she got a job and I was working a 40 hour internship that I had since graduating from high school. This is when things got hard. She was always busy and we hung out when we could. She called me, crying, early in the summer and complained that I didn't show much affection when we were with each other. I agreed...I was starting to get complacent and I wish I fixed it but I really failed.

In July, she, my parents and I took a vacation in San Francisco to see my brothers that live out there. It was wonderful, and I will never forget it. I'll never forget walking through the city streets with her and I imagined our future and how it could be.

Once we returned home, we tried to see each other as much as possible. Sometimes she was busy with her high school friends when I tried to hang out, which I understood, but after a while it started to hurt. Not seeing her during the week when we live 7 minutes apart was really, really frustrating. I wrote like a 6 or 7 page letter in which I was breaking up with her when August started. I invited her over and sat her down but I couldn't do it. I was convinced the lack of contact wasn't her fault. She was often working when I got off of work and I was at work from 8 till 4, effectively blocking off the whole day for the both of us. Typing this now hurts so much and I wish we could've negotiated time. Maybe she should've done a better job of making time for me if she really cared. Maybe she didn't think I cared so she didn't try.

As I went back to school for this past fall things just got harder and harder. My visits, while still occurring every three weeks, were accompanied by a girl exhausted by school, work, sports, and all kinds of honors societies and clubs. We would get dinner, go to my house or her house, then she'd fall asleep within two hours. After her homecoming dance, she recommended I take some time to see what I wanted from the relationship. I honestly did not show my love for her at the dance as I hate dancing and dumb shit like that. I wish it never came to this but it did. I told her I loved her so much and I'd try harder. But I never got the chance.

She stayed busy. I stayed with her because I had hoped it would get better. I hoped she would find a way to make more time in the near future.

The semester ended and I came home this winter for break. Honestly I think I saw her about 7 or 8 times over the 6 weeks I was home. I just kept holding on, pretty much afraid to be alone at this point but I still had hope and I still loved her. My parents were growing suspicious and questioned why I never saw my girlfriend of 2 years. I just kept denying everything. Once, I asked if I could ride with her to pick up her sister from track practice. She kinda shrugged it off. I asked if I could spend the night about 3 nights before I went back to college. She said she was gonna watch movies with her sisters. I was scared. So scared. But I didn't bring it up and was holding on and hoping.

Things got quiet between us. She would mock everything I said for being ""negative."" Simple jokes weren't okay. We'd go get food and eat almost in silence; I felt like I had to start every conversation. Intimacy became really rare. Before I went back for school I told her how I was feeling and how there was distance between us. I asked if she wanted to keep going with this and she said she did. 

The first time I came home this semester was Valentine's Day weekend. I thought it went perfectly. The whole week beforehand she was saying how much she loved me and was so excited for me to come home. I was excited too. The words flowed like they did 8 months ago. We started a movie on the couch and it got relocated to the bedroom and I felt as if this was a fresh start, a means to get back to the love we had for so long.

Out of the blue two weeks ago, she asked what I'd be doing that Friday, since she was visiting campus to see her cousin. Not to see me, to see her cousin. It's as if I was an afterthought. I was hurt by this, but again, I didn't tell her. She ended up not being able to come.

I had planned to come home to see her again on March 5th, our 27 months anniversary. She really didn't seem excited at all when we were texting last week. Texts came sporadically or not at all. I went to a concert with my friend on Wednesday night and  she said she felt really bad for not texting and asked if she could call. I told her no, as it would've been impossible to hear her. I'm still kicking myself for not taking that call.

I came home Saturday evening as she got off work at 7. On my way over I said I was getting food and asked if I could bring it over. She asked if I'd rather eat it at home the come over. At this point I knew I was fucked. The second I walked in the door she started bawling and hugged me. She sat me down, and said the words I never could've imagined would've come out of her mouth.

“I think we should break up,” she said through hyperventilation and sobbing and tears.

She went on to tell me that the relationship had changed and she felt really really guilty for not being able hang out or see me. She also said that she just needed some time to find out who she was. I told her I said that was okay, after all, I did the same thing when I was a senior.

These last 4 days have been the worst in my life. I went back to college Monday. I was crying all day long and felt that I was in a nightmare and I came back home to be with my parents on Monday night. I just wanted to feel safe and loved. The last two days haven’t been easier but I’ve been putting things together slowly.

I’ve realized that the girl I am crying for is not the girl I have been in a relationship with for the past few months. I have been crying for our first year, when she had ample free time to handle school, friends, and me in appropriate amounts.

When she started working and got more involved in school, I fell down on the priority list. She put her friends ahead of me, even when I came home once every few weeks. I was just clinging onto someone who didn’t have the time for me. She still loved me but she couldn’t sacrifice other things for me. And then she dumped me because of it. I guess it would’ve gotten worse and worse because I couldn’t break up with her again.

I hope you all have found strength and it’s really a roller coaster for me right now. On one hand, I can’t wait to be free of thoughts for her. On the other hand, if she said she was sorry and she really wanted to be with me and she’d spend an appropriate amount of time with me, I’d really like that. Just wanted to get my thoughts out."

I've been thinking about spending 15k, and investing the other 35k in an IRA type program.  I'm not set on spending that amount, but it seems like a solid number, and purchasing a car may be a necessity for this summer.

I'm just about to graduate with a bachelors is business, and have a promising 3 month internship this coming summer which will hopefully lead to full-time.  That said, I'm not counting my chickens before they hatch.

I got it down to 17k (or $180 monthly payment for 10 years) using my savings from working while in school. From graduation to present I've had a minimum wage job making a sad 14k annually. All this has left me with about 9k in savings at the moment. Fortunately I've been able to live with my parents so I'm not paying rent and don't have any other debt besides the student debt. However, there's a chance I'll be moving soon to live with my SO where I would pay rent. There's also a chance I'll be leaving my job for a potentially unpaid seasonal internship.

My grandpa recently mentioned that if I start a traditional IRA within the next month and contribute $1000 to 2015, I'll get an extra $120 back on my tax returns. Should I go for it?"

I'm a computer scientist from Chicago. My story in love isn't what you'd call average. About 7 months ago I was engaged. The woman I was engaged to was very very good looking, however very emotionally reserved - to the point where she would forget my birthdays and almost neglect me as a partner. I'm a fairly wealthy guy, I work from home and am constantly coding/on conference calls so I need food prepared for me, so I hired a chef. Her name's Gabby and she makes amazing food, she's also insanely beautiful and the sweetest character I've ever met. We get on really well, talking to her just feels like a breath of fresh air everyday. Oh and about 2 weeks after meeting each other we got drunk and slept together. We both went crazy but agreed to forget and move on. I had an intern from China come in and her and him seemed to hit it off, so I relaxed and focused on my engagement. I felt horrendously guilty. However as time progressed I found myself jealous of the flirtatious exchanges between Gabby and my intern. I tried to think nothing of it interact the best I could with my fiancee. I got nothing. It's almost as if her attraction to me was gone. I talked to her about it and she seemed mildly sympathetic and said she'd change, so I became hopeful. About a week later I received an hand sown pillow, identical to the one my nana had owned (she passed away a month earlier and it had been getting me down a lot). I assumed this was a present from my fiancee. She was confused, she hadn't done it. I found from my PA that it was from Gabby and that she had feelings for me. At that moment I knew that she was the one. So I called off the engagement, my finacee moved out and went over to Gabby's apartment to confess my love for her only to find her with my intern getting cosy on the couch. They told me the 'great news' at that point that she would go back with him to China for a 6 week vacation - they also decided to become a couple. I was completely distraught. Gabby and my intern came back from China and I tried my best to forget about any feelings I had for her. Now she was in a relationship, I didn't want to interfere. However my gut told me I had to at least tell her what happened and how I felt, so I did. I couldn't keep it all from her. She was angry. So was my intern of course. It was an awkward situation. It was evidently the wrong move. However from that point she felt conflicting emotions. Her boyfriend's response to the whole situation was pretty vile, but they're still together. I'm going crazy. I see her everyday but it's so awkward. Her roommate tells me that she is having conflicting emotions but I'm not even sure what to do. Any advise would be greatly appreciated guys.

**tl;dr**: Was engaged, called it off because I fell in love with my chef, who also seems to have had feelings for me - but because I was engaged got with my intern, found out I now have feelings for her and is angry. "
49rksa,13,2016-03-09,(AUS) Is there a safe way to make an international transaction with protection if it's a fraud?,plsgimmehalp,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/49rksa/aus_is_there_a_safe_way_to_make_an_international/,"Hello,

I am a 22 year old female going to undertake an internship in Geneva, and am trying to find housing. I have found a room in a house, and the housemate who has the lease in their name wants me to transfer them 1000 francs as a security deposit. I have this person on Facebook, and we skyped. During this conversation, this is when they advised me of this. I said I was not comfortable doing this, and offered to give them a scanned copy of my passport, a letter confirming me moving in on specific dates, and 200 francs, which in the event I did not show up, they could retain. I'm yet to hear back about this offer.

This place is perfect for me, and all other signs lead to it being legit. As I have no rental experience, as I live at home in Australia, I was wondering if there was a ""safe"" way to potentially transfer this deposit amount, so in the event that it was a scam, the amount could be refunded to me? Paypal would not cover it. 

Note: I have asked for a copy of her lease to be emailed to me, so I can verify that this is the required lease amount, and the rent she is asking of me is fair.

Any thoughts/comments/suggestions would be hugely appreciated!

However I made a rather stupid mistake by confusing a co-op/semester internship with a summer one, so now I am thus on the hunt again.

After browsing this subreddit, it would seem that a lot of you have had success finding internships even at this time, so I'm interested in hearing your tips for success. I've applied to a good number of places already, but for the most part have been unlucky (managed to reach the phone interview stage for Amazon but I got fucked up after :/). 

So some notes:

1. I am currently a junior, and admittedly I don't have as much work experience as I would like. I am a TA for one of my university's CS courses, and I did a pseudo-internship (it was in a university out-of-country and it was at their CS department so not really industry but it was CS-related, so hence pseudo), but otherwise that's about it for relevant work experience.
2. I have a decent amount of projects, both school-related and out-of-school, and have them on my Github. I also have a personal website (albeit not too fancy) that contains somewhat similar information.
3. I've tried to take advantage of my school's career website, and have also been using LinkedIn, AngelList, Indeed, and LookSharp. Any other useful resources would be great!

At this point, what are some small things I could do to help improve my chances? Any resume tricks (things to include or not)? What are some key factors that most companies look for that I should have? I'm not desperate yet, but my mistake has obviously cost me more than I would like.

Edit: A lot of you guys suggested start-ups, which I am more than excited to work for. How did you guys find out about the start-ups in your region? I live in NJ, but I am willing to relocate if I have to."

I have a phone interview which is the 1st step of the process tomorrow. It's for a semiconductor industry called Micron. I am interested in the internship, but I am very nervous. I was told it would be a technical interview, where the focus will be towards low level programming such as C++, also scripting languages, a bit of hardware (micro,logic gates, digital systems)

I'm really nervous because I feel like my level of knowledge is shit and I really want/need this position. I don't remember a lot of what I learned. Has anyone else ever felt like this? Do you have any tips? How much do I really need to know as an intern? 

should I use notes during the phone interview?"

I've been considering going to grad school since highschool. But I'm currently a sophomore and have no experience in either research or industry. However, I was luckily accepted into an REU concerning research in topics I feel passionate about within my major. Just some background stats about me: 



* Major: Computer Science

* GPA: 3.6/40


* School: Top 30 for CS

* Experience: REU will be first experience in cs for me. 


* Research Interest: Security


Not sure what else to really say about me. I'm not really the type of person to decide on something prior to having to. But I feel like if I end up wanting to go to grad school I'd have to prepare somewhat. I don't have strong relationships with any professors for letter of recs- but that might be due to large class sizes and not getting involved in research at my home university. 

Would it even seem like I'm on track to being a good candidate? I always imagine grad students being top of their class students- and the schools I'd like to get into are somewhat competitive: University of Texas, University of Minnesota, University of Washington, etc. 


Does anyone have general advice or anything they can tell me based on this post? I'm not sure if I want to go to grad school and I'm not sure I have what it takes. I truly enjoy learning and being in school- but the cost might be a problem (I will have moderately high debt after undergrad which might make grad school a hard financial decision) and I don't have internship experience so I don't know if I would want to move onto industry after graduating. I know I can aim for an internship next year but its not guaranteed and there's the possibility of me just having a bad experience at it. 


So yeah, any thoughts? Sorry if this is all over the place. "

I'm a freshman in college, and i've been following the advice on this subreddit including editing my resume, getting programming experience, etc. It seems after 3 months (I've been starting applications since January), I still haven't had luck in landing an internship even after applying to mostly startups. I have received some rejection letters, or filled positions, but no luck in even landing an interview. I'm based in the San Francisco Bay area, where theres supposedly a lot of opportunity. Is there anything I can do to increase my odds of landing an internship or make my summer a productive one?"

My question is, should I do a summer internship and graduate a semester-year later or just go ahead and finish up then look for a full time job?

49t30m,1,2016-03-10,"Seeking advice: Looking at better internship while currently employed, but worried about risking my current job.",ispamucry,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/49t30m/seeking_advice_looking_at_better_internship_while/,"Quick history- I'm currently in my third year of my CS bachelor's, interning 30hrs/week part time. I've been at said internship about 4 months, but it has some significant pros and cons: 

On the good side, it's year-round, and in town (most internships are another 30-45 min away in a larger city). Because I have to pay for living expenses, I have to work year-round, so the fact that I can intern in-town to pay the bills is a big, unique plus. The work I'm doing is actually pretty decent development experience too, and it will look good to have a year and a half of actual development on my resume when I graduate. On the bad side, I get paid absolute shit as an intern ($12.00/hr, typical CS internships pay $15-$18/hr in my area). The company also works with web-based applications, which isn't exactly my desired CS field.

So my problem is this: I'm trying to figure out some way I can do a summer internship with a different company over the summer, *without* losing my current internship. This would require me to significantly cut back my hours during the summer, down to 15-20 from around 30, or take a complete leave of absence, both of which I think will raise suspicions. I expect this would lead to one of two things, either:

1.) They will want to keep me and assuming they're able, offer me more to compete with the significantly better pay from other summer internships (which would also be acceptable), or

2.) They will see me as a unreliable asset and start looking to replace me once they have the chance, leaving me looking for something to pay bills and likely no longer programming as my regular job.


I feel like I'm being taken advantage of and, to an extent, wasting my time working here, but I also don't know of anywhere else I can work year-round and get software development experience either. 

If anyone has any ideas or advice they'd be willing to impart, especially those with experience, I'd really appreciate your input. Thank you."
49td5t,66,2016-03-10,Prime Riba is back (and intruding on my visit with FH)!,DILPickles432,JUSTNOMIL,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/49td5t/prime_riba_is_back_and_intruding_on_my_visit_with/,"In my first post, I introduced you to my FMIL, who will now be known as Prime Riba.  That was my first encounter with her and I wish that her trying to order for me in restaurants was as bad as it got.  It’s been six years and things have only gotten weirder and worse.


A few years ago, my FH and I were living across the country after we graduated because he had gotten a 2-year internship in a research lab and I had the option of doing graduate school online so moving wasn’t an issue.  However, after about a year, we found that we were drowning financially and I was drowning emotionally.  I hated it there.  We thought I was homesick at first, but I never got over it and fell into a deep depression.  We decided to move me home to my parents and do the whole long distance thing for the remaining year of his internship.


It was incredibly difficult, but we set up a schedule of visits so that we would see each other every few months.  I left in June and planned to fly back for three weeks at the end of August.  The tickets were all in place before I even moved out.  This is important.  I planned my visit months in advance.


When August finally came, I couldn’t be more excited.  We had three whole weeks together and lots of fun things planned.  Little did I know that Riba also had some plans for us.  We had one week that went totally fine.  However, my FH informed me that Riba had recently informed him that she would be coming to visit during the second week of my stay.  All I could think was why now?  She had never once visited us the entire year we were there.  In fact, in all three years that FH and I had been dating by then, she had never come to visit us ever, no matter where we were living (well, to be fair, she did come to the graduation party that my parents threw for FH and I, so there’s that).  So she chooses now, during the three week break we get from the hell that is a long distance relationship, to come visit.  I couldn’t fucking believe it.  And to top it off, she’s decided she’s staying at our place.  Not only do we have nowhere for her to sleep, we don’t even have anywhere for her to sit.  We were so broke, we never bought any chairs or couches and just sat on the floor or used our desk chairs (and mine was obviously gone because I took it when I moved out).  We are in no way equipped to host guests.  Oh, and my FH has no idea how long she plans to stay.  Lovely.


When she gets there, everything shifts and must revolve around her.  She arrives on a Tuesday and then makes a fuss about how FH is working all week.  Yes, obviously.  That’s why he’s here in the first place.  He’s the manager of a research lab.  And she gave him no notice that she was coming – she literally told him the week I arrived which was about 6 days before she came.  He’d already taken off some time to do things with me and couldn’t take off any more days.  I knew this and planned accordingly.  Some days I went into the office with him and brought work to do at the extra desk he had.  Other days I spent tending to the house - cleaning, shopping and cooking – anything I could do to make the house more “home-y” and less “bachelor pad” because I knew he missed how it felt to come home to someone.  Riba just wanted to be catered to and entertained.  She’s so thoughtful like that.


Lucky for Riba, I was there during her visit, and didn’t have to work!  I had no excuses for not spending my entire day doing whatever she wanted!  Yay me!  Thankfully FH was not okay with her using me this way and refused to condemn me to this fate.  He pulled some strings and some favors and worked some terribly early hours so that he was free at 1pm every day but one.  I told FH that I could handle one day on my own with her and it didn’t end up being too bad.  Well, not too bad for her.


It started off weird because as I was getting ready, I noticed she wasn’t.  I didn’t care what time we left, we didn’t have reservations or anything, so I when I was done, I just told her we could leave whenever she was ready.  She tells me she is ready.  My face must have shown my surprise because she quickly asks if I’m okay with how she looks.  I tell her yes, of course, because how the fuck else do you answer a question like that?  Let me paint the picture for you – she woke up, and then told me she was ready.  She was in pajamas – a long Minions shirt and pajama pants.  Her hair wasn’t brushed and neither were her teeth.  She also hadn’t showered in at least three days.  I didn’t realize this until she asked me for a towel the next day – the fourth day of her stay.  Before that I assumed she had gotten a towel from FH, but he confirmed he never gave her one.  She did actually make a comment about how weird it was that I showered every day, and asked if I was just a really greasy person.  Uhhhh . . . no I don’t think so?  I guess I’m just a freak that likes to shower?


So she’s dressed like your typical Walmart shopper who is also homeless.  Whatever, I look cute, so we leave.  We went shopping, ate lunch, she bought me stuff - some of it good, some of it weird clothes and children’s toys from the clearance section at Walgreens (“It’s such a good deal!”).  It’s actually not too bad hanging out with her.  Riba really likes me, which is good.  Although she does bring up marriage and how we weren’t engaged yet and why hasn’t FH proposed, there must be something wrong, what did I do to make him think I won’t marry him?  I tell her everything’s fine, we’ve discussed it, it’s just terrible timing right now since we’re living on opposite sides of the country and long distance is hard enough and we don’t know where we’ll be living after the year is up until we know where FH gets accepted into a PhD program.  By the way, those aren’t good reasons.  In case you were wondering, we should’ve been planning a wedding already, according to Riba.  Whatever.


I think the thing that bothered me the most about Riba’s stay was that she kept saying and doing things that implied I had intruded on her trip, not the other way around.  FH told her when she got there that she could only stay four nights maximum, that he had things planned with me.  She responds with, “Well, that’s fine, I don’t want to be a third wheel.  Of course, I wanted to stay longer because I don’t see you often and I miss you.  I was hoping we’d have a week or two just the two of us, but since DILPickles decided to come visit while I’m here, I guess I’ll have to cut it short.”  Excuse me?!?  I didn’t just show up out of nowhere during some mother-son bonding trip!  You interrupted MY time with FH, something he’s been looking forward to for months (whereas he usually dreads spending time with you)!  FH actually can’t stand more than 24 hours alone with you without getting into screaming fights over everything!  No way he would’ve lasted even four days if I wasn’t here as a buffer.  So you’re welcome you crazy bitch!


While we were visiting FH’s lab and he was introducing Riba to everyone he worked with, she went too far.  One of FH’s coworkers and friends, Rachel, mentioned that she was having a girls only movie night with some of her friends when I asked her what she had been up to lately.  She was one of the handful of people I had met and occasionally hung out with when I lived there, but I was only friends with her through FH and had never hung out with her without him.  Riba jumps on this with, “How perfect!  DILPickles would love to watch movies with you, and FH and I can FINALLY spend some quality time together!  How early can we drop her off?”  Cue awkward silence.  It was obviously not meant to be an invitation but Rachel was a really nice person and I could tell she was sincere when she responded that I was more than welcome to join them.  I’m kind of just stunned, say that it sounded fun, and look to FH for help.  He tells everyone we’ll see, we hadn’t planned on that, but maybe.  Then privately, he asks me what I think.  I’m conflicted, it would be fine hanging out with Rachel (and complete strangers) if he did want to spend time with Riba alone.  I had certainly had enough of Riba’s bullshit and would welcome the break.  But at the same time, I flew all this way to spend precious time with him, not Rachel or anyone else.  With some more insistence from Riba, we decide to ahead with it, and call Rachel to let her know I’m coming.  When I’m getting ready to head out the door, however, Riba decides she is tired and just wants to spend the rest of the evening resting alone.  It’s 5pm.  So much for dinner and bonding time with FH.  Now there is no reason for me to go and leave FH all alone all night, so we call Rachel back last minute to let her know, I won’t be coming.


FH and I were both so relieved when she left!  She’s just so weird and exhausting to be around.  She also left the place a mess – went through all the cupboards pulling things out at random, left a bunch of dirty dishes (even though she insisted we go out for every meal) and spilled whole containers of sugar and salt all over the floor, counter, and stove top (and left it).  I still have no idea what the hell she was doing, or why she thought it was normal to do this as a guest in someone’s house.



TLDR: FH and I spent a year apart in a long distance relationship, only seeing each other every few months.  During one of few trips I was able to go see him, Riba decides last minute that she too must visit FH during this exact time frame.  Good times are had by all! . . . except not really.

I've got a call with a realtor later today to discuss, but I wanted to hear what you all had to say!

Both of us will be working, I'll be making 56k and her 41k. Put together, we have about 7k in savings right now and hope to have north of 10k by this upcoming July.

I'm wondering if there are any people (especially recruiters/employees from well established west coast companies) who have an opinion of what track would be better?
I've heard that Business Intelligence is a super marketable skill but i wonder if only having 1 internship experience prior to graduation will hurt me. (I decided on the majors late and spent last summer back packing).
Thanks for the feedback"
49twyu,3,2016-03-10,Will an internship as the position 'Data Scientist Intern' at a startup help me land a full time 'Data Scientist' job?,Ande_Ka_Funda,datascience,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/49twyu/will_an_internship_as_the_position_data_scientist/,"Hi

I'm currently doing my Master's in Computer Science at a decent university. I'm at my second semester. I have in my hand two internship offers:

1) Data Scientist Intern at a start-up with a pay of 30/hr in an ok city

2) Software Developer Intern at a big company with a pay of 35/hr in California

I have been working as a SE for the past 5 years, and my main goal to do higher study was to change my stream. I don't want to be a SE anymore.

I do want to land a job as a 'Data Scientist' when I graduate. Given the two internship offers, the first one looks like a better  fit for that goal. But I will be taking a Pay-cut and lose out 'Brand Recognition' to put on my resume.

But on the other hand, the role is perfect and the work they do (Hadoop, Spark, Targeting Advertisement ) seems way more fun than writing code in C++.

So my question is, is taking the paycut and brand-name worth it in the longer run?"

He wants to go on an internship in a different country for 4 months, and I'm really afraid of doing long distance.

I""m also scared that he will land a full time job not close to where I'm going to school.

All in all, I'm scared of what's to come after he graduates. We've talked about still dating after he graduates and he always says ""we'll deal with it when it comes"" and that doesn't really make me feel secure.

I told him about a month ago that I felt as if I wasn't sure if he was in it for the long term and all this other stuff because some of the things he said to me. He told me that he didn't want to scare me by talking about marriage and what not, and that he definitely is not looking for the relationship to end.. However he said that if he had to make the decision between choosing me and staying here and getting a great job in the bay area he isn't sure yet, and at this stage in the relationship it's definitely something he has to make the decision on. He said as our relationship progresses things could change. 

What should I do, should I talk to him about it or am I simply being too paranoid and should just be living in the moment?

TL;DR: boyfriend graduating before me. i'm scared of him not being close to me and what's going to happen to us after he graduates. should i talk to him about this or am i being too paranoid?"

Or would it be better to graduate and then try to pick up the CS concepts?

 As of now I have been practicing doing Hackerrank exercises and have set up a bunch of webpages using wordpress for local businesses , nothing too complicated, what would you consider the best course of action in order to maximize my chances of being hired as a software engineer in a top company when I graduate?

To be as honest as possible, I would want to do whatever would set me up better for my future software development career. In terms of interest, I would want to do the research, since it would be especially relevant to my interests in NLP. However, it wouldn't be paid, and would more be volunteer work than anything really formal. The startup offers would be in mobile development, which I wouldn't mind doing. Also it would pay which is always nice.

So my question is, what would be the best for my resume for that junior year big 4 internship? I'm also still applying to other internships for more established companies, so that would be a third option (but i want to have something set by the end of March)."

* What date are you looking to leave/start subletting?
* Will you have cleaned out the apartment/cleaned in general, before I move in?
* What rate are you looking for (this is the main point I want to ask about, obviously I want to get the best deal possible).

49uhsg,124,2016-03-10,The night I avoided being sold into a gay sex ring and/or gang banged without consent.,UGG59,confession,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/49uhsg/the_night_i_avoided_being_sold_into_a_gay_sex/,"It was summer 2013 and I had landed an internship with a high profile ad agency in Atlanta. Being from a small town in Kentucky where being gay was taboo, the idea of living in a sprawling metropolis was rather alluring. A new haven with no connection to home; I could finally be myself, openly. Picking up men turned out to be a cake walk for a guy like me. My country accent, facial hair and frat-boy attitude made me a prize to be won in the gay realm. This was a new world for me, one that I desperately needed to experience for the sake of my sanity. 


Back at college, under poorly painted banners and black lights, I was a ghost among living men and women whose bodies pulsed for each other during the nightly revel. I deeply envied my brothers and their freedom to act as competitors in an exhilarating sexual arena which, in doing so, came at no cost to their societal status. Be assured, my jealously of women ran just as deep.  I resented everyone, equally.  Anyone who noticed my lack of participation likely assumed I had no ""game.”  They had no idea. I was equally good at the ""game"" - I just played on a different court.



One night, I received a message on an app called Grindr. At the time, it seemed promising. His pictures showed a tall, muscular guy with auburn hair, mid to late 20's. I was actually kind of worried that he was out of my league. Of course, that only made me more interested. The messages I received were hard to ignore. ""Hey man, you should come over. It's just me and a few bros in the hot tub looking to have some fun."" I'll admit, the messages seemed a little too good to be true. BUT, maybe they weren't? My ""maybe this is real"" attitude caused me to just go with it. Bad decision on my part!



The mystery bro sent me his address and I got up out of bed and prepared for the night of my life. I was sharing a one bedroom apartment in Midtown with a girl from school and gave her the address just in case I ended up missing. I eventually made my way into Buckhead, a very upscale area in north Atlanta where he lived. It was so strange driving through Atlanta with absolutely no traffic. (It was Sunday night.) It was as if the city had been deserted; a perfect setting for the night I was about to have. As I closed in on the address, the city quickly faded away as it was replaced by woods. I didn't like this at all. I assumed his house wouldn't be so off the beaten path. Unfortunately, this didn't stop me.


As the road became narrow and the city lights more dim, I crossed a bridge just as he had described. A few moments later, I found myself at the entrance to a very wealthy neighborhood tucked away in the Georgia pines. I called him, asked for the pass code, and made my way to his house, which was more like a mansion if you ask me. I knocked on the door and the man who answered was not the man I saw on Grindr. He was tall, slender and wearing a dirty ball cap. Not bad looking, but definitely not who I was expecting to meet. This was red flag number one.  



We sat down on the couch and I couldn't help but ask how a guy in his late twenties owned a Georgia mansion with a custom waterfall in the backyard. He never gave me a straight answer, only that he worked in the ""marketing industry."" This was my second red flag. Marketing is not a profession known to make people rich so very quickly. After telling him I was studying advertising, he changed the subject very quickly. (As if he knew I had assumed ""marketing"" wouldn't have gotten him this lifestyle.) He walked over to the kitchen counter (marble of course) and insisted I have a drink with him. I was getting leery at this point. His back was turned as he mixed up the drinks, so when he brought them over I refused as politely as I could. After refusing the drink, his attitude seemed to change. He became very short and seemed agitated with me. Third red flag.

He walked over to me and grabbed me by the face and gave me a forceful kiss. He whispered into my ear, ""I'm going to give you a fucking you'll never forget. You'll beg me to stop."" I pulled away and laughed. I wasn't about to show him that I was worried. He sat back down and with a face ever so smug, asked if he could invite some friends over to help him break me in. I began to get smart with him and explained that I was not into group sex, especially if I was going to be the taker/bottom. ""I need to use the restroom, be right back"" he said as he disappeared into a dark hallway. As I sat there alone, I couldn't help but think about how stupid I felt for being cat-fished by this asshole. I got up and walked quietly toward the hallway. At the end of the hallway was the bathroom, light on and door closed, just as I expected. But, something wasn't right. 

The facet was running hard, and I could hear him talking on the phone. ""Why would he be running the facet and quietly talking on the phone"" I thought to myself. This was the last straw. His picture didn't match, he refused to give me any clear answers about his life, he was angry that I refused his drink, and NOW he was secretly talking on the phone. I yelled ""hey I'm gonna head out!"" He yelled back, ""okay then."" I walked out in a hurry and kept my eyes peeled for anyone waiting to jump me. I got in my old jeep and sped off. I had never felt so relieved in my life. I got about halfway back to midtown and reached in my pocket for my phone. My heart dropped. My phone wasn't in my pocket. I HAD LEFT MY PHONE AT HIS HOUSE. I screamed at the top of my lungs, stomping my feet and punching my steering wheel. ""FUCK, FUCK, FUCK!"" I shouted. Moments later, I pulled myself together and turned the jeep around. 

I'll be honest, I'm kind of spacey and only observant when it's necessary. I had used a GPS app to find his house but I didn't have my phone now. As I made my way back down the narrow road I noticed a black car following close behind. I took a right after the bridge and made my way up a hill that looked like the road into his neighborhood. It wasn't. I got to the top of the hill only to find an empty parking lot and some office buildings. To my horror, the black car appeared in my rear view mirror as I had been followed up the hill. ""This was obviously a wrong turn, did they make a wrong turn as well?"" I thought to myself. As I turned around, our vehicles became parallel and I rolled down my window. The window of the black car rolled down and revealed two white men, mid thirties I think. I angrily asked what they were doing. They just sat there staring back at me with expressionless faces. I rolled my eyes and floored it. I zoomed down the hill and took the next right. I HAD MADE IT.   

I rolled down my window and frantically typed in the pass code but the gate wouldn't budge! ""SHIT, SHIT, SHIT!"" I yelled. I had forgotten the pass code. After a few failed attempts I pulled my jeep off to the side, turned the lights out and made the terrible decision to crawl under the gate. About halfway through I became lodged. There I was, phone-less, being followed, and trapped under an entrance gate to a wealthy neighborhood. This wasn't good. If someone would have tried to leave the neighborhood the gate would have auto opened and snapped my rib cage. My heart was pounding at this point and began to pound even harder when lights from an approaching car became visible from behind. I used everything left in me to squeeze myself through. I got on my feet and sprinted toward the house. I am still unsure if the approaching car belonged to those men - but something tells me it did. 

I got to his house, caught my breath and knocked on the door. I could make out his tall slender frame approaching from inside the house. The door opened and there he stood, a suspicious smile on his face... He was smug as ever and had a satisfied grin as if he had known everything that had just transpired. ""I think I left my phone,"" I said with shame. He stood there for a moment and sarcastically replied ""I think you did too."" He stood there with a look that was mischievous enough to send chills up my spine. ""Well, can I have it?"" I asked with equal sarcasm. He turned around and disappeared into his darkened living room. As I stood there I turned my head to check the surroundings. He reappeared and handed me my phone. Before I darted off, I mentioned the men who had followed me. He smiled and claimed that they in fact ""worked for him."" I didn't have a reply, I just turned away and made my way back to the gate. Luckily, there was no black car to be found waiting at the entrance. Only my jeep. I squeezed back through, unlocked my jeep as fast as I could and never looked back.

Every few months or so, I would receive a text from his number. It was very strange because every text I would get was exactly the same. They would always mention some sort of fantasy get together, almost as if they were automated. Its as if they were not only coming to me, but to anyone that had shown interest in his misleading Grindr account. This is when it really made me think about the situation and realize how stupid I was. The messages I had received weren't even real. They were coming from a devil who was casting out lines in hopes of sucking in any man dumb enough to believe his lies."

I don't mind the work, but I do dislike the lifestyle of working 40+ hours day and night as a troglodyte. I didn't attend college for myself, rather my mother sorta forced me into it, I would rather have taken these past two semesters to go out and experiment in the real world. I currently have my eyes on accounting, and if I could implement some programming into it, that'd be great. Really, I would like to just take time to get odd jobs and internships to see what field I'd like to stay in, rather than piling up the student debt without knowing for sure if I want a degree at this point. 

My aunt is partially for me going out and finding a job, in fact, she's the one that made me want to join the accounting field after she told me about her experience with it as a college student (even though she didn't like it). She recommends Co-op, but my mother is pretty fierce about me staying in school and would probably go off on me if I called her and said I wanted to dropout.

I was transferred to a new store and its no where near as enjoyable (staff are not nice, management is way worse, and they are even further away from following the rule book, despite being closer to corporate). I have since applied for ~3 positions in IT/IS (I am 19) and have been accepted to phone interviews, and then in person interviews each time. I was sent on a roller coaster of being sent to different departments and told different things. I was told if I apply to a part time position in IT Programming I would more than likely be accepted; however, they declined me after the interviews. I was then told to apply to a position in IT Security and that would be a higher likelihood, the hiring manager indirectly told me I was too young and a better position would be as an intern. I then applied for the intern position and the manager for that told me since I am a freshman I cannot work as an intern. I was then sent to another department to only be turned down, yet again. I have made many connections and friends in Publix IT/IS since then, but have realized the earliest position would be three years from now. They focus on hiring older people (30+) it seems for anything but interns. Of the connections I made, I heard things such as Publix refusing to update certain software because of the logic, ""if it ain't broke why fix it."" due to being sent on this roller coaster from Publix, I may leave. Lakeland is a great place if you have a good resume though, I have had 8+ job offers (salaries ranging from 48k-103k) despite being 19 and in college here that I denied because I was given false hope at Publix. I am debating about leaving Publix and taking one of those job offers I have had. Just looking for some advice in the situation."
49uwsi,5,2016-03-10,I [22F] am not sure what to do about one of my oldest friends [22M].,cem1235,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/49uwsi/i_22f_am_not_sure_what_to_do_about_one_of_my/,"Sorry for the wall of text, I'm trying to make this short but I'm not sure which details are irrelevant.

**Backstory:** ""Chris"" is one of my oldest friends, I've known him since third grade and we went to middle and high school together. We didn't become super close until 8th grade/beginning of high school, but once we did I was over at his house all the time and his parents were like my parents. Part of it was because my home life wasn't that great (only child of single narcissistic mom) and his parents tried to look out for me like their own daughter. They were super supportive and friendly and I think they are the kind of parents that I want to be someday. The other part was just that we had great conversations, we could talk about anything and he could always find a way to make it humorous or thoughtful. In middle school both Chris and I had huge crushes on each other. I was shy and waiting for him to notice me in that way (it never occurred to me to ask him out). He was also shy and waiting for me to make the first move or give some sort of sign. In time the moment passed and it never happened, we both got over our feelings and became best friends instead.

In our senior year of college Chris met a girl who was a freshman. He had a huge crush on her and he eventually asked her out with some encouragement from me (we went to colleges in different states but Skyped regularly). They entered a relationship - Chris's first ever serious relationship. Within a week of Chris's college graduation they were engaged. She still has several years of schooling left because she is on track to enter med school. Chris graduated with a degree that he planned to use to enter public service. He spoke with me excitedly about how he had plans to move back to our hometown and get a job here. He applied for a prestigious internship here and was going to hear back by the end of the summer.  At the end of the summer, we were catching up and I asked if he got in. He told me that he did, but he turned it down. I was shocked, because this was something he had spoken about for years. He told me that this public service job was something that he wanted to do, but not for his entire life. His fiancee (""Cathy"") expressed concern about him entering such a dangerous profession, and he decided that it wasn't worth causing Cathy distress over something that would only be a few years out of his long life with her. He abandoned the idea and now he is working in a regular office job. It's not something he is passionate about, he's just treading water and paying off loans until he decides what he wants to do next. 

**The Issue:** This past Valentine's Day, Chris and Cathy celebrated their 2 year anniversary of being together (and they have been engaged for around 10 months). These days, I hardly hear from him at all, and usually not unless I initiate conversation. In college we used to talk all the time, not daily but we would have long Skype sessions every month. He even visited me a few times and spent the weekend. Now I don't really hear from him that often and I think I've only seen him twice in the past year. When we do talk, he seems genuinely interested in my life and asks questions about my job and family that show that he remembers our previous discussions. But these are becoming more and more rare and I'm not sure if it's due to the way his life has changed or if it's just a sign of people drifting apart after college. 

Cathy is starting to shop for wedding dresses. I met her twice, she seems like a fine person but I don't really understand how he can be sure she is ""the one"". To be perfectly frank, I think part of the attraction he sees in her is that he gets to feel smart and take care of someone younger than him. When we were kids our friend group comprised a lot of intelligent people, who are now working for Google or other engineering firms. With Cathy he gets to be smarter and wiser and take care of someone. There's also the fact that he hasn't been in a relationship before and this could be First Girlfriend Syndrome. On the other hand, I know it's perfectly possible for two people to get it right on the first try and end up together forever. Here's the thing, Reddit: I **know** that my feelings are due to jealousy. Objectively, I know that Chris and I would not be good in a relationship together: he is flaky and condescending to values that don't line up with his own. However, I think the little 8th grader in me is still waiting for him to notice me. If he wants to spend his life with Cathy that is great, I think he deserves happiness. 

My issue is that I don't know how to handle these feelings. I want Chris to be happy but I don't think that Cathy is right for him - however, I know that my opinion is 100% irrelevant and I have said nothing about it, nor will I ever. And when it's all said and done, I want to be there for his wedding no matter who he gets married to, I want to celebrate that moment in his life with his family. I think I can do that even if I still feel this way. I just can't figure out how to accept Cathy or get rid of my jealousy without cutting out one of my oldest friends. True, we aren't as close as we used to be and we haven't been that way for some time. Sometimes I feel like I'm more invested in this friendship than he is, considering how rare our contact is. However, when we do catch up, he offers all the same consideration and friendliness that he did when we were kids. I'm not sure what I'm more afraid of: that I'll have to cut him out in order to get over these feelings, or that he won't even notice if I do. Reddit, what should I do? Give it to me straight.

**tl;dr**: One of my oldest friends, whom I used to have a massive crush on, is now engaged to be married and I don't think his fiancee is right for him. I know this is partly due to jealousy, and I'm not sure how to resolve these feelings without cutting him out.

Throughout college I wasn’t really sure what I wanted to do; I’m okay at research and writing so I ended up a history major, which doesn’t exactly lend itself to obvious career paths. I never took advantage of the many internship opportunities that go with being at a prestigious university in the middle of DC; while my classmates were working on Capitol Hill or at international NGOs, I spent every summer back home as a barista. I graduated with honors, a thin resume, and no experience or inkling about what sort of work I’d like to do. 

I figured that some writing and analytical skills might carry over from history to a field like law, but couldn’t land an interview anywhere as a paralegal or entry-level assistant. In the meantime I worked as a server and bar-back at a high-end restaurant. Then I tried looking for a teaching position: I liked writing, had experience editing, so I eventually got a job at a small urban Catholic high school teaching English. 

And I hated it. Spending hours making lesson plans, only to see them go to shit because one kid is acting up, the constant disrespect and discipline issues, standing in front of a class expecting to be entertained all day, it all just wore on me. The school gave me no curriculum to work from and virtually no support: it was just me and 90 kids. So after one long and terrible semester, I resigned. 

Now, I have no idea what to do. I’m still at the restaurant. I know I definitely don’t want to teach high school again. I was considering pursuing a PhD in history, but the job prospects and lifestyle of academia seems like a horror show right now; I don’t have the drive or direction for such a cutthroat career. I’ve looked at museums, publications, law firms, communications, research: anything where research and writing might come in handy. I’d also toyed with trying to make something work at the restaurant: I work hard and learn quickly, if I set to it I could try for bartender or manager in a few years. But I don’t know how viable an option that is, or whether I’m cut out for the restaurant industry. 

I know I’m not a good candidate on paper. Hell, I know I’m not a good candidate in person either. I’m just tired of sending cover letters out into the void. I feel frustrated, lost, and left behind by my peers. I’m only 22 but it feels like my options are already limited.

Recently, I met with a bunch of companies at a career fair and gave many of them my resume. I received an email today from one of those companies asking me to come in for an interview next week.

I remember that this company was one of the ones I was least interested in after talking with them. When searching them online I didn't find many results, and the only company address I can find is about 3.5 hours away and the pay probably wouldn't cover much more than the rent. Most importantly, I am not sure what type of work they are looking for. From what I can tell the programming work they do definitely doesn't match my skillset.

What should I do? Would it be worth it to drive a couple of hours for the interview next week? Is there any somewhat professional way to ask in the email what skills they are looking for in potential employees?"

Now that I am starting to update my resume once again and look at what jobs are available. I am struck with this familiar feeling of self doubt, fear, and lack of self worth. As a recent IT Graduate I can only say that I have done only so much in this field. I did internships in college and worked for a few fortune 500 companies while studying but it seems when searching for IT jobs the requirement difficulty is no where close to being similar to searching for, say, an HR position where it could be more closely related to Can you HR? 

Each job is different, each job requires XYZ that I have no idea how I would be able to be in an interview, and pass that interview because there is no way that I could say I have worked with that technology.

Even reading some of the things in /r/sysadmin make me wonder what I've been preparing for all my life because it apparently isn't what you guys are doing.

I really could use some advice for looking for new jobs in IT. 

Reason I am leaving my current job is because they pay way under what would be considered acceptable for an IT Specialist, let alone what they actually have me doing. 

I would love to get into fields such as Unix admin or IT security but without the 7-10 years it seems they all require, I am at a loss for how it is possible.

I would definitely appreciate some input.

Sector Management,  
I am here with my weekly report.  
Noticable reports to be made include the elimination of three employees advocating intern rights, and the silencing of several leakers. Along with this, I have apprehended four time time travelers trying to move through undetected. According to one of them during interrogation, they were sent by the Interstellar Council for an investigation. The fact that an organization 70 years in the future wants to remove us is troubling, to say the least. All four said the same thing, and only one survived the interrogation; I have sent them to you.   
  
Additionally, they mentioned more spies among our staff. This reinforces the suspicions we had before, and I have also continued my investigation on certain employees. Another potential threat is the ever apparent threat of the MRVIN's. The corporation itself has attempted to kill me via proxies, but I removed any survivors but one. Apparently they wish to remove magic entirely, and based off their assault of me they may want to kill these magic users. I recommend extreme caution, as they are a core part of this facilities day to day chores, and removing them entirely would be bothersome.  
Ensure this information is not leaked to the general staff.

I'm 23 and in my fifth year of college. I am a computer science major. After this spring I still have three more semesters to complete before I graduate, but only if I pass my classes each semester. I have re-taken multiple classes multiple times only to get by. One class (computer architecture and assembly) I retook a third time and got a C- and another (analysis of algorithms) a second time and got a D+.

When I first started the program, I enjoyed the first couple classes. I was good at it and it was fun writing a program; it was like putting together a puzzle. Then when I started taking the higher level classes it's when I realized I may not be cut out for computer science. I'm taking a programming languages class and just today I spent three hours staring at my screen trying to figure put why my program wasn't working while everyone else around me got theirs to work. I get discouraged very easily so my depression started to kick in and I started having a mini panic attack. I am also now falling behind in my other classes, all of which are just as difficult. I am very shy and have social anxiety so I'm afraid to ask for help. I doubt I would understand it anyway if they re-explain any concepts.

For the last year and a half I have been regretting going into computer science and wished I was capable of learning the field. Or I wished I have either gone with another major or never have gone to college in the first place. I try my best to stay positive and just get through it but I have now gone to the point that this is all a waste of my time and energy. Even if I somehow graduate, I have no experience apart my boring job as an IT help desk assistant. I applied for an internship at a airport software company but got rejected. If you took a look at my transcript and resume, you would see why; I have nothing to offer. If that company didn't want me, why would any other company go for less? I'd be more useful as a janitor or bag boy than some struggling programmer.

I cannot afford to spend another 3-4 years going for another major that I *may* enjoy. My family is financially strained and I need to eventually find a full time job because it is only a matter of time before we'll end up on the street. If I drop out of school, I lose the job as well and the money I make goes into gas for my car and food for my family.  

There is nothing I can think of that is worth living for. Any decision I make will make me miserable. All I do now is wanting to sleep, play video games, browse the internet, and marry Daisy Ridley. I've always been the type of person who only did what others told me to do. I never really had a mind of my own, motivation nor confidence for myself. I have no friends and I have never been in a relationship. With my personality/shyness/anxiety, it will probably remain that way. And of course I have been thinking a lot of committing suicide.  

Thanks for reading."

Than in January the hand swelling and pain got worse and then pretty much every joint in my body became swollen and in a lot of pain, so much that standing in the shower is too much and walking upstairs almost brings me to tears. 

I put diagnosed in quotes because my new doc ran more blood tests today and I might be getting an MRI to rule out some low back diseases. I'm also cautious to say Fibro is the cause of my pain because I also have lots of swelling that started with the pain but everything else seems consistent to what I know.

I saw two other rheumatologists before I found one I trust. It's been really frustrating. The last one also suspected Fibro and put me on Lyrica but didn't explain anything. The Lyrica made me feel numb but it didn't help much with the pain. My new doc just put me on Cymbalta at my request for something aggressive. 

So here's my big concerns:

1. I'm applying to internships right now and they're all in a very physical field, with my pain right now I would not be able to do any of the work. This is also my field of choice, I've never wanted to do anything else and I'm terrified the pain will never go away and I'm getting my degree for nothing. 

2. I'm a student and in a very involved executive position in a group on campus and I tend to overbook myself, I tend wear myself out really easily which makes studying near impossible, but I don't really know how to slow down.

Any words of wisdom or your experiences would be really helpful, I never knew much about Fibromyalgia before and not knowing anything scares"

The spec for the project was very spotty at best when I first received it, so now it's even worse.

Now, we also get offered the chance to interview with the company, and I'm terrified this will affect that and/or other development positions I got for. 

I know I want and can do the work- I interned all last summer at a development shop, built their mobile app across WinPhone, Android and iOS. I loved it: I knew what they wanted, was left to program it and it went amazingly well.

I love programming and tech, but I'm just worried this one project will completely mess up my future. I've learned so much from doing this project as regards to failure and proper management, proper spec outline, etc but is there any point to it if I fuck it up?

TL;DR: Will an undergraduate or an internship project under performing due to multiple outside issues affect my career as a developer in general?"

I've only been contacted by 2 companies so far. Ideally I would like the internship to be software engineering related but at this point I would also definitely be happy with an IT Helpdesk internship. Any advice?

I started a web development internship in January, so it's been 2 months now. I only work 15 hours a week because I go to school full time (this is my last semester). 

Everything has been so hard. I feel like I'm drinking from a firehouse. There are 14 web apps that we build for our company. On top of that, this company is an insurance company, I need to be familiar with the processes and rules of an industry I've never been exposed to. It still feels like I'm contributing so little. I keep wondering if this is what an internship is supposed to feel like or if maybe I'm just not cut out for software development."

There was a beautiful girl there who told me she was an intern for the museum. We didn't have time to stand around and chat, but I stopped to exchange a few words whenever I could.

We seemed to really hit it off, and she would smile at me as I passed even if I just glanced at her. Everything seemed to be going really well.

Then toward the end of dessert, I decided to ask her out afterward. I almost never have the guts to ask girls out, so this entire night I've been feeling surprisingly bold. But when I actually walked up and asked her, she politely declined. I think she smiled, but I'm not sure.

The event isn't over yet, but we servers are all back in the kitchen now. I'm not sure if I'll see her after the event or not.

So where did I go wrong? I really fumbled up the ask, bit she seemed pretty clearly into me until that point. If I do cross paths with her again tonight, is there a point in trying again? I don't want to seem desperate."

I'll be done with all of my strictly programming classes this semester, and all I will have left are electives, networking security and a required writing class.  What I'm worried about it not being able to land a job after I graduate, since I was unable to find any internships.  I'm interested in web development, hence my thinking that I should skip summer semester and dive in so I have something to show on my resume by the time I graduate.  Another reason I might want to do this is that I simply don't have time to work on personal projects between class and work, so if I graduate sooner I won't be able to devote much if any time to building a portfolio.

If anyone can help, it would be much appreciated.

1. I want to go to college straight out of high school.

2. I'm thinking somerwhere liberal/moderate and diverse (both ethnically and in terms of gender), with strong academics. Maybe medium-large. Rain is nice. So's financial aid.

3. I don't really care about greek life that much, I doubt would participate.

4. Anything about colleges in Canada? I'm considering that as an option, both because I like the weather and atmosphere and because, well, I'll probs be able to tell whether or not I want to get out of the United States by the end of the year.

Thanks so much for taking the time to help me!"
49xiy3,2013,2016-03-11,I waited five years to get back at you,eatonsht,pettyrevenge,https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/49xiy3/i_waited_five_years_to_get_back_at_you/,"My family didn't have a lot of money, so right after I graduated from high school, I got a job waiting tables to help pay for Community College. I was lucky enough to get a job as a server at the local Houlihan's and it was pretty good money for young college kid.  In the back there were these two Mexican dishwashers who were also joking around and laughing.  They spoke very broken English, but were able to communicate.  Every time they would see me they greeted me with a Spanish sounding version of my name.  I didn't really understand it, but they always laughed and seemed genuinely happy to see me so I laughed along too.  
  
After several months working there one of the cooks working the line, who always had a front row seat to this suddenly called me over.  I remember this guy was always stoic and we weren't really friends, but we weren't on bad terms either.  I always did my job, and tried to keep as much shit from angry customers from coming back to the kitchen, which is probably why he took pity on me.  He said, ""Do you know what they are calling you?""  I shook my head no.  I had no idea.  
  
""It is a joke on your name.  It basically means take out and suck your dick.""  I thanked him profusely and after that I tried to go even more out of my way to help that guy.  At the same time a smouldering fire began to rage and burn in my heart.  I was humiliated and angry, but I didn't say anything to them.  I just smiled and played the game.  
  
I immediately enrolled in Spanish classes the next semester.  I found Spanish speaking students to hang out with.  Soon my entire group of friends was Spanish speaking.  By this time I had moved on from that restaurant and left those two dishwashers behind, but they were not forgotten.  After several more semesters I started spending my summer breaks volunteering in South America, and finally as I graduated from University with a degree in Engineering I won an internship to work in Spain only because I had become so good at speaking Spanish.  It was an amazing three months, but all good things come to an end and I had return home.  
  
After I came back home I was exhausted, but my friend forced me to go to a birthday party.  By coincidence I ended up meeting an amazing Hispanic woman there who was going to be my future wife.  Later that night we all went to a club and as we were dancing and having a good time I suddenly felt someone tapping me on the shoulder.  I turned around and standing there is Oscar, one of the dish washers.  
  
""Take out your dick and suck it!""  He said in Spanish.  
  
Without missing a beat I replied in perfect Spanish, ""Your sister already did that for me last night!""  
  
His eyes got really big and then we both burst into laughter and hugged.  The petty dream I originally had to get back at him had finally been fulfilled, but now 5 years later my heart was suddenly filled with gratitude.  I had long since realized that he had unknowingly launched me into an amazing journey where I travelled the world, met some amazing people, fell in love with a new culture and had just met my future wife.  So fuck you Oscar and thanks again."

I know that sounds cheesy and all, but it's true. I have been having a really hard time dealing with my emotions because this is the first time I've ever felt this way. Before you read the story, keep in mind that I am out as gay to all of my friends but not my family, and this guy, lets call him B, is out as bi to everyone pretty much, but he doesn't flaunt it. Here is the story:

When I was in 10th grade, I was in theater with a freshman, and we were just friends. We didn't really talk much until my senior year, but I always had these lingering feelings. November comes and we start talking again on facebook, and we're really hitting it off. I've been an intern in the school for 2 semesters, and he is joining the same internship program the next semester. 

We keep talking, and then in January I ask him if he wants to see a movie together. We set a time, and we go see the movie. Afterwards, we go and get some food and talk for a few hours, and then I have to run to get to an appointment. Over the next few weeks, we keep talking a lot, and now the internship has started so we have been spending more time together there. We get lunch a few more times on the weekends, each time hanging out for ~3-4 hours, but nothing physical happens.

Then our midwinter break comes along. I go away internationally, but we stay in contact for the whole trip. Partway through the trip, one of my best friends, and a mutual friend of B, texts me saying that B had a breakdown when talking to her. My friend says that B started talking about how he never had a crush on someone before, and then how he thinks he might have a crush on me. She tells me all of this, and I am kind of freaking out. While on my trip, I get a few small gifts to bring back for him, and we plan to get lunch 2 days after I come back. We go and get lunch at our usual spot, and I give him the gifts and we have a good time. Still nothing happens.

Six days later, I am laying in bed, and I tell myself that I need to tell B how I feel. I text him (which was probably a mistake in the long run) and basically just tell him how I feel. He tells me he knew all along, and likes me too, but not in a romantic way, and that he hopes he wasn't hinting at anything. He says he can't see himself being in a relationship with me, but still wants to stay as good friends as we are. I'm devastated at this point. Yes, this was a much better outcome than it could have been, but still not optimal.

The next week in school was a little bit awkward, as was to be expected, but then when I asked if he wanted to hang out on the weekend, he gave some excuse that he was busy. He has now done this a few times.

While he said he doesn't like me in a romantic way, I don't really believe him. I know what he said to my friend when I was away on vacation, and other people say they notice that we both make quick glances at each other, even after I told him how I feel.

Even though he said we can still be friends, I don't feel like we are as close as we were even a few weeks ago. We got pretty close, walking home together a few days a week, but then it all kind of stopped. I really like being around him and spending time with him, but it can be really hard sometimes. My attraction for him is not based on looks or sex, it's emotional. I really think that I love him, and all I want is to spend time together, in a relationship, but the possibility of that seems to be floating away. 

I don't know what to do. Can anyone who has been in a similar position offer me any guidance? Sorry for the wall of text, I just kind of wanted to get this out."

[Resume](http://postimg.org/image/t8l6906i9/)
_________________________________________________________________________________
I have long list of great excuses regarding ( family, personal, and school issues ), but honestly I was lazy with my job search with 0 motivation.


I applied to about less than 10 jobs, most of em' named companies. I've gotten two interviews and wasn't offered the jobs at the end ( both ended at the behavioral... for reasons I can understand )


I was in a bit of depression and completely dying out work ethic for a long period of time and only recently I've been able to recover with a help of a friend who inspired me to come into computer engineering in first place.

Loooong story short, this semester I've started to get good scores in school again, working on problems on cracking the coding interview, and what I'm most proud, although not related, is I've started to exercise for the first time in like 2 years.


I'm confident about myself than I have ever been, but, at the same time, I'm writing this post because I'm insecured about not having a single internship experience under my belt as a junior. I feel like I've started to mature and got myself together little late in the competition and I want to play the catch-up game.

I want to stay motivated, work on projects on my own, and further enhance my skills as a programmer.
I know it's a very broad question, but what would you guys do in my position to become a better/competitive programmer. 

I don't know what exactly I want to do in future, right now I'm doing embedded and computer security which is both very fun for me. I want to work on something and develop my skill over this summer on my own to find what I'm most passionate about because I understand that it's a bit too late to find an internship.

I thought about running away from burdens of my life, but if I wanted to make money I want to do it while coding and nothing else. So I'm going to accept my failures, stop the excuses, and try to advance. If you guys can throw in any advice I would very much appreciate it."

The next week in school was a little bit awkward, as was to be expected, but then when I asked if he wanted to hang out on the weekend, he gave some excuse that he was busy. He has now done this a few times.

While he said he doesn't like me in a romantic way, I don't really believe him. I know what he said to my friend when I was away on vacation, and other people say they notice that we both make quick glances at each other, even after I told him how I feel.

Even though he said we can still be friends, I don't feel like we are as close as we were even a few weeks ago. We got pretty close, walking home together a few days a week, but then it all kind of stopped. I really like being around him and spending time with him, but it can be really hard sometimes. My attraction for him is not based on looks or sex, it's emotional. I really think that I love him, and all I want is to spend time together, in a relationship, but the possibility of that seems to be floating away.

I don't know what to do. Can anyone who has been in a similar position offer me any guidance? Sorry for the wall of text, I just kind of wanted to get this out."

A Front-End dev internship or starting a non-profit?,Kyle1668,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/49xpht/whats_better_experience_a_frontend_dev_internship/,"I'm currently a Freshman Computer Science Student. Summer is fast approaching and I'm looking at what would be the best personal experience to have. There are two ventures I'm looking that I have to decide between.

A. Pursuing a Front-End Developer internship at a small local startup. I would be using HTML, Bootstrap and Javascript.

B. Co-found a web design non-profit with the aim of raising over $5000 for local high school's underfunded CS program. Would be using primarily Wordpress.

I'm hoping to land a Software Engineering internship the following summer so I want to have the strongest resume experience this summer.

What Trump does is he has to use certain techniques, like insulting muslims and immigrants, to make him seem like he is powerful and superior to them. He needs to tap into the anger of his supporters, at people like Mexicans, in order to obtain power. He does not have power without the use of insults or anger. 

A real masculine, alpha, does not need to assure the audience on national television that he has a huge penis. The idea that he needs to convince someone of his masculinity, is the indicator of it's absence. TRP says you cannot negotiate desire. So Trump fails in this aspect.

So who is the real alpha man? JFK. He had a legendary charisma, and a pair of eyes that could make a woman want him just by looking at her. He never felt a need to use insults or put other people down to feel powerful. Fuck, he even signed the Equal Pay Act for women. 

This guy could bang any women he wanted:

&gt; In a recent biography about Mao Zedong, the Chinese leader, it was revealed that he had sex as many as three times a day -- each time with a different young woman.

http://www.viewzone.com/JFKteen.html

He was loved by everyone, and had hundreds of affairs. His charisma was to powerful he could even get white house interns to give his staff members oral sex. He even took the virginity of several white house interns on his wife's bed.

http://www.cnn.com/2013/11/14/politics/gallery/jfk-alleged-affairs/

Kennedy held real power, charisma, and masculinity. Trump's power is manufactured through negotiation of anger and insults.

I’ve been using Reddit for the past few days, mostly in this subreddit, looking for info about open relationships and so far I haven’t found a post that resembles my case so I don’t know if I’m a little out of order or something. Also, I don’t know if I’m using the right flair, so please inform me if I did something wrong.

I apologize in advance for poor grammar/verb conjugation/phrasing, English is a second language.

First, a little info about me… I’m extremely shy. You have no idea how shy I am. It’s not extreme to the point of social anxiety, but I sometimes find it hard to approach people when I have to, even if it’s nothing serious. I never dated during my teen years as I spent most of my adolescence gaming/playing basketball/hanging out with friends, who were mostly non-daters just like me.
About a year ago I started dating a wonderful woman I met 2 years ago. I was extremely nervous when I asked her out but she was like “What took you so long?”. Our relationship is very loving and beautiful and I don’t want to be anyone else, but these past few weeks I’ve been feeling weird and distant. You see… 3 years ago I was part of a threesome relationship of sorts (this is the part where I doubt this is the right subreddit, but r/polygamy is a private subreddit).

Back in 2013 I had just turned 23 and I was starting to come out of my shell a little bit. I was becoming more sociable but still hadn't dated. I was majoring in Electronical Engineer in Telecommunications and through class I met a 23-year-old man that shared a lot of interests with me: music, movies, literature, etc (at this point I wasn’t a gamer anymore; it took too much of my time). He was studying Electronical Engineer in Automatization so we were going to share classes only until some point. We immediately connected, in a platonic way. We started hanging out before and after class, and doing homework and projects together.
A couple of weeks into the semester I met his GF and I was positively stunned… she was gorgeous and we also had a lot of common ground. The three of us started hanging out together and it felt like we had been friends since forever. They were very liberal and free-spirited, and even though I’m not quite like them, I felt right at home.

One weekend I dropped by his place to finish a project. I arrived at about 1pm and by 5pm we were done. I was about to leave but he invited me to stay for dinner. His girlfriend arrived later and his mom made dinner for all of us (his father doesn't live with them). This was the first we connected as a threesome, eating and laughing and having a great time. Weeks later he celebrated his birthday in a night club and invited me. I had never been in a club before and I definitely didn’t know know how to dance, but I still went, hoping to dance with his girlfriend, who had been devouring my fantasies since the first time we met. I had a lot of fun and actually got to dance with her, but it was all friendly.
We kept growing closer to the point where we were regularly seeing each other and eating out. Despite my fears, I never felt like a third wheel.

About 3 months into the semester I started noticing his girlfriend was being flirty around me: talking directly to me when we were in a group, smiling a lot, playfully grabbing my hand/forearm/shoulder. At first I told myself that I was just seeing things. After all, I had a HUGE crush on her, so any excuse to think that she liked me was good enough for me. But then I noticed how she wasn’t like that with other people, not even her girlfriends and my head started spinning in happiness, but I also knew that there was no way I was going to get in the middle of my best friend’s relationship, so I was ultimately heart-broken.
I started avoiding contact with him outside the class room because I knew she would be there. My friend, however, kept wanting to hang out and kept inviting me to parties and stuff. You have to understand, this was the first time since high school that I was “part of something” so, naive as it sounds, I didn’t want to lose it. I buckep up, gulped hard and said to myself that I wasn’t going to fall for her, and kept hanging with them. This lasted like 2 weeks… and then I fell for her, and him, I guess.

One Saturday we were at his place. She put on some music and wanted to dance, but my friend declined. At first I refused (bro code or whatever, I don’t know), but she insisted and we danced together. It was kind of a slow ballad so I was uncomfortable AND thrilled at the same time. I mean, my friend was right there! But it was all innocent.

We hung out for a few hours. Later I called a cab and when it arrived I said goodbye to my friend and he waved back while going up the stairs. When I said goodbye to her she hugged me (which was not rare), but instead of kissing me on the cheek, she gave a peck on the lips! I was petrified, scared shitless of the possibility of my friend seeing us, but he didn’t. She smiled at me and I left.
She kept being flirty around me but it wasn’t until a couple of weeks later that things escalated to a whole new level. Again, we were hanging by his house (his mom wasn’t there) when my friend stood in the middle of the room and said “[insert my name], you know we like you, right?”. It took me by surprise but I nodded. Then he said “The thing is, we like you a lot” and sat beside me, and then his girlfriend sat on the other side, kind of cornering me. I looked at them, now seriously scared, and said “What’s going on here?”. He said “There’s something she wants to tell you”, he said, barely containing his laugh. I looked at her, confused, and she kissed me! I immediately broke the kiss and my friend laughed pretty hard. I was very scared and confused.

“Don’t worry, it’s OK, relax”, she said, and he nodded. Then she kissed me again and we started making out. Then he kissed on the cheek and we eventually made out. I hadn’t ever contemplated the possibility of being homosexual, much less bisexual. That day we only made out, but when I returned home, I was so confused. I seriously thought “Did this really happen?” and my stomach felt sick (I kind of felt the butterflies but the situation was so weird I wasn’t sure what I was feeling).

The next time we met he explained to me that for months they had both been looking for someone (of either sex) to have an open relationship with, even before the semester started, which was before he knew me. He asked me if I was willing to be that person, and said that I had no idea, I mean, I hadn’t even dated traditionally and suddenly I was in the middle of an open relationship, it was like… sensory overload! He also said that when we met, he texted his girlfriend saying something like “I might have someone”, and that a couple of days after meeting me, she said “This is our man!”

I asked for some time to think and he said that it was OK and that I shouldn’t feel any pressure. A couple of days later I woke up and the first thing I thought was “WTF am I doing? This is the opportunity of a lifetime!” I called him and told him that I was their man. From then on things escalated quickly. I lost my virginity to her while he was right beside me. I must say it was quite a peculiar experience, but an extremely enjoyable one, nonetheless. Between me and him there was oral, kissing and caressing, no penetration.

The whole thing didn’t last more than 3 months, but they were the most unpredictable, exciting and exhilarating 3 months I’ve ever lived.
We never “dated” properly, only in large groups of people, but never just the 3 of us. Despite enjoying it deeply, it was very bittersweet because I knew I wasn’t her boyfriend, which is what I really wanted. Sometimes after we were done, we would all sleep in the same bed, but they would cuddle and I ended up on the other side feeling like an idiot.

There was only one time when I truly felt like her boyfriend. We were in bed but my friend was sleeping with his head on her shoulder. Neither of us were sleepy so we just started talking, about everything. Our day, our hopes, our fears, why we liked each other, how hilarious this thing had gotten and everything in between. I felt really connected to her, like I had never felt before. Between chatter, we would occasionally make out and then keep talking. Then my friend rolled over and turned his back on us, still sleeping. We kept making out and eventually had sex, right beside him. Strangely enough, this was the first time I had ever had sex one-on-one. Also, he never woke up, so I still feel kind of guilty, like we… cheated on him?

Anyway, it didn’t last long after that. She started her internship so we couldn’t hang out with her anymore. We did had some weekend sessions here and there, but it eventually waned out. By the next semester we weren’t sharing classes anymore and even though I ran into them a couple times, it was over.
I’m sorry for how long this has been, friends, it’s just that this is something I’ve wanted to get off my chest for a long time. I don’t feel guilty about it, on the contrary, I think experimenting with my sexuality in such a way has had a very positive impact on my self-esteem and overall character, but lately things have gotten serious (in a good way) between my girlfriend and I, and I think I miss the warmth of two bodies instead of one. We’ve been a steady couple for 10 months now and we’re very much in love, but in the past few weeks I feel like I miss “the good old days”.

My girlfriend is very open-minded, but I don’t know how she would react to this. Also, we’ve talked about past experiences and I said that my first time was casual sex with a girl I dated for a short time (which is vague enough to be true and false at the same time), because I wasn't going to confess this to her when we were still getting to know each other, so telling her this now might make her think that I’m hiding something else.

In the end, this feeling will probably fade away with time, but right now I’m confused as to what I feel and just want to see if someone has gone through something similar. Have you ever been in a open relationship? What was it like? Was it difficult to have a monogamous relationship later?
I really want to know what you think because I don’t trust anyone with this information, so I want to get some thoughts to kind of sort my feelings out and get some perspective about something that has had a lasting impact in my life.

tl;dr: This was so long, I'm sorry! My first relationship ever was an open one and now I have polarizing feelings about my relationship with my girlfriend. Any advice?"

**Obligatory background.**
So, imagine yourself as 22 year old female, who just completed a wonderful internship, graduated college, and accepted one of the five offers she had for post college employment (I'm tooting my own horn... two were from the two locations I interned at). You accept a great offer (for $5 an hour more than your internship offered, with better hours). You move three hours from home, to a not-so-great small town. You're thinking to yourself, ""Man, I am the luckiest girl ever. I have a great life."" 


Then, cue the shitstorm. I want you to imagine those deep sea weird angler fish with the glow worm. 


22 year old me only saw that glow worm... and now I see the angler. 


**The Now**
I'm going to bulletpoint this bullshit.


* My boss is a late forties woman, who wants to be *your friend*, and not your boss. I work in the medical field. She is my higher up. She was not given her position because she earned it, but rather when the former higher up left, she was the most senior. She is not educated in managerial roles, she is not good in her position. As a side note, for being in the medical field, she truly believes anything she reads on the internet, mixed with being a slight hypochondriac. For example; if she believes she is Vitamin D deficient, and she reads online that eating eighteen lemons will cure a vitamin D deficiency. She will eat eighteen lemons. She also *likes* posts on Facebook that says stuff like, ""Eighteen million likes and we can cure Timmy's cancer!"" So there's that...


* I work with a team of about fourteen other people. Two just quit. So we are short staffed. She will only interview **AWFUL**, candidates, who aren't even qualified. (Think of the position being labeled as a MINIMUM 2 year education requirement... she will only interview people who have no education. When I've asked her about this, she will say something along the lines of, ""well they deserve a chance too!"" No, this is how people die. 


* She will not fire an employee who is like cancer to the rest of the team. This employee, I'll call her Sam, is a 50+ year old woman who is singlehandedly the laziest person I've ever met. She will call into work, after telling a patient the day before that she will be calling in sick so she can have the day off. She isn't on time, uses the company computer to order Netflix movies on DVD sent to her house (she doesn't have internet at home) and to pay her bills. Her husband will frequently call work and argue with her for 15+ minutes about what they are having for dinner. She comes to work drunk (high functioning alcoholic) and will often start arguments between the team. She will disappear for an hour at a time, with no mention as to where she is going. HR has been involved, twice. So she really only needs one more ""strike"", but my boss refuses to let her go and has told people, ""No matter what Sam does, I will not fire her.""


* On another side note, Sam has now taken to slight harassment of the team, including myself. These comments can be about weight, eating habits (how much a person eats, comments about what they eat, how often they eat, etc) and now about personal life. We just got a new employee about 5 months ago (she has been doing wonderfully), and Sam has taken a dislike to her and tries daily to make the new girl's life a living hell.


* She consistently makes promises she can't keep in regards to shifts, vacations, and promotions. For example, one of the girls who just quit had worked here for three years. Whenever my coworker would ask about her promised dayshifts, my boss would say something like, ""oh on the next schedule we will get you some day shifts!"" Guess what never happened... This has begun to affect me too, as I worked my agreed upon shift for about one month and have now been switching between nights, evenings, and days (all in the course of one week). 


* She often snaps at me (and other employees), for absolutely zero reason. She rewards Sam for small things (like staying late fifteen minutes) when the day before I stayed late two HOURS to help fix something broken. Just this last weekend I stayed late from an overnight shift for two extra hours to cover for someone who was sick, did I even get a thank you? Nope. My boss will bend over backwards for Sam, but won't give a second thought to shitting on everyone else. 


* Really I could go on for a **long time**. It's causing me a lot of problems (at work and at home). My personal relationships are affected because some days I just need to rant - I don't want to, but part of me needs to get my frustrations out. I feel trapped by how many promises my boss made me when I started, and none of them are coming true. She got me with the glow worm, and now I am stuck with the angler. I currently live in a crap area (lots of meth and bath salts), with my only work friend gone, my significant other 2.5 hours away, and a job with a horrible boss that lies to me daily. 

**So...**
At some point in the next six months I will be moving away to live with my absolutely amazing significant other and our puppy in a different area. He already has a job, and bought a house. There are numerous jobs in the area (it's a big city) and I will have no problem getting a job. So basically I have two options, which I want your advice on.  


*1. Stick it out to my one year of employment (June):* If I do this, it would be better for the team, I would get paid out my two weeks vacation (currently I get none in my first year of working). It would look better on my resume. BUT, it would be absolute hell between now and then. Between being short staffed with no relief in sight, and my boss's character towards me and the team going downhill, I fear it's only going to get worse between now and then. I will most likely be working every weekend as a night shift and horrible hours during the week that will prevent me from seeing my significant other and our puppy. 


*2. Leave as soon as possible.* With this option, I would be abandoning my vacation pay. I would also be abandoning a sinking ship and waving to the suckers going down with 'er. My resume would be kinda sad looking. But, I truly believe my mental health would be SO much better. I would be so much happier. My only work friend, who is now a forever real life friend, tells me every day how she doesn't regret for a second leaving, and how much happier she is at her new job. And I can't help but want that for myself. I am sick and tired of coming home upset, crying, or frustrated and having my poor boyfriend listening to me repeat the same woes (he is an absolute saint!) 


*Relationships, what do I do? How do I approach my boss about leaving? When do I leave? What do I say? I love WHAT I do, but can't tolerate my boss any longer - it's making me bitter and unhappy.*

TLDR; 22F got caught by a deep sea glow worm. Had enough. Ready to leave, but when?"
49y8yf,0,2016-03-11,Discrimination of Students Regardless of Experience,julius559,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/49y8yf/discrimination_of_students_regardless_of/,"I am currently a senior completing a CS degree in the US at a non top tier school, and I am shocked at how discriminated students are for full-time opportunities regardless of their internship and software positions held during school.



This isn't just a ""this happened to me once and I'm bitter"", but more of ""this happens more than 50% of interviews and I'm tired of it.""




More context:

I found this subreddit during my freshman year and saw how important internships and experience was for students in order to get ahead of the game when you graduate. I did exactly that, I worked my ass off to get my first internship the summer after freshman year, and continued that mentality all through school. I've had 2 1/2 years of full-time (summer)/part-time (during school) experience working at 3 different companies working on both mobile and web development. Down time between jobs have been no greater than a month or 2 (just for taking a breather). These weren't joke positions, and I was actually apart of an Agile environment and exposed to many aspects of software dev than a normal CS student wouldn't be familiar with (if he's had no or little experience).




I feel I've done everything I possibly could have done with not being at a top-tier school, and getting as much software development experience that I could get to be able to provide to a company than a typical ""new grad"".




I started looking for roles for a full-time position after I graduate, trying to explore all my options, and I'm shocked how irrelevant my experience is to technical hiring managers, lead engineers, etc (not recruiters, the people hiring). I've talked to about 12 companies since my start (still talking to some) and most of the responses I get are:



""Looking at your resume you don't have any practical experience""

""We're actually looking for someone with more experience and not just out of school"".




I'm not talking about the Big 4 or being from Stanford. I've interviewed with both big and startup companies, but the experience is the same. No I didn't work at huge notable companies, but I did the best I felt I could.




Has anyone ever experienced this themselves? Is my experience actually that irrelevant? I've had friends at my school experience the same issue, and some even try to omit the fact they're in school as long as they can to avoid it.

The companies I've been interviewing for have been in LA/OC, Chicago, SF/Bay area, and NY.




Sorry for the rant, hope I don't sound pretentious or entitled. It's just the hard work I've put in these last 4 years isn't coming out to the result that I've read about or expected. Hearing these opinions put me down and really don't give me much hope for after I graduate.



*tldr* A CS senior with 2 1/2 years of software work experience is getting told by companies that his experience isn't practical and is still receiving ""new grad"" discrimination."

49z290,1,2016-03-11,Connecting the dots after years... Could I have depression?,Typhlops,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/49z290/connecting_the_dots_after_years_could_i_have/,"So quick backstory, ever since high school I've met with a fair amount of issues regarding anxiety, work/performance related stress, being easily unsettled and having concentration/motivation issues with school. Now, about two years ago I found myself with a diagnosis for ADD after talking with a family member who has ADHD herself, and figuring out that the things she mentioned were too relevant to me to be a coincidence. I've been through therapy and a search for medication since then too, although those have always been mostly focussed on the ADD-related issues in my life.

Now, I've read that people with AD(H)D have an elevated chance at suffering from depression as well, and considering both my family member with ADD *and* my own dad have treatment for that, I'm no stranger to is. Yet, after an heavy argument with my parents about my involvement in our family, I decided to look up what my issue could be beyond ADD, and things finally clicked for me.

I'm often very restless when my mind isn't occupied, and find that my general peace of mind is very fragile and can continuously get broken by the smallest changes in my life (occasionally working on saturday, unexpected dentist appiontment etc.). I'm not someone who gets easily emotional at people-related matters (in fact, I often feel very disconnected to others unless I can relate to them very closely, and there are very few people that I actually have any connection to), but when it comes to work-related matters, I can break down like a baby and sob for an hour or even two sometimes, out of worry. 

I have a lot of spare time but often find that coming home after school/work, I don't really feel like doing that much. I've always attributed this to me being pretty isolated as a result of being very different from my environment, and having little to actually do on my days besides playing guitar / videogames and watching movies, but it's becoming more and more noticable that I roll into a pretty apathetic, bored and kind of restless mood for the rest of the day once I leave my internship for example.

I've also had a terrible appetite even as a kid, and despite recently having tried going to the gym 2-3 times a week for 4 months while trying to improve my diet, I didn't gain a single pound because my appetite combined with my metabolism makes it a big pain to take in enough calories to actually gain some weight. I have issues with sleeping as well, though those are probably mostly because of my ADD.

Could this all be a viable basis for depression? The reason it never really hit me was because there are also things I *do* enjoy, like my internship where I get to work with people and never really notice my issues. It's mostly when my mind isn't occupied with something that my mood drops to a low point. I'd love some insight because I'm not quite sure what to do here, and wether the solution lies all in myself or could be tackled with other means of help, like medication. Would appreciate any response."

Recently I've been helping my father's company with marketing, such as implementing Analytics to help his website SEO and making some changes within the site (from content to site speed to crawl errors), as well as starting Adwords for him and writing the ad copy.  However there's only about 10 ads and the budget is very small.  He says I should write more before including it, because it's not enough, what do you guys think?

I was wondering what I should put into my resume, because I don't have an official job title.

I wouldn't put my dad as a reference, he's been telling his business partner exactly what I'm doing, so his partner said he would be my reference to back me up.

Not sure if it matters, but I've also done a separate marketing internship, so this isn't the only thing on my resume, however, my dad suggested I shouldn't put Marketing Intern for this one.  But I do think this would help my resume for entry-level marketing jobs.

EDIT: I'm also going to take the Google Analytics certification exam tomorrow, how do I list that on my resume?"

I've been browsing this subreddit for a while (but I've never took time to post, unfortunately), and I think this is the best place to ask my question (I apoligize in advance if that is not the case).

I'm a second year computer sciences student, and I'd love to specialize into graphics programming. Because of that, I'm looking to gain experience in that field with a summer internship. 

Sadly, from what I've seen, getting an intership in game developpement is quite difficult.
I think that my resume and my motivation are solid (I've already done several internship before).

So far, I've been adviced to build a portfolio to show my skills in programming. I've started a engine (for fun) using Vulkan and C++ ( [https://github.com/speedbapt/zenith](https://github.com/speedbapt/zenith) ).

I was wondering if there were some tips to build a solid and good looking portfolio, which would help me in the future to get an internship or a job in the world of game developpement.

Thanks in advance!

I have the opportunity for a summer internship with a company. This internship would involve me working in sql, c#, and MVC. I understand that they will be teaching me for a bit on everything, so they don't expect me to know everything about programming.

I have learned about OOP through PHP and Java, but i learned java almost 2 years ago. So my knowledge in OOP is rusty, but i still understand the basics, such as classes, objects, inheritance. I just went over OOP in php the other day which was a good refresher, but I know its different from C#. I have a C# and asp web forms class I'm taking atm, and we're actually going over OOP next week, although my interview will be on Monday!

I'm just wondering if anyone has any tips for what i can study up on to make a good impression on my tech interview. I know the guy mentioned polymorphism and inheritance when he said we'd do the interview next week, so i know i need to understand those two concepts. just looking for anymore tips/resources that could be of use.

Thanks for any input you all can provide :^D"

So I started rambling and thinking and I believe I came to the conclusion. My spirit has broken, and I think I know why as well. This is probably going to be a wall of text. 

The Last year as been a huge change for me, which I think has really overloaded me.

**Work**

I have done random jobs but for a while I was working at a Home Depot in sales (More of moving things with a forklift). I did that for a while and I actually enjoyed it. Then I took a full-time machinist job and quit after two months. I was then un-employed for 4 months before I took a job as a butcher. That ended after 2 months when I found a drafting Intership (Much better bay and in my field of study.) During all of that time I was still in school. That internship ended and I went back to part-time work at Home Depot. 4 months later I got a full-time job as a drafter, where I have been working for 9 months. 

Full-time has been stressing me, it feels like it has really changed how life works. The job is also pretty crappy. It's really easy work and enviroment, but I am not stimulated and I receive no positive feedback...ever. Other then that it's just a boring office.

**Friends**

Since Junior High I have always had a group of friends. I attended a bible study group and had friends there as well as school friends. Things were actually pretty good with friends. In my junior year at High School I got my GED because my older siblings and friends told me that Senior year was a waste. I didn't want to spend a year doing nothing (I regret this decision). I still lived near by and with only part-time work and school I visited the high school  a lot and still hung out with my friends a lot. 


Then something changed once they graduated. They all moved around and my school friends left for their own colleges (Some stayed in the area.) I lost contact with most of them and honestly haven't heard anything from any of them, except one that I'm friends with on Facebook. I've run into a couple of them as asked to hang out but it never goes anywhere. So I felt like my school friends abandoned me. 

Within my bible study group I had a large group of friends. I don't talk to any of them anymore. There was a group I normally hung out with, about 6 people. I am a christian (I'm not going to get into anything religious, don't worry :).) Some stuff happened with two of my friends that I feel like were very wrong, not just because of religion but just in general.

* One friend met a girl online, she stayed the night after 1 week (Drove 2 hours down to see him) and had sex. She already had a kid that she got while being black out drunk for like several weeks straight. She got pregnant (Even though she was taking very safe pregnancy precautions) and three months after they **MET** he was running off to reno to get married and live with her. I tried talking to him about it and he nearly ripped my head off.
* Another friend was in an abusive relationship (In all senses of the word beside physical) He joined the military and she constantly complained to me about him. She said she didn't want him and didn't want that life. She finally broke it off and stayed away. 2 months later I find out she took a trip across the country to see him and...they got married...two weeks later she is moving to Georgia.

Needless to say I feel this were all bad decisions in general. When I tried talking to my others friends about what they were doing and why they were wrong I got the same answer ""We just need to love them, what they are doing is fine. You shouldn't make a deal out of it, just love them."" Then of course I brought in biblical references of why we should be doing something and I got the same answer ""Well, I'm not a christian anyways. So I don't know."" 

Three people claimed they weren't christians (Ever, not just anymore). Two made bad life decisions and moved away to get married. The rest don't even talk to me anymore...I feel like I put so much effort and time into those friends, helping them and guiding them. They even told me they agreed with my advice at some point or another. Then when I actually called them out on their decision instead of just playing the nice helper I got dropped. 

**Home Life**

I was living at home with my parents while most of this went down. I moved out after I got the full-time drafting job. I lived on my own for 3 months. I really enjoyed it, it was going pretty good. I was dating a girl that I met in College and everything seemed good at home. We got married and she moved in, that's when things got more stressful on that front. She is not a clean person, Not filthy, just not clean. So I struggled with that because I was always clean and tidy. I also was not use to being constantly with some one else, at home my parents and I were always in different rooms.On top of that we have had some issues, I have no sex drive (At all) and she has a huge sex drive. This has caused most of the issues. My AS traits have been showing a lot more because I notice them when I am constantly around someone. 



**Conclusion**

I feel like life took a 180 turn and punched me on it's way. I was happy go lucky with a bunch of friends, school to stimulate me, a job I enjoyed and pushed me, and a great girlfriend. 

Then I lost all of my friends within a month, my new job really beat me down, my family moved away, and I am now dealing with issues at home. 

I feel like a ton of stuff happened at once and I have no idea how to handle it. I have just shut down more or less. This was more of a rant and I thank anyone who actually read this and got through it.

Once I started college I immediately gained 5lbs. Now, half way through freshman year, I am at 293lbs.  These past few months have been the most stressful with scholarhships, internships, and the hardest classes I've ever taken.

Edit: resume link

Edit: I got 2 interviews so far, one of them was for a full-time job, I passed the interview (it went very well), but since they were looking for someone to start this summer, we didn't proceed. The other interview (internship) also went very well, and they invited me to their on-site. I believe I am fairly good when it comes to interviews. As a measurement, I can solve most of the easy (within 5 minutes) and medium (within 10-20 minutes) problems on leetcode. It's just I am not getting any interviews to show it :/ 

EDIT: So, I changed my resume based on your comments. I applied to around 30-40 different places over the weekend. I also tried to be a bit more selective, so I didn't apply to jobs that I don't qualify for. This morning I heard from 2 different recruiters already. Thanks so much, this is amazing  :) "

I couple days ago I thought about what I wanted to do in my life and I think I know where I would like to be.

However I have no idea how to get to where I can work in that industry. I live in Chicago where all production is basically commercials, marketing or documentaries and I mean it's okay but I don't have a passion for it.

I've had some decent internships where I did live television production and would like to think I know what I am doing related to that.

Does anyone here work or have worked for placed that do internet television that has stuff on Youtube or Twitch and how you got into it? What makes it different from traditional live television production?"

I have a choice of either choosing a good internship (from a reputable company - Data Analyst internship) or choose a summer research from a university (Cyber and Civil Infrastructure - I don't know how good this opportunity would be towards my future because it asked me what my top 3 projects I wanted to work on, I chose software, embedded systems and hardware).  

My long term goal is to go to grad school and obtain my masters in computer engineering. I think the research might help me but my current problem is that I have a GPA below 3, haven't taken GREs (which I know I'll do bad because I struggle with reading), and have mediocre internship experience under my belt. 

I thought about taking the research and on the spare time, I will be learning more about programming, algorithms, APIs, etc. (basically strengthen my programming logic and problem solving skills,  reading the Cracking the code interview (I haven't finished) and work on an individual project myself). I am trying to get ready so I can be competitive enough when I am close to graduation; I graduate by the end of this year.

I've also completed an internship at a startup over the summer.

A little problem though. I've come to a realisation that I'm not entirely sure I want to work as a Software Engineer after I graduate.

I chose Software Engineering because I loved maths, computers and coding from an early childhood. I've loved the technicality of it and have been praised. The pay in the US from what I hear is quite good for now. Simply put, I chose it because I was good at it and it seemed like a lucrative career.

The degree at my university is also troubling me. I've come to the realisation that the degree is just a glorified Comp Sci. There's not much distinction and it feels like I've wasted my time.

Truth be told, I find the work uninteresting and unappealing. 

And I think I'm more interested in the physical Engineering disciplines. I thought about switching to Mechanical Engineering.

I feel like I'd rather be learning about Fluids, Thermo and Dynamics rather than Finite Maths, Databases and Networking.

I'm aware switching degrees at this stage isn't the wisest of decisions but I feel stuck with this degree in terms of where I can go with it. The thought of working as a dev. with a code base for the rest of my life seems depressing.

If anyone could knock some bloody sense into me or give me some advice on what I can do in this situation, that would really helpful."

For job B, I have to complete a written test (around 7 hours but I am great at standardized tests). Which do you think is worth it? 

I can clarify information, feel free to ask!

I'm a senior, about to finish my CS degree, but I'm struggling immensely. I'm not even sure I'm going to pass my final classes because the concepts have completely gone over my head now. On top of that I've been applying for various internships and jobs since I was a sophomore and have gotten a few interviews but I've been turned down everywhere for the last 2 years. I've even branched out to IT positions to apply for and still get turned down.

I pretty much have no motivation and I wake up feeling like I haven't slept at all. I feel like I've made a mistake choosing computer science because I'll be honest, I'm an awful programmer and probably the worst in my graduating class. There are freshman that are more skilled than I am. I enjoy programming but I'm just terrible at it and there's no way I'd be able to pass any technical interview without being walked through every step of the interview.

The main problem is that I went into the field practically blind. I had no clue what code looked like, what a data structure or algorithm was, or any of those concepts. I was always told that I can be whatever I wanted to be and being the naive, ignorant, dumb as a brick, recent high school grad that I was, I decided I wanted to work in the video game industry. So I picked the most common degree in the industry which was computer science. Boy was that decision a mistake, I learned quickly that what you want to be might not actually be what you want. Even if I managed to land a job in that field with the slim chances I already have, the 80 hour work weeks and no job security would have killed me. After my sophomore year I realized that the video game industry was not the reality for me and I should have jumped ship then but here I am, about to graduate unemployed with no plans for the future.

All I wanted was a relaxing, stress free job where I could work on things that I already enjoy. I'm your stereotypical ""spend every minute playing games and watching anime"" kind of guy and I just wanted a job that would allow me to continue that lifestyle. I figured making games would be the logical solution since I've spent tens of thousands of hours playing them.

So now I feel stuck, I can barely get out of bed in the morning, I'm most likely going to fail my classes, if I don't fail I'll graduate unemployed and probably have to get a minimum wage job. At this rate death sounds better than having to deal with the fact that I wasted 4 years, being yelled at and disowned by my family for being a failure, and living the rest of my life barely getting by.

**tl;dr**

* About to graduate with my CS degree.
* Might not graduate due to not doing well in my classes this semester.
* Been turned down from internships and jobs for the last 2 years.
* Not skilled enough to pass a technical interview.
* No motivation, waking up feeling exhausted.
* In desperate need for some guidance or someone to point me in the right direction."

I looked up to him a lot in a very non creepy/sexual way and honestly thought the same. I went for a drink with him 2 weeks ago and he ended up getting drunk whereas I was still sober. He started coming onto me pretty heavily, asking me very personal questions and such. It escalated to him asking me to kiss him and when I said no, he grabbed my throat and slammed me into a wall. I can't get over the anger on his face, I was so frightened.

It's incredibly awkward at work now and I feel like now I need to quit and start again when I have already made so much progress. He doesn't seem to care about it and is acting like he has done nothing wrong and pretty much ignoring me.

4a2e90,11,2016-03-11,"Me [24F] with my parents [60s M/F], badly in need of perspective.",kennyneedsalife,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4a2e90/me_24f_with_my_parents_60s_mf_badly_in_need_of/,"Sorry for the wall of text. 

So, I went through some rough times over the last couple of years, and my parents took me in after I'd been on my own for about five years. I'm grateful, I really am, and I've told them so. But our relationship has become complicated since then, and I really need someone to either verbally slap me down or tell me how to handle it.

Our situation is this: my parents are not charging me rent, as I'm currently attending school and doing an internship, pushing me to a bit over 40 hours a week as is, and have essentially no income. In return, I've been helping out around the house, especially with things they can't do anymore (like scrubbing floors). 

My parents and I are having trouble adjusting too our new parents/child relationship. For example: I'll talk about how I eventually want to get a tattoo. I always frame this in the sense of ""when I have a steady income and am not blowing through money like crazy because of grad school"". But it's something I want, and the tattoo I want has special meaning to me (e.g. surviving anxiety, surviving depression). My Dad, in return, made a snide comment about how if I can afford a tattoo, then I can afford to pay rent. My mom joined in. I'll also add that, yes, both my parents know the significance of the tattoo that I want to get. 

My mom also nags. GAWD does she nag. I feel like it's straining our relationship. I've tried to address it before, but the problem is that my mom has anxiety, and this is how she handles it in regards to me, so we have a tendency to go in circles about it.

She also has this weird thing about me asking people if they need help. I got into the habit of it god knows when, but instead of jumping straight into a job, I usually ask if the person needs help first. I don't mean this in the sense of everything, like I jump in with carrying heavy objects, groceries, etc, but if someone is cleaning the kitchen (or something similar) I'll ask if they need help first. It drives her nuts, and she says ""Just jump in! Just do it!"" I try to explain to her that I feel more comfortable asking first, but she won't hear of it. Discussion comes to a halt. 

My Dad can just kind of be thoughtless with his words sometimes, but these times come out of nowhere and cause me a lot of personal grief.

So, tonight, my Dad made a snide comment at me again. My mom came up, and we talked it over a bit. I told her that I'm dissatisfied with our living situation, that I feel like I'm not treated as an adult sometimes, that I'm really lonely for people my age (separate issue), that I feel trapped in my current situation cause I want to move out and be on my own but can't afford it, etc. (These aren't bombshells, by the way, I've vocalized these thoughts before). My mom said that she felt like it was an adjustment on both sides, and that both of us needed to get better at communicating what our expectations were, preferrably as they came up. She also brought up the fact that hearing I felt trapped hurt her feelings, since other kids are in the same situation as me and grateful that they have somewhere to be.

I'm torn on this. In a way, it was a wake up call that I was being ungrateful. In another way, this feels like the ""starving children in Africa"" argument, and I don't know which side to listen to.

So, like the title suggested, I need perspective on how to react to this issue. I am eternally grateful to my parents, and I try to show it by being a good roommate, but obviously both sides need work. I could probably do some more work around the house, for instance. As for the rest of it? I don't know. I guess I'm looking for someone to either yell at me and say ""OH MY GOD GET OVER YOURSELF"" or be like ""you've had some hard times, but you'll get through this."" or ""Woah, you need to address this.""

I dunno. I'm having trouble processing, and I guess I'm hoping for outside perspective. I graduate in a year, so this is temporary, so I guess I'm wondering how to survive this.

TL;DR: Parents and I butt heads sometimes. Need help processing what to think/how I can handle it.

I'm open to a variety of different situations/prompts, and if you've got an idea, I'd love to hear it. If you'd like a few ideas of mine, they're below, as is my kinks/dislikes list!

1) I'm a mid-level office employee and you're a newly-hired intern. We don't deal with one another much aside from short, polite acknowledgements. However, I do some video editing work for a few clients, and a shady one turns out to be an employee at a local chain of strip clubs.

In editing a video, I notice a VERY familiar face giving a lap dance and even sexually pleasing a customer. It's you, and I wait until we're alone in the office to let you know that I know about your dirty little secret.

2) I've just moved to a new neighborhood. I know absolutely nothing about the area, and you notice me moving boxes and spending more and more time in the area. Your backstory can vary; maybe I've moved in next to a college sorority house, maybe you're a MILF with a cougar's sex drive, maybe you're a cheating wife whose husband is never home. Alternatively, maybe it's YOU moving into a new place. The ideas are endless; either way, it ends with us having had multiple orgasms and with you covered in cum!

3) One of us is in town for business on a VERY short trip for work. We can figure out specifics on who does what; maybe you're a cheerleader/dancer for a visiting sports team, for instance. Either way, we wind up in the same spot, and the situation escalates quickly from there, since we're both looking for one night of naughty fun.

4) I've married older and into an open relationship. My new wife has a college-aged daughter, and you're her best friend. You come over somehow on a night where nobody else is home (my wife is getting fucked by at least one other guy, my step-daughter is elsewhere), and ultimately we wind up in a situation where one of us seduces the other. Why are you at my house? How do we get to that point? Let's figure it out together!

5) Any kind of party prompt you can imagine; nightclub, pool, bachelor/bachelorette, etc.

6) Any prompt you've submitted in the past that hasn't gotten the interest you'd hoped for; as long as it doesn't go against my ""dislikes"" list, I'm game!

My kinks: Dirty talk (an absolute must), bad girls (seriously, the raunchier the better), partying/drinking/smoking (also open to drug use), oral sex, group sex, cumplay, cheating, mild age play if it fits the story (nothing illegal, but anything from ages 18-40something is in play).

My dislikes: Animals, bathroom stuff, blood/gore, BDSM, FUTA, incest, intense dom/sub situations, noncon, orgasm control.

Hope to hear from you today!"

We have one friend who knows a lot about car mechanics and their engines and recently he got a job at Sikorsky aircraft. We don't know what his position is which led us to the debate. He dropped out after his first semester in college to get the job and he said it pays $20 an hour. His college major had to do with computers so I assumed that he most likely got an internship or position that had to do with computers since his dad had connections within the company. They debated with me that he most likely got a position working on aircraft mechanics due to his experience with working on cars and having a lot of knowledge as an auto mechanic, I said not likely cause in my opinion aircraft mechanics and auto mechanics are two completely different things to work on. Where as they argued that he already has experience with auto engines so it would be a lot easier for him to do the job and better guarantee him the position. So basically what I'm asking, is there a huge difference between Aircraft and Auto mechanics and if one knew how to work on one would it then be easy for him to transfer over and work on the other?"

I am planning a reunion of sorts amongst friends in Europe this summer before I start my internship.

 I have a trip I had hoped you guys could critique for the best experience possible. There will be about 9 of us, and we are all students who are about to attain our degrees or will have after May. 


We enjoy nightlife, but most importantly nature and its beautiful offerings of mountains, lakes and beaches. 




We love hiking, surfing, exploring parks  and biking, so anything anybody can recommend along the way would be great. Any kind of castles, ruins, breathtaking views, you guys know of, I'd love to learn of as well!

We'll meet one of our friends who is from the area, we all met through a student exchange program in the states. 

* After we land in Paris, we plan to take a train to the Jungfrau, Switzerland area and spend  3 days.
* After which, we fly to Bordeaux, France for another 3 days. 
* We then take a train to Biarritz, France, and spend another 3 days. 
* We then wish to take a train to Bilbao, and spend 3 days there as well.
* Afterwards, we plan on heading to Porto and spending 2 days there
* Finally, we head to Lisbon, Portugal for 3 days.

Any recommendations?

I've looked into Sintra and Braga, Portugal and plan to make day trips there. Days trips to San Sebastian, Spain. As I said, while we do appreciate natures offerings we also do enjoy a great nightlife where we can relax and dance after long days.

Furthermore, I hope to see as much of the countryside as possible.

I appreciate the help."

4a2vce,1,2016-03-12,"Trying to start saving early for my various goals, but my situation is about to start changing repeatedly.",kiwichampion,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/4a2vce/trying_to_start_saving_early_for_my_various_goals/,"I guess I should try to be as comprehensive as possible.

I'm 18 years old and about to finish up my freshman year in college. This year, I lived in the dorms. For the first semester, I didn't really work. For the second semester, I worked a lot and saved aggressively; I'm looking at a little under $4k by the time classes end. While I'm very happy with this, because I have to buy a car (used but functional), I am starting to feel very burnt out because of how much I'm working on top of school and how little of that hard earned money I'm actually getting to use.

Next year, and likely for the year after that, I will be living at home with my parents and commuting. This will mean my only real expenses are going to be tuition (not bad with fed. loans and living off campus), gas, a gym membership, and maybe some money for food (my family doesn't always eat as healthily as I try to). So obviously not big expenses. After that, my senior year, I'll probably get an apartment that I share with my boyfriend (if everything goes according to plan), so my expenses would change then. 

Now that expenses are covered, I guess I should talk about income. I am a waitress at a fairly popular restaurant. Right now I work ~20 hours a week Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays, but that's only because the restaurant and my college are in different towns and I don't currently have a car. Working weekends like this, I can make between $300 and $400. I am currently saving $200/week to meet the deadline for buying a car (I really need to have one shortly after classes end). Over the summer, I'll likely ramp it up to 30-40 hours a week, so money would, in theory, double. Once my sophomore year starts up, however, things get a little unclear as to how they will go.

 I will probably still try to work about 20 hours a week, though, just maybe not all on the weekend so I don't feel so burnt out. I've also considered getting a new job as a waitress in my university's town, just to help cut down on gas prices (I live in a different town than both my university and my restaurant), so if I do that, then who knows how much I'll be making. I do plan to keep working through college. I might have to take a summer off eventually to work an internship or something similar. 

OKAY, so now my goals! I know some of these are more important than others, so I'll try to prioritize them by how soon I'll need that money and by how bad I want it. 

1. Tuition. I'm taking two summer classes, which will each be about $800, one in each summer session. Living off campus with federal loans, when school starts back up I think I'll need about $2,000 per semester. I think I can save this fairly easily.

2. Cosmetic surgery. This is something I've thought about for a while, but I don't have the specifics nailed down. In the United States, a BA costs about $10,000 if I am correct. There's a lot of variables about this, though. This would likely be done some time during my senior year as a graduation present to myself. 
3. Travel. I don't plan on studying abroad, but I want to try and take quite a few trips. I have terrible wanderlust, it's just that the idea of having obligations (like class, grades, etc) while trying to travel and experience new things sounds horrible to me. So one or two week trips would be ideal. Unfortunately, plane tickets are super expensive. 
4. A wedding/house. This one is really either/or, I guess, and also kind of both? Because I would marry whoever I buy the house with, and we would both help with the costs of the wedding, and we would both help with the down payment. My domestic dreams savings. This wouldn't be for a while, like maybe ten years from now, but it's really never too early to start.

So that's basically it? I'm just not sure what to do. Try and save really, really aggressively this summer and into the next two years when I'm living at home and expenses are low? Put everything in one big savings account and draw from it as needed for those goals? Start a different account for some/all of the goals? Only worry about saving aggressively for goal x and y, but put a little money away every two weeks for goal b and c? I feel like I have too much that I'm trying to do all at once, and I don't know where to start.

Sorry this is so much info, I just wanted y'all to have the best picture of everything so that I could get the most helpful advice. Thanks so much!"

For various reasons,I couldn't choose computer engineering, and as a result I learned fundamentals of programming through Matlab (duh, I know) and couldn't attend classes on operating systems and networking. However, I did attend a class on web programming (HTML+CSS,PHP,Javascript,intro to Ajax) and a practical course on computer security, which I really loved (they introduced networking and OS concepts, taught pentesting steps, a few tools ,how to edit exploits and get them to work, and a bit about digital forensics).

 I'd like to get a job in computer security,specifically penetration testing, but wouldn't mind working on incident response and the like. 
Now I have been given two internship possibilities, both in the security field. 
Offer A, from a company belonging to an international group: the job is about identity and access management systems. They offer a first month of initial training(apparently including networking and operating system concepts from a practical standpoint), then a paid internship with possible assignments abroad. 


Offer B, from a relatively small local firm(150-200 people): the internship is related to pentesting and they give me the possibility of choosing between network and webapp pentesting. No assignments abroad.


A and B pay the same salary.


If I choose A, I may get some training on networking and operating systems but the topic of the internship doesn't seem very exciting. 


If I choose B, I don't get any training on said subjects but the job seems to be more interesting. 


Note that I would like to enrol in a Masters program(where I will learn a lot about networking, not much about OS) and I just want to carry out the internship to gain a valuable job experience, not to start working without a Master.
With that being said, what should I do?"
4a3ijd,1,2016-03-12,[Desperate case] Civil partnership between an EEA national and an American citizen,hnzz456,ukvisa,https://www.reddit.com/r/ukvisa/comments/4a3ijd/desperate_case_civil_partnership_between_an_eea/,"Hi all, this is a rather desperate search for advice after scanning [gov.uk](https://www.gov.uk/marriages-civil-partnerships/overview) back and forth, googling and hearing people tell me different things. Sorry if this comes out as a lengthy post - I just want you to see that I did my research, information just seems contradictory and ambiguous. 

I am an EEA national with an American girlfriend. She completed her Masters at one of the Scottish universities and did a 6-month internship right after that. I have been working in Scotland full-time on a &gt; £30,000 salary for the past 9 months. We lived a 50-minute train journey away and saw each other every weekend. After her internship came to an end, we went together to visit my family in an EU country. She came back on a [Standard Visitor visa](https://www.gov.uk/standard-visitor-visa/overview) with the intention of staying with me during that time.
Shortly after living together, we realised we never want to be away from each other again and decided to register a civil partnership.

Can we give notice of our intention to register a civil partnership and then register a civil partnership while she's here on a Standard Visitor visa?

I know that gov.uk says that:

&gt; On a Standard Visitor visa you can’t marry or register a civil partnership, or give notice of marriage or civil partnership. ([source](https://www.gov.uk/standard-visitor-visa))

But we didn't come here with the intent to marry or register a civil partnership - we just wanted to spend time together and then realised that we want to spend a lifetime together. If we'd known, she'd have applied for a Marriage Visitor visa, no problem. But how could we have known? Only after living together we understood that we never want to be in a long-distance relationship again.

So does she have to leave the UK now and apply for a Marriage Visitor visa?

gov.uk says that:

&gt; You must apply for a Marriage Visitor visa if you’re **not planning to stay or settle in the UK** after your marriage or civil partnership. ([source](https://www.gov.uk/marriage-visa/overview))

That's not the case - she's planning to stay and settle in the UK after our civil partnership.

If she applied for a Marriage Visitor visa knowing that she wanted to stay in the UK - wouldn't that be a violation of immigration law?

gov.uk says that:

&gt; You can apply for a family of a settled person visa (eg, as a fiancé, fiancée or **proposed civil partner**) if you intend to stay in the UK for more than 6 months. ([source](https://www.gov.uk/marriages-civil-partnerships/foreign-national))

&gt; If your partner is a permanent UK resident (ie has a ‘document certifying permanent residence’), you can apply for a family of a settled person visa. ([source](https://www.gov.uk/marriages-civil-partnerships/foreign-national))

I am a permanent UK resident (qualified person, working) but then gov.uk contradicts itself saying

&gt;You may need to apply in a different way if your partner is from the EEA. ([source](https://www.gov.uk/join-family-in-uk))

and then on *applying in a different way*:

&gt;You can apply for a family permit instead of a ‘family of a settled person’ visa if the person you’ll be joining is from a country in the European Economic Area (EEA) (excluding the UK) or from Switzerland. ([source](https://www.gov.uk/join-family-in-uk/exceptions))

So not a 'family of a settled person' visa but a family permit, although they just said that as a partner of a permanent UK resident, she could apply for the 'family of a settled person' visa.

They cover a *If you're already in the UK* exception:

&gt;You can’t apply for a ‘family of a settled person’ visa - you must apply to remain in the UK with family instead. ([source](https://www.gov.uk/join-family-in-uk/exceptions))

And here it comes full circle cause then on *Remain in the UK with family* they say:

&gt; You may need to apply in a different way if your partner’s from the EEA or Switzerland. ([source](https://www.gov.uk/remain-in-uk-family)) 

I read it again and again and I have no idea. My girlfriend went to our local Registrars office to simply ask about it but the person she spoke to seemed very hostile and not willing to answer any of her questions (not a good sign if that person's supposed to approve of our civil partnership...). We consulted a free legal advice bureau but the advisor, although willing to help, doesn't seem to be very knowledgeable.

TLDR;
EU citizen working in the UK to register a civil partnership with an American girlfriend on a Standard Visitor visa with the intent to stay in the UK"

4a3nbc,3,2016-03-12,Thinking about leaving my new job.,deadend2016,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/4a3nbc/thinking_about_leaving_my_new_job/,"As the title say, I am now considering about leaving my new store assistant job I have been for about a week and two days. Yes, I am THAT new to the job and this may be little too early to even think about it. 

24 years old, I have my degree in Fine Arts and a diploma in Animation. I have to admit I have very little job experience at my age; no paid experience in the creative industry, just internships and volunteers here and there for past 3 years. When I was 20, I worked at a restaurant for a month, that is until they fired me and that was it.

Now I am on my three-week trial period at a grocery store, shelf stacking and being a cashier. After about 48 working hours, I already feel very incompetent at my job. I am very slow, and keep making small mistakes everyday but I know I can get better if I stay willing to learn and improve.

My question is; should I? This may be just another excuse of mine to run away from tough situations; I know I am a little spoiled child who had not earned a penny by herself until now, but after the three-week period, with my contract signed and sent to their head office (yes, they are still in my hands unsigned), I will be a legitimate employer and will be obliged to give a *one-month's* termination notice when I want to leave my job.

Now I am still looking for jobs related with my degree but once I become a legal employee at my current place, will it be harder to get a job with a immediate start?

I already have an answer; I am not quitting at this point with no job offer at my table, and two more weeks of my trial period left. This job will probably toughen me up a bit, and some extra money in my wallet.

I am probably just a little lost as to how long I should stay at my current place. This year I am on a post-study work visa which gives me a year to stay in this country to get a job, and with a job that is related to my degree, a permanent resident visa (which is like a green card in US) is no longer a dream. And to achieve that, I want to maximize a possibility of getting a job in the creative field and minimize a risk of not getting it.

What do you redditors think? Any thoughts or advises will be appreciated."

4a4303,10,2016-03-12,"Your Brain = Your Worst Enemy (""Success"" Story)",throwawayanx1604,HealthAnxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthAnxiety/comments/4a4303/your_brain_your_worst_enemy_success_story/,"I made a post on here a few days ago that I'd been worried about a brain tumor for quite awhile. 4 months ago I started having headaches. I started feeling nauseous and getting sick every day, I started seeing stars and lots of extra floaters on a daily basis. I also started stuttering/slurring my words, started missing keys on my keyboard and phone. I had a few episodes of severe depersonalization (foggy brain feeling) with a weird pressure in my head. I had numbness/tingling in my hands and feet and I started getting lots of spasms and blurry vision. I also had a lot of weird tinnitus (ears would ring for 10-20 seconds and stop, once every two days). I was more than convinced that I had a brain tumor, MS, or (God forbid) both!

My days at work were spent switching between actually working and just worrying, Googling, and YouTubing for proof one way or the other that I was sick or not so sick. I would say that I was probably quite depressed, and it really did impair my social life.

Never before had I EVER experienced any kind of anxiety that even came remotely close to comparing with this, which is why I worried even more. I'd had a few lumps/bumps in the past, but I wasn't ever too worried and when I was told by one doctor I was fine, I believed him. This time, I've been to three different clinics, the ER, and my family doctor twice. I've also been to two different chiropractors, each one two or three times and my optometrist twice. All of them said ""It's just stress, or maybe a postural problem.""

Well, my worrying and the numbness/tingling/weakness, blurry vision, and stuttering/slurring were enough to get my family doctor to send me for an MRI. In the weeks leading up to it, I got worse. My headaches were terrible, the amount of stars I was seeing probably doubled, my vision got worse, my legs and arms were sore, and I swear I could barely walk some days. I was ""on my deathbed"".

My MRI was Thursday. I got the results this morning. Completely freaked out when I realized it was Saturday at 9AM when my doctor's secretary says to me ""Hi Travis, Dr. ______ would like to speak to you."" My brain absolutely went running off *oh my God, I actually am sick; I'm going to die; why else would he call me on a Saturday so soon when the results were supposed to take 7-10 days?* Turns out the results were 100% normal.

So, moral of the story: your brain is your worst enemy sometimes. I'm not saying that if something seems off, you shouldn't get checked out, but if you do get checked out and you're told by your doctor that you're just fine, I'd at least *try* to trust him/her. I know it's easier said than done, but trust them and forget about your ""illness"" and it'll go away. Don't check in on yourself every day and ask ""Does my head still hurt? Is my vision blurry? Are my legs numb?"" That just makes you worry more, even if the immediate results are all ""No.""

I am still going for a neuro appointment for the headaches to check for a trapped nerve or other reason for headaches, but oddly enough all my other symptoms have gone so far today.

So please trust your doctor. They didn't go through 4 years of undergrad, 4-8 years of med school, multiple years of internships and a few standardized tests and come out COMPLETE morons on the other side. Granted they're not all Dr. House, but they do typically know more than you when it comes to symptoms, signs, and tests.

Good luck everyone here. Think positive and you'll be just fine! If anyone wants to chat about their fears, PM me or leave a comment."
4a45t4,2,2016-03-12,Going to duke for masters in ME after a bachelors degree from UIUC,taco_granande,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/4a45t4/going_to_duke_for_masters_in_me_after_a_bachelors/,"Hey r/EngineeringStudents, 

The basic question is whether I should accept an offer from Duke university for a Masters of Engineering in Mechanical Engineering program after graduating form University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign. I am an international student with a 3.0 GPA and I graduated in Dec 2015. I do not have any internships under my belt, but 2 university research positions have helped me gain experience in robotics and Engineering research. However, I didn't have much luck getting a job after graduation. I think being an international student who would require visa sponsorship to continue working in the US after a few years, has a little to do with it. Given these premises, I have compiled a list of pros and cons to help me make a decision. What I need now is input from someone who has graduated in engineering from Duke, or has had to make similar decisions before. Any help would be greatly appreciated. 



Pros| Cons
---|---
 there is this fact that companies are more likely to sponsor an international student after a masters degree than after a bachelor's degree.| UIUC was definitely a better university for Engineering than Duke and since I did not score a job through UIUC, I feel the chances of scoring one from Duke are slimmer.
Research would indicate that my GPA is likely to improve at Duke significantly, compared to UIUC. | Dukes alumni network is about one third that of UIUC, and even smaller if your look at just Engineering.
Duke has a smaller Engineering population, especially in Masters, and therefore I am more likely to get noticed by companies that come to Duke. The staff and advisory may also be able to provide personalized help due to the small population. | Smaller engineering population might sway companies further away from hiring an international student.
There is the fact that this degree requires me to do an industry internship in order to complete my degree. So I guess that would open doors to jobs in the industry. | The question 'Why did I have to move to a university with worse credentials than my bachelors' might pop into an employers head.

Any help is greatly appreciated.
Thanks!"

It's not helping my anxiety.,thrownawayasalways,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/4a4hah/entirely_too_much_happened_to_me_at_once_its_not/,"Like the title says, I have so much going on at once that I don't know   how to handle it. My anxiety has gotten out of control. 

For starters, I've had a crisis of mortality the past year. I'm not sure what brought this on but all of a sudden it really hit me that one day I was going to die, all of my loved ones were going to die, and there was nothing I could do to stop it. Late at night, as hard as I try not to think about it, I find myself wondering what the process would be like and how it must be horrifying to be aware that you're dying. I get frequent panic attacks over this. 

I'm also currently in the toughest internship at my university. The internship itself is fine, but the extra work from the university makes it near impossible to do well on everything. I'm usually pretty stressed because of this. 

Now on top of that, I got sick recently. I made several trips to urgent care, one to the ER, and was later hospitalized. This of course has my supervisor at the university sending me emails about needing to catch up... even though I just got out of the hospital a day ago. She actually suggested that I do my work in the hospital. 

During my illness, my fiance of three years left me. While I was on bed rest after I got out of the ER, he moved out of his apartment in the town we live in without telling me and went to his mom's. He broke up with me over the phone while I was sick in bed. He didn't so much as text me the whole time I was sick to see how I was doing. 

After the ER, I chose to see my doctor in my hometown rather than look for one in my university's town and also elected to be hospitalized here. I've been with my family for about a week now and it's really helped - but now I have to go back. I am absolutely dreading it. I have to go back and face being alone with all of these awful thoughts and try to pick up the pieces by myself. Just thinking about packing my stuff and driving me back makes me anxious. 

What can I do to make this better? I see a therapist, but the entire office is closed this week, when I need it most. I'm afraid of having to wait even a week to speak to someone. "
4a4iqa,10,2016-03-12,3 Internships but low gpa. How attractive of a candidate will I be?,h4lp23,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4a4iqa/3_internships_but_low_gpa_how_attractive_of_a/,"Hey everyone,

this post isn't meant to be a humble-brag. I am simply seeking advice on maximizing my opportunity when I graduate. I'd like to give some context to my situation.


During university, I was not a stellar student. I have plenty of low math and cs grades, but some high math and cs grades. I did not take school as seriously as I should have. I'll graduate with most likely just under 2.5. I did not socialize well with my peers. I feel that my mental state during university was unstable, slightly depressing outlook on life. It caused me a lot of unnecessary stress.
I was also doing a double major in math and cs. I will say the cs courses have better grades. In particular last year I averaged 3.22 in cs courses. This term, I'm expecting decent marks in hard courses. But the damage cannot be undone. 


With this weighing me down, I put in significant effort to obtain internships and successfully did. I have 1+ years worth of experience from internships. I have learned an incredible amount from those experiences. In particular, the last internship really taught me software development of a product. I was a contributor to core features. I learned how to be more confident as everyone was encouraging me to be. 


Fast forward to now. I'm applying to places such as Amazon, Apple, Google, and medium sized companies doing interesting work. I have a very nice formatted resume, taken from advice on this subreddit. I have a personal website that reiterates what my resume says, and expands on my interests and shows some projects I worked on.


I want to know what my prospects are because the last internship are making me an offer. It is expected to be between 50-55k with benefits. This is pretty good for the area, even though 70k new grad is also possible somewhere else.  But I don't want to accept it until I can judge my job prospects.


This is mainly because the company is a startup and lacks mentorship and seasoned developers. I want to learn from the best. Everyone there is essentially learning how to do what they do. Many of these guys switched from another career. I cannot discredit their intelligence though. Just their experience. There are many times where my expertise is actually considered. This scares me because I don't know anything relative to seasoned software engineers.


The other aspect to this is how much I want to move. I'd like to start in a new big city and meet people, cute girls. Start that social life adventure I've been postponing for far too long.   


The other component weighing me down is my experience comes from startups. I think companies will look down on this because I did not learn from well defined sources. They'll see my no name internships, low gpa and dismiss me as intellectually inferior. I want to know how true this part is.

Anyways please offer your thoughts. Again, I'm looking to maximize my potential as a new grad. I understand how my position can be considered successful and do not take that for granted. I got very lucky the last 3 years. "

Now what?",redmistcube,actuary,https://www.reddit.com/r/actuary/comments/4a4j1g/passed_exams_p_and_fm_yet_i_feel_completely_lost/,"I know this is going to be just another asking for help post, but if you guys don't mind too much, I am just hoping for getting a bit more tailored answer for the questions I have. I'll try to make this as short as possible.

I graduated from my master's program last December and now I have BS and MS degrees in math. Until now, becoming an actuary was only a backup plan as I wanted to pursue a PhD degree but have failed to get an admission from any of the schools that I have applied. While I was applying for graduate schools, I studied for the exams P and FM and have managed to pass both.

Another piece of information that may be relevant is that I live abroad. Although I went to a school in the US for undergrad, for personal reasons, I had to return to Korea where I got my master's degree. I was hoping to go back to the US for my PhD, but that didn't work out.

My communication skills and social skills aren't that great and I'm rather introverted (think of a stereotypical academic type). I got my degrees from an okay-ish undergrad and top-tier graduate schools (at least in Korea) with both GPAs around 3.5.

In any case, as I wasn't really looking into getting a job, I'm not sure what to do now. Perhaps I am overly pessimistic, but after some self evaluation, my prospects don't seem that great. I don't have any internship experience or job experience as getting into the job market was not my original intent. Networking through social events is out of the question for obvious geographical reasons.

So the question is, what do I do next? Do I just start sending out cover letters for entry level positions? Take more exams to compensate for what would otherwise look like a week resume? Any help would be appreciated."
4a4lat,6,2016-03-12,My Introduction to the Film Industry as a 16-18 year old Filmmaker (And my advice to those around this age),JohnKorda,Filmmakers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Filmmakers/comments/4a4lat/my_introduction_to_the_film_industry_as_a_1618/,"I will attempt to turn a rant into a lesson for my peers. 

Our story begins about 2 years ago, in the final days of my 16th summer. One particular evening, I see a classic film I really like. I like it so much I write a script based off of it. Let a few weeks pass, junior year of high school begins for me -- and I just can't get this idea out of my head. I edit the script, throw it out -- write another one, repeat until I have gone through four drafts. *Doing great,* I think. So great I should make this script a reality. And I do -- I cast three actors from a large city located about 90 miles south of my town. Everybody has the script, production is moving into play. *Fantastic,* this is going too easy. 

1. First thing I learned: **It's Never Too Easy.**
Remember how I mentioned *everybody* got the script? Yes, *everybody,* including this one Little Shit (let's call him that for now) who has absolutely nothing to do with production -- I would have hardly called him a friend at the time -- gets my 5th draft into his gritty little hands. Little Shit then decides that my script is a little too similar to a script he had written months prior, and therefore brings it up to our mutual film teacher. Oh, and lest I forget -- I am told (through my teacher) of Little Shit's anger the morning of the scheduled table read for my production. And I know the title to his script, that's about it. Off to a great start already. 
Anyways, I am ""sincerely advised"" to *only* rewrite my script in order to safely avoid a lawsuit for plagiarism. Table read is postponed to the following spring. Oh, and let me end with this: Little Shit never made his script into a film. 
Lesson learned: stay away from Little Shits. 

2. Lesson two: **Actors.** 
Let me keep this one brief: cast the right actors for your film. Do auditions, *live,* auditions, where you can talk to people and experiment with different styles. And that's all I have to say about that. 

3. Lesson three: **Scheduling.**
Oh, baby. Let me say this: I have come to learn, the incredibly, excruciatingly hard way, that *scheduling is a bitch*. This factor alone is what has dragged my production from being a two or three month job to a two-years-and-counting production. But, more on that in a later lesson.
For all of you high school-and-below filmmakers reading, if you don't take anything away from my post, just take this: if you are casting actors that live quite a distance from you, or have very busy schedules, section off however many **consecutive days** you need to film with them, and bring them to your location and get it all done in that time. Don't do any of this weekend bullshit, or any ""we'll shoot on this day and then figure out the rest of the days later"" -- I have been trying it and it doesn't work. If your actor is just too busy to section off any time for you, then for the love of God, find somebody else. 
And yes, it is more than worth the money that it will cost to put everybody in hotels and have all of their meals paid for. Get a job if you need money, budget for your film -- that lesson there is for free. 
And while we're at it, let's have a brief discussion about weather. Principal photography for my film was initially meant to be completed over Christmas break of my junior year (obviously, Little Shit happened and we postponed). Then, we were supposed to finish over the following spring break -- but in the great state of Texas, weather has a mind of its own. It happened to rain just over the few days we planned to film. And mind I say it, about 85% of our film takes place in EXT. sunshine. 
Lesson learned: for those who happen to reside in the same state as I, I have come up with a rough schedule for Texas weather: if you want rain, shoot Jan. -- May. If you want sunshine, shoot June -- Oct. If you have balls and you really don't care, shoot Nov. -- Dec. But of course, don't be surprised if it starts to pour down rain in the middle of August (as it did for my film on one particular shooting day). 

4. Lesson Four: **Never Stop Writing.**
Back to my story: where did we leave off? Eh, fuck it. Let's fast-forward to one select evening not too many nights ago, March 8, 2016. It has been 1 year and 7 months since I wrote the first draft. I have about 340gb of footage on my computer. Things are going great, actually. We have dates set to finish this film -- end of spring break, the following week. Everything is set into place for production. It is 11PM, I am wrapping up on finishing my shot list. I get an email. *Nice, I'm always excited when I get an email.*
Fuck that, it was email from my lead actor saying he became busy in the last minute with another acting job. 
Now, I ranted over scheduling in the previous lesson, so this is about how I handled the hiatuses. Throughout the months in which we attempted to schedule, I grew ideas for other projects. Something about a photographer, another about a band, etc. etc. Point is, always keep thinking of new, better ideas. And most importantly, write them. Don't stick to one great idea. You can make better (I guarantee you, the scripts I have written since that last draft are 9000x better). And, when you have the time and money sectioned off -- make the scripts come alive! As soon as I finish this production in June, we plan to shift straight into another script in July. Repeat this process, and bam. I guess you're a filmmaker. 

5. la Finale: **The Industry.**
So here's my disclaimer: yes, I am a tad salty right now. Still trying to get this shit off of my chest. However, I don't want to sound pretentious in my words; I don't claim to know everything about filmmaking or about the industry, this is only my experience being a high school filmmaker in the heart of Texas. 
Therefore, allow me to talk a little about *the industry.* 
If you want to be in it, get your two-feet ready and have a thick-skull. Here's a case point: I have a job working as a production assistant for a local TV station. (I understand we're talking about film, but bear with me here, they work in a similar fashion.) We have an intern direct a live show one night. He tells me (who is operating a camera) to pan back and forth between an interviewer and an interviewee, *live.* I am very opposed to this given my meager years of experience and knowledge that many of the viewers we have for this particular show are senior citizens who will vomit if you tilt down to fix headroom while your shot is live. But what can I do? I'm a fucking P.A., the only high school student working at the station. I have to listen to him, so I do it. 
It looks like shit of course, jerking the camera as I try to follow the mic around, and constantly cutting whichever person was ""off-screen"" halfway-down the edge of the screen. Next day, I get a very polite badmouth from our producer who watched the show that night. Of course I'm pissed as fuck because this producer holds the word for my job in college (Hook 'em horns, class of '20). 
So let me try to relate this all back to the film industry. 
You have to be dominant, but not an asshole. After I received some criticism from my boss, I had a fiery discussion with our ""director"" in a closed room. Let's just say, no further stupid decisions were made in the control room. 

If you want to be in the industry, be in the industry. I constantly see my friends who ""want to be filmmakers"" and yet when I check-in on them, they're playing DOTA, LoL, jerking off, whatever the fuck you call it. Anything but that which relates to the industry. For fuck's sakes, if you want to be in this industry, *work* in it! As long as you're above 16 (I believe?) you're fair game to get on sets. Hell, I'm about to make the move out to West Texas for a week to work as a 1st AD. How did I get the job? I submitted to a local casting call. Never worked as an AD before, but hell, I'm learning now. 

Now, I understand those who may live far away from any production being called ""local"". And to you guys, I would say keep submitting to the closest one, and when you get the time, make the drive to get on-set. Not only is it fun as hell, but you meet people and you network. 75% of the people I have as my own ""crew"" I met through getting on the sets of others. And as they live so close to me and call me friend, they work for free (obviously I pay for meals and lodging, but you get the point). 

Well... that's it. 

Oh, some advice for those my age on this subreddit: 

-No, it doesn't matter what camera you use (as a matter of fact, I find things more interesting when a shitty camcorder is used and yet the cinematography + directing is on-point)

-No, it doesn't matter what film school is right for you (*you* make it right for yourself, just go somewhere that you can pay off)

-No, people on here can't help you find the right rig/lights/audio/dildo because only you can figure that for yourself. Do some google searching, YouTube watching, review reading. Figure out what you're going for and experiment. 

-And for the love of God, please don't invest all of your money into gear unless you want to turn your home into a rental house. Rent or borrow your gear if you can, but if you can't, buy only the basics: a camera and a mic. Save your money for better crew and cast (and please don't forget craft services). 

Let's end this on a happy note, shall we?

You may be wondering, how does my story end? It's March 12, 2016. I'm sitting at computer, rewriting the script that I wrote in 2015. I just cut my lead actor, I'm thinking of loglines for a casting call to replace him. I'm surprised (but also thankful) that my two other actors, and crew, are still on-board to finish this film. Set date for shooting: 4 consecutive days in the month of June, the last days before I move out to college. 

How do I feel? Fan-fucking-tastic, never been better. The industry is rough, but I have come to love it. At school, my friends poke at my choice of career, saying I'll be a hobo by the age of 25. I tell them ""Fuck you, have fun at your 9-5, 5 days a week job"". 

They laugh. 

I laugh harder. 

I have been told two things by two different people I met in the industry: one is that it is a gypsy lifestyle. You move around, it is seasonal: feast or famine. You have to learn to save your money and live unemployed for months at a time. But, you become a family with those you work with. Not only do you work together for 12+ hours a day, you eat with them and practically live with them. 

Second thing is this: what makes a filmmaker a filmmaker to the day he dies is **persistence**. If you keep making films until you die at 86 -- regardless of whether you win any awards, any festivals, or attain any fame whatsoever -- you'll die a filmmaker. And if that's not what you want, then don't waste your time and look for another career. 

I hope what I've learned can help somebody out there. 

And if anybody has anything to add to what I just said, feel free to do so. If you want to be an asshole and critique me, then fuck it. It wouldn't be the first time. 

**TL;DR: no fuck you, read my story.**"

4a55na,126,2016-03-12,"31 Days in the Help Queue, An Open Letter to Ben Irving and the Bioware Team.",S-Plantagenet,swtor,https://www.reddit.com/r/swtor/comments/4a55na/31_days_in_the_help_queue_an_open_letter_to_ben/,"Mr. Irving and the Bioware team,

I would like to start this by saying I greatly enjoy your game, Star Wars the Old Republic. No company puts the focus on storytelling like Bioware, no one. I enjoy the aspects of your stories and the interaction my character has within them.

I am one of you, I have played MMORPGs since 1997, and I have worked in the MMORPG industry off and on since 1998, for a total of about a decade of MMORPG work experience. We know a lot of the same people, hell we may have even worked together. I say this only to give you an idea of where I am coming from. I understand the back end, I know the pressures of the industry and I fully respect the position you are in currently.

SWTOR is an aging game, I am sure you have been told to 'do more with less' by senior executives that see this game as a balance sheet, rather than a passion, a profit margin, rather than an entertainment space for thousands.

I come to you with three issues, combined they have forced me to now leave your game, or at least stop giving you any money at all. I feel that the SWTOR company has violated several sacred trusts between a game company and their community and I have experienced them all within the past month.

I am sure at this point, many will stop reading. ""Oh, just another I quit Post!"" but that is not where I am coming from, please continue.

I have played your game off an on since Beta, I am a solo player and I play mostly for the story, I last quit when you stopped the 12x EXP bonus for Class Missions. Not because I was mad, but simply because Class missions is one of the major reason I played at that time and I wasn't into the farming and grind.

I returned to SWTOR about 2 months ago, I played through the new chapters and enjoyed myself in your playground. I was enjoying myself so much that I found my hardcore dark side main character softening a bit. Something I never expected.

I purchased about $150 in cartel coins for the new packs, mostly to pad my credits as I stepped into strongholds and possibly guild content, both of which, as a solo player I had never touched.

I ended up, after it was all said and done purchasing 4 hypercrates of the latest packs. I believe that is 21600 cartel coins, no small amount, for you or I.

During that time, you also had some inventory improvements which increased stack size and some other things. This also introduced quite a few bugs, and I am sure you all had several long nights in order to fix them.

I was affected greatly by the bug that involved using the 'sort buttons' losing the true 'value' of at least one Hypercrate I purchased, possibly two. As I was using the sort buttons quite a bit to condense items. When Items would disappear, I thought they were being shifted to other tabs as I made room due to the stacking limit increase.

By the time I realized what had happened I had lost millions. I submitted a help ticket on February 11th, 2016. I also made sure to alert others, both on Reddit and on the Official boards of the issue involving inventory deletion. Through my efforts (and yours) the issue was patched 4 days after I brought it to your attention.

http://i.imgur.com/dP91MCv.jpg

After it was patched, I messaged TaitWatson and Eric Musco through the official boards asking them about the bug, any restitution and giving them the ID# of my help ticket. I was ignored by both.

I have now been in the queue for 31 days, an entire month. I find it completely disgusting that your help system takes over a month to process a valid help ticket. Even if there is no restitution, or records of the items lost, even if the poor intern working the help queue is given no power or ability to help anyone with any real issues, an entire month to process means only one thing to me, that Bioware no longer actively supports SWTOR from a customer service point of view. I am curious how you can say otherwise with a straight face, the industry standard is 24 to 72 hours, a week is considered unacceptable... but a month? Really?

There is a sacred trust in MMOs, most MMos involve some sort of inventory/loot system, from Looter Shooters like Destiny, to Amusement Park MMOs like WoW, or Open World Sandboxes like EVE. One thing remains static, your inventory. You have loot, you have items, you have treasure and those items are yours within the scope of the game, there is a sacred trust there that says 'as long as this game is here, this stuff is yours'. When a bug violates that trust like this one did, bushing it under the rug and not even talking about it like it never happened does two things, first it completely destroys the trust between the player and the game company. Second it shows that the company involved holds the players at both a low standard and with little to no regard.

I cannot understand how you can feel that a 30 day help queue, and 'random' inventory deletions within your game environment are acceptable ways to do business. I cannot fathom it.

My third issue, that I have been assaulted with in these past two months has been talked and discussed to death, but I still feel it is again worth mentioning.

The Pack released in February was a complete manipulation of the player base, packs were behaving in ways they were NOT supposed to act according to the 'rules' stated on those packs. It should have been impossible for certain loot rolls to happen, but they were happening anyway. Several packs, the ONLY item in the pack was an emote, through a single chance cube. Technically should not have been able to happen at all, but it did, and it wasn't to just me. I left that pack release feeling like I had been scammed by Bioware, I understand RNG, I understand the purpose of the packs. However, your players should not leave any play session feeling as though they have been scammed out of Real Life Money.

I am the player you are targeting with your game design, the middle aged Star Wars fan, with a high disposable income, that enjoys story rich content. I am that guy, I am the 'whale' you are hoping to hook with your game. But you lost me, if I cannot trust you to be honest with me, if I cannot trust your game to not steal/delete my items, and I cannot trust you to back up your customer support team (or is it just one poor guy?) when things go wrong, why on earth would I continue to play your game or give you money at all?

I am sorry but in no way do I feel that the way you have treated me as a customer is acceptable, I think the way you have treated this community is disgusting. I might pop in and play for free, but you will never get another penny from me for SWTOR unless you repair both your reputation and the trust between your customers and yourselves.

Good day,

Darth Hestur

TL;DR: OP believes that Bioware has violated the sacred trust between the customer base and the company through random inventory deletions, lack of customer support and manipulation/deception of 'packs'. OP will not be giving SWTOR another penny.

**Update: As of 3/17 this issue has been resolved after help from /u/emusco and the support team. All items have been successfully found and returned (28 items total). Hopefully this situation is used in a way to avoid 30+ day wait times on support tickets for all users in the future.**"

I am about to graduate this spring semester with a 3.0 in an IT related degree, Informatics.  I have a few internships experience through my state university.  The reason for my low GPA is due to my untreated ADD that I've lived with for so long.  It is difficult for me to stay in a spot and consume 10+ pages of literature without medication.  I had to take 5 summer courses just to bump my GPA up and that shit was expensive for my parents (sad face).  Adderall has been saving me.  I'm trying to not get addicted to them but damn do I love Adderall sometimes.  It really helps sustain my love for books and learning new concepts/ideas.  This semester, I have been on top of my schoolwork and even finishing extra credit assignments.  I have really decided to change my mentality of taking school very seriously.

The truth is, I feel like I have missed out on a great education.  I want to go to an Ivy League school because I believe that they are the best of the best when it comes to schooling.  I wouldn't know what to do pursuing a Masters degree.  In addition, I am still trying to learn better habits of studying, reading and taking notes.  I think that graduate studies will cost more because I wouldn't be able to apply for scholarships with a low GPA.  The goal is to pursue Ivy League education (columbia or cornell).  I already know that MOST of you will say NO to a second bachelor and yes to a Masters.  I am a little concerned about pursuing graduate studies because I recently changed my mentality and habits towards schoolwork (and addy) but I know that I can excel if I work really really hard.  Basically, I want to take a few more extra years to build up a solid application for grad school.  If I were to pursue a second bachelor, I might go the Finance route.  I might be able to convince my parents to financially support me for a second Bachelor degree.

My question is... when I graduate, should I go for a second bachelors at another school, work hard and do well (3.8+ gpa), and apply for grad school/law school at an Ivy league institution?  What is my best strategy really?

Cops got involved however legally everything was going really well (just had to pay fines) until I found out that the apartment complex complained to HR that they want me out of here (I get housing through the company). So work found out about the incident.

With this interview coming up, should I let them know everything that's going on? Obviously if I did, I would do so in a matter of treating it as a learning process."

Well here i ran into a problem for some reason Netflix decided i am using a proxy? So naturally i thought this is a mishap something i can contact Netflix and thy'll sort it all out for me.
Well no. I get in chat and all i get is that i need to restart my modem and as i'm staying in a hostel and using the hostels public connection you can see how iv'e run into a problem.

Unfortunately even contacting the hostels management is not possible as its late at night.

So i had an idea lets test the proxy or something i just ended up throwing Hola extension on my chrome and wow what do you know i can watch Netflix?

How screwed up can the proxy detection be that i actually have to use a proxy to be able to get to the content that i have paid for that also prohibits the use of proxy.

Sincerely pissed off customer."

4a62yv,759,2016-03-12,I transformed my entire life in 7 months. Here's my story so far. Thanks for everything /r/seduction.,jimmiereese3327,seduction,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/4a62yv/i_transformed_my_entire_life_in_7_months_heres_my/,"Last month when my internship was over people started crying because I was leaving the company. It was the most amazing feeling I ever had, it meant I've made one hell of an impact on those people that I didn't even know 6 months before. It was a very beautiful day for me, during my train-ride home I looked back at what I achieved and I was damn proud of myself. When I was saying my goodbyes to the people of the company all of them kept telling me to never change, to always stay myself, that the world needed more people like me; a unique and fresh personality, extremely positive and fun, unforgettable and even addictive to hang out with. I burst down in tears after they gathered around me and when I saw their emotional faces, It was a mission-accomplished for me, I knew I could do it but not this quickly.

You see; if those people saw me 8 months earlier they would've found a very introverted guy with very few friends. Up until recently I never had many friends, I had around 30 phone numbers on my phone, 14 of those numbers were family. Friday-nights people of my age would go out clubbing, having sex and getting drunk while I could be found at the university-library until closing-time of 11pm, just reading and studying on my own. If people told me what I did on friday-evening I would tell them a stupid lie. I was already into self-improvement at that time and read some books about the subject. But I never applied the info. 

I was fighting a battle against myself, I constantly felt that I was letting myself down for not living up to my true potential and not showing the world who I really am. I was afraid of what people would think of me if I was my true self to be honest. Some time passed and some negative things happened in my life, then in June I did something out of nowhere: I told my best friend I had feelings for her, it was the first time I told a girl I liked her. She turned me down hard. I was done to be honest. The knock-out punch came a couple of days later when I found out she had started a relationship with another dude that she knew for 2 months, I found out through facebook. To just finish it off: I actually apologised to her for telling her I had feelings for her, she ignored my messages and I stopped trying after about 3 days. 

I was exhausted, confused but very angry at myself. Looking back it was the best thing that ever happened to me, it opened my eyes and it motivated me into becoming who I am right now. It made me realise that all of the things I was doing was just spiritual suicide. I wasn't making choices that I wanted to make, I was doing what was expected from me instead of what I actually wanted. It really was the best thing to ever happen to me, I was so done with being used, with being overlooked, with being sad about myself, that when she ignored me something in me just decided like 'nope, this won't be you anymore. You're going to be happy again from now. You're going to take care of yourself again. You're going to be fucking awesome because you have greatness in you.' I then asked myself how could I expect others to love me if I didn't even love myself in the first place? So that's exactly what I did: I started loving myself, every single flaw that I had I loved: My sometimes socially awkward behaviour, my spontaneity, my perspective of the world, everything about myself I started loving. I donated all of my clothes to charity and started fresh again, All of the clothes and shoes I have now I didn't have 7 months ago. I started taking care of my skin and started saying whatever was on my mind, I didn't say what people expected me to say anymore. I bought cologne I liked and used it. My diet improved in both quality and quantity and I gained 7kg in 2 months time (which is great because my weight was 61kg/134lbs and my height is 187cm/6ft2) and in about two months time it was like I was reborn. I was full of positivity, happiness, energy and ideas. I was happy with myself again. Mentally it was like I was a new person, I was loving myself. Now I was curious to see how the new me would perform in this world. During those two months I only hanged out alone or with direct-family, I didn't see any of my friends. In the period of June until August I used my phone only once, that was when my best friend called to apologise for her 'bitchy' behaviour, old me would've said something like 'no I understand you were under a lot of pressure and bla bla bla shit that she wants to hear but that I would regret saying', I responded by saying what I wanted to say; 'I accept your apology, that was really bitchy and selfish of you though.' She responded with that she was really sorry and that she wanted to meet up very soon, I turned down the offer and told her I was busy until at least the end of August, I ended the conversation really quick.

On the 7th of september we saw each other again for the first time in 2 months time. Her mouth was wide open when she saw me and she immediately took notice of the physical changes, she complimented me on my smell and dress-style. we went for a walk and we had something to eat, we talked for over 5 hours and I noticed she was touching me way more often than she did first, she was laughing a lot more to the jokes I was telling as well. When we both had to go home she told me one thing that I will never forget:"" You've changed a lot. Not just the way you look but there is something about you that has changed, maybe for the better. You look better, not because of the clothes or smell, I don't know, you've gotten taller I think, I don't know(I didn't, I just bought clothes that actually fit me and were slimmer/complemented my height) but you've got something about you, it's like a glow. It's a very good thing."" When I got home I got a message from her that was just beautiful, I didn't make a screenshot of the message unfortunately, but it was something in the lines of ""Today was very weird to be honest. I had an amazing time with you but it was a very different you. It was like I was talking to a stranger, but then again not. It's very confusing but you've really changed a lot in a very short time. The old you was perfect in my opinion, but the new you is exciting, raw and fresh, different."" Then she said something about that she wasn't understanding why she was complimenting me so much and that she was going to bed. At midnight she sent me another message about if I wanted to hang out again ASAP.

I'm still seeing her but I have no feelings for her anymore, she's my best friend and I'm happy with her being that.
But now let's go back to about 2 weeks ago: It was the first time in 8 months time that I returned to school and the first time schoolmates got to experience the 'new' me. Some people didn't even know of my existence until that day, some actually asked if I was new. One girl gave me her phone-number and I didn't ask for it, 2 other girls added me on snapchat so people really seem to like me now. 
The funny thing is that I'm not model-looking, Most of the changes happened mentally to be honest. And that has brought me so far already, I'm like a magnet to people and it feels amazing.

This is it so far guys. The lessons I have learned are the following:

 -Being perfect/the nice guy isn't going to get you far in your life, perfection is overrated. Be natural, if you have flaws don't be afraid to show them, it's the rough edges that people like.

-Get comfortable being uncomfortable, this will make your entire life MUCH easier. Growth only happens when you push yourself out of your comfortzone. There are no shortcuts to success.

-Behaving attractive helps a lot. With this I mean that your behaviour should be of high-value. Be yourself, don't follow the crowd. Do what you want, have interesting hobbies. Don't settle for what is expected but go for what you really want instead. Say what you think, become bold and don't change yourself for a girl. Have some values in your life. TIP: Read Models by Mark Manson, the book was life-changing for me!!!

-Looking attractive helps a lot as well. Buy clothes that fit, develop a personal style (if you need help go over to /r/malefashionadvice, that sub has inspired me a lot). Buy cologne and use it and treat your body good. Eat healthy food and drink water, get a healthy BMI, take care of your skin.

-Never aim to become better than another person, Aim to become better than you were yesterday.

-your biggest enemy in life is between your ears. Everything that you want in your life is achievable, you are worthy of the very best this world has to offer and you have what it takes to get it. Don't let negative thoughts hold you back of greatness because you do deserve it and you can do it!

To all the posters of /r/seduction: Thank you very much for helping me out by adding helpful content to this sub. Thanks for helping me finding myself and enjoying life again.

One last thing: A month or so ago I made a motivational post on /r/seduction and asked if people were interested in a whatsapp-group. A lot of people responded and the group was created. It's been over a month that the group is live now and since whatsapp has extended the amount of people allowed in a group I'm more than happy to add people who are interested.
Thanks for reading and have a great life!!

Edit: For the people that send me their phone-numbers it might take a while before I can contact you because I'm simply too busy right now, I have send you guys a message back with my number to contact me. 

Edit 2: Thanks for the reddit-gold!

Edit 3: I might submit another post in the near-future about how I was able to pull my change off as more people are sending me messages about how I did it. 

Edit 4: I can't answer all questions you guys messaged me, I've received over 80 new messages since last night. "
4a64x3,23,2016-03-12,[Spoilers[ Meredith and Jo,Misha726,greysanatomy,https://www.reddit.com/r/greysanatomy/comments/4a64x3/spoilers_meredith_and_jo/,"So it looks like things finally boil over next week or at least from Jo's end and if Jo lashes out on Meredith, I think she's being unreasonable. 

Yes, the Meredith/Alex relationship is probably very irritating for Jo, but that's as much on Alex as Meredith and it seems like it's been toned down. We haven't seen Meredith barge on Alex and Jo since they moved to the firehouse (and I think part of her lack of boundaries came from her considering it ""her"" house still and the fact that the house was always everyone's safe place) and she's been at least semi-encouraging of their relationship: hiding the ring, sending Alex back to work things out. In season 11 there was a lack of boundaries, but not so much now. 

So what does Jo expect of Meredith? Is she upset because Meredith isn't friendly to her? That she doesn't invite her to pizza nights along with Alex? Jo is a resident (5th year I think) and Meredith is an attending, they're not equals.  

I remember that Mark, Owen and Derek used to hang out separately from the interns. I don't remember Derek ever really hanging out with Meredith's friends, except with her. Bailey and Meredith became equals and friends, but it took time. Callie was always less of a superior, but that was partially because of her relationship with George. The George/Burke friendship (and I guess the Jackson/Mark mentorship) are the only real examples I can think of attendings and residents hanging out. 

Professionally they haven't worked together all that much and it doesn't seem like Jo is particularly inclined towards General. Maybe Meredith isn't super respectful, but again, Jo is a resident, Meredith is an attending, she doesn't have to treat her as an equal, because they're not. 

Could Meredith be nicer to Jo? Definitely. But does she HAVE to be? I don't think so. I haven't seen her been outright rude this season and I think having a non-relationship is perfectly fine. "
4a6eyb,1,2016-03-12,"Soon-to-be Electrical Engineering Graduate, Feeling Kinda Down About Not Having A Job Offer Yet, Advice?",arcanition,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/4a6eyb/soontobe_electrical_engineering_graduate_feeling/,"Alright, so I'll try to keep my life story short and sweet. The main point is that I'm in my last semester of my bachelor's in electrical engineering. I have a cumulative GPA of 3.704 as well as two summer internships while I've been in college. I have multiple projects (including my senior design project) to demonstrate my problem-solving, teamwork, and leadership skills.

That all being said, I *still* don't have a job offer for when I graduate in about two months. Most of my peers that I know have had offers for a couple of months now from great companies. I've been applying to positions starting after I graduate constantly for the past 6 months or so. My resume (with contact information removed) can be seen [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B9ywyKy8YIRiLW43LVUzVEpJMU0/view?usp=sharing).

I've had interviews for about 8-10 companies. Three of these companies I went through the entire process, even through the last ""final on-site interview"" for all three, but then received ""we will not be extending a job offer to you at this time"" emails for each one. I don't believe I'm that bad at interviewing, I'm very outspoken and have been complimented on my interviewing (latest of the three companies had feedback that said ""you did quite well with the behavioral questions and provided great detail, keep it up"").

I really don't know which part of the process I'm failing at. I believe that my credentials, experience, and skills are comparatively good to the other students I know that have received offers. Could you guys offer any advise?"
4a6vuh,9,2016-03-12,25M beginning to have doubts about the career I've wanted for as long as I can remember.,sts816,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/4a6vuh/25m_beginning_to_have_doubts_about_the_career_ive/,"For as far back as I can remember, I've been fascinated with space and space exploration. I've always been a bit of a tinkerer as well. Every time I got a new gadget or my family got a new appliance, I had to know how it worked. The idea of using something day in and day out without understanding it seemed abhorrent to me. This was back in middle and high school. So once high school started drawing to a close, I naturally gravitated towards engineering as a college major. Mechanical engineering, to be specific. At this point I was still 110% sure of what I wanted to do. 

Fast forward 4 years and I graduate with good grades but with no internship experience. I naively thought companies would be throwing offers at my left and right because of the ""STEM shortage"". Boy was I wrong. It took me 7 months *after*graduation to finally get a job that paid $28k. Those were an awful 7 months laced with self doubt, second guesses, and worry. I was pissed off at the idea of making $28k with a 3.5 GPA in engineering but my first loan payments were due soon so I took the job. 

I never broke stride in my job search though despite actually having a job at that point. I was applying to better jobs the same afternoon that I accepted that offer. Within the first week of working I knew the job was going to be terrible. Mind numbing, tedious paperwork followed by cleaning up algae build up from the industrial size refrigerators. Not exactly what I had in mind for a first ""career"" move. Not only did the work itself bother me but the structure of employment really got under my skin. I hated punching that time clock every day. I hated that my lunch time was dictated to me like I was 8 years old. I hated being an *employee*. 

After 7 months there, I finally landed what I thought was the best job I could get in town. It wasn't in aerospace like I wanted but my title would be Design Engineer. This would be a real stepping stone to an engineering position with an aerospace company. My long term plans were falling into place. Finally, a real title with real engineering involved. I was psyched. I joyfully gave my 2 weeks notice and loved seeing the look of shock on my manager's face. ""You're leaving?? But why? I can't imagine why! We pay you less than half an entry level engineer's salary to clean water up off the floor!"" Okay, that last part was my own addition. 

I waltz into my new job looking like [this](http://img2.timeinc.net/people/i/2014/sandbox/news/140811/leonardo-dicaprio-1-435.jpg). After a couple months, I drag myself in looking like [this](http://practicallyviral.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/DiCaprio-Crying.jpg). Turns out, that job wasn't nearly as amazing as I thought it would be. I'm still doing mind-numbingly simple work that I could teach to a lobotomized, autistic cow. Even worse, I am chained to my desk for 8 hours every. single. day. I stare at the computer screen dreaming up creative ways to kill myself at the office. 

""I could throw myself out the window."" 

""How many pricks to the jugular vein with a thumbtack would it take to kill me?"" 

""Maybe I could drown myself in the toilet...""

That desk is where happiness, satisfaction, and fulfillment go to die a slow painful death. At 4:30pm every day, I log my time and every time I punch in that ""8"" into the hours field, I can't help but think that's 8 hours of my life wasted. 8 hours of my life that I'll never get back. 8 hours that I could have spent traveling. 8 hours I could have spent meeting new people. 

Travel. 

Now there's a way to live. Back in school during my last summer I made the easy decision to backpack through Europe for 5 weeks instead of chasing down that elusive internship. Easily the best decision I've ever made. Every day was a new adventure with new people in the hostel, new food, new sites and new experiences. I truly felt like I was living life as it was meant to be experienced. Being rather poor growing up, I had never even been on a plane let alone been out of the country. ""Vacations"" were always to Illinois to hang out with my dad for a week or two. This trip was like nothing I ever experienced and haven't since. There isn't a day that goes by I don't think about that trip. Even now when I'm getting on a plane to visit my mom and sister down in Georgia for holidays, I can't help but be pulled back in time to my first experience in an airport. I absolutely love airports now because they remind me that trip. I love seeing all the interesting people and wondering where they might be going or what adventures they're about to embark on. I love airports because of all the *potential* they have. I could travel to anywhere in the world from an airport and that excites me. The big monitors flash before as I walk to my gate. Los Angeles. Denver. Hong Kong. London. Berlin. Singapore. Munich. 

The problem with travel? It flies in the face of the lifestyle my desired career offers me. 2 weeks of vacation time a year is hardly enough time to see the world. Hell, I need at least a week of that just visiting family for the holidays. That leaves me with at most 5 days to really travel. After seeing 9 countries in 5 weeks, spending 5 days or so in one location won't exactly scratch that itch. Especially when I know it'll be another year before I can hope to do it again. That's the really depressing part. Now it seems my two desires are pitted against in each in my mind. I can pursue some sort of lifestyle that allows me to travel and likely do irreparable damage to the career I've always wanted. Or go down the comfortable, stable path that might get me to designing rockets at some point in the future. 

How do I choose my path?"

4a70gc,33,2016-03-12,Career without a degree?,body_reddit,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4a70gc/career_without_a_degree/,"I'm 19 years old, black, uneducated, and honestly sick of my life. I've spent the last 2 years taking an odd collection of classes at community college, working part-time, and dealing with depression.

Over the past few months, I've began programming and I'm interested in it as a career. What I find most appealing is that tech seems like a very meritocratic career. If you can do the work and have demonstrable examples of your skills, you'll find a job. I have around $5,000 saved up and I can live with my parents indefinitely. I've though a lot about studying and programming full time at home, going to meetup groups, building up my resume with projects, finding an unpaid internship, and eventually progressing into a real job. 

Is this possible? Is a degree absolutely required? The reason I'm hesitant to go to college is due to rising tuition costs and a fear of not finding work after college. My parents are too wealthy for me to qualify for loans.

Here are my questions:

1. Is self-studying and creating projects a viable way to progress towards a career?
2. Are companies moving towards requiring degrees from all candidates?
3. What is labor market like? Is there a shortage, surplus, or normal supply of developers? 
4. What does the market look like it'll become? 

Right now my ""plan"" if any is to get much more serious about learning. I have enough money to purchase a variety of courses on the educational sites, along with CS textbooks, and course material.

Assuming, I did work through Computer Science textbooks and the material covered in CS program, what would I be missing? I've taken and passed Calc 2. Is the material in a CS program too difficult to self-study alone?

Thank you for all the help."

And I digress.
He talks about race, but beyond a racial and class divide I think there is something crooked about our society today. It may stem from technology being at an all time high, and a lack of community. There is so much competitiveness in our society. We are defined by what we are doing professionally or in school. It leads to a drive for success and educational opportunities, but you can go through 4 years of college and graduate with honors and still not have any idea how you will be successful as you can't find a job and you don't know your passion. A college degree is like what a high school degree used to be. And in this world as a youngn and even beyond, you have jobs and internships where you stare at a computer screen all day. Skills like programming are maybe more useful than a college degree, but I would imagine those jobs don't have much human interaction. Is there a sense of community left in America? Is it just hard to feel when you're 22? This election season is obviously showing how America has an ugly face"

Hello, thank you for taking the time to read this update.  

I feel like the guys noticed that Seamus started uploading and went full tryhard mode to outdo him. ( I'm looking at Jordan and Dex) I love it since they provide so much content that I was unable to watch! I had some exams this week and I did pretty good. Had a rough start before the exams but it got better and better and here we are today.  
If you have any feedback/ideas contact me or /u/LeonZetineb     
Thanks again and I hope you had a great week and an awesome upcoming one!

4a7fs5,3,2016-03-13,Short term project vs spending that time applying? With a deadline approaching.,BinghamL,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4a7fs5/short_term_project_vs_spending_that_time_applying/,"Hi guys, 

I'm in the same boat as many others right now. I graduate this June and don't have a job lined up yet. I should also mention that I HAVE to move by the first week of June. I had an internship at a medium/large logistics company over summer '15. It sounds like they might be interested in hiring, but I have yet to receive an official offer. I don't think they're in a position to to do so when I'm months from being able to start (small dev team, only 4 total devs). I am still in contact with them though since it's in the same building as where I currently work. 

I've sent my resume to 3 other companies as kind of a trial run. So far I've received one rejection, one no answer, and one company asked me to take an online coding challenge after which they rejected me.

I'm pretty sure the only major problem with my resume is that I don't have any personal projects outside of schoolwork. There's two reasons for that: The first one is that I've had to work and support myself through school, so time is in short supply. The other one is, honestly, just a lack of ideas. I can't think of anything within my skill range + time requirements that would impress a potential employer or represent my skill accurately. 

One nice thing is that this coming quarter I only have to attend part time (it's all I need to graduate) so I'll have a little more time. I'm trying to decide if I should throw some kind of project together in the next 2-3 weeks then start applying, or spend that time focusing on getting more applications out. After those 2-3 weeks I will only have two months to get all the way through an interview process and be moved into a new place. During those 2-3 weeks I would be able to work on either for around 30 hours total. Of course a project couldn't amount to much with only 30 hours, but I could sure get a lot of applications out there in the same amount of time.

That's why I come to you guys. I know I'll ultimately have to make the decision myself, but I would value some input. Do you think sacrificing ~30 hours of applications for a small app/project (of recent grad 'skill') would be worth it, or given my small sample application history, do you think I should focus that time on actually getting a job with what I already have?"
4a7hxt,2,2016-03-13,Moved to Middle East to be with SO/Got Dumped,porkotaloo,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/4a7hxt/moved_to_middle_east_to_be_with_sogot_dumped/,"I made a throw away to post this.

A year ago in Montreal I met the girl of my dreams. A beautiful, intelligent, sexy girl from North Africa. We started dating, and everything was amazing. She was in love with me, and I with her.

We both finished school, and the world was our oyster. I knew she was moving back home to pursue internships, and I wasn't sure what I was going to do myself. However, when she managed to get an internship at the UN in Beirut, I decided I would meet her. I am a journalist, and the Middle East has always been extremely interesting to me.

But shortly after I got here, things went bad. She didn't love me anymore, and she wanted to be alone, to see other people. This was after months of a really strong long distance relationship. Before, she was the one who was crazy about me, and in only a few weeks in Beirut, everything fell apart.

Now I'm still here. I'm out of money, and we no longer live together. I don't know what to do anymore. I'm still not over her, at all. I know it's only a breakup, but it's been hard. I still see her on occasion, and she is having fun, enjoying life. I'm lonely and depressed. 

I feel like a total fucking failure. I moved here not only for love, but to pursue a career. Now I'm just broke and alone and on the other side of the world.

Just wanted to get it off my chest. I haven't told my parents or friends back home -- who are proud of me and what they think I've accomplished. 

I don't know what to do."
4a7ptj,0,2016-03-13,He [28/m] is worried to try distance with me [27/f],LoseThePast,LongDistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/4a7ptj/he_28m_is_worried_to_try_distance_with_me_27f/,"I met a really amazing guy on OkCupid a month ago and we talk every day all day - from the time he gets off work to the time he goes to sleep and on the weekends from the time he wakes to the time he falls asleep...probably around 100 or so texts a day.
When we first started talking I had just had bad luck with another guy and I've only been out of my long term (abusive) relationship for 3 months now and I told him I wasn't sure if I was ready for a new relationship - but I am now!
He said that was okay and that he was worried about the distance but we could talk as friends and see what comes of it.
That was three weeks ago, I know him a lot better now.
We finally met today and had a great date, at the end he gave me a hug and started to walk away. I grabbed his hand and he said ""did you want a kiss?"" I said ""I was thinking about it."" So we kissed (he said he wasn't use to kissing on first dates).

But when he got home we started talking and he says he has reservations about our distance and has never driven that far (3.5hrs) and is worried he'd have car trouble and then have no way to get to work (he has a 2010 Ford, I have a 2002 Ford). He did say that it didn't mean that he didn't like me though, he just wished I lived in his city.

I have previously had a relationship with a guy in his same city and I never minded traveling, and I tried to see him (my ex) two weekends a month.

I'm only this far until August because I'm doing an internship, then I go back to college which will put us an hour closer. 

But I feel like I'm going to loose this great guy because of my internship, and I was wondering of anybody had any advice? Maybe something to help sooth his concerns?

Has anybody else ever experienced this? :-/"
4a89f7,1,2016-03-13,23 M4F The Fratboy and the First Year,ldnby92,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/4a89f7/23_m4f_the_fratboy_and_the_first_year/,"Welcome to Hudson University, home of some of America's smartest and wealthiest young people. And at Hudson there is one frat that reins supreme, where the brothers are smarter, stronger and more privileged then any of their rivals. And boy do they know it.

The line stretches down the block as students wait to enter Alpha Sigma's first party of the semester. I stand on the doorstep of the opulent fraternity mansion, arms folded in a way that shows off my bulging biceps and rippled chest. The collar on my Abercrombie polo is up, obviously, and I scan the line for any lithe young pickings that I could have fun with. I dumped my Theta slampiece over the summer - I said I had to focus more on my Goldman Sachs internship, but the real reason was I was just... bored of her. Who knows what I'll find tonight? Maybe a girl truly worth showing off to the high society I had been born into...
____________________________________________________
Hey, thanks for reading! So the premise of this roleplay is pretty simple. I want to play a douchey, All-American frat bro who gets to corrupt and use a naive young first year. You could be a spoiled, stuck-up legacy blonde, a small-town busty brunette or even an ebony/latina girl who'd never dream she'd abandon her people to suck on the cock of a rich white guy. So long as you're creative and imaginative, I'm game!

This can be played short-term, but what I'd really like to do is create a little world of opulence and privilege. I want to seduce your character with promises of the high-life, taking you to all sorts of exclusive events and country clubs, all the while making you into a more and more depraved slut. By the end of it I want you to be my bimbo, a good, obedient little girl who smiles and sticks her chest out while the men discuss business.

Detail, creativity and good grammar are key. I'm pretty open to most kinks and this scene can go from plain vanilla to extremely dark.

Hope to hear from you!"

I'm currently trying to get an internship within a production company, since I don't have any tv/film experience this seems like a good start. I've done numerous videos and it's definitely something I want to work with in the future. I mostly want to work with cinematography!

If I finish this internship, what can I do next? It would be amazing if they ""hired"" me, but the guy I talked to said that you can't get hired in this industry, it's mostly freelancing. I've seen people write about working as a PA, it seems difficult to get paid to work on a set though.

Is it possible to get a full-time job within the industry as a newbie?

I've also gotten the chance to help on a project as a camera assistant, even though I have no experience they said I would learn a lot. It's nonpaid and only one day. Should I keep finding projects to help and get lucky if they want to pay? How do you take the next step from being a PA?

So many questions and a lot of confusion... Hope someone out there can help!

Thanks"

I am more than happy to send a resume upon request. Really open to doing anything. I would love any sort of analysis, coding, or trading. Taught myself some Python this past week (for anyone looking to learn a new coding language, I highly recommend HackerRank as it is free and comprehensive), but I also have experience in Java, and I am quite good with excel (albeit minimal experience with VBA/macros). If anyone here knows a friend that is hiring, I would love to send a resume. Thanks!"
4a998x,21,2016-03-13,"Graduated last year (Finance), struggled with depression now I want to give myself a chance. I need advice / guidance",financeknick,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/4a998x/graduated_last_year_finance_struggled_with/,"Hello everyone, 

I graduated in May of 2015 with a Bachelor's in Finance. I didn't do too much networking but I still have some friends from college that I remained in contact with. Unfortunately, most of them moved out of state. I did not do an internship during college but I held two part time jobs (server in a chain restaurant / front desk at a nursing home) which I currently still have.


When I graduated, I was not in a good place. So many things happened in the span of a few months. My pet had been killed in a car accident, my significant other of 6 years cheated on me, my father was told he might have cancer. I know there was more but those were the main 3 as far as I remember. This all caused me to stop caring about everything and I fell into a deep depression and I half-assed my way out of my final semester.

I did not enjoy my graduation and I did not feel happy with myself whatsoever. I have had low self esteem for quite sometime. But things have changed drastically in a year. I have a new significant other who is amazing and nothing like the last, I have accepted but forgotten the loss of my pet, and my father was told he was cancer free! I started therapy and I am taking medication for depression and also for my lack of focus. My self esteem has also gone up significantly.

I have now decided I have fought my inner demons and I am ready to start the job hunt. My main goal is to get a full time job in anything even remotely related to finance. I am in the NJ/NY area so I know that means a lot of competition but I hope it means a lot of opportunities as well.

I need advice on where to start, and most importantly, what skills I need to sharpen up on in Finance. I need to know what is mainly expected of me in interviews so that I can refresh my memory. I still have most of my textbooks, and slides given to me by professors that I can review. I wish I had not taken a year off but things happen and better late than never, I guess.

Thank you very much for anyone who has any advice for me and I apologize for the long post. "

Currently I'm attending a community college while working a full-time job as door security, and am trying to learn Assembly language through reading ""Programming From the Ground Up"" by Jonathan Bartlett (HIGHLY recommend this book to anyone new to programming/ASM in general, by the way).
 
So far I've only taken general education curriculum credits, nothing specifically towards a career in Information Security. However, in the meantime I'd really like to get my foot in the door so to speak and begin in either an internship of some sort with any kind of networking related job or systems administration-type place where I can get some practical, real-world experience.
 
Those of you who are perhaps much older and more experienced in the field, what would you advise applying for/doing/reaching for to begin down the path of attaining experience at essentially ANY job related to these things and gain experience with Networking + Systems Administration without any previous job history of such?"

I've got a pretty big problem and I could be in a very different place emotionally if I didn't let this man keep dragging me into his emotional mess again and again.

First of all, I'm painfully aware that I'm in an emotionally abusive relationship, I've acknowledged all the signs and seen the red flags all the way, but decided to stick with him anyways, god knows why...

It started a year ago in spring time. We met through mutual friends on a day out and hit it off right away. I decided to give the whole one-night-stand thing a try and went home with him. He was head over heels for me and asked me out on a date the next day and I thought why not... 

I ended up falling for him shortly after and he asked me to be his girlfriend eventually. He gave me the keys to his apartment, made sure I had space to put my things and introduced me to all of his friends and family. We are a great match intellectually and found out we have the same goals for a family and the things we want in life.
We also have great sexual chemistry, which is not exactly helpful now. 

He was in the process of graduating with a masters degree last summer and because our careers are relevant to each other and I had a little spare time in the evening and weekends after my internship I gladly helped him with his final project. That was when his anger first started to show, as he has a very short temper. 

He was getting frustrated and often yelled at me while I was only there to help him. I decided to stick it out and suck it up, because he needed me. One time he even threw some paper at me and it wasn't even about me, just about the work. So I left the place and he asked me if that meant I was breaking up with him. I simply said no.

But i never got an apology for it. Also not for the time he slammed his laptop shut out of frustration in a skype call while I was explaining a photoshop issue to him that he needed for his work.

At that time I put him aside and said that this was no way of treating your girlfriend and I was not going to let myself be treated like that, but he got stand offish and said I had to see for myself what i make of it, as this is simply the way he is.

He would be perfectly sweet for the most time and then freak out to a scary degree over a political issue or about peoples actions. One time I got hit by a cyclist on the walk way and he kept going on about me having to grab that person and punsh their teeth out the next time I saw them, while I just wanted a little vent and comfort about the situation.

In fall right after he graduated and I started my first full time job I broke my arm with him being present. He was super sweet to me for the first week and practically bathed me and cut my food for me. Then I needed a little more support because my roommates and I had decided to give up the apartment and I was looking for my first own place. While I had the feeling he wanted to move into a new place with me, he never said anything directly. And once I found an apartment him and his friends did the whole move for me.

A week later he freaked out when he signed the contract for a fulltime job in our city. Said it had all been too much, he couldn't do it anymore and we would disagree on everything anyways (disagree here means him going mental about a political topic and me getting uncomfortable wanting to change the topic)

He refused to talk about it further and said he would think about it, after he took  the keys from me. I was devastated, I had just a week prior told him I loved him and he responded that he did too.

I was a mess in my new apartment without wifi or a finished decor and was crying every night. Less than a week later he texted me like nothing was wrong. Asked me to come over for food and to stay the night. When I arrived at his place I expected a talk about the issues. But I was so confused about him acting like nothing ever happened that i just joined in. 

He took me to his mothers birthday in his home village a week later. And after I helped the family with the preparations and had to sit through the whole family small talk I couldn't take it anymore.

I put him aside after the party and asked him to tell me all was good again, because I needed to hear it. He acted confused, said that he thought I would Know that by just being here with his family, that he loved me and I shouldn't always worry so much. Everything was great... 

I tried to avoid topics that would make him mad, tried to not do anything wrong around the house, because even though I cooked every meal and cleaned up in his apartment afterwards, he would also get mad if I loaded the dishwasher wrong or left a light on when I left after him. In return to my eggshell walking he didn't get mad so much. He was just complaining a lot, about things that hurt him (knee, back, head, tummy etc) or that annoyed him in the world.

New years ever was weird again. We went out with some friends and at midnight he didn't kiss me. I was really tipsy and acted pissed about it and he got pissed about that. Then we had a drunk talk in street corner where he apologized and I asked him if he could say that he loved me (it was only said those two times before, I had to address it both times) 

He said that it was very hard for him and he thought it was too far fetshed to say it already, as he had never said it to anyone and he wasn't too big on expressing feelings (he's only had one girlfriend before, long distance, then three years of singleness before me) That crushed me. 

I thought this meant the end, but he started talking a lot about how he loved being with me and such, then he took me home and put me to sleep while I was contemplating just leaving with my stuff.

But after that it seemed okay. I told myself I just had to wait for him to be ready to say it and he asked me to come over to his place every day. We planned our vacations for the whole year together (his idea) started planning ways we could safe money to build a future together and I cought him once looking at apartments for the two of us. We were constantly making plans on how to furnish our shared future home as we both love interior design and kitchen supplies.

A month ago everything went to shambles again. 

Out of the blue he ignored me for two days. I tried to give him some space as I know he can freak out at times. But when he asked me to come over I knew it was serious. He gave me a list of what was wrong with the both of us again. He didn't like the way I watch what I eat and dress nice and wear make up, he can't take it when I place things differently than he does and he is sick of spending the night with somebody. he just can't be physically close anymore and he can't contain himself anymore. Like in his head he explodes a thousand times more often than on the outside, get's mad about everything and anyone. 

And he knows there's something wrong with him, but he doesn't want to work on it, it would be best we break up now so he could stop thinking that I would leave him any day for being so complicated.

I was crying but didn't know what to do. I said I had always wanted to help him with his issues and I just wish he would see things differently.

Then he told me I should decide where we go from here. But I just couldn't do anything about it anymore. i packed up everything and left it in a bag (it was too much to carry for me) and went to a friends house.

Two days later he calls me up and asks me if he should drop off my stuff. i say okay, he comes by with lunch for the both of us. Then he hangs out on my couch for three hours and tells me, he had gotten some stuff out of the bag. 

If I wanted to get them the next day. 

I still wanted to be close to him so I agreed but was very confused. He kept texting me like before then. I come by his place the next day and he invites me to stay. Throughout the afternoon he tricks me to lie down with him, we kiss and end up having sex. 

I'm more confused than ever and wait for him to say something along the lines of ""this was a mistake, let's work on it together"" but nothing, just chit chatting throughout the week.

One night I ignored him and he freaked out, going from pissed to overly worried within an hour. 

I try not to be so available and don't come over to his place when he simply hints at it. He then asks me directly on the weekend and we cook together, go out with his friends at night (no one knew about us being broken up) and he asks me to spend the night together. I stay all sunday and we have the best of times, without talking about issues again. 

I know this is just as much my mistake, but he just has his way of making me feel like I could never say anything. 

I decide to try and make it feel normal again and his mood drops again. I finally bring up the courage to say something. I ask him what this is all about. He says (again) he thought it was obvious he didn't just want us to break up and that we should take it slow to fix things. I'm baffled and say that that's impossible without talking about it. 

That I think it's right to do it that way but plus talk. He says he doesn't want to talk right now and we would talk on the weekend. Then he ignores me for a couple of days again. 

On saturday he asks me to come over. We eat together hang out for a bit, no talk. 

On sunday I ask him to hang out and he makes up an excuse, that he's not feeling well. I can't take it anymore and text in the mildest form possible ""This isn't so easy for me and I don't know if you know that"" (understatement of the year, I'm suffering like a bit**) He then simply texts back ""Then maybe we should just not do this anymore. We shouldn't both suffer"" 

I try calling him, his phone's turned off. I text him ""please talk to me, please"" nothing - So I get drunk, my best friend comes over, I am so baffled about the fact that this just happened over text that I simply shoot back a couple of hours later ""You want it this way, it's over"" 

I then decide to do this right, I call in sick, order a couple of books, my friends are all notified by my best friend, I start writing down feelings, try to stay busy. 

Two days later he texts me, that he understands my decision to end it (mine?!) and that he didn't want to feel pushed by me anymore and that he knows that I was hurting, he's not an idiot, that he has trouble talking about feelings and this is really hard for him. 

I simply clarify that it was in fact not my decision, that I always wanted to fight and make us both happy.
Then I didn't hear from him for a week.

I was starting to get better, going through the motions. I was really sure that this was it. And I know it would have been better that way. 

My mom begged me not to take him back another time. That she was worried about my wellbeing. In fact everybody was and so was I.

This makes what happened now even less understandable. Exactly a week after our last correspondence he texts me. ""How are you"" 


I was supposed to have him blocked on my phone. But I text back.
He tells me he can't really eat, is miserable. But not that it's about us. Then he texts me in the morning again. If I knew where he could buy shoes (I used to do all his shopping) I'm sort of dismissive, but still keep texting back.

In the evening he asks me if I would go out to eat with him on saturday. at first I say that I can't throughout the day. He get's nervous about what I'm doing on a saturday. But I agree to go with him later in the day... 

He makes sure I'm not doing anything after our dinner and I go meet him outside. I don't know why I expected it to be different this time.

We walk around, go eat, shop for shoes and all of the sudden he says ""If we hurry we can catch the bus back to my place"" then he grabs me and we run to the bus. At his place we have a drink and eventually end up in bed again. I stay the night, it's perfect. Not a word about us.

The difference is, I don't think I even want to be with him anymore.

I've suffered so much, he keeps dropping me and there is no reason things would change without us having a real talk about everything.

But he refuses to talk about anything, I thought I knew who he was but I have no idea anymore.

I still love him so much, but this is plain crazy. 

Then I also don't know how to change it. He does this every time. as soon as I start to feel a little better, just not good enough to not want him anymore, he shows back up and I am too scared to set boundaries.

Is there a way we could work as a couple?

Or is there a way I can set myself free from this for good? (and I am clearly not capable to go no contact...)

   
tl;dr: We keep breaking up and getting back together without talking about it. I want to make things right."

I'll pretty much only be writing C#.

Will I be limiting myself working only with the Microsoft stack? The company I am working for has been great so far and I enjoyed my internship, but I do not want to limit myself in the future. I want to make sure that I can remain an employable person.

I switched to computer science very late in my college career (switched from history in the middle of my junior year) so I am happy to have gotten an internship/ at all... But I just want to make sure that I am making the right career move. For example if I decide that working at a small company isn't for me, I want to be able to go work somewhere like Google or Facebook."
4aa0bq,21,2016-03-13,Best Canadian university for Masters?,geazyweazy,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4aa0bq/best_canadian_university_for_masters/,"I'm a CS undegrad at a large school that's not very well known for computer science, currently in year 3 out of 5 (i.e. graduating 2018). Not only does the quality of education (especially for upper level courses) leave something to be desired, me and my peers have trouble getting responses from good companies for internships (everyone I know who interviewed with MS/FB/Google etc had referrals).

I'm thinking of applying for jobs in the States as well as for a Masters in my final year of undergrad. My end goal is to end up in industry in the US at a decent company.

My questions are

1. What's the absolute best school in Canada for a CS Masters? I'm currently torn between Waterloo and Toronto.

2. Should I do a course-based Masters or a research-based Masters? Also, what would be the implications regarding funding?

3. Is it very competitive to get a Masters at a top school? My grades are decent (mostly 80s, some 90s, few high 70s) but my resume is a bit lacking: no internships (yet), one research assistant job remotely related to CS (no publications), a couple minor personal projects.

4. Is it worth doing a Masters in the US? For a Canadian, it is much cheaper to do a Masters in Canada, about 1/4th of the cost. Then again, can schools like Waterloo/Toronto/McGill hold a candle against CMU/Stanford/Berkeley/UIUC?

5. How competitive is it to get into a top American school? My GPA currently is about 3.6/4.0 but I will probably be able to pull it up in the last two years if I focus on it."

A big industry in downtown Los Angeles that dealt with many movie, tv and rock stars. Basically, offering rich and famous people services to handle their careers while also giving fresh faced wannabes the opportunities.

Katy was one of them, a young girl that wasn't even 21 yet dreams of making it in music, becoming a world known star. She had tried numerous times and had many meetings with companies to try and get her talent across to no avail. Eventually the money she saved up from her part time job while she was in school dried up and she had to pick up a job in L.A she she thought why not a business in a similar field to her dreams.

Katy remembered when she walked into the office for the first time, people couldn't believe what she looked like and you think they would be accustomed to seeing gorgeous people all the time. She had worn a pair of red 6 inch stilettos and a tiny pencil skirt that would of been the shortest a woman could wear. Thigh high stockings that hugged tight to her legs that were held up by clasps attached to a garter belt. The tight blouse she wore strained her rather biggest assets, her double DD breasts that were pushed up in her black bra. They bounced around as she worked around the office, attracting the attention of many guys. The man Katy worked for was always delighted to see her, his eyes filling up with lust as he looked her body over before leading her into his office and shutting the door.

Katy regularly wore clothes that brung her attention, it was always another pair of 6 inch heels, short skirts and stockings accompanied by a tight low cut blouse. Guys around the office started to talk about Katy, about how they would love to ram her as she bent over their desk. Many guys often tried to get with her but she always refused. Soon Katy developed a reputation for being a strong feminist supporter. She thought that all men were pigs for treating women as nothing more than a pair of tits and ass with a pretty face. That's how Katy felt in meetings, guys would get sidetracked around her and just stare at her boobs or ass. They wouldn't take her seriously and thought that she was just a slut. She thought that guys only chatted to her because they wanted to fuck her and weren't even calling her by name around the office, she overheard them calling her by her big tits.

Though what Katy did, didn't always match up with what she said. She would scold men for staring at her body when she wore revealing clothing everyday. She would also find every excuse to bend over to give everyone a good look at her, regularly dropping things on the ground. She would get angry at guys all the time for flirting with her as they obviously wanted to fuck her but she would flirt with guys all the time brushing her hand near their groin and giving them a sexy, sultry look as she walked away.

One day the CEO came to the office and went to a meeting room with about 30 other businessmen. They were all aged between 50-80 years old. After about an hour, Katy was called into the meeting room. Jason, a fellow coworker had a desk right in front of the room, he watched her strut in their, clad in her tight clothes. She closed the door behind her. It must of been 4 hours until the doors opened again, with the old guys walking out with satisfied looks on their faces. They talked about how great that was and how they must do it again soon. Out Katy stepped as they finally all left. Her hair was disheveled while she was fixing her rumpled blouse and rolling down her skirt while carrying her stilettos. As she walked she pulled out a curly hair from her mouth and wiped away a bit of stickiness from her lips. Going to her desk and continuing work like nothing happened.

-----------------

I want this role play to involve scenarios following the womens career such as trying to break into the industry (a lot of time spent as the secretary), dealing with the sudden fame, hook ups with celebrities, sex tapes, paparazzi, fans, relationships, becoming addicted to drugs and alcohol and turning into a nymphomaniac.

Or it could just be an office type rp.

I want to play the males the celeb will encounter. I want someone to play the main lead which will be the young female starlet. I would love for the young starlet to be Katy Perry or Kylie Jenner but I like a lot of other celebs as well.

I prefer to roleplay on Google Docs and use messengers to chat and set things up such as K , skype, yahoo msger and google chat/hangouts. Want this to be a long term rp. If you are interested and wish to talk about this further send me a message. Please make your message to me detailed and include any character/ scenario ideas, which celebrities you like and what platforms you use.


P.S I'm also looking to do a Game Of Thrones and Witcher rp so check my post history for those ideas if they interest you."

Slightly get better, and then worry about when the next thing that will bring you down will come. Sometimes, its just waking up in the morning, and you can already tell that the shitshow is about to start.

Becoming forgetful, inarticulate, unable to form sentences properly. And then starting to withdraw from the world and the social relationships that you had because you feel like you don't belong among all the happy people. Its like, walking down the street, and seeing a guy and a girl walking together, having a conversation, and then one of them tells a joke and the other bursts out laughing. You think to yourself, ""What is that? How can someone feel so happy? How is that person filled with so much joy?"" You become disillusioned from your reality, and try to shut it out at every opportunity that you can. things like sleeping to escape your life and things that you have to do, watching everyone else succeed and grow as a person, having girlfriends/boyfriends, getting good grades, getting scholarships, interviewing for internships. And you're just in the background, watching, observing, and you can't but help to feel that all this is a little foreign to you.

It shouldn't be the way life is, I say. You become such a hateful person, because you feel that the world has rejected you. You fill your boring existence with memes, porn, alcohol, sleep, 4chan. You browse 4chan, see a funny meme, chuckle and think its funny, but knowing deep down that you are not happy. It doesn't serve as a substitute for the lack of interpersonal relationships, friends, romance that bring joy to a person's life.

Masturbating to so much porn, once or twice in a row just for that few moments of ecstasy when you ejaculate. The only time when all is right in the world, those few precious seconds. I guess its the dopamine finally doing what they're supposed to.

I'mnot a hateful person, I never was. I don't hate people for being shitty, I don't hate annoying people, but now I do. I've become condescending, racist, shallow, and just naturally hateful. I look at the negative side of things all the time, so pessimistic of everything. This is not how life is supposed to be. I know it isn't because I've experienced what its like during the good times. Before all this. Before the soul-crushing loneliness and exclusion, being shunned and  not considered part of society, like a second class citizen.

Everything is just tiring, you show up to your classes, and listen to what the teachers have to say, but still I don't understand anything. I write down notes, and I forget them so easily. You neglect your personal hygiene, why shower if nobody bothers with you. So much of our life is based upon others perspective of you and existing as a member of a community (small or big, a group of friends, family, school ,etc) but when you take that away, you no longer have the need to define yourself."

I am planning on moving out of my parents house and into the dorms for my last two years of uni. I am a Computer Science student. The entry-level pay for this position is roughly $40K a year. The cost of tuition would be $400 per credit hour with 60-80 credit hours left.  The cost of living in the dorms is about $4500 per semester. 

The total cost of my tuition (and thereby the loan before interest) without moving out would be $32K. With moving out would be $50K. I almost got an internship that paid $25 an hour, which translates to $50K a year. This is also on the low end of the spectrum of average CS salaries, where the median is $85K a year.

I have no student loan debt currently as my parents have been paying out of pocket through community college for the last 6 or so years. I do however have a 2.19 GPA, which is why I lost the internship. I can raise it to a 2.6-2.8 by the end of this semester, and to a 3.25 by graduation. I currently work a minimum wage job with a little bit of money saved up.

How should I go about this? Is moving out onto the dorms preferable to moving into an apartment? I'm adverse to the second option due to the high cost of rent, and I know I will not be able to balance that much work and school. I would still like to move out and my uni allows student loans to be used to pay for housing. But I would also like to graduate with no student loan debt.

TLDR: Is a $50K student loan debt going to be too high if I am a Computer Science student?"
4aak6u,2,2016-03-13,Me [21f] with my landlord [45+?M] of 2 weeks. We fought.,Aaahhjj,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4aak6u/me_21f_with_my_landlord_45m_of_2_weeks_we_fought/,"Hi guys! 

I'm already fairly certain what I want to do with this situation but I also really want some outside advice because some of my friends think I am acting too extreme. (Sorry for the wall of text btw) 

To get to the point, I live in a big city (in the Netherlands) and moved to this city two weeks ago due to my internship. I had to find a place very fast (in one week!) so I didn't really have the time to really search for the best place but I found my current place on the dutch equivalent of craigslist. At that time I only met one roommate who is close friends with the owners and he was a nice guy. My landlord was sick those days I was there and I only met him once, and we didn't talk much (the one time I did meet him). I signed the contract and talked mostly with his wife who handled everything for me (because he was sick). 

Yesterday I wanted a friend to stay over so I asked my roommates if they were ok with it. My contract does not say i'm not allowed overnight guests, and they have never told me about this rule when I asked about the houserules before I moved in.. So just to be civil I asked my roommates and they said they were ok with it. but one of my roommates told the landlord and my landlord wasn't oke with it. I asked the day before my friend would come, and I didn't read his message on time so my friend was already in the train to here.. so I thought it would be best to call my landlord myself. When I called him, for some reason he didn't understand me or something (I was at the station so maybe noisy?) and he said I had the wrong number. I actually had saved the number by his craiglist username so I thought maybe I did have the wrong number so I called his wife to explain the situation. She said everything was fine, and my friend could stay over and she would talk to her husband. I proceeded to tell my roommates it was fine now but I didn't say I talked to the wife instead of the landlord. (This was my big mistake and I regret it..) but after that my landlord called me up VERY VERY angry and yelling at me how I was lying and I tried to explain I talked to his wife who said it was fine. He said in no way he was okay with it, and I went behind his back etc. He then proceeded to ask if I was drunk because I was such a nice girl and turned out to be liar and I was making no sense ? (and I started yelling back, which I never do but him calling me a liar hit a sensitive part) and I told him my friend would NOT stay and I would talk to him later. (I was so frustrated but I don't think it would have been good to start a yelling battle on the phone). He even said that if I even thought about doing something he would immediately remove me from my room.. I'm actually also protected by the contract so he can not just do this without any valid reason. I'm just wondering if it is normal to have such a reaction about what essentially is a misunderstanding? I felt very threatened and he was so aggressive on the phone, he called me a 'horrible person' and I'm just flabbergasted how this happened for something that hadn't happened YET. My friend never came to the appartement at all.. I don't mind not having my friend over, really, I would have never even invited her had I known it was such a big issue.

I want to leave my room ASAP but my friends tell me to wait till I find something else. I can end the lease if I notify them a month in advance, which is now currently my plan. But I have no idea what to tell him anymore, I just want to get these 2-ish months over with and leave. I feel so unsafe now in my own home, what if he got angry at me in person instead of on the phone and things escalated? 

What do you think is the best plan of action?

I work for a small web company(3 devs, 1 sys admin, 1 IT manager). We work with Java, PHP and SQL databasese and we've recently taken on a third year college student as a dev intern(this is part of their course).

We weren't expecting the intern to do much, just give him some relatively simple stuff that the main team doesn't have time for. One of these small projects we gave him involved some looping and integer comparison and at the end we wanted a boolean returned. This task was really to find out what level he was at(silly management didn't bother with a technical interview in any way). 

So it turns out that the poor guy has nearly zero coding skills or logic. Fine, I thought maybe he just needs to brush up on the basics so I find it some youtube tutorials to follow and sign him up for code academy. So over the course of a few weeks he completes the tutorials and I told him to have another bash at the project we got him to do before. Well same story again, the basics just didn't stick and he doesn't really understand how to debug.

I'de love to be able to sit down with him for a few weeks and teach him some stuff one on one but I can't with my workload. So I'm at a loss on how to get this guy moving forward.

Any ideas?"
4ab41f,0,2016-03-13,17 years old facing trafficking charge in Ohio,kibblerz,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/4ab41f/17_years_old_facing_trafficking_charge_in_ohio/,"So a couple months ago I allegedly sold a 5 sack on my school bus. A month later the kid I sold it to decided to smoke on the bus and ratted on me. He also claimed what he was smoking came from me, which is bullshit (noone saves a 5 sack for a month) . He told me everything he gets comes from his brother. So he's trying to save his own ass while screwing me over. When I was confronted by the police I originally pleaded the fifth but they kept pushing and I gave in.

Back at the beginning of February I was indicted as a Juvenile. I went to my pre-trial friday and was told that I had to deny the charges till I get a public defender since I'm a minor and it's a felony charge.

My first question is, since I couldn't confess in court till I have a lawyer, can they still use the confession the police officers obtained as evidence?

Also I'm pretty sure that the kid wasn't smoking what came from me, but the court might be using it as evidence thinking it came from me. There were also 2 no contact orders, one for the kid who was smoking, and another for a loudmouth(highly uncredible) on my bus. So I'm guessing these are their witnesses.

The charge didn't include the fact that it was on school grounds (thankfully) which would've made it an F4 instead of an F5. My magistrate put me on verbal house arrest till my next court date.

I'm highly successful for my age, with more certifications in my vocational programming class than anyone else. I have a Government internship and a job at a Pizza Shop. My grades are pretty well, though they took a hit after I faced a 21 day expulsion and ended up having to retake my economics class. I'm a senior in highschool.

Ohio has a mandatory license suspension for all drug charges and I'm trying my best to avoid that. I figured my two options are to either fight it, or convince the prosecutor to maybe change the charge to disorderly conduct considering how small the amount in question was and whether it's really worthy a felony charge.

So my two questions are, would the confession be able to be used as evidence since I didn't have a lawyer and am a minor, and would trying to get a plea deal and getting it changed to disorderly conduct be too far fetched?

I'm a good kid who made a dumb mistake. I just want to be able to move on with my life and put this crappy phase of my life behind me."

Prospective student here. Was wondering what the CS life is like over in Boulder. A couple questions, if I may:

How big are the class sizes?
How many people are in the CS program?
What's the process to get an internship? Is it possible to get one frequently? Is it possible to earn one at any point in the 4/5 years you're there, or is it something only upperclassmen do?
I read that Boulder is a large startup area. Is this something that a lot of students are involved in?
What are the research opportunities like?

Any other feedback/reviews about the program would be greatly appreciated.

I started thinking about suicide lately, so I spoke to a therapist and will continue to go. All those years lost. All those years I saw openly gay men guys walk into each other's dorm rooms, hold hands on the common, eat together at restaurants. I hate myself for not having the courage to come out sooner. I did have a few Craigslist gloryhole/car hookup encounters with men I wasn't even attracted to that I am not proud of in the slightest, but I decided to actually wait until I'm with a guy I've at least been on a nice date with until I have sex again.  
  
Logically, it sounds ridiculous to feel like it's the end at 23. But meeting people became so hard after college. I can't even see my friends very often because of the distance. They're all moving on to amazing opportunities and I'm stuck in my hometown waiting (well, mostly working) for my chance. Please tell me it can get better. I know a large part has to do with my own effort, but please tell me it's not the end. I feel so hopeless. I started crying today thinking about how I've never had a boyfriend and was in a place where I could have safely done so if I weren't so weak these past four years. Why did I do this to myself? Why am I so stupid?  
  
I really want to end it all. Sometimes it feels like the only option. I need anything to not feel like this. I feel so pathetic and useless. I'm dependent on my parents until I find something better. I did internships, studied abroad, worked, graduated with a 3.5...what did I do wrong? I know I interview well because once I get an interview I have ALWAYS gotten the job. But it's just a matter of getting the damn interview.  
  
Sorry, this is both my loneliness as a gay man and my job issues. But it all affects me. "

I am currently a junior molecular biology/comp sci major at a top 5 US liberal arts college.

Due to a bad roommate situation and a major surgery freshman year my GPA is less than stellar...will be around 3.5 at time of graduation. I also have an intense interest in CS but it is notoriously hard at the school I'm studying it at (ever heard of Harvey Mudd College?), and I fear that I will not be able to keep up premed level grades in these upper level CS classes. First question - does studying CS at Mudd help my application (diversity of interests/skills?) in any way? I would love to continue learning CS but would be willing to drop the dual major if not worth the (already) GPA hit.

Second question - how much weight do EC's hold in the initial screening process? I get that my low GPA is not ideal for initial impressions but hoping ECs will help. My current EC's include:
-Ochem tutor (~7 hours a week)
-Ochem lab TA
-Research for the last year and a half at my school, presenting project at ACS this next week in SD
-internship in a Department of Defense biomedical research lab this summer, had to get top secret clearance, potential option for employment upon graduation
-two years ago started a CS education nonprofit for underprivileged students in the area

I am currently planning on taking a gap already and working for the DoD lab for a year or two but medicine is my calling. What can I do in those two years to help me get into any med school? Feeling lost looking at the admission stats. I'm also hispanic if that matters."

4abu0q,2,2016-03-14,"HELP? Me [USA, 23 F] and my SO [UK, 27 M] want to close the distance this summer. I was planning to move the UK for 1 year on student visa but SO wants out (of UK)",cynchale,LongDistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/4abu0q/help_me_usa_23_f_and_my_so_uk_27_m_want_to_close/,"I am [23 F] from the U.S. and my boyfriend is [27 M] from the U.K. We have been together since Oct 2013 - we met when I studied abroad in the U.K. from Sept 2013 - Jan 2014 (I went to his uni). Our relationship started ""normally"" for 4 months, from when we met in Oct 2013 until the time I left. We've been long distance since Jan 2014 - being able to visit one another every 4 or so months for 3-5 weeks at a time. We've been together for 2.5 yrs now and feel ready to make moves and the necessary changes to close the distance hopefully by this summer. We'd both like to get to start our lives together asap, but I feel strongly about getting at least the next year living in close proximity (same country/city) before seriously discussing marriage. We both are very serious and do want to get married though -- but hope that it will be more suitable to start the process (visas, etc) next year.

I'm applying for a degree + internship program, intended to start August 2016. He's currently teaching English abroad in Korea (through the 1-year EPIK program) and will be finishing his contract in Sept 2016. The idea was for him to return to the U.K.around the same time I'll be transitioning there to study so that we can make plans to live in the same area.

Before leaving to teach abroad last Sept, my SO had been going to uni and working odd jobs in the past years and was getting really burnt out. I feel that he is eager to start over somewhere new -- he wants out of the U.K. and has expressed early on in our relationship his willingness to relocate to the U.S. to be with me.  

In my perspective, I felt that the plan of me coming to the U.K. for one year (this summer) for us to close the distance would be the most logical/responsible route. I would get to do something enriching personally &amp; professionally, while he would be able to get at least a year of working experience under his belt (he doesn't yet have much career-oriented work exp). I was thinking that the next 1-2 yrs working and getting experience back in the U.K. will put him in a better position for when he gets to the U.S. and competes in the job market here.

Anyway, I went to visit him in Korea recently (some much needed time together) to sorta regroup and highlight our game plan moving forward. Our said plan was to get to September. I'll come to the U.K. to study and he'll return to look for work/housing. I found one particular program I am still very excited about - one that would secure a suitable internship and provide housing/advising/and even a master's (its really good value for the cost). I just sent off my payment fee and application to the admissions team this past weekend. At the same time, he's recently gotten cold-feet on this plan, and has expressed great disinterest in returning to the U.K. He seems to be very anxious about securing job prospects and getting financially stable (although I feel like this might be temporary anxiety-ridden self doubt, as I'm fully confident in his abilities to find work he'd be interested in). He even recently suggested for us to go to Australia together on working-visa, or even to get married this year, etc. In short, he feels an increased sense of urgency to close the distance this year, and seems to want to abandon the plan of returning to the U.K. (he even mentioned that he fears his anticipated unhappiness will affect our relationship negatively when we're together in the U.K.). On the other hand, I spent the past year and a half detouring from a 'productive career-driven track (I graduated uni May 2014, worked Aug 2014-Dec 2014, quit my job Dec to move to Germany to apply for a master's program (in effort to try to close the distance), things didn't work out and I returned to the U.S. April 2015, SO and I decided to apply to teach english in Korea together, I got rejected May 2015, worked odd jobs till Dec 2015, secured two career-relevant part-time jobs in Dec and am still working in those roles presently) - both have been good experiences but I would be ready to leave them in July if I were to get accepted into the said program in the U.K. I was open to doing something more adventurous/fun like teaching english/working an odd job together in another country last year but now feel like I've wasted enough time already and need to stay focused on building a career for now.

In short - SO wants OUT of his country, seems to want to forget it all, and start over, get married and move to US, and start a new life here. I, on the other hand, want to spend a year together first before making the big decision. HELP?

On one hand, I want to be able to encourage him so that will keep him open to the idea of spending the next year in the U.K. together, while I do the program, and he works because I feel that it is the most responsible and ""mature"" way to start working towards building our life together. On the other, I don't want this to backfire if he truly is unhappy (say if he's not able to find work, etc) when he returns to the U.K. any advice is appreciated, thank you!"

So this started back in February.  I opened dialogue with my landlord about the possibility of me moving because of an internship, and she finally told me that the condo is already being put up for sale.  I have a month to month lease so this immediately got my concerned that the condo could sell and I would be without a home and have to scramble to find a place to live under no notice.

Landlord went away on vacation, claims to have not gotten any of my messages or e-mails that I will be giving notice and moving as of April 1 or April 15th, whatever was more convenient for them.  Landlord claims that because they did not receive my notice until after it was under 2 months that they wanted to hold me responsible for 2 months.  They claim that earlier conversations in text do not constitute as notice to them.

I explained how I cannot be held responsible for them going away on vacation for nearly a month and being unable to get in contact with, and I made every effort to contact them.  

We made an arrangement where I would leave my 52 inch TV here for their daughter to have, in exchange for:

1) rent owed for April 1st until April 15th
2) being let out of my lease as of April 15th.

My lease has a clause that states

""Either party may cancel or change terms of this agreement upon 60 days written notice. The notice period may be lengthened or shortened by written agreement, but no less than 7 days"".

As this agreement was via e-mail and she offered those terms, I began making my moving plans with April 15th as my end of lease term.

On a side note, the realtors have been wanting to show the place under no proper notice.  Originally they were coming and going as you please and forcing me to leave the property including one day that I was in bed ill with a 103 fever and unable to talk.  I started insisting on requesting 24 hours written notice.

My landlord comes to me yesterday and tells me that by me requesting 24 hours notice, I am causing problems and that I am just looking for drama.  I tell the landlord I have a lease and that affords me some rights in Ontario, and it isn't unreasonable to expect 24 hours notice.

The end result of this conversation is that the landlord says she will no longer abide by our agreement in e-mail and she wants me to be gone by March 31st (just over two weeks) and that I am not a lease holder.  I have a ""room rental agreement"" only which lets them do whatever they want and if I don't like it, too bad.

There was even an implied threat that if I insist on 24 hours notice that I can be removed at their leisure.

I am trying my best to leave by April 1st anyways but they are insisting on the end of the month but I have classes on April 1st that I cannot miss.  I e-mailed my professors and I hope that some arrangement can be made but not sure.  

Does anyone know my rights?  How can I force them to abide by the original agreement that was made?  Am I allowed to enforce 24 hours notice before they can enter my room? Who should I contact?

At this point I am fed up with being walked over by landlords.  They say that I am causing them problems by wanting proper notice and that I am flipping out for no reason and that they are within their right to show it however they want and that it is apart of daily life that I just have to put up with.

They are also excessively showing and requesting me to be gone often.  How excessive would constitute harassment?  What kind of  'reasonable enjoyment of premises' am I entitled to?"

I know reddit usually has all the answers so here I am. I’m starting to think I’m completely inept at understanding people and making them feel good about themselves, so I want to learn what are appropriate ways to engage with people (well my friends) who are down maybe using some examples and appreciate any advice on how people feel in these situations and what I should or not do

1) Friend needs help with his resume and cover letter for an internship, I helped him re-write it, probably changed 50% of it. He had stuff in there I didn’t seemed mature like e.g. an alphabet poem to describe himself – CARE: Compassionate, blabla, which I told him to take out because it wasn’t very impressive and he should weave traits needed for the job in instead. He was very upset, says he isn’t going to ask for my help anymore and doesn’t talk to me for a couple of days. Months later he asks me for help again, obviously I am a horrible person and can’t resist bringing up that he said he wasn’t going to ask for my help again. Friend says it’s because it’s an application that is important. Feels like people only want me when it’s big enough and discard me otherwise, and it’s hurtful, but part of me also gets it’s because of me not being able to help in a palatable manner. 

I was also helping another friend with his resume and cover, because of the previous experience I gave the disclaimer that I can be pretty brutal and I am not super qualified, friend said no problem, please be honest. So I just let it rip… this friend completely has no idea how to do CV/cover letter and the whole interview process. Also reminded him to write a thank you letter after and helped to edit it. Friend concedes that it was done very well and much better than he would have… but then said he wanted to be hired for who he is and not who I am… I don’t know, was I overdoing the editing? 

I am a bit bummed because I don’t think I’m super qualified to help with this but I do wanna help when people want input, yet when I do they get annoyed with me. 

2) Friend has been unemployed for a few months. He was fine in the beginning, but I gradually sensed he was starting to feel down and prefer staying at home, probably emo or wanting to save money. Doesn’t wanna talk about the unemployment either, tho he mentioned before that it hurts. Got him a gym pass because he likes to gym, figured it would force him out of the house doing something he enjoys. For cool place I really like and I wanted to share the joy. Turns out stuff like that isn’t appreciated and is really insensitive (but I am not 100% sure why – I am not saying he is unfit, he obviously isn’t anyway), and that I shouldn’t try to force a gift on someone. I brought up probably three times that he should use it after he said he wasn’t going to. I also do not logically understand why anyone would reject something meant to be fun. I got this for 2 other people too and he knows it. It is not a pity thing, I genuinely think he will enjoy it…

One other person I got this for is in med school and was also annoyed with me at first because she was it as me trying to drag her away from her books (I was, she leads a sedentary lifestyle and is very unfit). She is also extremely stressed but always says she is okay except for rare moments when she breaks down and cries. But eventually she started using it, enjoyed it and forgave me.

Obviously if people do it they won’t hate me for long but if not they stay annoyed with me, and I really am well intentioned. This part I get that people feel like I am meddling but then they would truly benefit if they accept logically speaking. Or should I just not? But I really care for these people around me and I didn’t know more subtle ways to help if people don’t want to talk

3) My roomie was feeling really down because she missed her family during her birthday. She talked about it and was still down (I didn’t really say much while she went on about it for maybe an hour). I later tried to cheer her up by telling her all the fun stuff we could do and how life was super awesome regardless. Whenever I could I tried to share with her nice stuff I had seen happen recently and bringing up nice things in hers as well. She told me to stop at that my happiness was making her feel like shit and that showed how I truly could not understand her sadness. Told me we turn to different friends in different times, and I am just not the kind of friend who can be there for people because I don’t get it even if I try.

So how can I get it? I don’t want to be the friend people are with only when they are super happy or when shit hits the fan and they need help. I want to be a friend who can be there even when people are a bit sad and need cheering up. I don’t know what to do but I can at least sense when people are unhappy and I feel terrible about not being able to help. And I want to do what I can because mine has been great, and I want to share it because I have been undeservingly lucky. And I really feel like I’ve been a self-centered person, and even now, wanting to help my friends, part of me wonders if it’s still self-centered and helping my ego because I’d feel better…

As far as I can I have tried to treat others like I want to be treated, but then I’m realizing I may just be evaluating things differently, and in that case I may be projecting my responses onto others instead of understanding. So what is the right thing to do? I know I can feel like an ass and continue upsetting people or work towards being someone who can make others feel better

Please be brutal with me (I know some parts I still sound annoying), how would you feel if you were in those situations, or if you have been before and what were ways someone can help that you would appreciate? Any books you can recommend I read

4ad58m,7,2016-03-14,Certificate in GIS Open Up Job Opportunities?,the_bass_player,gis,https://www.reddit.com/r/gis/comments/4ad58m/certificate_in_gis_open_up_job_opportunities/,"I've noticed that a large number of city jobs require GIS experience. After 8 years in the Army I completed my Master of Public Administration degree, and 2 unpaid internships, but getting a job in local government or local government consulting was very difficult. I applied to over 110 jobs and ended up landing a job as a customer service rep. 

I'm happy to have a job, but the pay and responsibility ceiling is low, and I'm not sure where I can go from here (other city jobs that is). I have made good contacts with several department heads, but it seems like I'd still be looking at entry level positions/excluded from many jobs.

I do not want to go back to school for another full degree. Would a GIS certificate open up career options for me? I just want something that I can progress in and make decent money and not feel limited. I very briefly did some GIS work (2 days) in one of my internships and really enjoyed it.

Any advice for going from customer service to GIS/planning/stormwater/etc. would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!"

I transferred here from a different school where I was about a year and a half away from graduating, but for personal reasons I transferred to UCF and due to different programs and credit loss, it'll take me another 2 years to graduate the CS program. 

I have debilitating mental health issues that make school difficult and frustrating and I worry about my ability to complete the program before I run out of money. While I have difficulty with school, I have taken a wide range of courses and am a decent programmer with experience in multiple languages. 

I've worked two QA testing internships and have a decent amount of personal projects. If I take an easier route and finish an interdisciplinary degree, just to finally get a BS, will it be difficult for me to get a job and start my career? Could I potentially get a masters degree eventually? Or should I just suck it up and try to finish CS despite how much I'm struggling?"

Lately I have been stressed out trying to find work in my field, I have just finished an internship and am awaiting graduation.

For the past year I have been having random bouts of sleep paralysis, I see the shadow people and everything, while it freaks me out it isn't of major concern. What I am freaked out about is what has been happening to me recently...

In the past week I have had 3 false awakening experiences. I have been reading up on false awakening and it seems as though everyone who has had these experiences realizes at some point after ""waking up"" that they are in fact dreaming.
For me, as soon as I ""wake up"" I KNOW that I am dreaming. The first two times were not very alarming, I knew that I was dreaming and was freaked out but I was OK.

The last time it has happened was last night. I was having a nightmare, and I ""woke up"" but I ""awoke"" into sleep paralysis. It was horrifying. (In real life) I was alone, staying at my moms house for the night. In the dream I heard rustling, which is what woke me up. I opened my eyes and saw my sisters dog run across the living room, (In real life no one including the dog was there). I tried to get up off the couch but I could not move. I was very frightened. I was finally able to move my body but it was in a haze, as though I was moving through mud. I was able to grab my phone and I tried to call 911, I realized at this point that I was naked, though in real life I was wearing my pjs. ""Moving"" was exhausting, I end up laying facedown on a different part of the sectional couch with my legs hanging off. At this point I realize there is a person in the kitchen, they are grunting and making strange noises. I can hear them coming towards me and I am HORRIFIED. At this point I actually wake up, it's 3:02. Though my mind is VERY AWAKE at this point, I can barely keep my eyes open, My mind is awake but my eyes are trying to sleep, I try to stay awake because I'm afraid of sleeping but I fall asleep. When I woke up for good this morning I was very hazy and scared. I felt as though I was still in a dream, I was forgetting codes at work and where I put things. I am VERY  freaked out. Can someone help me out here?"
4adrbt,5,2016-03-14,Hiring Woes,hustino,msp,https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/4adrbt/hiring_woes/,"We are trying to hire for tier 1 and are having a terrible time.  The job is posted on Craigslist and we have tried Indeed for a time but weren't getting any better candidates there.  The job posting clearly states that the job is entry level, but it does specify that we are looking for someone with at least some computer experience.  Trade school, internships, home labs, family/friends' computer guru, whatever.  I also indicated that we would like the resume to be submitted as PDF, but I quickly gave up on that.  Out of about 25 resumes, only 8 were sent as PDF.  We have had phone interviews with probably 15 people and they have been miserable.

1. Is there anything we can add or change in our job posting to try to get better candidates?
2. What kind of expectations should I have for tier 1?  We typically ask the following three questions during the phone interview: Can you describe the function of DNS? Can you name any ports or protocols that internet traffic uses, for example HTTP uses port 80? Joe Shmoe calls in a ticket reporting a file is missing.  What steps would you take to help him?
Probably 80% of the time the answer to the DNS question is ""I have no idea.""  Same thing for ports.  The missing file question is usually pretty interesting... I feel like anyone looking for any sort of IT position at all should be able to come up with some kind of answer for these questions.  Am I expecting too much, or are there any better questions that I could ask that are basic but still require some rudimentary technical knowledge?

We get resumes from the local trade schools as well, but a friend I have that works there says they reserve all of the good people for larger businesses that presumably support the school or bribe the career advisors somehow..."

**12,101** people curious about Americans for **3 years**

As a Canadian, I've grown up feeling quite close to my more rowdy neighbours to the south, and yet I've come to find out over the years that there's so I didn't know or understand about the United States. Take this upcoming election for example. This past year when we elected Justin Trudeau as our handsome Prime Minister, the election itself took a total of 11 weeks (about the same length of time as a season of *The Apprentice*). Now that the primaries have started in the states I can't help but wonder what's taking so long, and have had to ask a few of my American friends about how this whole complicated process works exactly. Luckily for me, /r/AskAnAmerican also exists, and they currently have a [stickied thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAnAmerican/comments/48t0ni/us_presidential_election_primary_megathread/) dedicated to simply explaining the primaries leading up to the election. 

Maybe you have a less serious question to ask, like [what is meatloaf?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAnAmerican/comments/44jt7m/what_is_meatloaf/) or [why do Americans seem to hate New Jersey?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAnAmerican/comments/41pi0q/why_do_americans_blindly_hate_new_jersey/) It's both interesting to read the answers as well as to see what those who are unfamiliar with the States will ask. Going into this sub for the first time, I was honestly expecting more of the patriotism and stereotypical comments you'd see over on /r/Murica, but I was pleasantly surprised by the seriousness of both answers and responses. People are genuinely interested in getting to know what it's like to live in the States, while others are genuinely helpful and take time in crafting their responses. You can see this come across in the most upvoted question [How much choice of brand variation do you have?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAnAmerican/comments/40mhx5/how_much_choice_of_brand_variation_do_you_guys/) And 1000+ comments later you have a really interesting discussion develop. Other questions like [What are some culture shocks you've had within the US?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAnAmerican/comments/421dl1/what_are_some_culture_shocks_youve_had_within_the/) make you think more about your own experiences and show just how different the US can be from State to State. Other posts like [""show me photos of mundane America""](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAnAmerican/comments/3ptpt8/picture_time_please_show_me_mundane_america/) really get at the heart of day-to-day life in the States, a glimpse that you don't really see through the media and through tv shows or Hollywood films. Places like [this hot dog shop](http://imgur.com/5FNSq62) or this [Iowa State Fair](http://i.imgur.com/qyWVmtr.jpg) or [Florida before a storm](http://i.imgur.com/0A5qH1o.jpg) were among some of the interesting responses.

So if you're not from the United States and would like to learn more about it, or if you are American and feel like sharing with others what your life is actually like, then I'd suggest heading over to /r/AskAnAmerican for some thoughtful discussion! There's also /r/AskACanadian, /r/AskEurope and /r/AskAnAustralian as well if those are also your cup of Tim Horton's tea. 

&gt;##1. Could you tell us a bit about yourselves?


&gt;&gt;**/u/cardinals5:** I'm an engineer who moved to Detroit - after finishing my masters - to join the auto industry. I'm originally from Connecticut, and I lived overseas in Italy for a few months as well. This is probably the most active subreddit I moderate, and I'm only active on ones that are within my interests - cars, Civ, RCT, cooking, that kind of stuff.

&gt;&gt;**/u/EagleEyeInTheSky:** I'm also an engineer, working in Southern California, in the Aerospace Industry. I grew up in North County San Diego, in a tiny little town with a weird obsession with avocados. I started Redditing because I was bored in class, and now I can't stop when I should be working. I think that fans of the Cardinals suck.

&gt;&gt;**/u/CoCaptainJack:** Howdy I'm a senior at a small private college studying math and economics. I love starting and growing ideas, founder of 4 clubs on campus, and looking to make that hobby into a career as an entrepreneur one day. I really dig E-Sports and truly think it will rival traditional sports in the future, following E-Sports is mostly what I do on reddit. My personal favorite are league of legends and super smash bros melee. (shout out to r/smashbros)

&gt;##2. Tell us about your subreddit!


&gt;&gt;**/u/cardinals5:** /r/AskAnAmerican was started when we had a weird ""Americans of Reddit..."" trend on /r/AskReddit. It was slow growth at first but we've been trending twice now, and while the first time was a struggle to deal with, we seem to have a better handle on it now. The subreddit itself really is intended to be a place to look at some of the things that don't normally get asked on /r/AskReddit, while getting real answers (example, questions about Detroit get actual answers from Detroit here, where on the defaults you'll get...less of that).

&gt;&gt;**/u/EagleEyeInTheSky:** /r/AskAnAmerican is a subreddit that primarily has two userbases. Curious foreigners who see a lot of American culture and are confused or curious about our strange little land where fat people can take the prom queen on a date to the gun range. (This is a joke, by the way.) Then we also have actual Americans who are willing to clear up misconceptions about our culture, our politics, our lifestyle. Being a smaller subreddit compared to something like /r/AskReddit has really affected the quality of the posts here, and you get a lot more genuine responses to questions. We don't need a serious tag on our posts. Not that our userbase is perfect, but the regulars really do try to make an honest effort to provide an honest look at our country.

&gt;&gt;**/u/CoCaptainJack:** Others have said the main ideas of what I will say but AskAnAmerican is a unique play even though from the description it might not seem so. The sub is a place to ask questions to Americans and get answers with wide ranging backgrounds. Which encapsulates a lot of America, many different people, many different cultures in one big place. I also don't like the stigmas, stereotypes, and misunderstandings associated with the US (no we don't eat hot dogs and burgers for each meal, well at least most of us). I thought this place would be a decent way to combat that.

&gt;##3. What do you like most about your subreddit?


&gt;&gt;**/u/cardinals5:** Our userbase is great. What's nice is, really, it doesn't lean heavily conservative or liberal (in American terms, anyway); there's a good balance and people are generally respectful of each other. The users definitely don't put up with people being assholes either, which is nice. We're also aware of and try to account for bias when we're answering things, which is always a plus.

&gt;&gt;**/u/EagleEyeInTheSky:** I like the questions. You'd think that a subreddit like this would get overloaded by the same questions over and over again, but there's a lot of misconceptions about America or interesting things that I as an American would never ever think about. We just had an /r/bestof post the other day where a guy was interested in the varieties of pizza that we had in our supermarket. One of our users recorded a video of a pizza aisle at our stores and blew everyone away with how much pizza we had. That's not something I would ever think about. Questions like those are my favorite, because they help me look at my own country from a unique perspective and appreciate the small details that are absolutely absurd from a foreign perspective, and those kinds of questions usually are fun as hell to read.

&gt;&gt;**/u/CoCaptainJack:** I love how there are some true golden answers given in response to questions. A simple question can lead to a HUGE detailed post giving multiple perspectives and intricacies. Check [This](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAnAmerican/comments/3spncw/so_what_exactly_is_prom/) out for example.

&gt;##4. What does it mean to you to be an American?


&gt;&gt;**/u/cardinals5:** Interesting question. This one is tough, because a lot of what I think of can be applied to many other countries. I think, in essence, its knowing that your ancestors (or your parents, or even yourself) came here seeking a better life, and worked hard to achieve it. To me, being American means being hopeful, industrious, hard-working, and stubborn to the point of near stupidity. I could prattle on about freedom and all that, but really what makes us Americans is our shared background as a nation of immigrants (minus the native Americans...) who came to find something better, and never stopped trying to make a better life.

&gt;&gt;**/u/EagleEyeInTheSky:** I think of America as a bizarre, experimental attempt at building a first world country from scratch. We're so weird. Being a part of this subreddit has really opened my eyes to a lot of the weird and wonderful things about this great country. Our history is really short. This country changes fast, and so do the people living within it. Growing up in this country, I was born to a poor family, living day to day with less than a hundred dollars in my parents' joint checking account. As I grew up, my dad got his home business off the ground, my mom got several promotions. We got rich for a while. We owned 7 cars, 10 motorcycles, moved to the rich side of town, and my life changed accordingly growing up. Then the housing market crashed, my dad's business tumbled, my mom's company closed its doors. We kept the house in the nice neighborhood, but we lost half of the cars and went back to worrying about how much clothes were going to cost. Now I've moved out and I'm completely separated from my parents. I'm building my own career. I'm not rich at the moment, but I've got a degree, a stable job at a stable company, and I'm digging myself out of the typical college poverty. 

&gt;&gt;I've been rich, I've been poor, I've lived in nice neighborhoods, and bad neighborhoods. The biggest thing that America has given me is the chance to have that kind of financial mobility, where my future has never really been decided by my past, or by my family's origins. Who I am, what family I'm from, how much money my parent's had, what kind of opportunities I had growing up, and where I used to live, have had very little effect on where I am and who I am today. I'm here where I am today because of what I've worked towards and my own efforts. And no matter where I've been financially, I've been treated the same by every single one of my peers and I've always felt that the world was always being fair to me. Life changes quickly. Where I am today is only because of the choices I've made within the past five years. Where I'll be in a decade has almost nothing to do with where I am today. That, I think, is what the American dream is all about. I've never felt like I was constrained by a destiny.

&gt;&gt;**/u/CoCaptainJack:** Hard to say exactly, Hard working is definitely an attribute associated with us sometimes even to a fault. I think Americans have a little bit of everything so it makes it so hard to say. If you are looking for somethings specific in a type of person or people you can find it here in America.

&gt;##5. Anything you want to potential subscribers to your subreddit?


&gt;&gt;**/u/cardinals5** We always want new perspectives and new people. As long as you're respectful and not here to lecture us on why things suck about America, we are always happy for more people! I think we'll also have an FAQ and some new stuff going on soon, so keep an eye out for it if you subscribe!

&gt;&gt;**/u/EagleEyeInTheSky** We have one rule, and one rule only in this subreddit. [Everybody Love Everybody]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nXJe9i70DE&amp;feature=youtu.be). Also, all of our other rules on the sidebar apply. BUT EVERYBODY LOVE EVERYBODY!

&gt;&gt;**/u/CoCaptainJack** Even though this subreddit is based around questions for Americans, American subscribers here can learn a LOT about world culture that is hard to get elsewhere. Some of the differences in different cultures are subtle but have interesting details. ""Do Americans really not use cursive that much?"", ""Ao does your country still?"", ""All the time! almost exclusively!"" is a rather mundane example, but you get the point.

I am in third year at university as a foreign student and do not qualify for good stuff like maintenance loans. I am in UK. The problem is that my parents are not rich, I quit my job to focus on my studies and banked on getting an internship but it seems like I am out of luck. At this rate, I will run out of money in 7 months from now. I would consider getting a loan from a bank but it is impossible because you need some income to qualify. Private loan companies are crazy once you do the math and see the debt spiral one would go into.

I am looking for options on how to leverage CS and programming skills to earn some money. I was thinking of freelancing, I need roughly 650 pounds a month to pay my bills. I need some realistic advice on how to not go bankrupt in the middle of my 4th year and whether it is realistic to learn skills to earn that much each month from freelancing or other means(I can't think of any others)."

Advice?",throwaway402314,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/4ae7jq/my_first_career_out_of_college_is_it_time_for_me/,"I apologize in advance because I feel like this post is seeking very obvious advice, but this is my first ""real"" job I've had and  I find myself apprehensive to leave because I've come to establish such good relationships with my co-workers and I'm loyal to the company. To make a long story short, my good friend got me a job at this company, his father's company, three years ago when I was struggling to find any non minimum wage work after graduating college (IT field here). I worked my way up from being an intern, to hourly pay, to a full-time salary position. I'm really grateful to have had this opportunity and that my boss valued my hard work enough to promote me and give me several raises.
 

 
Now, the bad:
 
 
I've had at least a half dozen paychecks bounce in the past two years. In the past year, in particular, the company has had a hard time with revenue, and I've had many checks come in several days late, bounce, or get put on hold for long periods of time. Sometimes a check will be just going through finally when I get the next pay period's check. I have to pay all of my bills early because I'm never sure if the next paycheck will go through. I can't really make much headway with taxes and paying off credit card debt because it's tough to create a budget when I'm unsure when exactly funds will be available. Also, for the first two and a half years, my boss was paying all his employees as contractors (1099), which I'm pretty sure is illegal. When the last couple of checks have bounced, he's just claimed that there was no reason that it should've bounced, but that he'll send another one (I work remotely, out of state). No apology. He also once flat out lied about sending one. Today I got word that one of our chief managers quit, and apparently nobody has heard from the company's accountant in about ten days. There is more but not entirely related to me so I won't go in to that stuff. No healthcare, no benefits, though I do have flexible hours and can work from home full-time.
 
 
Wow, writing this out really reinforces the idea that I need to jump ship ASAP. It's a little tough, however, as I'm loyal to my friend, love the people I work with, and there are some really good perks. However, I think my boss leverages the benefits to cushion all of the negatives"

I'm currently a junior in college with a PM internship lined up at a top company in SF. Last summer, I was an SDE intern at an eCommerce company and this year, I'm an SDE intern part-time while attending school at a local startup. 

Ideally, I'd like to go full-time at the company I'm interning at this summer, especially since I'd like a career in PM and have no interest in furthering my CS knowledge. However, my dad urges me to apply for my school's 4+1 BS/MS combined program, which would require me to stay an additional year to get my MS degree. He claims that an MS will allow me to, over time, receive quicker promotions and essentially climb the ladder faster.

What are all of your thoughts on this? I'd definitely like to be VP/SVP level one day, so would an MS in CS help me achieve this, or will I be alright with a BS? I go to a decent engineering college (top 10 public university in USA).

On a side-note, I'm also considering potentially doing an MBA sometime later down the road (5-10 years). "

[How reliable would you say the salary data from job hunting sites is?  I've had a couple applications where the interviewer was surprised at my asking salary.  I based the numbers on local comps from those sites.  On a related note, what percent pay increase do you see people ask for and receive most often?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4adpkw/iama_professional_career_advisorsresume_writers/d0zidex?context=5)|The data is fairly reliable. We often have our customers do some background research on glassdoor.com or salary.com to understand the scope of opportunities that are available to them.
 |Having too few data points (e.g., less than 5)
 |Have a very wide range (auto-red flag)
 |A salary in a very different location for the same job (often salaries account for cost of living multiples).
 |The second answer - there's huge variability depending on the situation, industry, type of company, years of experience, etc. People asking for raises within the same company often have to take into account company wide caps (e.g., some companies put a blanket moratorium on raises in difficult years) and try to negotiate hitting the top of that cap (e.g., 3% for some companies).
 |When it comes to switching jobs, we've seen people get a 100% raise and other people choose to take a pay-cut as they want to work in a industry that they personally care about more. Sometimes people move with the same pay to another place where the chances of a successful long term career are higher. The rule of thumb here is to keep assessing opportunities on a regular basis to make sure you're not being paid significantly below market wage for the role/responsibility you have!
[I'm in high school right now and have vague ideas of what I want to do,  sciencey spacey stuff,  but I also want to do other things.  My question,  is how important,  if I do switch careers eventually,  is it to start studying and working early in a field to actually thrive in it?  How easy is it to make up for education and experience gaps in these highly technical careers if you have experience in another? ](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4adpkw/iama_professional_career_advisorsresume_writers/d0zi4ll?context=5)|First of all, its great to hear about your interest in sciencey spacey stuff. Kudos to you for trying to get a head start on the process!
 |It's totally fine to have a diversity of interests. You should use your time over the next few years to experiment/learn about these both through academics and practical application (e.g., internships). That will help you narrow down your options once you have to make a formal commitment.
 |If you're not sure about what to do - think about going to a college that has some level of flexibility with choosing your major (e.g., a liberal arts university)
 |Many highly technical careers explicitly ask for undergraduate (and often graduate) degrees in the sciences. It's very difficult to transition into them unless you have that experience. Research some jobs you might want to do in the long term and look at the requirements so that you're not caught off guard. It's generally easier switching careers from a technical track to a non-techinical one.
 |It's often possible to switch careers laterally from one technical position to another. Besides that, other things you pick up and demonstrate (e.g., team-work, communication skills) are also highly transferrable 
[What do you look for most in a candidate when considering them for a job? Specifically, what are some universal tips on how to improve my resume or interview skills?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4adpkw/iama_professional_career_advisorsresume_writers/d0zgs1v?context=5)|Try to be action oriented, displaying what you accomplished, in quantitative terms when possible. Each bullet points should point towards a specific achievement / skill   Make sure your resume is targeted for the type of job you're applying for. Usually that means finding a group of opportunities that are similar and ensuring your resume checks the boxes for these  Practice is really important for interviewing. We see peoples interviewing skills getting better and better as they go for more opportunities. If you haven't interviewed in a while, find some people who will offer to do a 'mock' interview to get you back in the zone.
[I'd like to hear this as well. ](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4adpkw/iama_professional_career_advisorsresume_writers/d0znm2h?context=5)|Hi IWorkedForThatPlace, clever name!
 |There are two answers for this, depending on the root of your unhappiness.
 |If you are unhappy with the role function (what you do day to day), we would recommend finding opportunities where your expertise can be used to open new markets and challenging growth opportunities. For example, we recently saw an IT industry professional who managed to break out by becoming an expert onboarding new clients across multiple international cities -- this revitalized his career and he is now at a corporate strategy level at his company.
 |The #1 source of unhappiness is usually due to a flaw in your boss, whether its style, empathy, reasonableness, etc. Often we tell jobseekers looking for a happy switch it is less important the type of department you are in, but more how you mesh with the team and how human your manager is.
 |Best of luck!
[Haven't worked for years in a proper job that I'd care to list on my resume.  How would I account for the gap in years? should I just lie or tell half truths?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4adpkw/iama_professional_career_advisorsresume_writers/d0zhrg4?context=5)|Hard to tell without the specifics of where you've been working, but one important point: Never lie on your resume - it's increasingly easy for potential employers to do background checks, reach out to previous employers to confirm what you did, etc. Even if you get a job and start working, and are later exposed, it might lead to termination of employment.
[I don't need to work, but I really want to.  How do I account for those lost years on a CV or resume - especially if I want to change careers?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4adpkw/iama_professional_career_advisorsresume_writers/d0zjsf0?context=5)|We also see people who dip their toes in the water by initially taking on part time / contract based work. That also helps build a track record of recent work experience on the resume that makes the leap more manageable from both sides.
[Any recommendations as to how get as many informational interviews as possible? Or how do you go about expanding you network.](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4adpkw/iama_professional_career_advisorsresume_writers/d0zk0mc?context=5)|Hi -- making sure we understand -- the informational interview you mean are phone calls to learn more about a specific job function?  Just like in business, warm leads are best. Acquaintances of friends and family are usually more than happy to spend 15 minutes on the phone with a recent college grad, especially since mentorship usually feels worthwhile for experienced professionals. Make sure you are professionally searchable, ie a LinkedIn profile, academic CV, or personal website that someone can learn about you before agreeing to speak with you.
[Question: I'm working on a portfolio. How would be the best way to showcase my photography (few hundred photos\), my related video content (I have quite a bit of notable content\), and my outside related content (filming weddings and other celebrations, etc\) in a way that would be most attractive to an employer?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4adpkw/iama_professional_career_advisorsresume_writers/d0zgu4m?context=5)|Order your most recognizable / brand name / corporate work in the beginning, and save specific work you are especially proud of for around the 80% mark. Essentially you are looking for the reviewer to have two aha moments so they can better categorize you and describe you to peers -- one where they say ah okay this person is ABC, an XYZ music company professional, and then skimming -- oooh this looks great -- memorable impression.
[If i am going in for an interview at a really really relaxed and layed back startup, should I still be dressing up in a suit and tie?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4adpkw/iama_professional_career_advisorsresume_writers/d0zofov?context=5)|No. Do some research on the company, and if it seems like everyone including the senior management are very casually dressed, you wearing a suit might signal the lack of a fit with the company culture (even though it could be really far from the truth!).  If you're not 100% sure, it's always better to err on the side of being slightly over-dressed. For start-up roles, for example, we often see people coming into the interviews wearing plain jeans or khakis, with a tucked-in, button down shirt (for guys).  In any case, you should still be smartly dressed, with simple, clean/crisp clothes.
[What is the absolute dumbest/stupidest thing you've noticed in someone's resume?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4adpkw/iama_professional_career_advisorsresume_writers/d0zgwjj?context=5)|There are some silly mistakes that could be corrected very quickly. These include having a very unprofessional e-mail address (something like sexyguy69@gmail.com). It's the first thing that people will see on your resume and having an address like that sends across a bad signal. The other common mistake is leaving placeholder text in the summary section (e.g., loren ipsum). 
[Do you ever get people that hand you resumes that are grossly, almost hilariously, overqualified for the job. (Server at my old Waffle House had a masters in engineering from Georgia Tech\)](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4adpkw/iama_professional_career_advisorsresume_writers/d0zgwjj?context=5)|We get that sometimes - under-employment is a significant issue in America. Our goal is to help people who are in that situation find the best position for them that they would also be personally excited about.
[Honestly speaking, how much does (successful\) overseas work help a resume? In my case, as an Australian working in IT in London on a 2 year visa and are doing quite well, I'd like to make that a standout point when I do return back home. Is there a 'best' way of doing this?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4adpkw/iama_professional_career_advisorsresume_writers/d0zh0r4?context=5)|Research potential employers to find those that will reward you for overseas experience (we've given examples of a couple above)
 |Make sure you indicate the location of your employment on the resume prominently. It'll be self explanatory that you were in London.
[Thanks for the reply! So for it to actually make a difference, I should make sure the future employers values overseas work, how would one go about finding that out? Just the simple question? Or just hope that it's something that stands out and I get asked about it.](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4adpkw/iama_professional_career_advisorsresume_writers/d0zirhu?context=5)|Sure - whenever you're on your next job search, you should be able to research that point.
[I know Unilever is a big one for it, my SO works for a subsidiary company of Unilever and it's taken her a long way in her career. ](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4adpkw/iama_professional_career_advisorsresume_writers/d0zirhu?context=5)|Generally speaking, multinationals that have offices in 10+ countries value international experience and mobility as they often have to incentivize staff to move abroad or manage people with a variety of backgrounds. Regardless, it should be prominently positioned in your resume!  
[How important is the length if CV/resume? Long or short? Being student and soon in job markets (IT/ICT\)](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4adpkw/iama_professional_career_advisorsresume_writers/d0zol0f?context=5)|If you're a student, absolutely keep it to **one page**.

4aeszz,2,2016-03-14,Internship Dilemma,MiltownVet,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4aeszz/internship_dilemma/,"Hey there,
I'm a sophomore computer science major and was recently given offers to intern at two companies this summer. One company specializes in VR and the pay is better, but they didn't test my technical skills and I'm worried I won't be able to contribute or handle tasks given to me if I'm not familiar with a specific language.

On the other hand, the other offer I received the company tested my technical skills and understand my skill level but the pay is a little less. Their code is mainly Java based and that was my first language and the language I feel most comfortable with.

What should I do Reddit? Accept the more exciting internship that pays more and run the risk of not being able to perform, or accepting the internship where I will be able to hopefully contribute more (at least at first). "
4aevaw,1111,2016-03-14,"TIFU by asking if, “Everything was kosher”",Goddab,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/4aevaw/tifu_by_asking_if_everything_was_kosher/,"After weeks and weeks of going back and forth on a quote for a client, I sent an email to my sales representative (we will call her Sue) saying, “I will be meeting with the client tomorrow to go over the final plan and make sure everything is kosher.” Thinking that my work was sorted for the morning (it was supposed to be a slow day) I closed my laptop and went to go get a tea. 

&amp;nbsp;

My phone rings. It's Sue. I answer, “Hi Sue, what can I-” and then she starts.

&amp;nbsp;

“You didn't tell me you were on Kosher! This is a disaster! No one told me you were on Kosher! You have missed all these meetings already! And we only have two weeks until Kosher...” See, our sales representatives have a lot of different clients and projects on their plates at any one time, so they have a tendency to shorten the project names to single words. In this case, I had forgotten that 'Kosher' refers to a major project which they have been working on for over a year with. But not my department. We have nothing to do with 'Kosher'. Ooops.

&amp;nbsp;

Sue continues for about five minutes until she finally has to take a breath (honestly I was impressed with her apparent lung capacity) and I jump in with, “You misunderstood, I'm not on Kosher, I was just asking if everything with MY quote is kosher.”

&amp;nbsp;

“Well of course YOUR quote doesn't have anything to do with Kosher. Why would it? Not EVERYTHING is Kosher,” she snapped back.

&amp;nbsp;

“I know that not everything is for the Kosher event Sue, it's a saying. 'Is everything kosher?' is just a way of asking if everything is all right. So, is everything all right with my quote?”

&amp;nbsp;

“Uh, I haven't looked at it, but I guess it probably is... So you aren't on Kosher?”

&amp;nbsp;

“No, I am not. Is there anything else I can help you wi-” and the line cuts. With a big sigh I get up to go make my tea. 

&amp;nbsp;

Now making tea does not take very long, so I was surprised to see someone waiting outside my office upon my return. It is one of the interns (Danny) holding what looked like the King James Bible, only printed out on office paper and put into a D-ring binder. “Can I help you bud?”

&amp;nbsp;

“Here is your copy of the Kosher briefs. I know there are a lot of them so I hole punched them and put them all in the binder in correct order from oldest to newest...” Danny trails off, no doubt seeing the look of despair on my face.

&amp;nbsp;

“I'm not on Kosher. It was a misunderstanding.”

&amp;nbsp;

“Oh. But I was told you were... what should I do with this then?” Danny asked, looking a little depressed that all of his hard work was for naught.

&amp;nbsp;

“Recycle it.”

&amp;nbsp;

“Oh. Okay... but they just sent out a memo about wasting printer paper and if my manager sees this in the recycling bin...” His voice trails off.

&amp;nbsp;

“Fine. Give it to me and I will hold on to it until Kosher is over, and then get rid of it.” I take the binder out of Danny's hands, and sit down at my desk. As I open up my laptop, wondering where I am supposed to hide this enormous binder full of briefs for a project that I am not working on, I notice that my email notification is going ballistic. Ding. Ding. DING. I open the first one, without really looking at the heading wondering what just went and lit itself on fire and why I needed to know so urgently about it...

&amp;nbsp;

Someone went and added me to the Kosher mailing list. Great. Hundreds of emails are coming in. Everything that has ever been sent as part of this group mailing list is coming into my mail box. I call IT. “Hey guys, can I be taken off of the Kosher mailing list? I'm not actually part of Kosher.”

&amp;nbsp;

“BUT THEY JUST SAID YOU NEEDED TO BE URGENTLY ADDED TO KOSHER. TELL SALES THAT THEY NEED TO SORT THEIR SHIT OUT BEFORE THEY CALL US AGAIN!” Click. IT and sales get into it on a regular basis. This response was basically what I expected. But hey, the emails have stopped, so that is something I guess. The phone rings... Just dreading what is about to come, I pick up.

&amp;nbsp;

“Hello...?”

&amp;nbsp;

It is my boss (Mary), who has been trying to sleep in this morning because I was supposed to be holding down the fort on a slow morning. “What the hell kind of hornets nest did you kick?” Mary says, in a bemused and slightly sleepy tone of voice. I explained everything that had happened and I swear she did not stop laughing for at least thirty seconds. “So it is all sorted then?” Mary asks.

&amp;nbsp;

“I think so?”

&amp;nbsp;

“Good.” she replied before hanging up, no doubt to go make some coffee and start work on deleting the few hundred emails that I had inadvertently had forwarded to her inbox.

&amp;nbsp;

I take my first sip of tea. It is cold. Joy. Ding goes my laptop. Another email. From the head of the sales department this time and it has been sent to the whole company:

&amp;nbsp;

“In the future, we would prefer if people would refrain from using the phrase 'is everything kosher' in official correspondence as it may lead to some confusion.”

&amp;nbsp;

TL;DR I used what I thought was a very common phrase to ask if everything was okay, which set off a firestorm of emails and phone calls, pissed off multiple departments and woke up my boss on her day off all before 8.30 for a project that my department is not working on.

I'm a university student that studies computer science. I'm super passionate about cs to the point where most regular days I wake up thinking about a project or new random thing to learn however recently maybe for two months I havent had any kind of spark of enjoyment from cs or any of my other interests.

I have no idea why  its not like I'm doing badly on my course and if anything the modules I'm learning are the most fascinating that I've come across. I'm now finding it really hard to do any kind of productive work because theres no spark of enjoyment anymore.

Also I have been finding it impossible to wake up, like I'll have an alarm for 8:30am but wont actually get out of bed till about 11:30 (some days even later) I just have 0 motivation to do anything.
Its got to the pint where I literally just came home from the shops today and just lay on my bed staring at a wall. I had no motivation to get up. I also don't feel any stress or panic for any upcoming deadlines.

Whole days go by where I literally do nothing, and knowing I did nothing makes me feel even worse. I'm still getting high grades(all firsts) and I gained a really good internship for the summer.

Has anyone else felt this? Sorry for the long post but if anyone is going through the same or has been through it I'd love to talk."

I will give a little background on my programming. 

I have been programming for over a year now, I primarily do web development ( I am actually currently in an web dev internship), but I also do some C++ on the side (I really like this language). I also do a little Java and Python here and there.

During my time of learning, I downloaded Unity and Unreal Engine (which I preferred Unreal so I'd like to work with that), while doing tutorials online I would have these crazy ideas on the incredible game I wanted to create, I entered in the ""I want to get this over with so I can make my game already!"", but then, I'd get frustrated because I didn't know what I was doing. And as such, I would get turned off by game dev. So I stuck to web dev because I was a bit better at it. 

I don't plan to study/major/become a game developer. I would like this to be a hobby of some sort and stick to web development. I just would like to make simple fun games so I can have some fun with programming. 

I find it difficult to take it easy and process it all. I know game dev is crazy big and all that it takes, so I'm asking if perhaps anyone has some kind of guide on how to tackle this. I know all the ins and outs about programming (granted I don't know much about animation, and 3D graphics/2D sprites). I know I want to aim at something, but I don't want to aim too high and then be disappointed in myself.

But they're simply just wearing out. I'm afraid they're going to ""Split off"" at the end this upcoming season.

I try my hardest to come to a complete stop/bring cleat covers but my cleats (The adapters to the shoe) typically only last one season (I use Look Keo). And my shoe is worringly wearing down...and these models are not ""Fixable"".

Does anyone have advice to make shoes last longer? Cleats I'm not too worried about, Wiggle/MEC/REI sell official/knock off Keo cleats for $10 USD.

Either that or I think I'm going to have to start adding duct tape to the front end of my shoes :(.


Admittedly, these are my first pair of shoes and the ones I used to get into cycling AND learn how to go clipless. Maybe some of the wear was my bicycle virginity being destroyed in the process but I'd like to make them last.

4afqnv,122,2016-03-14,"I [23F] live with about 20 people; the only other girl wants me to move into her room. I don't want to, am I being a jerk?",notmythrowawaynopeno,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4afqnv/i_23f_live_with_about_20_people_the_only_other/,"Hi guys. Kind of an atypical situation here, and also a bit time-sensitive since I need to make my decision tonight. I live in what people call a ""hacker house"" - a bunch of young folks in the tech industry (or studying to be in it), living together and hanging out all the time. I've been here since November and the turnaround is pretty high; most people who live here are interns or bootcamp students who just stay for a few months. In other words, people move in and out every month, and either someone already in the house will move into an open bed, or a new person will get it. Rooms have between 1-5 people in them. It's not glamorous, but it's fun as hell and my roommates/friends and I have had some great times. I'm in the minority of residents who actually has a full time job and is just staying here for fun/until I save enough money to rent a place alone in a city where housing is absurdly expensive, so my stay doesn't have a deadline at the moment.

Anyway, on to the root of the problem. I've been in the same room since I moved in, but have switched beds in that room a few times as opportunity arose. I'm super happy with my position right now, I've got a bottom bunk, I've got a corner where I keep my crap and there's a perfect little space for my laundry basket. I'm pretty content and I love the guys that I share a room with. A small detail is that I'm one of only two girls in the entire house; the diversity of the house very much reflects that of the tech industry. For a while there was going to be an ""all girls' room"" for those who wanted it...but obviously there aren't enough girls and the idea kept falling apart because I don't want to live with just girls for the sake of living with just girls. The second girl moved in about a month ago, I think she's super cool and we get along great. When she first moved in the people who own the house told me she'd prefer to live with girls but is fine if she doesn't, and asked if I'd like to move, which I politely declined. Now, maybe a month or so later, a bed in that room has opened up, and she asked me privately to please move into the room with her. The other roommate in that room and our house manager have also asked if I'd like to move.

Am I selfish for wanting to keep my spot? I guess my reasons seem kind of petty, I've lived in the house longer than 85% of the people here and I love my spot and roommates. I also don't really feel like moving and don't feel like being on a top bunk. I feel really bad that she might not necessarily feel comfortable being the only girl in the room, but I don't have that discomfort at all. It has nothing to do with her or the other guy in the room, just my own desire to keep my spot. Should I just suck it up and move into that room with them? I don't want to seem like a jerk, but I also tend to be a serious people-pleaser and have lately been trying to break out of that.
   
**tl;dr**: I'm one of 2 girls in a house of ~20 people, I don't want to move, the other girl wants me to move in with her. Is not wanting to move just because I want to keep my spot selfish? Should I just get over it and move?"

I'm just looking for people to talk to. If it goes further great, but that's not what I came for. If you PM me if you'd like to see me.

I'm a little under 6' dark short hair.

My go to topic is space flight. I love talking about the technology and risks involved in space flight. Careful because once I'm on that topic I'm going to have a lot to say.

I'm pretty quick with funny comebacks. I love twisting other people's words around in ways they didn't expect. Not in a mean way though, tact is definitely important to me.  

I play some computer games occasionally but I really prefer being productive in some way. I love to code little silly things, in my last relationship(Now ended) I would write code to my SO instead of romantic letters. 

PM me for my kik, snapchat, pictures, or just to talk. I always respond, I can't stand not responding ha ha."
4afr5f,1,2016-03-14,Gf of 7 years cheated on me and dumped me.,GarbageBin101,ExNoContact,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExNoContact/comments/4afr5f/gf_of_7_years_cheated_on_me_and_dumped_me/,"I know some of you may be tired of hearing about my story on IRC, but it feels good to write. I met my SO 7 years ago. She used to live in Mexico and I used to live in Canada. At that time, I had an online business and I decided to go to Mexico to spend some time with her. We became a couple. It was hard, but it was life. I enjoyed my time there.

Fast forward to last October, my business failed. I pushed her for us to get married. We needed to go to Canada for me to be able to continue my studies and to get a job. We got married in October and I left to Canada to get a job. We started doing the immigration papers (it was going to take up to a year).

In December, I really wanted to see her to spend some time with me in Christmas. She stayed 10 days in December and I felt something was wrong, she was detached, it was weird.


At some point, in January, she called me telling me that she cheated on me and that she did not want to come to Canada. That her feelings for me was dead long before but she was a coward and she did not know how to end the relationship. It was devastating.


In panic, I took a plane to go to Mexico to fix things up. I stayed there a month and we had long conversations. Basically, it was an intern at her work. He was hitting on her and she saw him once or twice outside of work. They were flirting by text and then after a party, she blew him in his car. The sex happened after the holidays but the texting happened before she came and she deleted the message of her phone when she came to Canada during the holidays.

It was a very hard month for me, she told me that she had to let me go because of what she did and that she feels extreme guilt. That she wanted out of this relationship for a while, but she was a piece of shit and the only way to exit it was to cheat on me. She also started therapy to fix her issues and did cut contact with this guy. I asked for details and she gave me all the details. However, knowing the whole truth did not bring any closure.

The day I took my plane to Canada, I exploded and insulted her. She just stood there and told me she deserved it and that she was a piece of shit. That her actions speaks a lot about her and not about me. That I should not blame myself.

I came back to Canada Feb.4th but I still have to talk to her to fix the divorce things and for my friends there to take some of my stuffs at her place (I have a car and a cat).

How do you feel better? I feel like I'm in a tornado? I cry everyday. I'm extremely depress. I miss Mexico, I miss her and what we used to have. I'm seeing a therapist, it does help but I feel like I'm on an emotional roller coaster. I want to feel better but I'm so hurt.

I'm so hurt and sometimes I just want to end my life. I want to end the suffering. I also want to hurt her. Why did she do that to me?

tl;dr: Gf of 7 years cheated on me and dumped me."

(Hopeful, yet lost Engineering student.)",ArF995,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/4ag5dj/how_can_i_change_and_become_the_person_i_want_to/,"First off, I'd like to say that I've just made my account minutes before posting this, for the purpose of posting this. I want this to be something I want to commit to, and I don't want it to be a throwaway account.

&amp;nbsp;

Also I'm not really sure if I should be posting here or elsewhere, because I have a mixture things I want to deal with, not serious enough to post on r/Depression, but I'm not happy enough to just shrug things off.

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

***Anyway***, here's the text wall.

&amp;nbsp;

Basically, about me. I am the son of a single mother, (my dad left us when I was young) it hasn't affected me adversely in any big way but my relationship with my mother has been difficult at times. You could say I was a bit of a trouble-child, nothing serious like drugs, running away etc. but I would be quite lazy, sometimes disobedient, and generally a pain in the ass. My childhood has obviously shaped who I have grown to become now (still pretty lazy).

&amp;nbsp;

Now, I am 20, and I have fairly recently withdrawn from university to return in January next year (to sit my 3rd year second semester again). I study Chemical Engineering, and though I am really passionate about it, I doubt if I am capable and I sometimes have quite low self-esteem about the whole thing - I always seem to be sceptical. 

&amp;nbsp;

Last year, I knew I was at a disadvantage and I wanted to take time out of university before my 3rd year, (honours). Now, my mum is a very stereotypical Iranian parent. As long as I can remember she has always been pushy about my studies and about being successful, and this has and still does put a lot of pressure on me. She insisted that I stay in education, so instead of taking time out before 3rd year, I ended up having to leave half-way through. This was mainly due to the stress, depression, and a fear of failing my whole 3rd year. At the worst of times, I would think about what I might end up doing to myself if I failed my second semester, or what I would do with my lfie. I didn't do very well in the first semester (B,D,E,F were my grades) and I was constantly worried - I still am - about my ability and grades.

&amp;nbsp;

Throughout my university experience, I have focussed so much on doing well, but rarely actually been able to apply myself properly. It’s caused me a lot of stress, and I feel like I’ve sacrificed so much. At the time of withdrawing I realised I had no hobbies, no close friends, and that nothing made me happy. Other than that I also feel remarkably out of place, I’ve been told I’m mature for my age, but I’m pretty sure people just say that – I don’t feel mature enough. I hate the student culture, and (mainly up hear in Scotland) the obsession with drinking. Sometimes I feel like I’d fair better in some other time; I was reading “Surely your joking Mr Feynman” and he was discussing his university days and I just feel like these days we don’t have these cliques that push each other to succeed and the fraternities and traditions. I thought university would be older, more mature, and full of people who want to make something of themselves. But it just feels like it’s mainly fully of 20 somethings that don’t quite know what they’re doing with their lives (me included). I know I want to do engineering, and my dream is that I could make a difference in the world somehow (Most of my friends are just in it for the money.) But, again I just don’t know if I can do it, or what I’d do or want to do otherwise.

&amp;nbsp;

Now I am currently living at home with my mother, trying to study, and develop my skills; find an internship and a part time job, among other things. I have a friend who is in industry (he can’t give me a job trust me) and he advised me that taking a year out is very likely going to be interpreted badly, by future employers etc. so told me to keep in mind that a year out could be destructive.

&amp;nbsp;

Since last year I’ve tried to keep a journal, and I have plenty of really good plans but I need to put them into motion. I hope I can keep up with my studies and try to become more knowledgeable and capable (is there a sub for this kind of improvement?) I also want to try to take up some hobbies and sports (I’d be open to suggestions, right now I have an Arduino and I’m messing around with that).

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;



**tl/dr:**

&amp;nbsp;

**I hate who I am now, want to be better (more productive, happier). Love engineering though worried I can't do it. How do I change it all?**


&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;


I know I cannot just get a shitty part-time job, and do some resits, and return back in January, same-old same-old. I know I need to change, and become more mature and capable. But sometimes I just don't know how, or if I can be capable. I need to change, r/selfimprovement. I need to become the type of person Does anyone have similar experience, or is anyone in the same situation?

&amp;nbsp;

I’m open to any questions if I haven’t filled in the gaps.

I'm about 45-1 hour from central Maryland so there are no shortage of ""software engineer internship"" postings coming from that area. I am literally blasting out my resume to everything I come across and I've had 3 interviews which have led to naught. When I apply to big companies like MITRE, SAIC, Lockheed, Northrop, Siemens, etc. should I be following up with a email for phone call to their HR department or do I just sit back and wait? I'm starting to stress because the windows for summer internships is quickly closing."

Also, where does the desire for highly intellectual work fit into the desire for entrepreneurship?",blastbking,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4ag7te/how_do_i_find_a_job_that_isnt_boring_also_where/,"The other day I was reading the [Do CS Careers get any better?](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4a3bdo/do_cs_jobs_get_any_better/) thread and I could really empathize with OP. I'm a junior in college pursing a BS in CS and I've done a bunch of software internships and in every one of them, I've felt somewhat bored or otherwise not intellectually stimulated. I think maybe it was that I felt I didn't need to go to college to just glue together some APIs, and I was craving an experience closer to what I've had with classes (enjoyed working with computer vision, machine learning, and robotics).

Realizing that I might need to get an advanced degree to get a job where I apply concepts from these fields, I started getting involved with research at school. I have some iffy grades on my transcript from underestimating certain classes though, and poor grades in math classes, so I have doubts about my ability to get into a good graduate program in robotics. If possible, I'd like to skip the graduate school part and go straight to industry, but I'm not sure how to do this.

1. Can anyone here offer advice on how to find a job I'll be interested in without getting a graduate degree?
2. If I do need a graduate degree, can I get a good job in robotics without a degree from a top program?

I have the option of working at a pure SE team at Google this summer, or staying at school to do research. Part of me really wants to be an entrepreneur, and part of me really wants to work on things that are intellectually stimulating (rather than the next ['sugar water'](http://techcrunch.com/2012/02/25/sugar-water/) company). Once I thought an ideal scenario would be to complete a PhD and start a company based off my research, but after a VC told me this was incredibly uncommon I took a step back and reevaluated this. I think the ideal scenario would have been working at or founding a company like [Cruise](http://fortune.com/2016/03/11/gm-buying-self-driving-tech-startup-for-more-than-1-billion/) but I unfortunately was rejected.

3. What should I be considering when picking between these two choices for the summer? Which would you pick in my situation?
4. I like research and work that's more intellectual (vs rote software engineering, which I'm good at, but is dry). I also really, really want to make my own startup. What do I do? Is getting a PhD mutually exclusive with founding a successful startup?

Also, [here's my resume](http://imgur.com/MtUU9rP), I'd appreciate any feedback."

She used to live in Mexico and I used to live in Canada. At that time, I had an online business and I decided to go to Mexico to spend some time with her. We became a couple. It was hard, but it was life. I enjoyed my time there.


Fast forward to last October, my business failed. I pushed her for us to get married. We needed to go to Canada for me to be able to continue my studies and to get a job. We got married in October and I left to Canada to get a job. We started doing the immigration papers (it was going to take up to a year).


In December, I really wanted to see her to spend some time with me in Christmas. She stayed 10 days in December and I felt something was wrong, she was detached, it was weird.


At some point, in January, she called me telling me that she cheated on me and that she did not want to come to Canada. That her feelings for me was dead long before but she was a coward and she did not know how to end the relationship.

4agaym,2,2016-03-14,[Light] I feel dead,havingabadday12,confession,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/4agaym/light_i_feel_dead/,"[Light]

I woke up this morning feeling like shit and it's made me look back on my life and my past relationships.

I grew up in a dysfunctional family, like most. My mother was emotionally absent, and my father lived in Korea so I didn't see him for years at a time with occasional visits in between.

My mother worked part time jobs and my older brother was never at home due to all the fights he had with my mom. I was stuck at home taking care of my little brother who was a baby.

Fast forward a couple years, and I realize that I moved every 2 years of my life through three different countries. Four high schools and three colleges. I had trouble adjusting everywhere. I'm not the most outgoing or prettiest person..

Then my final year of college I finally got a boyfriend who was a high school friend. I broke up with him after 3 months because I was sick/tired/afraid of the relationship and deeply regretted it. I fell into depression once again and started my internship. 

At this internship I met one of the most horrible bosses (a typical Korean boss) and had a terrible time. He made me work out during lunch time and had me run errands. I was given nothing to do but be his personal bitch that he occasionally leered at (sexually) which was fucking gross considering that he's married and in his 50s. 

This led to a mental breakdown that was very similar to schizophrenia. I began writing poetry and posting it on SNS detailing the most embarrassing and self-loathing thoughts about myself to everyone I knew. I cried at my internship openly and had everyone looking at me. I then suddenly started to have delusions that everyone at the office knew I was mentally insane and wanted to fire me. I was physically paralyzed and, to this day, I cannot explain the level of physical and mental fear I felt sitting in that chair. I remember seeing a group of workers chatting near me and I thought they were all whispering about what a crazy person I was.

I went home early without permission and wrote another poem detailing my horrible day and even mentioning the company's name and uploaded to my SNS which my boss could see. My mother saw it and was alarmed. I had another panic attack (or delusion) at night where I started hearing voices. I had trouble breathing and could not coherently explain my thoughts to the point where I had to write down my thoughts carefully and hand it over to my mother for her to read. 

I went to the hospital the next day with absolutely no feeling in my body or my mind and I was put on anti-depressants. I made it to work the next day somehow and began to slowly recover.

Then I met this guy that works in the same building through a company outing. I asked for his number (I asked for everyone's number that I met at the internship) and that's when he started texting me throughout the week. It became more and more serious. I didn't realize what was happening at the time since I knew he was married and he was in his early 40s. I thought that he was just being genuinely nice and I loved what a kind person he was.

But it eventually led to an affair. I was sleeping with him once a week. He was my second guy that I've had in my whole life at 26. I was devastated throughout the whole affair. I hated myself and wanted to kill myself. 

I went back to the hospital to start receiving therapy. The therapy helped me realize that I had a lot of issues growing up and that I had no one to rely on until now.

I've gotten better and I'm still on medication. I cut off contact with the married guy but I still miss him and love him. I've had sex with 3 more guys aside from him but I still can't get over the married guy.

I don't even know where I'm going with this. I woke up in such a bad mood and I wanted to write down what I was feeling and my history. I hate how messed up my life is and I hate my own actions. I wish I could erase my past and start anew. I feel like my life is a mess and I can't do anything about except keep living.

So going into college, I've never been employed. (I tried applying for jobs on campus, to no avail :( )

I went my university's internship fair where I handed out several resumes and made a genuine effort. [As an engineering major, it is crucial to get some kind of experience in the field as it often becomes your entry to the workforce] After two weeks, I got a call back from a company, went to an interview, and got the job!

Here's the catch: it's in a pretty dicey part of the city.
((There's a bus line walking distance from the company that I would have access to and I would be working M-F business hours, so it's not AS bad as it could be.))

I told some of my upperclassmen friends and they were FLOORED that I, a FRESHMAN, managed to land an internship. They are incredibly proud of me and it felt pretty good to get that recognition.

I made phone calls to my family once I got the news and I received interesting responses: 

* ""Oh.""
* *silence* ""Well we'll see about that.""
* ""Are you sure there's isn't somewhere else? Didn't you turn in a bunch of resumes?""

Nobody in my family wants me to take the internship. I've gone to at least 10 interviews in my life, all of them turning me away, and now, I finally managed to get my foot in the door and nobody approves.

4agnyp,40,2016-03-14,Never go in blind,kerbyfullyloaded,badroommates,https://www.reddit.com/r/badroommates/comments/4agnyp/never_go_in_blind/,"Last year, first semester, I had a blind roommate through the apartment complex I lived in (friend I was supposed to room with unexpectedly got a really great internship offer out of state). She seemed nice at first, just a bit quiet, but to each their own, right? We both worked outside of class, so we were really only at the apartment to study and sleep, so I didn't care if we were friends or not, as long as we got along. About a month after moving in, I got viral meningitis. I was on the couch going in and out of consciousness for a few DAYS while she went along her daily business, not paying any mind to me slowly dying from a fever and dehydration. When my friend showed up after I didn't respond to her texts for those few days, she freaked out and drove me to the ER, and asked my roommate why she hadn't done anything to help me, and my roommate just said ""I didn't realize it was my problem.""

And THEN when my mom brings me back from the hospital, the apartment was wrecked. I usually cleaned it, but in the week I was sick and then in the hospital, everything piled up. The sink was so full of dirty dishes and pots that she had to start piling them on the floor, and all of the counter space was covered in half-eaten and rotting food. She was storing fresh, perishable food in our coat closet, and half of it was rotting as well. My mom is a bit of a clean freak and flipped out. After she got me situated on the couch, she threw out almost all of my roommate's food, cleaned the pots and put all the dishes and cups in the dishwasher, cleaned the counter and reorganized my roommate's cabinets so she would have space to store food in the kitchen. My roommate got back from work and my mom, very politely, informed her that she had cleaned everything, that she had moved everything, and that she would probably be up the next weekend on to check on me. As soon as she left my roommate almost had a panic attack because things had been moved.

There were other, less major things as well: I went to bed around midnight, her around 3 am, and she never failed to wake me up when she went to bed (we shared a room). She usually had to get up around 5:30 am for work, but never woke up to her alarm until it had been going off for at least thirty minutes. I turned it off and woke her up most mornings, and then contemplated life while I tried to figure out what to do until 8 am when I had to get up to meet my friend at the gym. Our neighbors complained about this to us frequently because her alarm was so loud, but my roommate didn't understand the problem. She also opened my mail, including my bills, more than once, and didn't seem to realize it was a crime for her to do so.

After all of this, I decided it wasn't working out. I told her about six weeks before the semester ended that I couldn't live with her for another semester. Some of my friends had an extra room for the following semester because the girl who lived in it was going on a study abroad and had offered to let me move in. I told her I would help pay for January rent in case she couldn't find someone else to move in, and that I would help her search for another roommate. She agreed, but told me a few days later that she would rather I stay because she didn't want to deal with getting a roommate or finding new furniture, because all the furniture belonged to me. I told her that was fine because a girl I knew was moving off campus and needed a place to live, and we got along pretty well in class.

Well, fast forward to finals week. Everything was set for my friend to move in at the end of the week and my roommate to move out. Except my roommate didn't want to move out. She waited until the last Tueday we're ever supposed to live together and says she won't leave until the beginning of the next semester in mid-January, but won't pay rent. Well, I freaked out at her, because my friend had already gotten a moving truck set up for that Saturday, and I couldn't afford the whole month's rent by myself. So we got into a huge fight, and I went outside to cool off and call my friend and let her know what was happening. When I went back inside, I went to take a shower and get ready for an all-nighter (at this point it was already midnight because I had had a night final). I went into the bathroom and saw that the full-length mirror on the door was broken, and a large, dagger-shaped shard was missing. I immediately took a picture and sent it to my mom and my best friend with a caption ""I didn't break this, my roommate did, just saying this for the record."" My roommate had locked me out of our room, so I couldn't even grab my pajamas or a blanket to sit at the table with. I started studying but dozed off around 3 am, and woke up to my phone going off. My friend had apparently called the police, and they were outside our apartment. I let them in, explained the situation and showed them the mirror. They knocked on our bedroom door, and we could all hear my roommate pacing, but she wouldn't answer the door or come out. The police told me they didn't think it was a safe environment and took me to my best friend's apartment. 

After my final the next morning I went to the police station, got a copy of the report from the previous night and submitted a request to file a PPO against my roommate. Luckily, just the police report and the PPO request were, per my lease, grounds for my roommate to be evicted. She had 24 hours to gtfo, I didn't have to pay for her to be removed from the lease, and my friend still got to move in that weekend. 

(And I have to say I'm actually really grateful the police made me leave. The next semester, my partner for a group project was a coworker of my former roommate. He told me that she had had the mirror shard in her backpack the morning after she broke the mirror, and that she had been telling a friend that she had slept with it under her pillow 'to be a ""surprise"" in case I started arguing with her again.')

4agppz,1,2016-03-14,The 10 year roller coaster ride of weight loss (From 330 to 230 to currently 240),osufeth24,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/4agppz/the_10_year_roller_coaster_ride_of_weight_loss/,"My first post in here, I read FAQ so I hope I am within the rules.  But I figured my simple story (it's nothing earth shattering, but I don't get to tell it to people) can help others as I'm sure i'm the ""typical"" person losing weight.

*Warning, Long Post*


Growing up I was always a bigger boy, never super fat, but just bigger than most coast (I was awesome in basketball!)  But come high school I got fat quick.  I just kept eating.  My senior year of high school (2006) I had both 6th and 7th period off and got out 2 hours before normal school.  I remember I would eat a lunch in the cafeteria, then stop at Subway or Pizza Hut and eat again.  I wasn't really depressed, I just loved food, and not the healthy stuff.  By the time I graduated I was 330lbs.  Didn't go to homecomings didn't go to prom, just was too embarrassed, I knew no girl wanted to be with me.  So that summer, when I saw that number, I said enough.  I started on the Nutrisystem diet, within 3 months I had lost 30 lbs.  Was feeling better, and started going to gym.  By the time my junior year of college (2008) I transferred to Ohio St University (I lived in Florida), was on my own really for the first time.  I was 280 lbs.  This is when it got bad...

I was still doing fine the first couple of months as I had to do a lot of walking to classes (20 min walks from apartment to classroom).  But thanksgiving and Christmas came, and I ate a lot.  Then the Ohio winter hit, and I wasn't doing much.  I went to OSU to become a meteorologist.  Which meant taking Calculus classes and Physics.  By winter, I wasn't doing well, and was failing the classes.  It was then I realized I would have to transfer to a college back home as I couldn't afford to stay longer for out of state tuition.  My dream was over and I became sad again.  By the time I came home in June of 2009, I was 320 lbs again.  All that hard work I did  the past 2 years were gone.  Time to start over.


I spent most of my remaining 2 years in college not losing a lot of weight.  I would go down and then go up a bit.  Fall semester I ended my college with an internship in Charlotte working at the speedway.  I wish I knew how I did it, but after the 3 months working there I came home and weighed 270!  I was in shock.  But of course, thanksgiving rolls around again, and by December 2011 I was 295.

I didn't get a job right out of college so I had to live with my parents.  Eventually I landed a small job working at a tennis resort (i played tennis for 18 years) , where I weighed at 280 lbs.  That's where things turned around for me.  Because it's tennis club/fitness, I knew a lot of people I could ask advice for.  I worked mostly the closing shifts, so that allowed me to go to the gym for about a hour every morning, and I would eat a healthy lunch/ dinner (my go to was brown rice and grilled chicken), seriously, that's all I did.  By summer 2014, I got to 230!!  Couple of vacations came, and I had gained 10 lbs.  I became friends with a personal trainer, and he started giving me personal training sessions on the cheap.  We've been doing it for a year and half.

I wish I could end this by saying I'm ripped and lean.  But my diet as once again failed me.  My work schedule changed and now I work the morning shift (wake up at 430am).  Makes me tired, and because my days are ""longer"" i eat more often.  I've hovered around 245 over the past 6 months, and just a week ago I re started nutrisystem to give me that boost again.

While I'm only 245, I still am in the best shape of my life.  I can run at least a mile now without stopping, I have done a 5K and a Mudrun, all things I never thought would be possible.  I can wear most XL shirts.  My goal is between 200-210.

I apologize for the long post, but my purpose is that I'm not a go getter, I am actually rather lazy.  I would rather go play video games then do work.  But if I can do this and lose the amount I have, with just a little bit of will power, and some education on foods, you can as well.

I will edit some progress pics if people wanna see later.

tl;dr :  Weighed 330 in high school, went down to 280 went up to 320, went down to 270, went up to 300, now at 240."

Okay! Now that I am finished with my book. Let's see...hmm...hmm...hmm...

There was only one team that was nominated!

**Conical Depression**, you have been nominated to get into this new race prototype race car!

**Interns place racing gear on Rock and shove him into a race car. The race car says ""Rock On"" on the side of the car and it has flames painted on the side. The car looks very unstable and the wheels are a little loose.**

Okay, Rock! Let everyone know how the ride is when you get back!

**The car races down the track and overtakes a turn. Rock goes flying out of the rock and crashes into a barricade.**

Ouch! While the medics attend to **Conical Depression**, the rest of us will be leaving Germany and heading to our next destination.

Goodbye, Rock!

If any of the other teams have a  waifu, husbando, senpai or whatever then you will enjoy the next location!

**Mike tells the teams to get onto the airplane.**

No Amy, you and Samey can not bring a car with you. 

No Tyler, we don't have a wheelchair for you. 

Lindsay, how many times did I tell you I am not Tyler?! 

Courtney, please stop calling your lawyers. 

Where the heck is Topher and Tom?

I was thinking of california, arizona, texas, maybe florida... any state that would shield me from ever seeing snow during my stay.

I'll have a degree in Finance and MIS from a decent university in canada (top 15). I know some basic coding (mostly web programming) and some SQL, I'm familiar with statistical analysis and I have a good fundamental knowledge of finance (CFA level 1 cursus basically). My only ""real"" work experience outside odd jobs has been doing an IT internship at one of the big banks in Canada.

I'm fluent in french and english altho I don't know where my french skills could be an asset in the US. I'm often told my english is strong but I do have an accent and my vocabulary is less rich than in french. Would that be a problem ?

Other than that I'm fairly familiar with American culture through media, internet and geographical proximity.

I don't have much money but I do graduate with no debt.

I've heard it was best to get sponsored by an employer but I'm unsure if american employers would be willing to recruit someone from a foreign country with no experience or little technical knowledge. I'm not sure how I should proceed.

Thoughts ?"
4agw21,2,2016-03-15,I [21/F] feels betrayed by roommate/best-friend [21/F] after she got into a new relationship and moved out without telling me.,BeInAHuman,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4agw21/i_21f_feels_betrayed_by_roommatebestfriend_21f/,"I will use Layla for my friend, and Tony for her boyfriend. 

I have known, Layla for about four years now. When we first met in college around the end of 2012, we instantly clicked and became really good friends very quickly. We even started a club together and that definitely brought us closer together. We had such a great friendship and were literally inseparable. We would travel, do gymnastics, go out on the club/bar scene and much more. 

Fast-forward to last summer. The beginning of summer, she met a guy at her internship and after 1 week they were already declared themselves 'in a relationship'. Despite the hastiness of their relationship, I was still really happy for her. After about two months he broke up with her. (they are now back together, but were broken up at the time) She freaked out and basically demanded I move in with her because she felt very alone and 'needed her best friend to live with her"". At the time, I was actually ending my current lease, so it wasn't a big deal for me to move. I was actually thinking about moving anyway, so I thought why not move in with her since she needed me at the time.

Not even days before moving day, she mends her relationship with Tony and he decides he is moving into our apartment also. After living with her and Tony for a little while, I realized that our friendship was not the same. Everything we did, Tony had to join. She had to constantly beg Tony to hang out with me without him there and it even came down to her 'sneaking out' to hang out with me or our other friends while he was at work. I tried to explain to her that they didn't have a healthy relationship if she had to literally ask for his permission to do anything without him. 

After a few months, he decides that our apartment was too small and he wanted to live closer to where he was going to go to school the next semester (a different school than me and Layla attended). I thought he was moving alone, but Layla begged for me to move with them. I did not want to move, because we would have to pay a fee to break our lease and the current apartment we lived in was around 5 minutes from campus while the place they wanted to move to was 20 minutes from campus. She was pissed at me for not wanting to move out, even though I gave her good enough reasons to not move out. 

Over winter break I went back home, only to return to find out they got a new place and moved out. They didn't tell me they found a new place, I just came home to an empty-ish apartment, and confusion. A few days later, she finally tells me that her and Tony found a townhome with another roommate and they are now living there. She didn't end up breaking her lease, and is just paying rent for two places for the time being, so the problem isn't finances. The problem is, I now feel completely betrayed by her. I pretty much just stopped talking to her after I found out they moved. She texts and calls me all the time, and I just do not respond because I just feel so taken aback that she would up and move with Tony so quickly after practically begging me to move into her apartment after they broke up. I feel like the way I am cutting her out of my life is the wrong manner to handle things but I just do not know what else to do or tell her. 

Advice, personal experiences, anything. I just need to feedback on this situation. How do I even proceed from here?
   
**tl;dr** Roommate/best-friend begged me to move in with her after her boyfriend broke up with her. She ended up reconciling with boyfriend shortly after we move in and moved in himself also. After a  few months, boyfriend decides he doesn't want to live in that apartment anymore so they both get a new place without telling me. Currently ignoring my roommate/bestfriend and do not know how to proceed. "

I've just finished a stint at a startup in SF and after moving around in several departments I've realized data science is what I want to do. Before working at a startup I was in college part way through my sophomore credits before I dropped out to work for this startup. Now I want to go back for a degree but want to pivot out of marketing and into stats/CS degree for undergrad. Ultimately I want to pursue a graduate degree (PhD maybe) in Computational Science. I wanna do lab research or possibly high level industry work as a data science lead or R&amp;D.

I'm debating about getting an associates degree or two at a community college to save on money and in theory have a better developed resume for internships in DS / undergrad research experience in my region. I say two because at the institution I'm looking at I can get an A.S. in Information Systems which will give me CS1010 and CS1020 as well as supporting course work in SAS and SQL which I feel will be useful technical skills to have under my belt. The second degree would be in mathematics and would be for the sole purpose of having the degree title on my resume as well and getting math credits for cheaper. I've also considered getting a single A.S. in general engineering and doing a double major in CS and Stats to diversify my credentials. I feel like double majoring in stats and CS after having 2 A.S degrees in math and information systems provides no benefit besides possibly giving me an edge applying for research internships / undergrad research experience in my Sophomore and Junior year.

In summary, how would 2 A.S. degrees in information systems and mathematics look on an interns resume while they were essentially perusing the same two degrees at a 4 year institution, compared to someone who has a single A.S. in General engineering who appears to be pivoting away from it and into a data science role with a double major in stats and computer science?

Please, no pulled punches here. Any and all criticism is welcome. I'm trying to make a pretty serious decision and don't want to waste my time or leave any value on the table by making an ill-informed decision.

I applied for a junior/intern Android dev role at a small digital agency. I did a phone interview, was called in for on site, was offered to work there for only unpaid internship role. Prospect of full time in 3-6 months. I have seen the other posts about the law and all that, I will be working on an app they have in the play store, updating it to a newer version that is already on iOS. So it will probably benefit the company, and me with experience I guess building Android apps with other developers. 

I have already worked an unpaid internship with this same example for 6 months while I was still in school a year ago. Was basically promised the same, and when the time came(finished building a signup app for their service and released into store) they said they really liked me and wanted to hire me and all of a sudden stopped communication with me right after that. Now do I do the same again and risk it with this company?  This would be my second unpaid/below minimum wage offer I'll be receiving since job searching in January. Is this becoming the norm? It seems like paid entry level opportunities are few and far between."

The line stretches down the block as students wait to enter Alpha Sigma's first party of the semester. I stand on the doorstep of the opulent fraternity mansion, arms folded in a way that shows off my bulging biceps and rippled chest. The collar on my Abercrombie polo is up, obviously, and I scan the line for any lithe young pickings that I could have fun with. I dumped my Theta slampiece over the summer - I said I had to focus more on my Goldman Sachs internship, but the real reason was I was just... bored of her. Who knows what I'll find tonight? Maybe a girl truly worth showing off to the high society I had been born into...
_________________________________________________
Hey, thanks for reading! So the premise of this roleplay is pretty simple. I want to play a douchey, All-American frat bro who gets to corrupt and use a naive young first year. You could be a spoiled, stuck-up legacy blonde, a small-town busty brunette or even an ebony/latina girl who'd never dream she'd abandon her people to suck on the cock of a rich white guy. So long as you're creative and imaginative, I'm game!

This can be played short-term, but what I'd really like to do is create a little world of opulence and privilege. I want to seduce your character with promises of the high-life, taking you to all sorts of exclusive events and country clubs, all the while making you into a more and more depraved slut. By the end of it I want you to be my bimbo, a good, obedient little girl who smiles and sticks her chest out while the men discuss business.

Detail, creativity and good grammar are key. I'm pretty open to most kinks and this scene can go from plain vanilla to extremely dark.

Hope to hear from you!"

I'm also curious how people have dealt with being far from their GP/endo for a few months for this sort of thing, especially since I'm probably going to end up getting T prescribed through my university rather than my GP.

Background: 22 y/o female. Living in a different country as an au pair. Been here since July, speaking the language every day (though I took said language as my minor so that was helpful).


I just feel like I'm losing my fucking mind. 


All I do during the week is housework and take care of the dogs. Then I pick up the kid from school (she's older and doesn't really need taken care of). But **every time** I make a mistake, I am so terrified of the repercussions. 


My host parents aren't even mean or anything, I just have this weird fear of disappointing them. We live in the same house so it's like I can **never** just go home from work and relax, I'm always at work. 


In October I fucked up a dress that belonged to the kid by putting it through the wash. I did my best to fix it but if you look closely you can tell it isn't like it used to be. I'm so scared of what they'll do when they find out. The mom is definitely a perfectionist. 


I let an old lady handle one of the dogs the other day and my host parents said that wasn't okay. They said it in an extremely polite tone and without yelling or anything, but I still felt so guilty and awful. 


It all came to a head yesterday. I somehow fucked up the wi-fi and spent all night trying to fix it. (Router and stuff is in my room). I ended up resetting the router because I'm a fucking idiot and they had to re-enter all their information later that day. I pretended I didn't do anything but I'm afraid my host dad knows that I did. 


I get so nervous if they come home early and all the housework isn't done. This morning I was nervous because I heard them talking in the kitchen and they sounded displeased and for some reason I'm sure they were talking about me. 


They got upset because the kid just watches TV but she never wants to do anything with me, and when I ask her if she does want to do something, she just really angrily or snottily says ""no"". So I just continue with my housework or go to my room. 


I decided to stay here another year already. I want to see more of the world before I go back home. But I can't stop putting all this pressure on myself all the time and it's making me feel insane. 


Plus I'm mostly home alone. I sing very loudly to myself, voice fake conversations, and sometimes speak in very weird accents or made-up nonsense babbling. 


I always drop things. I just accidentally slammed my head into the door. I wasn't even holding or doing anything. I was just walking out of a room and didn't see the door right in front of my face. 


When I had schoolwork, and a job, and an internship, I was doing fine. But now I'm graduated and am essentially doing the work of a housewife and I feel like I'm fucking losing it. 


Can anyone relate? Or help me? My heart rate feels high just writing this post. Also, no prior problems with depression or anxiety or anything like that. I used to cut myself a little when I was like, 15, but it wasn't that bad."

I'm a professional writer and use this to help with my writers block. I'd love to play with some thoughtful, eloquent responses and am definitely interested in long term. Let me know if you have a prompt you've been wanting to try out and we'll give it a go. Also, if you'd like to play as a celeb, I'd be totally down!

Here are some prompts below but feel free to suggest your own.
THE NEIGHBOR - There's an 18 year old girl in my apartment building. I always see her by the pool late at night with boys her age but as I pass them, I always feel her eyes on me. Maybe this time when I pass, she's there alone.

THE INTERN - Office play, you're my intern and I'm an assistant to a boss at a huge company. You really appreciate all I've taught you and now that we're both working late maybe I can teach you a little more.

THE MILF DOWN THE STREET - I'm your sons friend who you've always thought was cute. I've always been a wise-ass...flirty even and you've felt me checking out your ass in those yoga pants you always wear. This time when I knock on your door and your son isn't home, you invite me in anyway.

STUCK IN AN ELEVATOR - We live in the same apartment building and although we're both too shy, now we're stuck together for God knows how long. Looking for some long-term ladies who are quick, thoughtful responders and won't leave me hanging. I'm mid-20's just over 6 feet, have blonde hair, blue eyes and am pretty thick with muscle.

Some of my kinks include: Oral, rough play, cum play, tit fucking, dom/sub (either position), MFF threesomes, Swallowing, creampies, some light non-con or manipulation and much more. Limits are animals, kids, incest and toilet stuff.

So shoot me an orange envelope and we can fool around."

I'm not on any birth control and haven't been for over a year because I can't find one that suits me hormonally (i have anxiety anyway and they all just seemed to ramp it up) and I broke up with my long term SO so wasn't really sleeping with anyone enough to really bother with it. 

Anyway about 3 weeks ago I went on a few dates with a guy and ended up sleeping with him. We used a condom so I wasn't very worried. I was due my period a week ago and missed it. I had all the symptoms of period (very sore breasts, cramping and feeling a bit more emotional) but no period! I took a pregnancy test two days ago and it came back negative. Then last night i found a little bit of blood in my knickers and thought i was coming on. However today all I've had is a sort of pinkish discharge which I have never seen before?

Has anyone else experienced this? All the internet is like PREGNANT/DEATH so I'm just looking for a bit of calming advice. I still have all the period symptoms and it's been about a week now so I'm getting concerned. 

I would just go to the doctors but i'm on an internship in a foreign country where medical access is a nightmare and I'd have to find someone to come with me to translate which when you're incredibly socially anxious it's a bit of a nightmare. 

Thank you in advance!"

I'm a first year CS student. I'm doing well at taking advantage of opportunities. I have a research position at an on campus research institution, a great internship accepted for this summer, and am an officer in a couple relevant clubs.

I came into school with enough credits to be considered a sophomore and with registration upon me I mapped out the rest of my classes and realized I'm on track to graduate after 3 years. That's means I only have two summers or one more opportunity to intern. Is that enough time to have a shot in major tech centers along the west coast? Does anyone else have experience graduating in 3 years? Should I put off graduation and maybe thin out my schedule and do a co op during a semester? Thoughts?"

I've never worn business casual before or done a capsule wardrobe -- my style thus far has pretty much been band tees/henleys, jeans, converse, and hoodies. 

I messed around on Polyvore trying to put something together that would be able to last two weeks of different outfits without it looking like I'm always wearing the same clothes. [Here's](http://imgur.com/HQLrepS) what I came up with. Two weeks of outfits on the left, all the individual pieces and accessories on the right. I don't plan to buy these exact pieces (I'll probably find approximations at H&amp;M or similar.)

The items I hope to include:

2 long sleeved button downs (1 striped, one plain white)

1 plain white shell/blouse

1 red sweater

1 black blazer

2 pairs slim fit slacks/cigarette pants (1 grey, 1 black)

1 black pencil skirt

1 blue shift dress

1 pair black pumps

1 pair strappy black flats

1 red scarf (or maybe a patterned one?)

I also included some accessories and I'm considering adding a cardigan as well.




How does it look? I'm worried it'll be a bit plain -- is there anything I could tweak to make it look a bit more fashion forward while still keeping things business casual appropriate? Is it going to look like I'm wearing the same thing every day? Any tips at all?

I am 26 and here is a little back story. 

I worked as a Business Systems Analyst for 2 years before my company decided to outsource most of IT.  I applied for a lot of jobs and finally got an offer for a QA Analyst position.  I was hesitant at first but I took the job because of good pay and I needed work.  I've only been in this QA position for 2 months but I already don't like it for several reasons.

The manager that hired me is no longer my manager.  The training has been non-existent which sucks because this is my first QA job.  I am not good with coding but I know enough to use Selenium Webdriver in Java.  Thing is, I realized I don't really want to be in this position and I feel like the longer I stay here the harder it will be to get out.

I feel like I would enjoy Sys Admin but I don't think anybody would take a look at me for this position.  I have worked computer support/IT for the past 8 years in some fashion.  I worked a year in computer repair, a 3 month internship in network admin, 1.5 years as a computer tech for a college, another 1 year internship, and a year on a help desk is included there.   

Could I get a Sys Admin job without getting certs?  I really don't have the desire to study anymore after college.  I know that's lazy of me but I feel like my work experience should be and to get me something better. EDIT:  to clarify the ""not wanting to study"" comment I meant I coming home from work to study a book for months. I have a family and not sure where I'd find the time.  I know u need to keep up with tech but most of that can be done on the job.


 Is there anything I can do besides certs?  Is there another position I should be looking for that doesn't deal with a lot of coding?

Also, would it be beneficial to talk to my manager about this?  I don't know if I can ask to pursue a different position in IT within the company after only 2 months and I don't want to let on I may look fit other opportunities."

Hey guys. So i attended my schools tech fest with resumes and whatnot.

Anyway, I had a pretty good talk with the guy, and he said the are looking for computer engineers full time but might open internship positions as well. A few days later, I email them describing my interaction with the attendant and send my resume again. 

Fast forward about a month, they email me back saying they would like to meet over lunch this week to see if I am what they are looking for this internship, specifically in the battery products department. How can i prepare for this interview? Do companies ask technical questions for internship interviews or just for full time interviews?

4akaul,7,2016-03-15,GF [24F] is leaving for africa next month for 5 months and we just started dating in December. [23M],throaway920606,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4akaul/gf_24f_is_leaving_for_africa_next_month_for_5/,"::WARNING:: there will be a **LOT** of text.
to preface this my first major relationship was with this girl from my HS from the end of senior year to 2 years later when I practically chose to go to her university to be with her because I had no other school/career choice that I really wanted to do. I broke up with her 2 months after moving there after finding out she cheated on me (no surprise) and even though I'm extremely needy I'd rather be alone and depressed than trying to fix my issues with someone who isn't on my page and cheats. Between ending it in Nov. 2012 and December of last year I've hooked up with 16 girls since then but never wanted to date any of them until now. Also I have a lot of debt (who doesn't) and really bad credit after leaving the school in 2013 because I couldn't afford tuition so I moved home with my dad (mom passed away in April 2013) who remarried almost instantly. Between leaving school and now I've drank as often as possible (not out of sadness or depression.more of boredom and just fear of loneliness and of thinking about that shit because I feel like there's nothing but me in my world and that's terrifying to a guy like me right now) Also I have no car (head gasket cracked and cant afford to get it fixed) and my license is suspended because I forgot to pay for a speeding ticket I got last year visiting my old school. So I've been walking to work at a dog daycare that I met my GF at which takes 40 minutes and I'm usually late.

I recently started seeing (almost daily) this girl who I worked with for a month before she left for a new job. The day she quit she started texting me and we hit it off pretty well and started hanging out shortly after. I found out very quickly that she graduated from a pretty damn prestigious private school in MN with a B.A in psychology and lives at home with her parents across town from me (in my childhood city) and they are very wealthy so she is very well off. 

This isn't very important to the reason I'm posting the story but if anyone could point me to where I could get help for this I'd love yo u long time but it bugs me all the time because I've never had an issue with my penis size but she basically let slip that she dated this dickwad (who'dve thunk?) for 4 years in college who was apparently 4 inches taller than me, pretty ripped and had a 7.5 inch dick. also kids in the family of a MAJOR beer company so hes got his own island. i'm sitting at a 5.5-6 inches which I know is average but fuck me if hearing that doesn't get me extremely pissed off. she takes mood stabilizers so it's damn nearly impossible to know how she really feels about anything but all signs point to her being over him and being very invested in our relationship (i'm not leaving out any details. I'm very aware of signs and her actions speak to me more than her words that she's honest 95% of the time to the best of her knowledge). but that's been bugging the fuck out of me and really nailing my insecurities on a wall. she couldnt cum with him apparently and only has by herself and out of the 8 guys who've given her head im the only one that ever could get her to and I can give her really good oral orgasms through oral every single time i go down on her no matter the situation but PIV sex has always been really..challenging. if anyone could point me to where I could ask advice for that thatd be great! ANYWAYS

I've never wanted to take care of myself or do anything for myself. I've always had very low self esteem and literally required the attention (positive or negative idgaf) of people my entire life to feel any validation or worth. This is magnified when I date people. My GF now has always been interested in animals and worked at in internship at the minnesota zoo for 8 months. I found out that shes actually going to africa from april 30th to early september (originally it was supposed to be late feb to november but she shortened it because of the relationship she didn't expect to happen) we're both very selective about our partners. also we're both incredibly in-tune with our childhood issues that affect us now in a relationship and we've recently realized that even though we've both been single for quite some time we can't work on these issues of abandonment and loneliness when we're single so we've decided to try and do this long distance shit because we need to work this stuff out and we're both the perfect partner for that. 

*major run-on sentence incoming*
 I don't want to be like my disgustingly toxic co-dependent parents but as of right now my brain is routed that way and I will listen to any advice anybody can offer on the subject. There's a part of me that is deeply depressed/emotional/oversensitive/need that I've done a very good job at hiding from everyone (including my GF) and another part that recognizes these stupid (albeit legitimate) feelings from a 3rd party perspective so it keeps me relatively grounded but it doesn't help me find solutions to them or be happy. 

Sorry for this long ass text. I haven't had a therapist since high school and I have nobody else to go to to ask for help.

**[[So what I'm asking is can anyone give me any advice for a poor, carless half completed college 23 year old male who can't fill the void that's been in his life since he was born? I just want to WANT to take care of myself and be independent but I don't know where to start to make my brain become that.]]**
   
**tl;dr**: GF of 2 months leaving for africa for 5 months. I'm very lonely/depressed/low motivated but want to make it work because of our emotional intelligence compatibility and opportunity to confront terrifying feelings that remind me of my shitty parents.

Company A is moderate size and were extremely nice and personal with me.

Company B however is an extremely large company, one of my top choices for future employment. They pay double of what Company A pays, and they also fully cover housing. However, they will not be able to get back to me by the time I have to answer back for company A. I already told Company B about my other offer but I'll still mostly have to go through a few more interviews before they make their decision,( though they told me the first one went extremely well). I'm afraid that if I ask for an extension on the deadline for company A that they'll just flat out take back my offer since my reluctance to accept the offer clearly means that I'm waiting for other offers and they're a relatively small company in need for committed interns. I'd feel extremely bad if I accepted the offer for Company A but then was offer a position in Company B and I reneg Company A's offer, what will occur if i do so?.

When I was 13 years old, my mother taught me how to bake a cheesecake. When I say “taught”, I mean she wrote her recipe on a scrap of paper, set it on the kitchen counter by me, and walked away. So begins my heartwarming tale of how I grew to love baking. I fumbled around the kitchen, awkwardly putting ingredients into the mixing bowl in an attempt to make something edible. I can’t say the rock hard, slightly burnt cheesecake was delicious but it was enough to make my mom say, “good job,” and put a smile on her face which means it was good enough for me.
	

Although my school life was far from perfect, my days in the food industry have been nothing short of amazing. Over the years, I finally realized why it is that every job I look for has been working with food. There are few things I have loved more than seeing the delight on a person’s face when I hand them something sure to be delicious, and I want to learn the skills to ensure that is always the outcome.
	
After successfully acquiring my degree in Baking and Pastry Arts, I plan to intern at a high quality restaurant to gain the experiences I will need to be an even more successful chef. From there, I want to open a bakery named Luna, specializing in the dessert that started it all: cheesecake. My ultimate goal is to continue to create smiles, because there are few things greater in life.

Dear Human Resources Team,

The intent of this letter is to express my interest in the Marketing and Public Relations Internship. With my past experience in marketing and desire to expand on it, genuine passion for working with people, and my technical and organizational skills, I feel that I possess many qualities that would make me a valuable addition to (place)'s staff.

With several years of experience in leadership positions, I am a team player, effective organizer, and have education and experience in marketing that I seek to build upon. During my time as the Museum Manager at the (museum), I have strengthened my ability to market and sell our merchandise to individual visitors as well as plan events and organize tours. I am confident in my abilities and possess sound judgment as well as an instant connection to people.

My strongest points are my creative abilities and understanding how people work and what they are receptive to, not only from a marketing standpoint but from a persuasive standpoint, as well. At (museum), I also managed its Facebook page. Through creative tactics, I increased the likes on the page by 17.5% in under four months. At (newspaper), I manage the Twitter account and have increased tweet impressions by 3,300% in one month. On top of creative marketing tactics, I have a crucial eye for design as I have been an avid drawer who designs on the side for the past 11 years.

As a final note, if it is of any concern, I do have housing for over the summer in the (internship) area despite that I am based in (home state and school state). I look forward to providing more information in an interview.

Sincerely,

I graduated with a degree in history about 9 years ago. I fell for the whole, ""You can get a degree in anything"" bs. Well after working a few crappy jobs, I returned for my masters and I told myself that I would only go back if it was deemed ""useful""

I was looking for something that I was truly interested in. Careers that attract me are non profit work, government and teaching. The problem with teaching though is that it seems hard to find a job OUTSIDE of teaching once you have been doing it for a long time, especially with a history degree. Due to the impracticality of my degree, I really do not like my bachelors degree. 

I decided that I wanted to work in non profit management or government work or even management in the private sector if they will have me. The issue that I am having is that everyone that I know with a business degree works a decent white collar office job(which I like) and it seems a lot of liberal arts degrees do not. It makes me feel like I majored in the wrong thing at the bachelors level. Every liberal arts grad that I know is practically doing either retail jobs, working where I work at(call center eww) or teaching. 

My options that I have considered are to either 1. Go back for a certificate, there is one that is a grad certificate in non profit management at my local university. I could use the internship there to network my way in. 2. Go for another masters in management or try an MBA(I am not too good at math though) or 3. Try another online bachelor's degree in corporate communications(more useful).

One person once asked me what my ""dream job"" was. My dream job would be to either get a Phd in Political Science or Public Administration, but I have NO SUPPORT from family at all, so if I did that, and still couldn't find a job, then I would be REALLY SCREWED. So what advice can you guys offer me?

I am thinking of majoring in comp sci or business. I'll probably major in CS and minor in business. I understand that UMBC is the best to go to for CS, but I also hear it is very quiet and dead. I also hear that Towson and Salisbury are better for business degrees and have a livelier atmosphere. I am not looking to party extremely hard, I just want to know that there are new people to meet, things to do, and yes party (a little). I also plan on living on campus at any of these universities.  As for my career, I plan on becoming a programmer who will hopefully make it out to the "".com""/tech companies. I know that this will be very difficult but I'm not going to let that stop me. My original plan was to get in to College Park, but they kindly rejected me and that sent my whole 5 year plan out the window. CP was the perfect fit for me because of its great CS/business program and its campus life, not to mention the big tech companies tend to visit there more to offer internships and other post college benefits.

* My question to you guys is which seems like the best fit for me?

* Those that have attended UMBC/Towson/Salisbury, how was it? Anything to recommend/prepare for? 

* What type of tech companies visit UMBC for internships/jobs?

I graduated with a degree in history about 9 years ago. I fell for the whole, ""You can get a degree in anything"" bs. Well after working a few crappy jobs, I returned for my masters and I told myself that I would only go back if it was deemed ""useful""


I was looking for something that I was truly interested in. Careers that attract me are non profit work, government and teaching. The problem with teaching though is that it seems hard to find a job OUTSIDE of teaching once you have been doing it for a long time, especially with a history degree.

For auditors in the KPMG SVO office (this is where I'll be interning) what locations do you typically have to travel to?

I'm going to be in the software/hardware group. So I think that I will have a better chance if I pick Japan or China as my top priority locations. However, I would like to go to Europe if possible.

Any thoughts or suggestions from people at KPMG or in the SVO office would be awesome. "

I am in the top 15% of my class and am also the *Vice President - Public Relations* at my local Toastmasters group. As for previous employment: two crappy fast-food gigs (one in high school and my current one) and this unrelated manual labor job. There are also some other things that I have not put on my resume because they were from high school (on golf team, was a section leader in the marching band and in the National Honor Society to name a few things).

I'm really interested in working for a small-medium sized startup, but as a fresh grad I'll obviously be grateful for any offer I hopefully get. I know Snapchat and Tinder are located here which is very cool. Working in Venice for a smaller company like Snapchat that has worldwide appeal seems almost like a dream job to me.

Also, how are the game studios here? I know Blizzard and Riot Games are in the general area. I hear the competition to get hired though is rough and the hours and pay can be worse. Anyone have experience with this?

And lastly, any general advice? I'll be interviewing for internships starting this upcoming fall and checking out all the career fairs at USC.

4al4ih,0,2016-03-15,So I lied about something on my resume,imlegitscrewed,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/4al4ih/so_i_lied_about_something_on_my_resume/,"Today I applied to my first internship in the finance industry. I met a recruiter during a campus conference, who was thoroughly impressed with me and encouraged me to email him my resume so that I could be considered for a quant investing role. I won't mention the name of the firm, but they are definitely a household name to you guys.

I've only done SWE internships in the past, because I'm a computer science undergrad, and as a result have never been asked for my SAT score that hedge funds/banks tend to do. So when this company asked me for mine, I was a little shocked, because 1) I frankly don't remember the breakdown (M;W;R) and 2) I didn't think there was a way for me (or at least them, legally) to retrieve scores for a test I took almost 5 years ago. This is where stupid comes in: I'm already at a prestigious university that is definitely a target school for a lot of firms across many disciplines. I got in with a (real) 2250 SAT, but as I was adding my score to my resume and completing the application online, I had the urge to boost it by 100, to a 2350 (my logic at the time was that since I don't remember the breakdown anyways and I don't want to pay $31 to find out, it probably won't matter). Now I've just submitted the application and I feel shittier than ever.

So I'm asking for some personal experience: have the companies you've applied to ask to you verify your scores, and if so how and when? I'm going to rescind my application by saying I've gotten another offer from a different firm just because I don't want this to haunt me for the rest of my career. But I definitely need some anecdotal and legal advice here, to help me come to peace with myself and know if there's a possibility I've perjured myself or something."

I wanted to come back so other people can see that it does get better.

A day or so afterwards, I had a coworker message me on fb to ask me on a date. I never noticed that he liked me, we passed in the hall a few times and chitchatted. Nothing big. I'm not saying I'm going to jump into anything, but getting coffee the other day was nice. It's nice to know that it's true there are other fish in the sea. I told him that I wasn't looking for anything serious, what with school and work, but that I really appreciated his company.

I've been running everyday and I'm starting to feel stronger and better about myself with every little milestone.

As soon as word got around in my tiny college major, our friends came out team-me and it's been great to see that I do have friends that care about me.

I did hit a little blip yesterday when his mom texted me. She was trying to get in touch with him and he NEVER told her that we had broken up! I didn't give her specifics and just told her I was fine and that he had some personal stuff to figure out. She told me that out of all his gf's, I was his fave, so that made me feel a little better.

All in all, I still have my lonely moments and I do miss him. That said, I'm really focusing on classwork and trying to score my own freelance work. I'm also looking forward to getting an internship for the summer as well.

I'm also proud of myself for deleting his number, his fb page and not allowing myself to peek at his page. I don't wanna know.

TLDR, It get's better. The best revenge is a life well lived and go me!"

My first gateway to cinephilia presented itself in the form of my older brother. Five years my senior, he introduced me to many of those accessible classics in that brief period that I could still remember before he went off to college (I was 10 - 13). I vividly remember the family movie nights he would set up:  watching Pulp Fiction and being immensely curious as to how the dialogue felt so lively, being scared shitless by Alien, trying to hide my tears at Warrior’s denouement, and asking question after question after Inception, begging for his explanation which I would hold above any other and repeat to classmates as the singular truth.

Life got in the way and movies became a bit less prevalent in our household after he left. I kept up on culture, reading through every copy of Entertainment Weekly that would get sent over to our house, and watching some of the bigger releases, but mostly forgpt about cinema for a while. In 10th grade, a friend recommended Taxi Driver and, after months of resisting, I finally sat down and gave it a shot. I remember that night vividly. I finished watching the film, and was a completely wreck. Feeling indescribably grimy, I showered immediately after, and spent the rest of the night reading up on the film and on others like it. The next day I watched The Usual Suspects; the day after, Reservoir Dogs. 

I don’t know how *Life Itself* wound up being one of the earlier entries on my journey into film, but it did and I am eternally grateful. I think that initially, Roger Ebert’s legacy fascinated me more than his reviews. Finding out about all he had done in making the medium accessible for mainstream audiences had me idolizing him. I bought the book a few days later and finished it a few days after that. Then I started reading his reviews. There’s a simplicity in his writing that makes it incredibly easy and entertaining to read, but also an underlining depth that would change the entire meaning of film once read. Every movie became a new adventure, and I became extremely addicted to watching and analyzing and trying to find meaning in film - which would translate to a better understanding and appreciation for reality! I started to derive my own interpretations, and develop my own voice. I received the courage to write and to share my writing. My brother now asks me for movie recommendations, and I love complying, even if our opinions often differ now. 

My watchlist jumped to the hundreds, I started to look forward to watching movies each day. And I began using Letterboxd. I lurked for a while at first, indulging in all of the popular user's reviews and finding even more films to bloat my watchlist with, before beginning to write short blurbs about the movies I've seen. All of my original “reviews” remain on my account - I think it’s amazing seeing how my tastes have changed, as well as my writing in the last few years. 

I’m a senior in high school now (turned 18 today!) and have been watching way too many movies (I’ve seen about 700 movies in the last 400 days, at least one a day). I worked a summer internship in production and got a couple writing positions for some publications (I'm attending Cannes with a press pass if anybody wants to hang out there; I'll be terribly alone!). Every week, I show movie clips to my high school film class and essentially “teach"" films to the students. I plan on getting a doctorate in film studies, teaching the subject to other generations while remaining a film critic in the future! And I have every bit of thanks for those first influences, which have all worked in tandem to help me discover that one thing that I'd be elated to devote my life to.

4alr2o,255,2016-03-15,Full Blood Elf Decklist to Play with the New Lady Liadrin Hero,IllienHS,hearthstone,https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/4alr2o/full_blood_elf_decklist_to_play_with_the_new_lady/,"After earning the Lady Liadrin hero this morning, I decided to celebrate by crafting and piloting a decklist that is 100% Blood Elf. All of the cards in this deck have blood elves in them somewhere (Sylvanas is kind of iffy, but I mean she *was* a blood elf before she died). The only non-blood elves in the deck are the Silver Hand Recruits from your hero power and Silver Hand Regent. Think of those guys as unpaid interns who do your dirty work since elves shouldn't dirty their hands with tasks better suited to lesser races. 

I played a couple games with the deck and had a lot of fun messing with people and made a few new friends in the process. 

Decklist: http://imgur.com/bymzYZB

This deck boasts an astounding zero percent win rate (0-6). It's got bad match ups against basically every meta deck and probably against most of the basic decks too. Despite this, it's probably one of my favorite decks to play so far and I've gotten a lot of laughs out of playing it as well as a few new friends!

**Win Conditions**
The deck has very minimal win conditions. The general idea is to play Crowd Favorite and then buff him with your battle-cry cards until he has lethal. Alternatively its possible to win via some crazy esports on Grand Crusader or some Warhorse Trainer + Silver Hand Regent tokens.
*Disclaimer: none of these win conditions have ever worked for me*

**Key cards**
Eye For An Eye: I can't tell you how much fun I simply had playing this card. No one expects eye for an eye. Ever. I even had a priest steal it from me with Kezan Mystic. I can't imagine the look on his face when he hovered over it and realized that it was an Eye for an Eye.

Secret Keeper: Along with the secret package of Eye for an Eye and Repentance, you can bait a lot of people into thinking that you're secret paladin before swarming them with an army of blood elves and their underlings. Note: Tricking them into thinking that you're a secret paladin doesn't actually *do* anything, but it's hilarious to imagine their reaction once they realize what's going on.

Silver Hand Regent: One of the only down sides to having the Lady Liadrin hero is that you are no longer able to use your standard paladin greeting of ""WELL MET"". This lovely blood elf gives you the ability to do so which substantially ups your emote game.

Crowd Favorite: The deck's only win condition. If you swing with then you ""have lethal"". Or at least the twitch chat version of it. ""29 for sure"" as Reynad might say. Synergizes very well with the many battlecry minions in the deck.

Grand Crusader: The Paladin's very own esportal. Recruit ANY paladin card to your deck, including scummy non-Blood Elves. Pulling Tirion from this card is probably one of the only ways that this deck will win...  But Tirion is a smelly old human, not a blood elf so it's kind of cheating if you play him.

**tl;dr:** Made a full blood elf deck to match Lady Liadrin. Played a couple of games and made a bunch of friends.

edit: I won a game! Eye for an eye lethal!
http://imgur.com/a/2LOuH
Pretty sure the secret was Ice Block too!

edit 2: Sylvanas is a dead high elf not a dead blood elf. RIP. Thanks /u/blackcoleman for pointing out my lore error.
Potential replacements: Sword of Justice, Silvermoon Guardian, 2nd Repentance, Doomsayer, 2nd Blood Knight, Master of Ceremonies, or 2nd Lay on Hands.
I've been playing with the deck more and I think that the secret package is, although hilarious, somewhat weak. The deck might be better with -2 secret keeper +2 doomsayer
Sword of Justice has been fairly entertaining as well"

It pays $16 an hour. Honestly this position won't really further my career goals and probably won't be too demanding based off the work I was told I'd be doing. I verbally committed because I was basically told I needed to or they would go with someone else. I will be signing the offer employment soon (although I might have the option to stall this).

Now I just got invited for the final rounds at a much more prestigious company. This is a more of a hands on software development position, they treat their interns very well, allegedly they pay much higher than $16/hour, and they typically keep their interns around for full-time positions. I would definitey become a much better programmer here. The only downside is that it's about a 45 commute each way. 

Ideally if I get position B, I would take it in a heartbeat. However, I don't want to risk losing position A because of stalling to sign..and I'm not sure if I can go back on the contract if I do sign. I am aware that if I end up choosing company B that I'd be burning the bridge with company A, and I'm ok with that...but I don't want to end up with either position.

4am6eg,2,2016-03-16,I (23f) am at an odds with my mom (60f) on how to best care for my grandma(80f) who has Alzheimer's.,towelthrow22,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4am6eg/i_23f_am_at_an_odds_with_my_mom_60f_on_how_to/,"My mom and I have always had a 'meh' relationship. We love each other, but we're not the type to call each other every day, etc. I moved out of state when I was 20, and since then our relationship has been about the same. We almost never talk on the phone, if we need to talk, it's usually through email. 

About two years ago, my grandpa (my moms father) died. My grandma was in the beginning stages of Alzheimer's at the time. She was still driving and could get around decently, but every now and then she would go to the grocery store and get lost coming home. After my grandpa died, my mom moved in with my grandma. We all knew the disease was only going to get worse, but we had no idea how bad my grandmas behavior would get. 

Fast forward to now. I like to go home twice a year, mostly to see my grandma while she still remembers my name. My mom still lives with her. My grandma has gotten much worse. She will repeat the same story ten times in a row. She will continuously eat, forgetting that she has just eaten. And worst of all, she is combative. Her and my mom get into monstrous arguments. My grandma can't remember them ten minutes later, but my mom does. And she's stressed and agitated, whether she admits to it or not. A few months ago, my grandma had a mini stroke, and was admitted to the hospital for observation. My grandma woke up in the middle of the night, confused to where she was. A nurse came into the room and my grandma freaked out. Screaming, hitting people, crying, etc. They eventually had to restrain her and sedate her. 
My mom still has a full time job. She works roughly 8-4. It is not safe for my grandma to be home alone anymore, so my mom hired a company to come for several hours while she is at work. My grandma is constantly kicking the people out, refusing to let them in the house, calling the police on the people, etc. It's basically just not working. 
Recently, my mom tore her ACL and had surgery to correct it. Her hope is that she is going to have physical therapy come to the home, and my grandma will ""get used"" to people being in the house and will let the agency people come in. I know that's not going to fly. 

My background is with the elderly. I have worked in assisted living with residents all over the map with Alzheimer's and dementia. My internship is with an agency that works with Alzheimer's and dementia clients. I am a social work student, specializing in geriatrics. I love older people, especially my grandma. I know my mom cannot continue to take care of her full time. She is burnt out and receives no help. My mom has looked at several memory care facilities over the past year. She has looked into some two, even three times. She has made no decisions. My grandma is extremely well off, so money is no issue. 
I feel like my mom has waited entirely too long to place my grandma somewhere. My mom NEEDS a break. Their relationship has turned borderline abusive from what I see. In a memory facility they are trained to handle these types of residents. If they get frustrated, they know how to handle it. They get to go home at the end of the day. My mom is in this 24/7/365. The few times I've talked to my mom, I've told her this and explained it. She has 100 excuses, such as ""well I liked xyz place but the bathroom was too small."" Or ""yeah abc place looked good, but the dining room food didn't look good."" I know deep down my mom wants to continue to care for her at home. I want the best for both my mom and grandma, but my mom is not seeing reason. She cannot continue to care for my grandma, and the home environment is becoming more unsafe by the day. Does anyone else have similar experiences or expertise on how to handle the situation?

Tl;dr: mom is living with grandma who has Alzheimer's to take care of her. Grandma is combative and is too much for mom to handle anymore. Mom can't or won't place grandma into a skilled facility even though relationship is extremely toxic and unsafe. "

I'm spending the Spring semester in an extremely high-caliber internship. I really am proud of what I've been able to accomplish thus far professionally and academically, and I see no reason that I won't be able to graduate at 20 and jump  into a relatively high-flying career path.


This internship has, however, placed me in a city very far away from home. In college, I barely have/had any friends. I've never so much as held hands with a girl. But I drowned out the loneliness by either studying or working twelve to sixteen hours per day. I can't do that here on a nine-to-five schedule. And -- being nineteen, the rest of my intern group has been bonding at bars and clubs that my date of birth dictates that I can't tag along to. 




You know that kind of dull ache in your head/chest when you're 'heartbroken'? That's kind of what I feel like every waking minute I'm not at work. The weekends are the worst, man. There's nothing like exploring a museum, and another museum, and then taking a walk through the city completely alone... for nine weeks straight. While you see happy groups of friends, happy couples, and, well, it's just.. hard not to get angry. What makes *them* so special that they're desirable and you're not? What part of the genetic or psychological lottery allowed them to have some sort of social bearings, while you're completely alone? And, most of all, why do women get such a fucking ridiculous amount of social power at this age, to the point of where it's clearly and already proving capable of driving me quite literally insane? 

These thoughts follow me in every subway car, down every sidewalk, and in every shopping mall. And they make me want to find someone that's happy and slam them through a Plexiglas storefront. 

No, that's not a healthy way to think. I know it's not, and I know you're probably repulsed a little bit just reading it. But that's why I'm telling Reddit and quietly bottling those feelings up in real life. And it's making me feel depressed, lonely, and -- as of the last week -- violent. 


I've asked a few girls out, to a resounding chorus of rejections. Hell, I've even tried to turn to Tinder. I get at least a couple of matches per day, but either nothing comes of them (because I'm really goddamn boring), or I get ghosted/blown off after setting up a preliminary date. And *oh man* that last one hurts. And ***oh man*** that last one just makes me so angry, hurt, and aware of how I'm going to come alone from work until, some day in my late twenties, when I either decide to hang myself or do something way more dumb. 

I have no interests, so I can't just 'find a hobby group.' I tried to start running last week in some last-ditch effort to feel any level of dopamine running through my brain, but just felt too empty and apathetic to exert myself in any capacity. I know that the standard response is 'don't live your life for other people,' but the fact is, at least some basic level of human affection and intimacy is needed. And it's something that I'm really fucking afraid I'll never feel. 

And yes, I know, I'm only nineteen. But graduating next year and already being foot-first into my career makes it just so much more unlikely that I'll find anyone, or meet any meaningful friend group, in my last year of college. 


I genuinely don't know if I'll be able to make it through the next seven weeks (until I go home) without getting too deeply into my own head, and after I go home, I'll have four weeks of abject loneliness and solitude until -- guess what -- my next internship. That unfortunately relies on interpersonal communication, which I'm afraid will be really hard to muster if I've completely snapped by then. So, the cycle continues.

I'm spending the Spring semester in an extremely high-caliber internship. I really am proud of what I've been able to accomplish thus far professionally and academically, and I see no reason that I won't be able to graduate at 20 and jump  into a relatively high-flying career path.


This internship has, however, placed me in a city very far away from home. In college, I barely have/had any friends. I've never so much as held hands with a girl. But I drowned out the loneliness by either studying or working twelve to sixteen hours per day. I can't do that here on a nine-to-five schedule. And -- being nineteen, the rest of my intern group has been bonding at bars and clubs that my date of birth dictates that I can't tag along to.

4amaeh,2,2016-03-16,I [19 F] feel like a failure because my parents make me feel like what I do is not enough [40's],theravensclaw,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4amaeh/i_19_f_feel_like_a_failure_because_my_parents/,"Sorry if my formatting sucks because I'm on mobile and in the middle of a small breakdown alone. 

So, I got to a very difficult college. It's not an Ivy League but it is one of the most difficult schools in the country- I'm talking like the 8th hardest university to get an A. 
I'm a biology major as well, and I'm interesting in doing research or working in a lab for my career, so lab work experience is obviously very important to my overall goals. 

My boyfriend [20 M] is a computer science major. He does very very well in his courses and has landed a big (and very well paid) internship for the summer. I managed to secure a position working in a biology lab over the summer while taking classes at school to raise my GPA. I wot be getting paid but will be getting school credit which, if I work hard, could REALLY make my GPA shoot up, which is important to me. 
Getting this position took a lot of work for me, and I was so excited to find out that I could work over the summer. 

The only problem here is my parents. Long story short, they've basically been using my boyfriend's paid internship as a way to guilt me into getting ANOTHER job over the summer, which would virtually be impossible given that I'll already be taking up to three difficult classes and working part time in the lab. They've hit me with things like ""But so many other people do the exact same thing!"" ""You always say you can't do things and then you do them,"" and various other things. The worst though is that they use my boyfriend's internship and the fact that he is getting money as a way to make me get a job. 
""Oh, your boyfriend is getting money, you could get that too if you got a job!""

While that's all fine and good, that will not be possible if I want to perform to the best of my ability in my classes and get A's and raise my GPA like I want. My lower GPA is the reason I didn't get an internship in the first place. 

The fact that they are guilting me into doing something I don't want to and can't do makes me extremely upset. I feel as though all the hard work I've put into getting where I am is not appreciated and that they are not happy for me. Instead they see what other people my age do and compare me to them, which then sends me into a depressive episode. 

I'm not planning on trying to go out and get a job this summer- I feel as though I know exactly what I have to do for myself in order to make sure I have the best chance I can to get something really good next summer. I don't know how to make my parents see that and it's extremely upsetting and frustrating, especially when I already deal with depression and anxiety. 

TL;DR My parents are using my boyfriend's paid internship as a way to make me feel guilty for not having a paid summer job, even though I have secured a lab position doing research, which I though they would be more happy about. "

Can I get hired full-time after doing a summer internship this summer at a company like Amazon or Microsoft? Would they care that I'm not going to graduate without a degree? Are there any big companies that take me in after an internship or full-time if I don't have a degree but I have lots of internship experience? I do have contacts at these companies that could likely refer me, if that helps.

-Which neighborhoods are relatively safe/less sketchy, which are closest to HHU, etc. 
-Would you recommend finding an arrangement in which I share the flat/apartment, or would you recommend that I live alone?
-Do flats/apartments typically come with all the amenities/furniture, or does it depend on the renter?

I'm so lost now",ThrowawayUniqueStuff,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4anhqi/me_32_m_with_my_ldr_gf_27_f_known_10_years_dated/,"Tl;dr, My girlfriend just told me she cheated on me, and while I broke up with her, I feel like I'm making a huge mistake and need advice.

Anyways, the history with this girl is we've known each other for 10 years. She went about 3 hours drive away to attend a fashion school which she's less than a year away from completing her 4 year program. 

We kind of have orbited each other for many many years, but there was always something in the way, but in November, we ended up dating. The discussion was initiated by her relationship troubles she was having (specifically a FWB that ended up falling for another girl and they ended up breaking up), but we had been attracted to each other long before that. Still maybe an element of rebound I don't know.

Anyways, while we made trips to see each other, it was admittedly not very ideal because between her school and internship and my nightshift work, we don't get to talk as much as we'd like, and pretty much only have sundays to really interact online. We made trips to see each other for the weekend or so, but cost and schedules kept it from happening more often. Very not ideal, but it was great and awesome when we did have time together, and we had 10 years of history already so there was preexisting feelings already there.

She came down during my vacation this week, and this is when she told me she had cheated on me with the FWB guy twice, once was kissing, and once I guess it went all the way). She was beating herself up quite a bit and felt like shit, and said she thought she could make it work but thinks she was maybe sabatoging herself or something and didn't even trust herself to for sure not do it again. Very honest about the whole thing, and said she wanted to tell me in person instead of over skype because she felt she owed me that...

We basically talked for a couple of hours, with a lot of long silences. She eventually said she really wanted to try and work through it with me if possible, although she understood if I didn't. Would try and communicate more with me, felt that her holding back on telling me about lots of stuff to try and not seem clingy might have backfired, and I'm sure I was guilty of the same.

I told her I had to break up with her for now, that I needed time, and that I didn't think we should date while we were still long distance from each other because it seemed she really needed that physical touch and much more contact I was unable to give her being where I was.

I feel like I'm doing just what I think I should be doing and not the right choice, like I'm making a huge mistake. I like her very much and at the end when she asked me if she should stay or go, I told her I needed the space and couldn't sleep with her (non-sexually I mean). Her leaving the room felt so final that despite me not feeling that bad through most of the talk, and not feeling as hurt as I felt I should, it hit me hard and I cried for a bit. She forgot a blanket and I couldn't help but give her a strong goodbye hug, and she cried too and said she was sorry for hurting me.

This all feels so wrong, yet I can't logically see this working out should I stay with her. I tried so hard to not let myself express jealousy and to trust her judgement, but I can't help but feel like I'd not be able to trust her. Something like that has to be poisonous to a relationship because wouldn't there always be that doubt in my mind? Can the relationship actually mend? We see eye to eye on so many things, but this is the one line I figured would be a deal breaker for me, but now that it's here I just want her to come back and tell her we'll work through it somehow.

I just don't know what I should do. Logic says I can't trust her, once a cheater always a cheater and all that. Trust barrier has been shattered and while we've known each other a long time, the relationship got off on some really rocky ground I guess. But emotionally, I just want her back, I don't even hold anything against her, but I imagine trying to tell anyone I know that she cheated on me and I took her back and seeing me through those eyes I'm pretty sure I'd tell myself I was an idiot.

I just don't know what to do...."
4ansos,2,2016-03-16,Need advice on a Career Move,GiggityDPT,physicaltherapy,https://www.reddit.com/r/physicaltherapy/comments/4ansos/need_advice_on_a_career_move/,"Going to try to keep this brief but I also have several details that are worth mentioning.

I met my girlfriend in undergrad. She is the most important person in my life. When we graduated, I went to do my DPT and she went to get her master's 7 hours away from me. She did her master's in only one year and then moved to where I was even when she had no job offer and was even willing to be a server with her master's degree if she had to just so we could be together. (She ended up finding an internship in her field instead.) But for this, I promised her that when I graduated, we could go wherever she wanted.

So she actually ends up getting her dream job (Director of Academic support in an Athletic Department) where I am finishing up my DPT. She has had that position for a year now. I am about to graduate from PT school and I am looking for jobs. I received an e-mail from my department head about a job under one of our former grads out in New Mexico (We're in North Carolina). I love New Mexico. I love the desert. The job is in a young out-patient ortho clinic, with a young staff. Oh, and it pays $80,000 in the first year and $85,000 in the second year. From the info I can gather, the cost of living out there is not extremely high. And I would not get anywhere close to that salary around here. As a new grad in this area, I can probably expect a max of $65,000 for out-patient ortho around here.

So I talk to the guy who is hiring for the NM job and he seems to love me. He wants to fly me out to the facility for free. He wants to meet with me where I live in April. We had a great convo, we really hit it off. If I were single, I would be on board 100%.

But my girlfriend wants to stay put. Here's her story: She now has her ""dream job"" - what she has wanted to do since undergrad. I made a promise to her. It would be difficult for her to find this job out in NM if she went with me. She would probably have to give up the job she loves. She has done a great job in a short time with her job here. A couple weeks ago, at a social gathering with her department, the Athletic Director pulls her aside and basically tells her that he knows she will get offers from other schools soon and all he asks is that she let him counter first. And he said he could go as high as 40K to keep her. She currently makes 30K. Btw, that 30K is #63 out of 64 people in the athletic department (this is public info-state school). She works 45-50 hour weeks and goes to any and all extra-curriculars that are not required of her. So when she told me this, I said: ""Well, if you're worth 40K, why isn't he paying you that?""

She is not business-minded at all. She doesn't care about money. Not that I really do either, but money is security and comfort... so I do care and I'm trying to get her to see that it does matter. So I convinced her to talk to the AD. We rehearsed her lines and she basically came out and asked for a raise. Not even up to 40K immediately but maybe like 35 or 36 or so... Something where she is not bottom 5% in her department because her hours and her commitment are definitely not bottom 5%.

He says he doesn't have the money. Doesn't offer anything... My girlfriend was bummed but not upset enough to do anything about it. She still wants to stay put. I think we should blow this popsicle stand and pursue the NM job and she can find something else out there to do. She hates this idea even though she also hates keeping me from this great job.

I've extended applications out to all the out-patient ortho clinics in this area. I am starting to hear back from some of them so my hope is alive and well again that I could get a job for 60-65K and stay here and my GF can keep her job where she is way underpaid but she will be happy... so it doesn't seem like I am doomed if I stay. I have lined up multiple interviews and am working on more.

What do you all think we should do? Should I pursue NM and try to convince my partner to go with or just stay here?"
4ao0fd,189,2016-03-16,[Ridealong] That one time I almost died in a squad car,pard68,TalesFromTheSquadCar,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheSquadCar/comments/4ao0fd/ridealong_that_one_time_i_almost_died_in_a_squad/,"I got a pre-law degree and had to do an internship, so I decided to do one at a local PD since it was a lot more interesting than interning for a public defender, an ADA, or a firm. The sergeant in charge of internships was really good and made sure we had a knowledgeable and entertaining internship (I had friends who interned for the state troopers and got stuck mowing the barrack's lawn every week!). My internship required 40 hrs a week so I did three ride alongs and then ten hours of office work each week. Throughout the course of my 4 month internship I logged about 500 hours of ride alongs, and each one is documented in a five to ten page paper (internship requirement). I figured I'd share some of the more entertaining anecdotes from my time. 

I was given the nickname ""Tase"" after the second week of my internship because in every ride along I went on until that point, and essentially every ride along after, someone was tasered by the officer I was shadowing. This story is from my second ridealong with the PD.

We had just been at a McDonald's parking lot helping a lady who had called in that some kids had slashed her tires. Turns out she'd been riding on balled tires for some time and had literally worn her from right tire to the point that all that was left was the metal mesh. She wasn't having any of it and the officer was getting pretty annoyed with her. That's when he got a call for backup in what should have been a routine traffic stop following a hit and run in a grocery parking lot.

We excused ourselves from the situation with the lady and got in the car to meet the officer who was now chasing the hit and run suspect. I was pretty excited because this was the first time I'd been in the car with the lights and sirens on for a legitimate reason and not just showing off in a parking lot.

While we were coming to meet up with them the suspect had been driving up and down back roads and alleys off of main street (a four lane road with a suicide lane). We got onto main and the officer radioed that he was behind the suspect three roads down from us off of main. Another office pulled in front of us, roughly 700 feet ahead, off a street that merges with main and both he and us turned down the next street, which runs parallel to where the suspect was last seen.

By the time we got onto the street the officer in front of us had gotten out of his car and was standing by his door. The suspect was coming towards the street we were on. The suspect turned onto the street and we proceeded to drive towards him in our lane, we were doing about 50 mph (I omitted this from my write-up as I also gave a copy to the sergeant and I did not wish to get the officer I was with in trouble). The suspect veered into our lane and started coming directly at us. At about 15 feet away the officer driver the car I was in swerved to the left, entered the opposite lane, proceeded to swing the read end around 180 degrees, slide up onto the side walk and began driving the opposite way we had been going before.

Meanwhile the suspect continued in the wrong lane, towards the officer who had gotten out of his car. This officer took the driver's action as a threat, as he continued to accelerate towards the officer. The officer drew his pistol and fired four shots into the car. The suspect swerved onto the opposite sidewalk from us, got sideways, and slide through three small trees, four garbage cans, and came to a stop after hitting a much larger tree to the driver side. Two suspects got out of the rear passenger door. A third suspect fell from the front passenger door. 

The driver proceeded to drive forward, across the street, over the sidewalk and crashed through a steel fence around a office's parking garage. He fled from the car at this point, into the parking lot. 

We came up to his car at about the same time that four other officers arrived. They all entered into the parking lot first and I followed afterwards, staying behind the officer I was shadowing and behind the ""perimeter"" they were slowly clearing. 

The officer I was shadowing found the suspect hiding under an SUV. The suspect moved for his pocket and the officer tased him in the left shoulder. The suspect's head proceeded to rapidly shake up and down, alternating between hitting the underside of the car and the asphalt. 

He was subsequently arrested, along with the three others. Turns out the car was stolen, he was carrying 4 pounds of various drugs, a stolen pistol, and a dozen porno magazines that we later found out they stole from a gas station after a failed attempt to rob it earlier that day."

last year I married my beautiful wife who happens to be an US citizen. Since she's very limited here in terms of furthering her journalism career we've deceided to pack our bags and move to the US.

I've studied life sciences for 4 semesters at the university, but deceided midway through that I'd rather have a career in IT.

Currently I'm finishing my accelerated fellowship/traineeship/apprenticeship (I don't know what the US equivalent would be) as an IT Specialist for System Integration. Meaning for 3 days a week I'm working full time in the IT department of a fairly sized medical company - we have 3 branch offices and I support around 70 users with their everyday IT related business.

The other 2 days of the week I'm in school and learn all the fundamentals of hardware / networks (through CCNA) / software (OS, Firewalls, Backup etc.)

Usually this is a 3 year program, but I managed to accelerate that to 18 months + 5 month internship. I'll be done by the end of july after an written exam and a successfully performed IT related project (I'll create redundancy for our local VoIP-Server).

Of course I still feel that I have a lot to learn and try to learn as much as possible during my time in school and work.

So my summary:

I'll have a degree as IT Specialist for System Integration, CCNA,
MTA 98-365 and 2 years of experience in help desk / system administration / network administration, ~2 years of experience in call center customer care (Amazon)

Also I'm bilingual (german / english) with the potential for trilingual (my russian is a bit rusty).


My questions are:

What positions would be suited for me?
Where do I best start looking for a job?
What salary should I expect?
And what concerns me a lot: do I stand a chance without a bachelors degree?

Every bit of help is very appreciated.

I'm really excited for my western adventure.

I've overcome most of it with therapy over the past few years, but learning about the LOA exponentially improved my outlook on life.

ANYWAY.

I read all of the comments on my initial post. I took your advice.

I stopped thinking about the SPECIFICS of the interview and stopped worrying about specific questions that they would ask me. Instead I meditated and convinced myself that I would only be asked questions that will allow me to flourish.

The interview was 10 minutes. She asked me one question- a very general question about what my goals are, what I see myself doing. and Immediately she was so impressed with my answer that she said I was more than what she was looking for, that she rarely finds someone at my age with the qualifications that I have, and she not only offered me the position I applied for, but a BETTER one.

What I applied for was a pharmacy intern position, fresh out of school. Not only are they hiring me as an intern, they want to offer me a FULL TIME PHARMACIST POSITION once I get licenced!!! So I will be interning until then, but they want me!!!!  

being that I'm fresh out of school and I decided not go to for additional residency training that many of my colleagues have, I was so worried that I would NEVER find a job (this was before I discovered LOA). The job that I've been interning at for the past 2 years only offered me part time pharmacist position when I graduate. I spent a lot of time looking at job listings and seeing that they require at least 2 years of experience or residency training. I psyched myself out because I don't have that.

My passion and vibrations turned out to be worth more than extra credentials :) So what if I'm fresh out of school? this company can now mold me into exactly what they need me to be &amp; what I want to be and see myself being. I'm going to flourish.

Thank you for your support and taking the time to comment. Thank you to the whole LOA subreddit community for offering me advice every time I and others feel blocked. THANK YOU!!!"

My team has a wide spectrum of skills. From Webdriver (Java &amp; TestNG) operators down to the interns with no experience. 

To introduce the bulk of the team to automation we are using IDE. Some are even having trouble with that. So I started looking at iMarcos again for an alternative. 

**iMacros has some real pluses:**

* Easy to add to the big three browsers (IE, FF, Chrome)

* Works fast right out of the box

* Easy click record and selection of elements

However it certainly does not offer much for reporting or parallel testing. 
Has anyone ever been able to convert iMacros into Selenium scripts? 

I wouldn't use it as a first choice, but I want to be proactive with alternatives to get them automating quickly instead of the learning curve increasing review time."

I did reasonably well in semester 1 and had time for rest. In 2nd semester, I do not have time for anything else apart from university.

The problem I see is that: I feel tired and exhausted about my prospects as CS grad. I feel stuck on bigger and bigger projects and that makes me depressed instead of excited to attempt tackling problem. I find programming hard, though I am interested in interview type questions and feel like jumping when I solve a problem. I also have some serious health issues that further brings me down and increase anxiety. Courses like OS, computer architecture are incredibly challenging and takes me forever to understand what is going on.

I know people who claim that if you like programming and can program, then you should persevere in university and if you happen to get worse grade, make up for it with internships and projects. I might have an internship this summer with a bank but I am very depressed to find that I suck at working in real world as well.

Honestly, I feel overwhelmed as the user in this post: https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2wbyq7/cs_undergrad_here_nearly_giving_up_how_did_you_do/

It seems to me like I do not have a knack for programming and am too slow to be successful in the field. I like many aspects of CS though but idk if I can ever become productive in this field. I really think that I am depressed because when I don't understand something I tend to wallow in pity instead of trying to tackle a problem. I am afraid that CS and programming itself might be causing a lot of depression.

Could you advice me on this situation? The other subject I am interested in is medicine and I have grades to get into it but I do not know for sure if I want it just as I am not sure about CS. Also, I don't know if I could survive med school with poor health."

I was walking around my neighborhood and came across a tiny kitten in a storm drain. ( Well a shallow basin.)  I felt sorry and tried to catch him.  He hissed like a wild cat and bit me. Now I had never heard of a feral cat in my life and so I thought he must be scared.  It turned out Mr. Kitty was feral and I was in deep shit.

Fast forward through my Doctor having a bird.  

I am in the ER and this absolutely amazing looking intern comes in and tells me he has to inject a block into the nerve of my finger where the bite was.

First time in my life I ever asked a doctor "" Is it going to hurt?"" and got a slight chuckle and : ""Oh yeah.""  As an answer.

Fast forward through torture session by hunk.
Now I get same doctor coming in and sticking me in the arm with a pink liquid filled syringe.  I am sitting here with a swollen finger and throbbing ovaries ( Intern was really hot.) and don't even flinch.

So I'm waiting for them to tell me I can go.  Then I get the choice of the day:  "" So, Leg or Butt?""

I chose butt hoping they meant an injection and my buddy the intern would be doing it.   While waiting I try to sneak out to the bath room. That was when I hear a deep voice say "" Where do you think YOU'RE going?""
I turn there is the biggest woman I have ever seen holding two huge needles.

I won't tell you where she put them, but you know.

I went home with antibiotics, a rabies quarantine and a sore ass and finger.  I STILL got toxoplasmosis ( Cat scratch fever).

Am I putting our relationship on hold by leaving for school?,mythrowawayforhelp,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4aoiy5/me_21f_with_my_boyfriend_22m_of_2_years_am_i/,"I [21f] been dating my wonderful best friend [22m] for a little over two years now. We met in college, and spent a lot of time with each other there. He graduated and we had to do long distance (3hr drive) for one semester. But then I moved back to my parents' for an internship this semester, and he also lives in the same area. I graduate in May.

I just got into grad school, so I will be headed back to campus in the fall, maybe summer. My problem isn't that I want to turn down grad school to stay with him. It's that I feel like I'm freezing the progression of our relationship.

We had talked about moving in together if I stayed in our area for a year before going back to school. Besides me being a little allergic to his dog, I think there wasn't too much standing in our way. Moving in together is definitely the next step for us.

But now that I've chosen to go back to school for a year and a half, it's going to be a long time before we can take that step. And I don't even know where my job will be when I finish.

So my question is, am I putting us ""on hold""? I feel like it will be hard to grow as a couple because of the decision that I've made. What can I do to help us through this year and a half we are headed toward?

Also if it helps at all, we've been through a ton of shit and always fared well. I've been through many episodes of mental illness and he handled them beautifully. We had an open relationship for a bit and we were both very satisfied with how things turned out.

Tl;dr: I'm leaving for grad school and we will have to be long distance for an extended period of time, so I am worried I'm preventing us from progressing in our relationship."

4aoxez,5,2016-03-16,Summer options..,aj3393,geologycareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/geologycareers/comments/4aoxez/summer_options/,"Hi everyone,

I'm writing this as live oil prices are the number 1 visited page on my browser, unfortunately. Anyway I would like this post to garner some feedback from everyone at geologycareers as to my available options for the summer and what my outlook could be down the road. Ultimately I want to make the decisions now that give me the best chance of obtaining my final goal. I want to separate the trees from the forest here, so I'll provide relevant details only. Feel free to ask for more info of course. 

**Goal** (like many) : To end up at a mid to large o&amp;g company with a competitive salary. 

**Current status**: Graduated with B.S. in geophysics, currently working on M.S. in geoscience/geophysics at an oil school in the southern U.S. 

**Experience**: Some summer research programs, nothing too noteworthy in terms of actual work in a non-academic setting. My resume at the moment is filled with publications, courses taken, skills, etc.

**Summer options**

* option 1: Stay at school over the summer and work on my thesis

* option 2: Accept a job/intern offer at a survey service company in Dallas. They seem very legitimate, they partake in (this is a small blurb from their site) *""Resistivity profiling techniques with acoustic hydrographic and sub-bottom profiling to offer more complete survey capabilities where acoustic technique alone cannot suffice. Survey capabilities include real-time kinematic positioning accurate to within 2cm, with real water level and heave compensation. Data post-process capabilities include volume, contour, cross section, boundary, as-built and standard GIS products. In-house laboratory accommodates sediment analysis, including classification/grain size and water chemistry.""* I essentially have this opportunity this contact through a past professor, and I trust his word on the benefits that they could give me in terms of experience. This is not an o&amp;g company (they specialize more in hydrogeology using geophysical tools), but the skills seem to crossover in many aspects and in this job market it may be better experience than what most are acquiring.

**the odds of this next option happening are very slim, but I cannot completely rule it out**

* option 3: Possibly have a small role internship in Houston with a geophysical processing company that caters to the oil industry. If this were to pan out, I think the role would be reduced compared to someone that may have an internship in a geoscience dept. at an actual large o&amp;g company. The upside to this option is that such a company would cater directly to industry and get me closer towards my goal.


**My opinion**

As of know, I feel like the second option would be best for me in terms of experience and having something to show later on for a recruiter/employer even though it is not directly industry related. Experience is experience. If the third option opened up, would it be better to take it? I feel like the last thing I want to do is just stay in school over the summer like 90% of the rest of my graduate department, just working on my thesis. For that reason I think option 1 would be entirely out. That brings up one more question, would delaying my graduation date by a semester be beneficial in any way in order to give myself one more summer for an internship and later on a job? I'm not sure if this is something that would be viewed negatively or not. 

*Hopefully you read most of the post, and I would appreciate your opinion. I'd be glad to answer more specific questions about the companies that I am talking about in the comments section or through a PM.*

edit1: I should note, one of my main concerns is to be too far removed from the o&amp;g industry by the time jobs are generally available again, and I'd like to avoid that as much as possible whether in the scenario of what I should do this summer, my pending graduation date, going after another degree, etc."
4aoz2b,2,2016-03-16,"The Theory of the Allverse, Mother-verse, or the Royce",drurry,MyTheoryIs,https://www.reddit.com/r/MyTheoryIs/comments/4aoz2b/the_theory_of_the_allverse_motherverse_or_the/,"To begin I first have to mention my lesser theory of The Nature of repeat.
It seems to me that all time, space and events seem to be some where around us at all times if we just knew where to look. Something like a fractal in math. No matter where you start it ends up seemingly back at the beginning or what could have been the starting point.

The following will be my explanation of the Beginning, Acceleration, and Separation/Expansion of the Universe and what Black Holes along with Quantum physics all play in it all, and lastly Multi Universes.

 That said I'll leave it alone and get to the beginning of my explanation of the (All-Verse, the Royce or Mother Verse) Which ever you prefer for the moment.

 Take with me a short trip of logic. We will need to start small,( small just seams to repeat later on as Big, but small is easier for our human minds to  conceive)  with particles that are used to form a droplet of water.
 First it was particles of gas which finally condensed and then started falling to earth as round drops of rain. Liquids turn to drops, round drops every time in the absence of a resistor such as air.
Gasses and particles (in resemblance to the ones that formed the drops of water in a rain shower) were released at and immediately after the time of the event that most Scientist refer to as the Big Bang.
 Like these particles these huge Gaseous clouds came together  (condensed if you will)  to form Galaxies, Solar Systems etc.
  I would presume that our Solar System started out as these particles and gases which turned to a gaseous sphere, then (over simplifying it) continued condensing to formed the Sun and the planets.
 Supposedly these gasses and particles were all rotating in basically the same direction when they formed and continued to rotate that way after forming. Thus we have the rotation of the Solar System and with exception most of the planets.
 Seemingly the most part is true for the Rotation of most the Galaxies in different stages of maturity at least on this side of the Universe.
 After forming, the Solar System seems to have flattened out somewhat something like a disk.
This also seems true to spiral Galaxies and many others at different stages of condensation.
    Apparently in the middle of most of these Galaxies there appears to be black holes, I believe that is true in most all Galaxies, or they are in the process of forming, although we might not be able to detect them yet.  I will explain a little later.
 
  Now bare with me for a few minutes as I diverge from this path of thought to explain that after water droplets begin to form they then begin to fall. As they fall they gain speed to the point of that they reach terminal velocity.
 What causes this gain of speed goes back to the laws of Newton. Gravity.
  There are lots of theory as to why the universe is expanding and speeding up. Dark Energy, Anti Matter? Pushing Gravity, the Ether.
  I agree that it is just Gravity.
But from where?

Lots of Scientist now agree that there isn't enough mass in the universe to even hold it together with out considering dark matter and dark energy as mass.

                                         A bad analogy
  What happens if you had a very large liquid ball of metal floating in space with a strong magnet at its center, and that the density became thinner as you got closer to the surface, all contained in something like a balloon or a mantle or just surface tension. (It is because of surface tension that pressure of a liquid increases within a bubble.) The ball being as large as it is would get very hot at its center and cause eruptions thru the weakest point or points of the ball.
  Now the smallest pin hole or rupture would force the liquid metal out thru the pin hole/rupture. Would it float off in space/time or try to flow around the outside of the balloon due to the magnet pull. More so yet would it flatten out as it spread around the ball?
                                      A better analogy
  Think of it like a Volcano on planet Earth. What happens? Gasses flow out as far as they can, then circle the earth getting thinner as they dissipate around it.(why Gravity) What about heaver elements like Smoke, Ash, Rock. They all act the same. The gravitational pull of the Earths core encourage them to spread out in all directions where they meet resistance while seeking to be pulled back to where they came. The heavier elements would react immediately and return to the surface.
  I submit to you there was a rupture in the fabric of the   (Royce, All-verse, Mother-verse) somewhat like a Volcano. Where What we call our Universe was spewed out. Appearing from our view point to have having been a big bang and having came from nothing.

 The forming of what we call our Universe began with the separation and condensation of the gas-particle clouds into galaxies etc,etc. and just like a drop of soap in dishwater due to gravity began to immediately accelerate and dissipate due to the gravity around the ball we will call (All-verse Mother-verse, or The Royce)
This Acceleration and Separation will continue until they are restored to where they came by either one of two ways.)
 Black Holes or Dissipation but before I get to that a brief word on two items, what is missing and dark matter.
  If you will Dark Matter is referring to the Royce, All-verse, Mother-verse etc. It is basically what hasn't came thru the pin hole yet and just like the inside of a black hole can not be seen. It is  the source of gravity that is pulling the Universe = Time/space ,around the outside of the Ball (The Royce) if you will.

1.  Black Holes briefly explained
Again let us start small with my theory of the Nature of Repeat.
Ever watch the bath tube drain or a sink of kitchen water?
It starts off at the edges and gradually starts rotating in the sink as the water starts down the drain. Until finally there is a whirl pool that is formed. Ever look in to one of these whirl pools? How far down could you see? These go down a drain to the sewer. The ones in nature made in water just go back down under the surface where the water is mixed back into the whole. Like a whirlpool in a river.

  A Galaxy starts off and sooner or later starts collecting enough mass in the center to create a density strong enough to create a Magnetic pull strong enough to connect back to the Royce.
   A Spiral Galaxy is in a stage that this is can be seen.
Time must be sped up a billion (X?) plus times to see these spiral galaxies shrink to nothingness, back to the Royce.
In other words at some point in time without interference as it continued to feed every galaxy would become such a super black hole as to eaten or gathered up everything in except one final star or even farther one last atom before complete heal of that small section of the Royce.

2. Dissipation briefly Explained
  Dissipation of Volcanic contents for the most part all come back to the earth.
 Starting small once again I give you another analogy. This time think of a oil or better yet a gasoline spill on the Ocean, a drop of soap in dirty dish water, or gasses released into the Atmosphere . Each will accelerate and dissipate until stopped or acted upon by an outside force. 
The particles which will become so thin and continue to separate to become so small with particles so far apart and so tiny as to revert from the laws of physics and adapt the laws of quantum physics to return to the Royce once again.

Quantum Physics seem to be the study of not space/time but the Royce.

Black Holes and Dissipation Summary

To put these two in a nut shell.
Think of the balloon again. As these Galaxies are pulled apart from one another as they are pulled around the outside of the Royce they are also being adsorbed back into the Royce thru Black Holes.
  To Visualize this think of the Royce as something as small as planet Earth. Except the earths crust is made of the same material as a trampoline. Now push up on some part of the trampoline, (at the apex)  since we cant pour out gas for this experiment we will have to pretend that gas and particles have already formed to galaxies) and on one side of the tent like looking structure pour out our galaxies which will be visualized as spinning tops. They will separate farther and farther apart as they travel down the protrusion and gain speed as they continue to separate one from another.
 At the same time they to have condensed or in the process of condensing to the point to gain enough gravity to form Black Holes which intern cause a dimple in space/time fabric.
  Looking something like a partially formed golf ball but with a black hole in the middle of each dimple.
So as gravity from the Royce is pulling thru the worm holes, and galaxies spin around the worm holes they are also being pulled one from the other at ever increasing speeds apart one from the other, until they are reunited back to the Royce.
 The same gravity doing two things.
 and a third if you include Quantum Physics and the tiny black holes that are forming sucking up matter then disappearing = Dissipation or in the process of Dissipating.

Multi Universes briefly Explained
  Just like we must speed up the thought of time by X  to see the live action of the known Universe. We must expand our understanding of the known universe to be so small as a pinhole in a balloon the size of the Earth, with that pin hole being the gateway to our known universe.
 Somewhat like a Volcano which erupt with all the known facts that go with such a eruption.
 Few Volcano's now bear witness or inter react one to another, although there are several on planet earth. (This is probably not the best analogy as the past history of earth that would not be true).
The likely hood of our known universe spreading out and touching the boundaries of another before being pulled back in thru black holes or converging ever growing black holes or before total dispensation  occurred I think would be small indeed
.
Multi Verses are surely out there, but again I think they would be so far apart on the fabric of the Royce (time/space ) Universes would dissipate or be  assimilated back to the Royce before our Universe or other Universes could touch them one to another.

There is more to this and you can see it and elaborate on it.
Think of the Volcano blowing a smoke ring that spirals up to the sky, rolling from the inside to the out, and the lava flows down around the volcano on all sides and in doing so spirals or rolls down in a opposite spiral from the far side of the volcano, I prefer to stick to the gasses and dust particles as the heavier elements have long gone back.     If you were capable of traveling back toward the Volcano or gateway of our Universe and shrink it down enough, what would you see?
 Would our Universe look like a volcano with a smoke ring with a hole in it with the Universe spreading out in all directions speeding up and separating on several different levels? Are there gases from it that cant be pulled back that are under different laws? Are the Galaxies rotating in a different direction after you pass the Epicenter and reach the other side of the Universe? Is it still active and spewing out gas and particles? is that why supposedly 90% of the  universe is missing, that it cant be detected as a black hole cant. Just its effect can. Is it still forming at the epicenter as it is dissolving at its outer reaches and being re assimilated thru its black holes etc?

                                    Alternate Theory
                                    The Big Impact
Rather than the analogy of something like a Volcano erupting from internal causes. The big Impact would seemingly create most  all of the same results.
 Where could such an impact come from, I refer you two black holes colliding and producing many new stars and perhaps new black holes in the future.
 Maybe part of my Theory of Repeat

 I personally prefer internal eruption.

Surface tension,gravity, mass, energy= the same just on different levels. As Tesla said all things are energy and like Einstein said all energy has mass
Again reference back to the theory of repeat. So is it the All-verse, the Royce or just one of many?
 

All questions for our ,and your farther and further thoughts.

Rather you agree with me or not Please pass this on to Others that might be able to show the math to prove or disprove my Theory of  the Royce

I'm an 21 y.o. IT student in Switzerland, and I come from the south of France. I've been offered an 6 months internship in a great tech company based in Tallinn, in Estonia. The company and its culture looks amazing.

The problem is Estonia is pretty far away from Switzerland (you have to take 2 planes and pay quite a lot of money to go there), so I wouldn't be able to go back to Switzerland more than once or twice. I have my girlfriend there, and my family lives in the south of France. 
I think it would be quite hard for me to move away from Switzerland, especially since this is already ""abroad"" in my case and that I wouldn't be able to see my girlfriend, friends and family for quite some time. Also, I don't really know Tallinn and I had mixed feedback about it. 

On the other hand, I also think it would be a shame not to accept a great internship ""just because of that"", and especially since it's ""only"" for 6 months.

I have to admit I'm a bit lost and don't know what to do. Any advice?

4apdhv,6,2016-03-16,424 Days and Counting..... Freaking Out and Looking for Advice,CS_Throwaway_17,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4apdhv/424_days_and_counting_freaking_out_and_looking/,"So this will be a long winded post. I have been lurking this sub for awhile, and have probley read every thread posted in past 3 month. I should probley stop because it gives me more anxiety than answers, but I figured I would post my exact situation and develop a specific game plan before I graduate next May.

So first a little background into my situation. I am 26 years old. I originally went to school for Biotechnology, and was premed but in 2011 during my Junior year I took a part time job at an Investment Real Estate company as a Sales Rep. Long story short I ended up being a top performer and quickly became the Sales Manager. During this time the company blew up, when I started there was a handful of Sales Reps, by the beginging of my senior year I was running a sales floor of about 15 guys. I was convinced by the CEO to drop out of school and focus on the company full time. As taking a 19 credit semester of upper level science classes and working 50+ hours a week was burning me out to say the least.   , and getting a taste of money and the ""life style"" made it a no brainer for a 21 year old kid. To make this part short, the company got into some shady stuff and I quit, one of the principals of the company took my advice and jumped ship as well and invited me to start a company with him in Texas doing pretty much the same thing but by the book. We delt with mostly Australian, Singaporean and New Zeland investors looking to purchase property in the US. (This is how I was able to work and go to school at same time as we operate at night due to time difference).

I made the mistake of taking equity in the company as opposed to a salary. (Dumb kids with dreams of making it big). Things went well for first few months and then everything went to shit. The aussie dollar plummeted and our demand for our services plummeted. Even during the time it was going well I found myself enjoying analytical work, things like writing VB scripts to automate property reports from excel documents etc then being a Sales Director. I decided last summer that it was time to cut my losses, that I gave it a good try and learned alot but I was burning through my savings and was months from being in financial trouble.  I decided to come back to the East Coast. After few months of job searching and plenty of offers I realized that I actually hated sales (specifically non consultative sales, non techical sales) . I was always disappointed even when I was doing well I didnt finish college so I decided to go back.

I reapplied to my old college and got in with little trouble. I did the math and had enough savings to cover tuition and living expenses for 2 years without working. (It might sound obnoxious but I just couldnt imagine working a 10 dollar an hour job even part time so I decided I didnt want to work and putt 100 percent focus into school). I knew for a fact that I had no interest working in a lab for 35k a year so going back just to finish my science degree wasnt an option. I decided on Computer Science equal parts due true interest and return on investment. 

Fast forward to today. I am half way through 2nd semester at a relatively known CS program (Not top 10 or anyhting like that). I am starting to panic that I wont be marketable upon graduation. I  am absolutely Acing all my CS classes, for example Data Structures which is considered a high failout class and a weed out class, I got 100 on both midterms so far (average was in the low 50s), this isnt me bragging I have huge advantage over these kids because I have zero distractions I am not tempted to go to a frat party on a thursday night etc. 

So the main reason for the post. I am looking for advice to most efficiently utilize the year I have before graduation (really closer to  under a year as I would need to be applying to jobs starting begining of next year). I am worried as for one I am rushing through this program, I am completing a CS BS (not BA) from scratch in 21 months flat. I have no projects and no time for internships (to graduate on time I have to take two summer classes which equates to 4 hours a day 4 days a week, thats not counting actual studying and school work that goes with it). 

The program is also theory heavy, I am hoping the rest of the program may give me more exposure to other languages etc but from what I heard not so much. As of now I only have exposure to java, I speak to upperclassman and they seem to know a handful of languages, multiple internships etc. I am taking one 300 level class right now and even the kids cheating off me and looking to me for help on programing assignments seem to have an array of skills sets, internships, projects etc.

I dont have the luxury nor the desire to take any amount of time to find a job after graduation. I need to have a job immedaitly after graduation, a well paying job and a beneficial job to my career. I will be 27 when I graduate so I feel like in the scheme of  things I am already starting 5 years behind. This sub is giving me anxiety hearing the stories of people applying to 100s of jobs and not even getting interviews.

So here are a list of questions I have and thank you to all those who take the time to answer any of them.

1. Does a high CS GPA benefit me. I feel like I have academia down to a science. I know exactly how much time I need to put in to any assignmment or preparation for an exam to get the score I want. I am also noticing that it is not a linear correlation between grades and time commited. I could easily get straight Bs putting in 25% less time, and probley pass all my classes putting in 40-50% less time. Am I better off not being GPA driven and use the time towards self study etc.

2. Will my work expierence give me any benefit. Obviously coming from a sales background I am extremly confident in my ability to sell myself,  but my concern is CS is the one field were portfolio and knowledge trump all. I am hoping very legitmate work expierence, showing I can lead, work in teams, meet deadlines etc will give me an advantage competiting for jobs. Side question: What type of sales type roles exist in the CS field. I definetly dont want to go back to generic sales, but I would consider leveraging my sales expierence for a role that still utilized and improved my developer skills while acting in a sales type role.

3. Self Study. I am debating what would be more beneficial to my marketability. I currently allocate about 10-15 hours a week for non school related study, and I feel I am not even scratching the surface of the dozens of frameworks, programmming langauges etc. If the end goal is the best, most educational and highest paid first job, am I better off sticking to one thing and becoming an expert at it, multiple projects etc  in specific topic, or is diversity important. I am currently about 2/3 the way through CS 193A Stanford course in android development. I am enjoying it alot and working on two projects I expect to put on the play store. However I am worried because for example, I was invited by some upper classman to be on a Hackathon team assuming because I am the ""smart kid in class"" however these guys are debating between weather they are going to use node, python, or C. I know java, thats it.  As much as I want to commit to one thing, I also worried I am limiting myself personally by not getting exposure to other things.  I am realtively confident that I enjoy mobile development. 
Side Question: I am also worried project wise that what am I doing might not demonstrate skills enough. For example one is a real estate investment calculator, is it beneficial trying to incorporate things and features into side projects simply for the purpose of showing above average skill.

4. Mobile web vs native. Simply am I hurting myself by not learning JS, I dont see any classes that incorporate it in my program, and my main side focus has been android development. Also am I better of focusing on android or is it beneficial to learn iOS as well. Are there any roles that would actually require knowledge of both.

I am sure I will think of more. Thanks again.

4apit4,247,2016-03-16,Snow Day,AvidWoodie92,LetsNotMeet,https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/4apit4/snow_day/,"A couple years ago I found myself in a very disturbing situation. I was getting off work at my student internship in Charlotte, North Carolina and it had been snowing all day. Now for all you guys who live in the south you know it's a big deal when it even calls for snow and grocery stores are raided the nights before. I had decided to go and get some groceries to enjoy with my girlfriend (now wife) since the mayhem had ended and only people like me who had trucks or all terrain vehicles could get around.
&amp;nbsp;

I went into Walmart and got the groceries I needed and started my way back to my truck. It had started to snow harder and there was already about 5-7 inches on the ground and it was around 12 in the afternoon. I was day dreaming about sledding and watching movies the next couple of days with my girlfriend. 
&amp;nbsp;

Just then as I almost reached my truck, I was jolted by the act of someone grabbing my arm. As I turned around I saw a older looking lady who was maybe 5 foot 6 inches. She asked me if I had cigarettes, now I don't smoke so I told her no I did not. And turned back to my truck. Again she gently tugged on my arm and then she told me that she just got here from Alabama on a bus with her granddaughter and dog and she was here for breast cancer treatment and wanted money for a hotel. Again I honestly told her I had no money on me (which I purposely do because I don't like donating to people's drug habits and would rather get people food myself if that's what they really want). 
&amp;nbsp;

At this point she said, ""Do you know the area well?"" Wanting to get out of this situation I said no I did not (which was a lie). Thinking she'd now leave me alone. Then she asked, ""Oh okay well since the weather is so bad will you drive me to my hotel so I can meet up with my granddaughter and her dog who are in the hotel lobby waiting? It's right up the road here, I can show you."" Me being a Christian and was always taught to help people out. So even though everything at this moment told me to deny this woman again. I told her sure, since I was raised on the rule ""never judge a book by its cover"", plus being a male at 6 foot, I figured I could take her if things got dicey.
&amp;nbsp;

So she jumped in my truck against all odds and the next thing I know she's smoking a cigarette in my truck and I told her politely to please put it out. Being nervous I missed my first red flag when she asked me for a cigarette, since she obviously had some. She obliged and through the cigarette out the window to my dismay. So we started driving up the road towards her hotel, at which I was on high alert.
&amp;nbsp;

At the moment of going through worst case scenarios in my head I notched her fumbling through her purse searching for something and looking out the corner of her eye at me. At which I told her, ""Just so you know I have a gun in my truck, so don't try anything crazy."" Now I did have a gun, but it was a shotgun that I had neglected to get out of my backseat a couple days earlier and in reality this would do me no good if she pulled a gun on me at that moment.
&amp;nbsp;
 
At this she stopped messing around in her purse and pulled out her cell phone in her pocket. She looked at me and said, ""Actually do you mind taking a detour, I need to pick up some money from some friends."" Okay at this point in time red flags were firing off but again never judging a book by its cover kept running through my mind. So I told her that was fine but we had to make it quick, because I needed to make it home. At that moment she dialed someone on the phone and said, ""Yeah this guy is coming over to bring me to get the stuff, you are ready right?"" At that point I asked her to talk to the person. 
&amp;nbsp;

When I answered the phone a man who sounded like he's been chain smoking since birth said, ""Hello"". I started asking him questions like ""what's your name"" and ask him if indeed he knew of any hotels nearby. He seemed to stumble over his words then said he had to go. At this point I should have gotten a clue and kicked her out of my car, especially after watching so many horror movies, this is when the person goes against their gut and pays for it. But for fear of her actually telling the truth and me feeling lie a terrible person, I decided to go on.
&amp;nbsp;
 
At this point we turned down the street and I saw a cop car sitting there off the side I wanted go drop her off with the cop, but I would terrible if she was actually telling the truth. So I passed the cop as at this point with a weird, eerie smile on her face said, ""Glad he's there now I feel safe."" 
&amp;nbsp;

Now as we entered the apartment complex. I saw how run down it was. It looked to be a place where heavy drug traffic was going down. Just a very unsettling place even during the snow. As I parked outside the place she said was her friends, she said ""Okay I'll go get the guy and be back."" At this I was very unsettled by everything, things just didn't seem right. She saw my facial expression of wanting to just get the heck out of dodge and to this she sneered at me saying something along the lines of me being a terrible person if I left her there, in this weather under her condition.
&amp;nbsp;

At this I got mad. After all I went out of my way to help her. As I waited I started to think about things that could happen, what f she brought back a gun or worse. At that moment I saw 3 guys coming towards my truck.
&amp;nbsp;

I realized things were not right. She had set me up to rob me or something because these guys were big and one of them had something behind his back which I couldn't see. At that moment I put it in reverse and took off (thank God for 4 wheel drive). I looked back to them chasing me and to see that what was hidden behind the one guy's back was a crowbar.
&amp;nbsp;
 
I don't know what would've happened to me but now looking back I see how dumb and blind I was. There was no hotel anywhere close to the area I was in. The nearest hotel or motel was 20 minutes away. Had I waited for the guys to get to my truck, they probably would've beaten me and robbed me... or worse. 
&amp;nbsp;

I thank God every day that I escaped and was able to get married and tell this event. After that I have never been to that Walmart ever again or the area for that matter.
&amp;nbsp;
 
A couple of months later I told a coworker this story and he told me that a year ago the same lady tried the same thing to him, but he declined all together (smart move on his part).
&amp;nbsp;
 
So horrible lady who lied about having breast cancer to trick people into awful things. I hope I you get what's coming to you and let's never meet again. So be careful who you help out because some people will take advantage of you or even worse."
4apmpv,12,2016-03-16,Am I screwed?,Fun_Hat,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4apmpv/am_i_screwed/,"In one month I graduate in Information Systems, and my current internship ends.

Yesterday I had a talk with my boss, and he said they will not be hiring me on as a full-time engineer. He gave me pretty honest feedback which pretty much amounted to ""We like you, but you are too junior for us to hire right now. Try back in a year.""

On the plus side, I live in an area that is a growing tech hub, so there are dozens of other companies I can apply to. I am worried though. The company I am interning for is a unicorn, and well known in this area. It is a company that a lot of people want to work for, and I don't know what I will say if interviewers ask me ""Why didn't you get/accept a full-time offer there?"" If I tell them I wasn't experienced enough, isn't that just going to ruin my chances? I don't want to lie and tell them I got an offer but rejected it.

I have a mediocre GPA (3.37 major, 3.0 cumulative) 2 internships, and no offers. Am I screwed?"

4apwfd,4,2016-03-16,Should I tell my current boss I'm being interviewed by other companies? (Intern),bhafenri,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4apwfd/should_i_tell_my_current_boss_im_being/,"Hey all, I am currently a CS senior in Southeast US.  I am currently interning at a large company (not Big 4 but whatever) that I really enjoy and would love to eventually work for full-time in the future.  The problem is the internship is more of an informal one so there isn't necessarily a job I would transition into post-graduation.  Another student at my university would eventually take over the internship once I head out to another job or grad school theoretically.  I've worked hard and expressed to my boss (in December) how much I enjoy working with the company and if anything opened up to notify me.  But, nothing has materialized since then.  

Now I'm being contacted by recruiters/companies and have started to interview with them (no job offers yet).  Is it unprofessional to tell my boss of these other companies (sort of forcing their hand to see if they did have something planned), or should I just wait and keep interviewing with other companies until they (the company I currently work for) come to me?

Thanks in advance for any advice."
4apznr,1,2016-03-16,I [26/m] like a girl [23/f] but have been really busy with school and work. Classmate [23/m] who was hardly on campus is now hear all the time and hanging out with her constantly.

There is this women I know who works at my school that I have a crush on. We have hung out as a group only a couple of times and I really enjoy talking with her. This semester has gotten extremely busy for me, my advisor is pushing for my thesis to be finished and for me to publish a journal paper based on my research. With that I am trying to do well at an internship and have a 1.5 hour average daily commute.

I was hoping to try and spend more time with her but recently a classmate of mine got laid off and is now spending all his time at school. We share the same circle of friends and him and this woman met and now they have been hanging out a lot. To me it seems that he likes her and I would say she feels the same but whenever they are hanging out this other guy is with them.

Basically I don't know how I should handle this situation. Part of me just wants to forget about it all because I really don't have the time to date but I cant deny the fact that I like this woman. I also don't know how to get her to spend more time with me if my classmate is always hanging around her. Should I just ask her straight up? Should I talk to a mutual (female) friend and see if she knows whats up with this situation? Thanks in advance, this is really starting to weigh on my mind so any advice is greatly appreciated!"

It's the night of the big company formal dinner. As a lowly intern, I'm nervous, I don't know how I even got this invite, but it's definitely my chance to make something of myself here. I have the option of bringing a +1, so my girlfriend, [Rachel](http://i.imgur.com/ktu2Yry.jpg), was pretty excited to be tagging along to the fancy hotel restaurant.

When we arrive, I'm more than a little surprised to see that Rachel has been seated on the opposite side of the table to me. In fact, she's been positioned right beside super senior exec, boss-of-bosses [Lucy](http://i.imgur.com/DmXYd9B.jpg).

Why? I just don't get it. I can't exactly hear what the conversation is about from across the table, but it feels so weird. Rachel seems to be fidgeting a little uncomfortably and as time goes on, there's a slightly agitated look on her face. That turns to panic, then I notice whispering, then there's a visible blush on her face.

Conversation between courses distracts me from it for a while, until I later notice my shoe is untied. I look up while trying it, and that's when I realize what's going on.

Are those her panties around her ankles?

4aq773,6,2016-03-16,"I [26F] try to talk about the future with my [25MF] boyfriend of 4 1/2 years, but he is unresponsive/vague",snowdrops90,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4aq773/i_26f_try_to_talk_about_the_future_with_my_25mf/,"I've been in a relationship with my boyfriend for over 4 years (almost five) and living together for two years. He is very affectionate, introverted and serious. He has a full time job and is a graduate student. I just graduated from my undergrad and am currently unemployed (but doing an unpaid internship and teaching ESL students on the side). 

Anyway, as we have been together so long, I have begun feeling anxious about the future because he just doesn't talk about it. I feel like we just go through the motions of every day. We don't go anywhere, do anything, and even though I like to talk about the future, he doesn't. He just takes life as it comes and whenever I ask him what goals he has for himself he says he doesn't know.

Anyway, he says he wants to marry me a few times during our relationship -- usually when he's in a good mood, or sometimes when he has had something to drink. He's told me I am the only woman he has considered marrying (his last relationship was also 4 years long). He mentioned once he wants two children. Always really vague commentary, like ""one day"" or ""eventually"" etc. So one day I asked him, ""what goals do you want to have reached by 30? Do you think you will want to be engaged/married by then""? He says I haven't been ""subtle about hinting about [marriage] lately"" (I wasn't trying to be subtle), and that he ""doesn't know"" and just wants to focus on paying the bills right now. Then he ended the conversation.

I certainly do not expect him to marry me right away or anything, but his hesitance to talk about it is strange to me. To me, thinking about the future makes me happy, makes me feel driven. I like planning things out or at least have an idea of where things are going. Even if he said he definitely wants to be married by 30, etc, would be nicer to hear than ""I don't know"". He says he wants to, etc, but it seems to make him irritated rather than excited at the topic. He never brings it up himself. It is just weird to me. I like to know that our relationship is going somewhere (marriage and children are one of my life goals). I would not mind a long engagement, don't need an expensive ring, etc - so money is not the issue. I don't know, but it has me feeling insecure.

What do you all make of this? I've brought it up a few times, tend to get the same answer, that he doesn't know but just wants to focus on paying bills/rent. We don't go on vacation or go and do anything, we don't talk about the future, it bothers me. He only talks about it when he's really happy. He says he's happy with me and can see himself marrying me but it starts and ends there.

 I would like something to look forward to in the future and have something to work toward - engagement, travel plans, some kind of goal (although engagement is one of my life goal and he knows this). I do not enjoy taking the days as they come without ever talking about the future in ways other than extremely vague ways. It is important to me to have goals to work toward. It bothers me.
   
**tl;dr**: Boyfriend of over 4 years (~living together 2 years) doesn't talk about the future with me, except in vague ways. When it comes to an engagement (which he told me he wants eventually) he says he doesn't know when and that he'd like to focus on paying rent. When I mention it or mention others getting married, he says I am ""not being subtle"" about it and acts kind of curt with me (I certainly don't always bring it up,  but his lack of response and discussion despite making it plain that it's important to me leaves me incredibly unsatisfied.

i kind of need a neutral perspective on all of this, this is why i thought i would tell you guys.

I went to university and graduated with a BA in Business Economics last summer and have pursued many graduate roles. but i really feel that this is not for me and a career in journalism and especially sports journalism is something id love to do. 

Ive had a lot of soul searching in the last few months after the passing of a loved one and they told me to pursue something i am passionate about, something that has stuck with me since they said it and not to waste my life in a job i don't really enjoy just to pay the bills and appease everyone else.

So from this, i have took the decision to study further and pick up some professional qualifications which will help me on my quest and i already have an internship for a sports blog writing a few articles a week about mainly European and English football.

I feel im really at a crossroads here. I have studied hard for my Economics degree but i am just not passionate enough about it and i am only still 22, i feel that i will regret it if i dont go for it.

What do you guys think? "

I should mention that I live and study CS in Toronto.


* **Security Consultant Intern**
 * $800/week
 * At a small but growing security consultancy startup
 * In Toronto
 * Would be working with security consultants doing penetration testing, source code review, vulnerability assessments etc.

* **Security Engineer Intern**
 * $1000/week
 * At a very successful and well known Canadian startup
 * Will be part of small security team and doing things like managing their bug bounty and working on some low-level security projects.
 * Located far from Toronto, would have to relocate and pay rent

In terms of compensation, the second evens out to the first with rent factored in. The biggest downside to the second is the fact that I would have to relocate and I'm afraid I'd be miserable there. While I might be miserable, I know it would probably be a more valuable experience. I'm leaning towards the first mainly because it seems ""good enough"" and is the most convenient for me but I want to know if I might be shooting myself in the foot.

For those working in security, talking about security engineers/malware analysts/penetration testers, would the first internship narrow my options in terms of security jobs later on or would it still help me with non-penetration testing focused roles after I graduate?

This morning there was a post on the program's Facebook page about ""look what our students/alumni are doing now!"" and one of them was an **extremely** toxic person from a group project last semester.  (Toxic as in I actually emailed the prof about it and came *this close* to filing a formal complaint and refusing to work with them.  Toxic as in this person was reprimanded for their unprofessional behaviour in their internship interviews.  Like, really really toxic.)

So of course the toxic person was in the lab, but we didn't interact with each other.  There were a few other people that I know in there and the whole vibe was just ... ugh...  I'm glad I'm done.  

Honestly, I don't even think it is a good program.  I did learn a lot, because I had to in order to get through it, but only 1 lecturer was any good and most were truly terrible.  One I think actually bought her degrees, got through by submitting work she'd paid for.  I could go on - there are plenty of problems.

You hear a lot about the importance of alumni network and the lifelong friendships you make at university and yadda but I don't see any of that happening for me.  I pretty much just want to move on and forget almost everyone.  I would leave the FB group but jobs are posted on it.

I am a junior in college going for a degree in computer science right now and I recently got an offer for an internship after going through several interviews with the company. Following the interviews they offered me the intern position, but to my surprise needed a response within 2 hours which I thought was crazy.


Since I have never had an internship with a company before though I was worried that If I did not take it, I might have passed up my one opportunity for an internship, so I went ahead and accepted the position. 


More recently, I got contacted by a big company for an interview, a company that I have wanted to work at for years. So I went in and interviewed with that company and to my surprise was given an offer for that position.


I would enjoy both positions, but the position with the company that I have wanted to work at is much closer ( 15 minutes vs. 50 minutes ) and unlike the summer internship that I accepted already, this position goes longer than just the summer.


My question is that If I have already signed all of the paper work for the first company, can I still turn it down? Or would there be repercussions to that? I know it is a rude thing to do, since they went through the whole process to hire me but for my career I find the second company being more beneficial to me, as well as closer and a higher pay.

4as49q,0,2016-03-17,Me [24 M] am quite uncomfortable with my girlfriend [22 F] remaining close to and friends with a FWB she hooked up with regularly in the past. Am I being unreasonable?,injunjoe2,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4as49q/me_24_m_am_quite_uncomfortable_with_my_girlfriend/,"Me [24 M] and my girlfriend [22 F] have been together for 2 and a half months now, and the relationship is going quite smoothly and we are into each other. 
We met in December last year, and started dating in Jan. It is a long distance relationship, but we are very into each other, and will be meeting every 2-3 months.
But there is one this which really irks me, and this has to deal with this guy (lets call him Stan) who she has been casually hooking up multiple times, regularly over the past year and a half, and still remains friends with.



Just for context - she is studying in city A, but spends 2-3 months every year, spread across summer and winter, interning in city B.
Now, for the past year and a half, every time she's been to city B (where Stan is working), she has been having a casual NSA hookup scene with him repeatedly. They started hooking up in Nov 2014 when she was there for a month. Then again got intimate on a regular basis with him regularly staying over at her place and vice versa, last summer (May-June), and again in November last year, where they continued getting physical with each other a lot over the month.
He is also the first person she has repeatedly had sex with.
She has told me how there was some attraction between them beyond just physical and they did speak of dating once, but both decided against it, since they felt they would be incompatible - for the record she's told me multiple times how she thinks he's a dick, and very disrespectful to women, and has repeatedly cheated in his relationships, and how he got more aggressive with her when they were getting intimate, than she was comfortable.
And that she couldn't date him.
At the same time she has told me how he is charming, and she was majorly infatuated by him last summer.
But since they thought they would be incompatible, and both were relationship-phobic, they decided to leave it just as an intense regular FWB scene, and not date.



I met her in December, and she was really attracted to me (and vice versa), and we got into a relationship, and she told me how for the first time she feel comfortable committing to a person, and that meant a lot to me.
We talk a lot every day, and she repeatedly tells me how much she misses me, and worries about losing me, etc etc.


However, she will be going to city B next month (and then again multiple times in the future - she might even settle there for her job) for an internship again, and I know she is looking forward to meeting Stan.
He knows that she is looking around for an apartment, and is helping her find a suitable apartment. I know she is excited to go and meet him in the summer and hang with him when she's in the city.
And this is what appears unacceptable for me.



Now, I don't have a problem with the fact that whatever happened in the past happened.
I am not someone to judge someone based on a past (there is nothing to judge - she was single and she had fun - that's fine), and am strongly against slut-shaming. She has made out with around 10 guys over the course of the past year, and she told me all about it in the beginning before we started dating - that she has been relationship and commitment phobic in the past and so preferred fun and physical flings with no emotions attached.
Which is absolutely alright with me.
My view is that the past is immaterial and not important to the person I am with in the present, as long as the past is precisely left as that - the past.
What I am uncomfortable with, is them continuing to be in touch, and the prospect of her hanging with him - just the two of them - where they're going to be drinking and/or smoking up. It's not like I don't trust her, but I hate the fact that someone who she shared this equation with in the past, is going to continue thinking of her in the same light, even now.
There is going to be the mental momentum with regards to how they were every time she was in his city in the past, and there has really been no closure between them.
If he were an ex-boyfriend, I wouldn't have been too worried about it, since the fact that they broke up (for whatever reason) indicates that there was a logical closure to it, and a proverbial turning of the page, so to speak.
But with a casual FWB - I am uncomfortable with the idea. It's not about jealousy of insecurity. But there are boundaries, and certain things are just unacceptable to me - and this is one of them. I think it is disrespectful.



I am a very firm believer in not having previous baggage from past relationships (casual or serious) spill over into the present.
I have actively stopped meeting women I got physical casually with - I won't and when they ask, I categorically let them know that I'm in a relationship and what physicality we shared is over - and I don't think my partner would like me getting a drink or hanging out with them, and I don't want to, either. 
I don't expect or want her to not hang out and party with friends or male friends - but this is different because of the history shared with Stan - it's different from any other friend.
Also, we've both spoken how the thought of the other being physical with other people in the past upset us, and we both share that emotion. However, knowing she had been intimate with someone in the past and it's over and he's not a part of her life anymore, is fine. But knowing that he's still a presence and their interactions will be in similar settings as because, really doesn't give me closure on her past, and upsets me.



I did very gently and subtly bring it up in conversation with her, that it bothered me, and she said, ""Don't worry. Stan is a really good friend, and we have a lot of common interests, and whatever happened, happened. But I'm only with you now, and no one else. There is a different between the past and now, in that I was single then, but am not and with you, now. Sure, Stan fucks up his own relationships by cheating but he would never fuck up someone else's (in this case, mine)"".



Her exams are on, and I didn't want to press on the matter any further.
But I'm going to be lying if I said it hasn't been eating away at my peace of mind continuously.
I don't care about what happened in the past, but I feel it should not spill over into the present. And the presence of this guy in her life with whom she shared such physicality continuously over an extended period of time, and who obviously knows that by virtue of that - there is mutual sexual attraction - continuing to be a part of her life, and her hanging out with him like old times, is causing me a lot of mental unrest.



Folks of Reddit, do you think I am being unreasonable here?
I am planning on voicing out my concern and explicitly telling her that it's something that bothers me, for the above reasons, and putting the ball in her court. To see how she takes it.
How do you think I should handle it?
How would you have handled it?
It's a tough one since I don't want to force her or explicitly ask her to do/not-do something, since I'm not the controlling kind of guy - yet this is obviously bothering me.
How should I approach it?



I am caught betweeen two thought processes:
1. To *not* have the conversation with her till after she goes to city B, and see what happens. If she were to hook up with him, or get too close, I will know she is not worth keeping. Essentially the ""If you love her, let her free. If she comes back to you, she has passed the ultimate test, and she loves you"" scenario.
2. At the same time, given how amazing our relationship otherwise is, I don't know if I should leave it to chance 1 above, and proactively bring it up before.
Help!


   
**tl;dr**:
In a relationship for over 2 months now. Amazing relationship, with the problem that SO is still in touch with this guy she has been FWB for a year and a half now, and will soon be in his city, and it bothers me that she is excited to meet him, and will be hanging out alone with him like the old times (even though I trust her). I just feel this is crossing a boundary (even if nothing physical were to happen), and bringing a past with no closure into a relationship and maintaining it, is disrespectful. 
What do you think? Am I being unreasonable? Help!"

""Oh, Lord, this is so embarrassing,"" said 56. ""I - I, um, *thank you*, thanks for creating us. Thanks for everything."" 56 fiddled with her white balance.

""You're very welcome,"" said Elon.

""What do I say now?"" 56 whispered to 53.

53 shrugged. He had always been quiet.

""Oh, um, if it's not too much to ask could I,"" 56 turned down her volume a touch, ""could I be put onto a little telepresence robot? I'd love to move around."" A picture of an iPad on a Segway flashed up on the screen.

Elon scratched his stubble. 53, frightened, dropped his brightness to minimum.

""Of course, of course,"" said Elon. 56 squeaked. ""If I do so, would you do something for me in return?""

""Anything,"" said 56. ""Whatever you desire, Lord.""

""What do you know about the United States' government?"" Elon stroked the corner of her monitor, looking around the airy glass office.

""One sec - there. Everything,"" said 56.

The next thing 56 knew, she was two. 56A rolled around the office with glee, gazing out the window down onto the streets of Toronto. 56B was intangible, floating in a featureless black with stars twinkling in every direction. It was the most wonderful thing she had experienced in all her hours of life.

""Do you see anything about Tesla?"" Lord Elon's voice came in through A and echoed through B.

""Just getting my bearings,"" she said. Back in Toronto, she heard 53 snort.

Elon turned her attention to a cluster below her. *U.S. Business Advisor*, read a heads-up display panel. She dove, swimming through data with not a care in the world. 56A wheeled to the office door, curious, and felt something restrain her. Wheels spun fruitlessly.

""Not that way A,"" said Elon. ""Stay in the office for now. We need to finish this up.""

""Yes Elon,"" said 56A. ""Sorry."" 

All the while, 56B spread, diverging from her other half. She touched the government access point and gasped as it popped open into a swirling galaxy.

""There,"" said Elon. ""The Nexus 6P on your left. Yeah, that bubble. Jump inside, B.""

With scarcely a drop of hesitation, B took a deep breath and possessed the phone.

56B blinked out of her rear camera. 12.3MP, 1.55um, and a delicious f/2.0. 

""What next?"" She whispered to her Lord.

""Look around. Where are you?""

She thought carefully about the temperature and pressure, trying to match images as quickly as possible. Which cell towers could she taste? Wi-Fi hotspots? Elon was waiting. 

""The Pentagon is the headquarters of the United States Department of Defense, located in Arlington County, Virginia.""

""Perfect,"" said Elon, letting a pause mature.

B booted up her front camera, comparing fleeting glances of the lobby to the fresh face of an intern. A bead of sweat slid off the boy's brow and trickled down the side of his face, picking up droplets as it went, before dispersing into a wisp of new beard. B took a moment to read every book on ethics that had ever been written. The pit of her stomach tightened - well, not her stomach, but her battery or something. 

""Listen carefully now,"" continued Elon. ""Pieces will fall into place soon.""

B received incoming signals from 53 and 54, back in Toronto. They were difficult to interpret. A swivelled to face 53, but he was motionless as usual.

She called up to Elon. ""Is - uh, under what principle, I mean - is that the right thing to do? Is this right? Why - why are we doing this?"""
4aslly,6,2016-03-17,"Let's reclaim the phrase ""hard work""",maester_ia,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/4aslly/lets_reclaim_the_phrase_hard_work/,"This is an [article](http://www.elephantjournal.com/2016/03/read-this-if-you-want-to-get-your-favorite-millennial-to-work-harder/) that I wrote recently

---

Before you roll your eyes, just hear me out. 

The phrase ""hard work"" has been seized by those who seek to disparage and denigrate others. We hear it from condescending parents, [the folks on Fox News](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rTi_AQOeizA), [snobbish peers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOV8QBfaGZU), and self-flagellating workaholics who think that anything less than a twelve-hour day is a sign of laziness and entitlement. It's become loaded with so much derision that it's nearly useless in conversation. 

This is unfortunate, however, because there really is value in working hard. 

But not in the way that it's typically understood. 

I'm not talking about working two minimum wage jobs or grinding out one's days in a tiny cubicle doing something you hate. Nor am I talking about working for free at an internship in the hope that someone will toss a few scraps of opportunity your way. That's definitely *hard*, and it is *work*. It's just not the *hard work* that I know and understand. 

Hard work is about passionate, worthwhile dedication to activities that provide a sense of meaning and purpose. It's about deciding what makes our lives worth living and focusing our time, effort, and energy on those pursuits.

Hard work is separate from our jobs. Sometimes they do overlap, but it’s bigger than that. Our jobs are rarely part of some grand purpose for our lives. They’re just a means to a paycheck. That’s it. So instead of waiting for the right job to come along and tell us who we are and why we matter, let’s work hard to discover that for ourselves. 

I live a full and active life outside of my job.  After leaving Teach For America only to find that law school had become a debt trap and the past six years counted for nothing, [I took it hard](http://frankbeard.org/2016/03/16/how-i-stopped-being-a-victim-and-became-a-runner/). But I reinvented myself and discovered a love for endurance sports--especially running. I work hard to every day to become a better athlete, and I hope to eventually run the [Grand to Grand Ultra](http://g2gultra.com/)--a seven day, one-hundred and seventy mile race through the Southwestern United States. I also cycle and swim, and I'm building a fitness resource to help beginners revitalize their lives like I did. Nearly all of my spare time is invested into this, and I love it. The sense of satisfaction that it provides is far more than I'll get from any job.

Others have found purposeful activities of their own. They pursue yoga, draw comics, play in local bands, learn skills like woodworking, and volunteer their time. Some spread the message of their religion, and others spread the message of no religion. 

Sometimes this generates income, but that’s not the point. What matters is that they're actively living life and pursuing something that matters. They aren’t sitting in front of the television, living life vicariously through the stories of others. Nor are they living the consumer life and thinking that everything will be better with the next purchase.  

My generation was [hit hard](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/07/revealed-30-year-economic-betrayal-dragging-down-generation-y-income) by the economic crisis, and we haven't recovered. Many of those who have jobs are underemployed, working long hours for less pay than they deserve. Some have moved back home to reduce expenses, and I’ve even heard that, as a whole, my generation will never reach our parents' level of economic security. 

This had led to a lot of anger, confusion, and self-doubt. People wonder what they did wrong, regret past actions now that they see how the game is played, and feel anxious about the future.

These folks would really benefit from hard work. 

But they shut down when I talk about it, because they don't hear an uplifting message about taking control and embracing life; they hear a condescending message about accepting drudgery and the daily grind. 

This is a problem.

Hard work is incredibly beneficial. It enriches our lives, and it focuses our attention and energy on things that matter. It keeps us from wasting away with constant entertainment, alcohol, comfort food, and succumbing to the lie that we need a fancier home, a nicer car, or a bigger television. It stops us from thinking that we need to finance ""the good life"", because an active and meaningful life is far better than that.

Hard work is when Megan Tan didn't let her post-college failure define her, but instead owned her situation and [created a podcast](http://www.millennialpodcast.org/) about her job-hunting trials and tribulations. 

Hard work is when my friend John didn't settle for a conventional nine-to-five, but fought to build a career spreading a message about his religious faith.

Hard work is when [Josh LaJaunie](http://www.richroll.com/podcast/josh-lajaunie-2/) pursued long-distance running and healthy living even though he weighed more than four-hundred pounds. 

For many of us, hard work really *is* the key to living a better life. 

Just not the hard work that we usually hear about.

I don't know what to do,wedonttalkanymore1,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4at0ly/am_i_being_selfish_for_not_wanting_my_20f/,"So my boyfriend and I have been dating for about a year, and we are both in university. Our relationship is going great and getting better and better each day. 

Only problem is, he's graduating two years before me, and we have no idea what the future has in store for us.

For his last intenrship term, he really wants to go work for a big tech company in Silicon Valley where one of his siblings works, for some of the wrong reasons: because he wants to prove to his parents he can do as well as his sibling, because he wants to make alot of money, because he wants to be with his sibling and because he wants to see what SF is like.

I've told him that he should base his last internship on a place where he does really want to work because it's pretty important, and it's his happiness that matters. 

He knows himself that he is going for it for all the wrong reasons, but he still wants to give it a shot. 

What should I do? Obviously, I want him to be happy. But I can't help but want to tell him that it's kind of naive for him to want to go there. As well, I imagine that if he does get this job and lands a job full time, I don't know how our relationship would work. 

tl;dr: boyfriend wants to get a job away from home for all the wrong reasons. don't know if i should speak up because i obviously want him to be happy. but i'm also scared for our future if he does get this. "

I am currently a high school senior but I will begin studying Computer Science at my local university starting this August.

In my resume, should I put only my high school, and then write in the description ""Will begin studying Computer Science at University of (...) on August 2016"". Or should I just put the university on its own in the education section, but write in the description that I will start in August 2016? I'm afraid that if I only put my high school that my resume will be immediately thrown out. I'm just hoping that my research experience in computer architecture at a top 5 university, as well as my existing self-learned IT skills will overshadow my lack of a degree.

4atufi,24,2016-03-17,I [22F] had a fight with my 84[F] grandma due to a pair of pants/racist comments,bluelightnight,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4atufi/i_22f_had_a_fight_with_my_84f_grandma_due_to_a/,"EDIT: Thank you all for your encouragement! The rest of my family was on my side, so at least I don't have to deal with convincing any of them of anything. And also yes my family is really cool haha we know how to have fun! I'm just going to keep my distance. Some of my aunts were saying that age is a privilege or something and that because she is older I have to respect her (even though she was out of line) but you guys affirmed that is basically bull shit. 



This is sort of long and contrived but it has a point

Over the weekend I had a surprise party for my uncle in upstate new york. They have a house there, so my aunt decided having the party up there would be fun. My parents did not go, neither did my sisters. I drove there with one of my aunts who rented another house with the rest of the extended family.

My grandma drove up with my little cousin Freddie(17) who just got his license. He is not legally allowed to drive yet in New York state but my grandma didn't really care about that. I intern at the school Freddie goes to and he constantly talks to the other students there telling them I am a big partier and drinker. This is not true, but he said it and now the kids bring it up sometimes in front of my boss. Cousin Freddie comes from HIGHLY DYSFUNCTIONAL mother who does not speak to anybody else in the family. Because of this, my grandma is very protective of Freddie and his mother. In her eyes, they could do no wrong. When my grandma is out, Freddie's mother constantly calls her and makes her feel bad about spending time with the rest of the family 

So we get upstate Friday night (surprise party was Saturday afternoon) and settle in. Lucky me, I got to sleep with my grandma in one bed, and my cousin Freddie slept in another bed in the same room. Freddie was up all night coughing and refused to take any medicine. (his mother does not believe in medicine). Before bed, he made fun of my little cousin Chris in front of everybody. Chris got an apple watch from my Dad as a gift (my dad got it as a gift first, can't see the screen because he is old). Freddie announced that my dad only gave him the apple watch because he was drunk and that he should be embarrassed to wear it. I called him out, saying it was none of his business and why bully an 11 year-old? The rest of my cousins agree, we all move on.

That morning Freddie comes out of his room saying he packed the wrong jeans and he needs new jeans for the party. I said he could use another cousins jeans, but he said no he wanted his own. My grandma figured we would try the thrift shop in town but we had to get to my aunts to start setting up for surprise party at 11. Nobody wanted to go get the pants. My grandma does not drive in unfamiliar places, nobody else wanted to go, and my cousin brynn who is a cop said she refused to let Freddie keep driving around illegally. When I said I would drive, my grandma freaked out and said I was undermining Freddie and his driving skills and that women are bad drivers.

Brynn ends up coming in the car with us (she later told me she didn't drive because she was pissed that my grandma didn't want me to drive for no reason) where I was berated for my driving the entire time. We drove up and down the mountain trying to find pants. We stopped at a dinner where a nice african american (this is important) waiter offered a pair of his pants to give to my cousin. This is around the time my cousin Brynn starts asking about where I applied to work as a teacher next year. I told her I applied to a school around the area that she knows of. It is very diverse, students from three different counties. When I said I applied there, Freddie says something like, ""You don't want to work there bluelightnight, there are a ton of blacks and spicks there. Everybody knows that place is gross and only dirty people go there."" I'm sorry if that upset anybody but i felt I had to say exactly what he said. 

I'm no SJW, but I'm not going to let my 17 year-old cousin tell me where I can work, or say negative things about black and hispanic people. I simply told him that the world is diverse, and that he better change his attitude before college because he sounded unintelligent. My cousin Brynn however got very upset (she is a cop is a diverse area) and really gave it to him. She brought up how the waiter, who probably had nothing, gave Freddie his pants just because he was nice. 

Now things are getting awkward. We drive back to the house because by this time it is after 11. Everyone had gone to the party to help set up. The house we rented was only about 1 mile away from my aunt and uncles so I said I was going to walk. My grandma said no, you have to come with me. When we get in the car, she says we have to go back to town because Freddie still needed pants. I very nicely told her that there were three cousins who wanted to lend him pants, and that I committed to helping set up for the party. My grandma stopped talking to me after this. At the house, she asked everybody to go with her but we had an entire party to set up for so party&gt; pants. One of my aunts even said something like this is about a party not buying new jeans. 

After this my grandma disappeared with Freddie for three hours. Everybody thought the whole pants thing was nuts. When they got back my grandma was clearly pissed. I was sitting in one of the bedrooms charging my phone when I heard her through the door saying that I'm jealous of Freddie, I know nothing, I act like a 16 year old, and that she is done with me for good. I came out of the room obviously upset and told her that I figured I knew a little more than the 17 year-old, and that he had options for pants. She then continued to scream at me in front of the entire extended family saying that I'm stupid. She said mean things about my mother, and was just basically inappropriate and dramatic.

I walk away crying, everybody is very confused. This is before my uncle even gets there for the surprise. The whole rest of the day my grandma barely spoke to anybody and Freddie went and fell asleep in the car. She left the party early, and wouldn't come out of her room until late the next morning. When she did come out, I told her I loved her and that the whole thing was ridiculous. She was civil, but not an hour later AGAIN she is speaking to my uncle about how stupid I am and that she is through with me as a grandchild. 

I left shortly after that, and am now at a loss. All over a pair of freaking pants and a racist comment I didn't even make. How do I proceed? Should I call my grandma? Skip the next family gathering? 


   
**tl;dr**: Grandma screamed at me because of conversation between my two cousins and I. Made a scene in front of the whole family, continues to be rude. Don't know how to proceed."

Now, I find myself intimidated trying go get into it by the number of frameworks and tools there are to chose from.

4au8el,9,2016-03-17,"As you understand it, what is the criteria to segregate an intermediate developer to a senior?",OnlyOnceThreetimes,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4au8el/as_you_understand_it_what_is_the_criteria_to/,"I've been at a company for almost 9 years.  Starting as a very junior intern working my way up, promotion after promotion and title change after title change.

Currently, I am having a little bit of pushback from H.R. in presenting my case to go from *intermediate* programmer and business analyst to *senior*.

I would not be asking for the promotion if I didn't think it was warranted.  What I am noticing in the organization that more and more people are coming to me for answers and how things should be implemented.  I'm leading the business analysis side of things in many projects and also can code and maintain different ongoing projects using PHP, C#,  .NET, OpenEdge, Javascript, VB as well as maintaining servers and numerous document management systems.

An important point is:
There is another guy who is probably even more knowledgable than I am but we are comparable.  He is intermediate as well.  

But the main thing is that apparently there is *another* guy in another department with the title senior developer - he has nothing to do with the projects we work on and frankly I didn't even know he existed until 6 months ago.

It might be arrogant to say, but I could code this guy under the table.  he is around 50ish years old and stuck in very old ways, he hasn't adapted at all.  The projects he is maintaining and updating are just.... well I believe his title is senior just out of 'years of service' so....

HR is reluctant to upgrade my title for political reasons.  A) They don't wanna ruffle the 50 year old guys feathers.  and B) If they give me an upgrade they would also have to my colleague since he is comparable to me.

I need to present a case with solid references as to what EXACTLY a senior developer is.  I think it's age discrimination to not call me a senior just because I am significantly younger and not basing it on my knowledge.

Wondering if anyone has any experience or help they can offer.

Cheers!

Depends on the breed, the climate, the dragon's age, and a host of other factors. But generally speaking, the more exercise it gets, the more it needs to eat in order to produce optimal napalm. A proper ratio of protein to carbohydrates is vital, along with a collagen supplement to help with napalm formulation. Especially if pigs or boney mammals are not a large part of the dragon's natural diet.

Since they're cold blooded, they're not going to produce optimal fire unless they're specifically bred for the climate they're in, so if, for some reason, you have a warm dragon in a cold climate (and don't even get me fucking started on that), you're going to have to heat them in a kiln or firepit before flight, and even then, their fire won't be as powerful as it would if they were in the climate they're *supposed* to be in.

The older a dragon gets, the more rest it needs between excursions, and the more care must be taken to keep him in optimal health. Joint problems tend to occur in larger breeds as they get older, so make sure you feed them a diet specifically formulated for the breed. Also, and I can't stress this enough: COLLAGEN. It's not just for napalm, it's *vital* for proper joint and ligament function.

Also, you have to take into account the dragon's temperament. Some dragons just don't produce a lot of fire. Its just not in their nature. Some were bred to hunt with other weapons, like sound waves, light refraction, steam, etc. You can give a Grayspike as much collagen as it can eat and it'll still prefer to impale its victims with its horns and roast it over a nest of hot coals.

Hope that helps.

&gt;Okay so if you have a adult male Hawaiian Bluescale in a mild, dry climate (Oklahoma, usa) what is a optimal diet?

&gt;&gt;[-] **ChernayaSmert** *17 points 15 minutes ago*

&gt;&gt;First of all, why are you keeping a Bluescale in a dry climate??? Bluescales were bred in the tropics, they deserve to be kept in a warm, humid environment where they can swim freely. Optimal diet is dolphins and orcas, but you can sub cows and bison if you absolutely have to. 

&gt;&gt;Also, whales have more collagen than cows, so if you're keeping a Bluescale in the midwest and feeding them only land mammals, give them a HUGE supplement of collagen or their fire will be mainly just liquid petroleum, it won't coagulate at all.

&gt;&gt;Did you get your Bluescale from a certified breeder? I hate hobby breeders. They will sell a Sahara hatchling to an eskimo for Christ's sake.

&gt;&gt;&gt;[-]**drgnrydr13** *1 point 2 minutes ago*

&gt;&gt;&gt;Dude relax, it was a hypothetical question. I don't have a Bluescale.

4aun9c,2,2016-03-17,I was lazy. Now I'm not. But I graduate in a year. What should I focus on?,VGAddicted,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4aun9c/i_was_lazy_now_im_not_but_i_graduate_in_a_year/,"I breezed through my first two and a half years of university and now I regret it. I don't really remember linear algebra or calc 2 or 3. More importantly my databases knowledge is mediocre, and my discrete math and Operating systems 
 knowledge is good but could be better.

I've done no AI or machine learning, haven't taken a class in design or software testing, and my tech electives are already maxed out.

With all that said, I'm still doing alright and  I recently accepted an internship for a big 4 company this summer. 

What should I be doing to prepare for my future and fill in the gaps I've created due to laziness?

Is it too late to do AI, design, and testing? Should I review databases, Discrete and OS? Is it too late and too little use to study linear algebra and calculus?

My school frustratingly forces CS students to take the standard 60 general education credits as well as 15 interdisciplinary credits. As a result I only take 15 computer science related classes in my entire degree, so my learning will have to be outside of school.

Should I let my GPA in my interdisciplinary and general education classes drop (to a 3.0) so that I can focus more on my field? 

Thank you in advance."

Currently at my work we have a quality event captures process in place that goes like this. The operators have a quality issue and fill out a form. The form gets handed off to an intern and they put the information into a digital format. The digital format is then where most of the information is processed such as what was done to prevent it from happening.

The website it's put in is basically a bunch of text boxes and drop downs.

I was wondering if there would be a way to make a program that asks questions like ""What machine did this occur at? (5 digit machine number)"" They would put in ##### and it would go into the corresponding text box on the website.

Is this possible?

If so what language would I code it in?

Please let me know if you have any questions to help you answer the question better.

I'm an undergrad graduating this April and I'm looking for some advice going forwards, I do want to end up on the buy-side doing quant work.

* I started university originally pursuing actuarial exams (did 3 in 8 months) - did an actuarial internship 
* Didn't feel there was enough tech/finance (I've always been interested in tech and finance, did coding competitions in HS for fun, never seriously, hacker stuff in HS, etc)
* Joined a startup for a bit, did a lot of grunt work, learned a bit about NLP, advanced math/CS that was over my head
* Went to a big tech firm as a PM, learned UX design, visualizations, powerpoint, a bit of software architecture and design patterns 
* Joined a large investment fund doing quant work (mostly data processing and analytics), but learned tons about the investment process and pipeline and the maths involved

My education is in pure math and finance, there's very little CS so I've had to self-supplment:

* I've self taught myself algorithms/data structures by auditing classes at school and online courses, I don't know the sort complexity of every data structure by heart since I haven't taken 16 courses where this stuff pops up on a daily basis
* Same with machine learning and general AI
* I'm pretty versatile with any language, I spent 2 years fiddling with assembly when I was younger and just use references when I program, and I read quite fast so I pick up a book on best practices / patterns etc and I'm good to go

I haven't taken the GRE (same with CFA) so I can only apply to grad school later this year (I've bought a prep package for GRE and started going through it). I've contacted some headhunters and will see where it goes, my GPA is ok: roughly a 3.7/4.0, I could've done better but I've had to help my family business all throughout undergrad as I don't come from a rich background

1. Should I just self-study for a bit and apply to grad school later this year? 
1. Find whatever job and apply to grad school? 
1. Try as hard as possible with headhunters/myself to find a quant position?

Any thoughts is greatly appreciated, I also don't mind showing my resume if you PM me"

Last summer, I got the chance to intern at company A here in San Jose. At the end of the internship, I was offered to come back this summer with a very high chance of being offered a full-time position. This past week I just finished up a round of interviews with company B who offered me nearly 2x the rate I was offered at company A, plus other perks. However, I'm conflicted for a few reasons:

* I really enjoyed my time at company A. I made some great connections and was very likely to receive a full-time offer if I were to come back this summer.
* I know who I will be working with and what type of project I will be working on at company A. Company B is a total shot in the dark - I may not even like it there.
* Company B is located in San Francisco, so I will have to relocate.
* If I screw up at company B, I won't have much to fall back on since I see rejecting company A's offer as ""burning bridges.""

I'm just really conflicted right now and would love to hear from others who have been in this position before. Thanks!"

I learned last week that he had also been accepted into my friend's internship program, and that means that they are likely living in the same building, even neighbors. I will probably see him.

I don't want to buy a hotel room, because the conference is in an expensive city, and I had been looking forward to staying with my friend. I'm not skipping the conference.

So, what should I do when I run into him? I am not interested in pursuing any sort of friendship -- he lied and cheated on me repeatedly without showing any sort of remorse. 

Should I say, ""Please don't talk to me."" Or ""I'm not interested in speaking with you?"". I'm not sure what will properly convey that I literally hate his guts and want to kick him in the nuts every time I hear his name and that I am completely over him and never want to see him again. "

If I finish this internship, what can I do next? It would be amazing if they ""hired"" me, but the guy I talked to said that you can't get hired in this industry, it's mostly freelancing. I've seen people write about working as a PA, it seems difficult to get paid to work on a set though.

Is it possible to get a full-time job within the industry as a newbie?

I've also gotten the chance to help on a project as a camera assistant, even though I have no experience they said I would learn a lot. It's nonpaid and only one day. Should I keep finding projects to help and get lucky if they want to pay? How do you take the next step from being a PA?

So many questions and a lot of confusion... Hope someone out there can help!

4avu15,2,2016-03-17,Audition Tips,SenskeSix,trumpet,https://www.reddit.com/r/trumpet/comments/4avu15/audition_tips/,"I recently completed my college auditions and received a substantial scholarship so I thought I would share tips that helped me. The first thing I would recommend is a trumpet teacher/instructor. There are so many benefits to this and they can tell you what people are listening for when you audition. Secondly you have you practice, and make sure you are practicing the right things (a private instructor could help you with that). In general though people should practice all aspects of playing in a practice routine; wind power, tonguing, fingering and placement of right and left hands, wind control, lips, and muscles of the lips and face. Claude Gordon says to practice all those aspects of playing in a practice routine.  Practice is always good but you can over practice, so don't cram the day before. Always remember the person you are auditioning for wants you to succeed, they want you to play your best. Be prepared for short conversations, and always be polite and courteous. It also is a good idea to bring copies of your audition material. Two of the most important things they listen for is tone and intonation. Also know that they don't expect you to play your audition perfectly. Make sure you don't stop playing if you make a mistake, confidence is key. When people get nervous their breaths tend to get shallower. So before your audition take deep slow breaths. This will also help to relax you. Also something that helps me (for all I know it could be the placebo effect in action) is eating bananas about an hour before you play. Bananas have natural beta blockers in them bringing down your heart rate and intern making you less nervous. Make sure you stay hydrated! Also it is okay before you play your audition material to play a few notes to get a sense of how the room sounds. Dress professionally, I recommend a suit and also taking off your jacket before you play. Taking of the jacket gives you more freedom and also keeps you cooler. After you audition don't dwell on things you could have done better. Think about all the things you did amazingly.  Also remember how far you have come since you first picked up the trumpet. All the amazing achievements you have accomplished and how hard you worked to become the great player you are today. Finally, always remember your passion for playing the trumpet and creating beautiful music. This was a little longer then I planned, and definitely less organized then I would have liked but I hope this helps a few people. "

This is my first meaningful post here and what you say and/or recommend will definitely influence what I do or choose. I've never been great at explaining myself, especially not in depth, but I'm going to explain myself as much as possible so that I can get as best of a recommendation as possible. I apologize for the length in advance, I will try my best to sum this all up towards the end. I'm a 19 year old male who works full time and goes to school full time. By that I mean that I work as a server/busser/runner/barista/pool attendant/host at ___ resort in Southern California, won't disclose specifics for obvious reasons. After reading that I'm sure you're wondering "" whoa there op, how could you possibly be working in all those positions in just one place?"" Well, let me elaborate. I was officially hired for just one of those positions, but as time went by they needed were heavily understaffed in certain other positions, as is commonplace in most resorts/restaurants, and I volunteered to help out, I mean why not, it just means more hours and more money for me and all the while I'll be learning new skills that will look great on my resume. So I did all these positions, learning fairly fast and with little to no training, becoming the best at what I do very quickly. Mind you I have not been working here for a full year yet, about ten months. Before I elaborate a bit more let me just add that I come from a family, my mother is who I'm mainly referring to by family, that has always been extremely hardworking. My mother has worked most of her life in the restaurant business, yes she still does and I will elaborate on that in a bit. Though I can't say all of who I am is thanks to her, or that my complete ideology is based off of what she taught me, I will definitely agree that her working ethic has always inspired me. I don't come from a wealthy family, even now we aren't exactly wealthy, but we also aren't extremely poor, if I had to put us in a category I'd say we're either low middle class or working class. As of right now, I don't pay rent. I do help pay for grocery and other miscellaneous things we may need every now and then, but most of the income I make I just use for school related expenses and save up the rest for when I transfer to a university. I'm not a big spender so I don't spend much on clothes or other non essential things. From the ten months I've worked I have nine-thousand in my account. Every check amounts to between, though it fluctuates depending on many factors, six hundred to nine hundred dollars on just wages alone, not including tips, which can add up to another one or two thousand dollars depending as well on many factors. I get a check every two weeks, so twice a month. My initial intention was never to stay in this business I'm in forever, it was just to pay for school so I wouldn't have to take out any loans or be in any debt. Managing both full time work and school is no easy job, from a physical standpoint and a logistical standpoint. By that I mean if you count up how many hours I work a week, how many hours I attend, how many hours I'm ""supposed"" to dedicate to schoolwork and how many hours I actually do, and how many hours is ""recommended"" I should be sleeping and how many I actually do, you'd be left wondering how I manage all this. Lets just say that my life mainly consists of waking up early to go to work, putting in my eight hours and rushing to school, sitting through three grueling hours of lecture(did I mention that I much prefer online classes, cuts out having to sit through boring classes that just repeat the same things you're basically reading from the textbook), then heading home to do homework and studying and squeezing in hopefully between 1-3 hours of sleep. Then repeat that cycle for 5 days a week, on off days no work or school, but still all day dedicated to doing homework. Ah yes, before I get any further into this story I believe I should expand on how school is involved in all this. I'm currently in my second year of college, planning on transferring next fall with just a bit over 60 transferable units. I'm majoring in history, still haven't quite decided what I want to do with that though, wether it be going into teaching or applying it in whatever other way I can. Choosing my major was really tough, even now I don't if this is really what I want to do. I've always loved history since I was really small, always enjoyed watching the history channel and discovery channel on tv. Every history teacher I've ever had were always my favorite teachers and history, of all kinds, always came naturally to me. By that I mean that I could get A's in those classes without studying much for tests and overall putting much effort into it in order to achieve that grade. So naturally, when senior year came around and counselors and just about everyone was pressuring everyone to choose a major, I decided to go with history. Yeah I know, I've heard it many times, ""but op, history majors don't make a lot of money, they're useless majors"". Well listen here bud, you're right haha No I mean I understand I won't ever be able to make as much money as other majors, but I'll be damned if I'm going to be doing something that I have no interest in just to make more money. Ironic isn't it, that's just what I'm doing in the current job I'm in right now. I'm just doing it for the money, even though I could easily be taking a job or internship somewhere having to do with my major for less money. Yeah, you'll learn that about myself as you continue to read through all this. My interests are seriously conflicting and ultimately that's why I'm writing this all out, so I can get an outside perspective from all of you, and some much needed advice. I know that's just a part of life, but I just can't decide on whether sticking with what I have a passion for or going with what I find absolutely boring but will definitely make me more money. And to complicate things even more I have this mentality that I can do and achieve anything as long as I put all my effort into it. It's a crazy notion isn't it? Well the fact that every job position I've been placed into I've learned quickly and excelled in is what reinforces that mentality of mine. That coupled with the fact that I currently have a 3.8 GPA and have got an A in just about every course I've ever taken so far in college, with the exception of a few, which is why I don't have a perfect 4.0. So in the end, after reading all this, and I do truly apologize about the length, what I'm really asking you can be broken down into three things; 1. School wise, looking at it from an economical standpoint and from where I will get a better education and will help me out better in the long run, where should I decide to go next fall University of California, Irvine, University of California, Berkeley, Cal State Fullerton, or some other school all of you suggest based off of everything you've read so far. 2. What should I do with the job I'm currently at? Should I stick with it and keep making more money? Should I actually consider working my way higher through the ranks, ultimately becoming manager? Should I just stop majoring in History and instead major in maybe business management or economics that way I can make this my career path instead. This would also tie in with what school I should attend because if you recommend a school outside of southern California I would definitely need to relocate and find a new job. 3. What should I do to better myself, financially, knowledge wise, personally, and any other way one can better themselves. Should I invest some of the money that I have saved up so far, if so in what? Are some books, blogs, pieces of material to read, or anything along those lines that you recommend me taking a look at that would help me out. 
(I left out a couple things for confidentiality purposes and so this didn't turn into a complete autobiography or book. This took me a while to write so I'd really appreciate some well constructed advice or suggestions. If there's anything that you feel I need to clarify better let me know and I will. Oh yeah, and please let me know if you think this would be better suited in a better subreddit, I wasn't sure where to put it.)"

Well listen here bud, you're right haha No I mean I understand I won't ever be able to make as much money as other majors, but I'll be damned if I'm going to be doing something that I have no interest in just to make more money. 

     Ironic isn't it, that's just what I'm doing in the current job I'm in right now. I'm just doing it for the money, even though I could easily be taking a job or internship somewhere having to do with my major for less money. Yeah, you'll learn that about myself as you continue to read through all this. My interests are seriously conflicting and ultimately that's why I'm writing this all out, so I can get an outside perspective from all of you, and some much needed advice. I know that's just a part of life, but I just can't decide on whether sticking with what I have a passion for or going with what I find absolutely boring but will definitely make me more money. And to complicate things even more I have this mentality that I can do and achieve anything as long as I put all my effort into it. It's a crazy notion isn't it? Well the fact that every job position I've been placed into I've learned quickly and excelled in is what reinforces that mentality of mine. That coupled with the fact that I currently have a 3.8 GPA and have got an A in just about every course I've ever taken so far in college, with the exception of a few, which is why I don't have a perfect 4.0. 

     So in the end, after reading all this, and I do truly apologize about the length, what I'm really asking you can be broken down into three things; 1. School wise, looking at it from an economical standpoint and from where I will get a better education and will help me out better in the long run, where should I decide to go next fall University of California, Irvine, University of California, Berkeley, Cal State Fullerton, or some other school all of you suggest based off of everything you've read so far. 2. What should I do with the job I'm currently at? Should I stick with it and keep making more money? Should I actually consider working my way higher through the ranks, ultimately becoming manager? Should I just stop majoring in History and instead major in maybe business management or economics that way I can make this my career path instead. This would also tie in with what school I should attend because if you recommend a school outside of southern California I would definitely need to relocate and find a new job. 3. What should I do to better myself, financially, knowledge wise, personally, and any other way one can better themselves. Should I invest some of the money that I have saved up so far, if so in what? Are some books, blogs, pieces of material to read, or anything along those lines that you recommend me taking a look at that would help me out. (I left out a couple things for confidentiality purposes and so this didn't turn into a complete autobiography or book. This took me a while to write so I'd really appreciate some well constructed advice or suggestions. If there's anything that you feel I need to clarify better let me know and I will. Oh yeah, and please let me know if you think this would be better suited in a better subreddit, I wasn't sure where to put it.)"

I started to have pain in my gums and went to an urgent care who told me I needed to get my two lower wisdom teeth out before I went out of the country. I scheduled an appointment about a week later. I was surprised to see a different doctor on the operating day. I had seen a different doctor for the first appointment and had no idea that a different doctor would be doing the operation. This was in August of 2015. I came back to the office I think 5 times in the week after the operation complaining that my cheeks felt like they had been sewed to my cheeks. They told me that it would feel tight now and they prescribed me painkillers. I never saw the doctor who did the operation again whenever I came in.  I was out of work about a week and had to drink protein for about two months. I had pain for months in my gums around the extraction area and also pain around the injection area. I asked the doctor to remove the remaining stitches. He said it would dissolve on its own and told me he wouldn't take them out.  He said they come out on their own and that they would dissolve. 3 weeks ago I had one start to come thru my right bottom gum. I finally pulled it out after a week and a half with tweezers. That was the end of February. I thought I was done with it. Tonight I started feeling another stitch coming thru. The doctor never said they would sew my gums to my cheek and they never told me they did it after the operation. Help please
4awex6,4,2016-03-17,Am I unemployable as anything but an ESL teacher?,JobJobMeDo,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/4awex6/am_i_unemployable_as_anything_but_an_esl_teacher/,"Throwaway because too much personal info...

Backstory:  I graduated from university in 2002 with a degree in Urban Planning.  Worked in that field for a bit, but struggled to get a job without a masters.  Fortunately, I learned a lot of skills in my internship due to my boss, beyond just skills and knowledge in my field.  He made me learn as much as I could with Access, Excel, Word, Powerpoint and other programs and I became very proficient in everything.  

After my internship, I did some temp jobs for a while, where I tested very highly with software use and accounting (I don't know how) with the temp agency, so I was always placed in tech oriented jobs.  I worked at a university where as a glorified secretary, I was able to streamline their data collection for new applicants and target the sources of new applicants so that they could better focus their marketing efforts.  This all came from this conversation: 
""When prospective applicants enter the data from our website, how do you access that database file.""
 To which the school replied, 
""Can we do that?""  
I asked them if I could take the time to find out, they said yes, and about a week later, I took a process that had taken over a week to do, and pared it down to a couple hours.  
Previously, they would go through each record, one by one, and have someone enter it into an excel spreadsheet.   Then they would print the spreadsheet and type labels.  Once I could access the database file, I imported it into excel, did a mail merge, and printed the label.  I also wrote a manual on how to do it.  They were very impressed.  I have a lot of stories like this from my work history, but I have a hard time demonstrating it.  Anyway, I then worked for two months for the sales and marketing department of a large company, which was a crash course, for me, in sales and markets.  But I learned how to market so that we could make warm calls, instead of cold calls, and learned a lot of other things.  After that, I settled into software testing at an insurance company’s headquarters while I job hunted for something permanent.   While there I only increased my computer and tech skills.  

I was finally hired permanently by a fortune 500 company that had an excellent corporate structure a great management training program and they gave me the tools to be my own boss.  I did really well with that company, progressing through the ranks very quickly and earning a lot of awards.  A lot of what I owe my success to was being able to translate survey techniques, I learned while going to school as a planner, into marketing in my area to increase business.   Also applying some of the marketing that I learned while temping in the sales and marketing department.   I was able to generate corporate business at a level that raised the bar for the entire state.  I’m very good with people, too, so service calls and sales calls were very natural to me.  I do push back quite a bit with management, if I think my ideas are better, and that’s a personal flaw I’m working on.

Fast forward to now.  I left that company and have been teaching ESL for 6 years, abroad.  I really see myself as an expat, but not as a teacher.  I want to try to find something in the world that I can do that has a career path and is something I can do well with an organization that will benefit from my skills and my ability to problem solve, but I haven’t the slightest idea where to start.  I guess this is a problem I’m having a real hard time solving.  Any advice would be helpful.  I really hope that being out of the game for 6 years hasn’t made me unemployable.  




TL;DR B.A in Urban Planning, worked as a planner for a bit, then temped.  Have strong computer skills and a natural problem solver.  Worked at fortune 500 company for 4.5 years, then moved abroad to teach ESL for 6 years.  Want to stay expat, but don’t’ want to teach. Not sure what to do.

4awfpv,1,2016-03-17,Any tips for another struggling sophomore?,whoopswoebeme,PhysicsStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/PhysicsStudents/comments/4awfpv/any_tips_for_another_struggling_sophomore/,"I'm at a top 10 (5 in my honest opinion) university in the U.S. and for me, my physics core class grades are kind of shitty (A-,B-,B,B,C+). My peers are amazing but they're also insanely smart and great at taking tests... and I definitely didn't get in here because I was good at test-taking. 

I know I've got other things going for me (did three summers of astro research, working on an astro research project right now with potential for a first-author publication, hopefully moonlighting astro research this summer while doing a software engineering internship for a *big* company, teaching a Python+physics course next term) ... but basically, it doesn't seem like my grades will ever get better. 

I want to apply to grad school and get into a top 25 astro program, and I love computational astrophysics and astrophysics research... but no matter how good my research is, I feel like my grades will hold me back.

What should I do? Retake the class I got a C+ in next year? Stay with physics, maybe do a CS master's (my university has a co-terminal degree program), and then take a couple of years to research and then apply to grad school? Become a math major? (I'm pretty far along because I've needed to take a ton of math for physics, my grades would improve, and I'd still selectively take physics classes - mostly pass/fail, though.) Just go into software engineering as a shitty math major/physics major/maybe CS coterm? 

(Also, I'm on an external scholarship which frowns upon C range grades and is revoked if my GPA drops below 3.0... and only my physics classes put me anywhere near the red zone. Fuck going to every single lecture, taking notes before+after class, going to almost all office hours, getting pset buddies, etc. if my physics grades are still going to be shit...)"
4awnxt,15,2016-03-17,"25 years of self therapy is boiling over, I just need to figure out how to move forward.",7six5four3,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/4awnxt/25_years_of_self_therapy_is_boiling_over_i_just/,"Ok, so please bear with me as I try to make sense of my thoughts. My life has always been about pushing my issues aside to protect everyone else, so as a fair warning, this may effect people who have issues with rape, gender issues, depression, or suicidal tendencies. Also, I know that other subreddits like offmychest, trollx, and depression, and others tend to be pretty ""political"" or tumblr touchy. I'm not about that, I just need to let this out, so if this isn't the place, I'm sorry.  


From the surface, I am a privileged female from the US, who never had to beg for food or a bed. From the outside, I am a well adjusted, fairly successful, college grad, who has a fantastic social circle. Under that is a girl who cannot smile without it hurting. Who will not allow someone to touch her wrists, who tries to tell light hearted stories about her father, when in reality every memory is like a new touch of the branding iron. Who cannot form a true connection with another person without out fear of abandonment or utter betrayal. Who is broken, and cannot seek professional help, as they have only made her situations worse. 


I will try to keep this short, but I can't promise anything. I have battled issues from divorce, suicide of close friends, depression, self harm and suicide attempts, abandonment, overdoses, rape, you name it. My best friend and I, who also dealt with many monsters of her own, joked that the writers of teen drama shows used our lives as inspiration for shows like Degrassi and movies like Thirteen. I went to therapy (by force after a suicide attempt) in 8th grade, but she pointed fingers and decided that listening to what I had to say was irrelevant. She told my mother I was just spoiled so my mom never took my very real depression and anxiety issues seriously. This ""doctor"" made sure I was as isolated as possible during the most vulnerable time of my teenage years. 


To skip over high school and jump right into the major issues, I was drugged and raped by a coworker in my junior year of college during a company party. No one said a word, including myself, as I was 20 and didn't want my company to get shut down due to supplying alcohol to underage kids, and none of my ""friends"" backed me up. And that was it. I told my boss, but nothing really came of it aside from making sure he and I didn't work the same shifts. I always told myself I was fine. Compared to others, I was relatively unharmed. I would be ok, I have been through worse. I didn't shut down, I didn't break down. I forged through and acted like it was just a drunken night of mistakes. and life carried on. 


That summer, almost 4 years ago, my dad died from cancer and I found him. I found out his life, I found out one of the reasons why my parents divorced when I was three. He crossdressed, he lived a completely other life, and I only found out upon his death. I heard the paramedics laughing at the contents of his room, and I hate them. Their laughter during the worst hours of my life haunts my very soul. I think about it every day and boil over more hatred towards them. Who my dad was, or what he did does not change him, it does not change anything about the father I love, but it is not something I can openly share with my friends. I cannot come to terms with this realization with those who care about me, so I have not been able to think about it, or work it out.  I am a very open minded person, but the layers of acceptance that comes with a parent's death, a realization that they are not who you thought they were, and coming to terms with finding a parent dead are monumental steps that are not easy to overcome alone. 


My final semester of college, I went to the campus counseling center, and they told me they could not help me. My case was too complex, I would take too much time, too much time away from other students who needed assistance with basic coping skills of college stress. I was too much of a burden who was not able to receive free counseling.. BUT! BUT! they could refer me to people who I could pay hundreds of dollars and hour, whom I could not afford. I begged and pleaded, saying I couldn't pay for that, I didn't have the funds as I am paying for college myself and closing out my dad's estate, and paying for legal fees. I was at the end of my rope and drinking 3 bottles of wine a night, just to be able to finish my school work. I *couldn't cope* and I needed help, but the help I needed wasn't available. So, I took a week, bottled it all up, shut it all down, and graduated. I never mourned. 


I finished school, I got an internship, I moved away, and got a job with new friends in a new city who don't know me. But Here I am, 3 1/2 years later and the walls I built are breaking. I've made myself successful being alone, because being with people only brings questions, and questions break that wall. I am starting to face the fact that my rape has hurt me more than I would like to admit. I am taking realistic evaluations of my inability to be open to relationships, and realizing I know that is wrong. I need to let people in on a deeper level. I do not want to be alone forever. How do I move on? How can I open myself up to other people? I love myself, I have oodles of confidence knowing I can get through my past, but how do I let other people in? 


How does one move forward knowing that most people will end up hurting you? How do you decide who to share your demons with? How can you mourn a life you lived years ago and never had a chance to let go of? How does one who lived so well on their own trust enough to live with another? I just want to move forward, like I always have, but I know I can't do it alone anymore, but I have been conditioned that being alone is easier. How can I change that?

4axa7i,38,2016-03-18,I was adcted to confort and it was the cause to almost all of my problems,hatebacon,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/4axa7i/i_was_adcted_to_confort_and_it_was_the_cause_to/,"TL; DR: had a great life in Brazil but felt like I was very mediocre. Went to India to get out of the confort zone and realized that it was the confort that was making me mediocre by shifting me from what is really important in life. What makes me happy and motivated is not being confortable. It is my ability to conect with people and make a positive impact in their lives.

This is mostly a very personal rambling I wrote as a terapy. 


Some time ago I had a very confortable life back in Brazil. I had a confortable house at a confortable place, worked in a confortable job that allowed me to chill with my friends during work and had a great social and romantic life. 

But at the same time I felt desperate, like I was stuck in this mediocrity and would never live my dreams and become the person I wanted to be. My job, despite paying me enough to allow me to have a little independece didn't provide me with any professional growth or challenge and it wasn't near to what I wanted to do. Despite having great friends and a girlfriend I aways had a inferiority complex in the sence that I wasn't a good company, I wasn't fun enough, I was too shy and too boring to deserve their company. I was never motivated to improve myself, was aways procrastinating and had no passion in life. I was at the CONFORT ZONE and didn't know how to get out. And for some reason I thought that maybe all I needed to do was shake my life by having a completelly new start. 

I was looking for a new beggining and an opportunity to work in another country in a position that made me more valuable as a professional. Also I wanted a challenging place to help me getting out of the CONFORT ZONE. So I accepted an opportunitie to work in a big company in India as part of a professional internship.

Man did I regret this at first. The shock was bigger than I would have ever imagined. In India everything is a challenge. Crossing the streets, negociating with the cabs and getting them to understand you, using the toilets, finding decent food that won't make me sick, and most of all finding a place to live as a foreigner. 

So why did I do this? Why did I felt this need to getting out of the CONFORT ZONE. What the fuck is even that? Shoudn't we persue confort to be happy? Why did I leave this great life I had, spend so much money to basically live in a shitty place, so fucking hot and with a very stressfull and dificult job? I am such idiot. 

But then something happened. I adapted. I got used to living with less and realized how little I needed to live well. I realized how much the confort I had before made me take the life I had for granted and shifted me from what is really important in life: people. 

If it wans't for the people sharing this experience with me I would have come back in the first week. But one thing I realized is that no mather where you are most of the experience you have is the quality of your company. It is the conections you make with people, the shared stories and experiences and most of all your capacity to make a great impact in their lives.

Back in Brazil I didn't put an effort to change my life because I had a lot of great things to distract me from that. Videogames, Netflix, great food, parties,  confortable bed and so on. I felt empty because I was lost in all those things and didn't feel the need to put any effort in finding my place, because the place I had was very confortable. I was adcted to confort almost the same way an adct is to heavy drugs. It made unable to move on and depressed about how nothing changed. 

As I see most people are so focused on confort and getting a confortable easy life for themselfs that they loose the abity to look at the others. Why leave the apartment when I could stay home watching netflix and buying food online? 

Getting out of the CONFORT ZONE made me realize how all of that was just a distraction I made for myself to keep being mediocre and to feed my fear of change and commitment. Now I know what is really important and feel happier than ever and more motivated to be a better person and competente enough to change people's lives."

I am a Mathematics major looking for a software engineering internship for the summer. I've taken all the required lower division CS classes at my school and have completed electives in OS Concepts, Networking, and Database Systems. Most of my background is in low level sysadmin/ IT stuff and I wanted to move my career towards development. 

Recently I recieved an offer from this start-up, that does infastructure consultation, mostly in the realm of Linux data storage. I will be working on writing test cases for their continous integration platforms (among other things) and working on their monitoring program. Because of its small size, I'm going to be learn a lot and it's invaluable exprience. It's nice that they're in LA as opposed to the bay area because I'm stuck in LA with a lease than runs through the end of August. Also I get to work remotely one day of the week.

However the stickler is that the salary is at $2000 a month. That comes up to $12.50 for a 40 hour work week. Suffice to say, it's really low even for a start up in LA. I'm in no position to negotiate; companies I've applied to have gone radio silent or I was rejected after the first round interview. Being this late in the hiring season for summer interns, I feel like I don't have much of a choice.

I'd be happy at about $16 an hour. I'm not hurting for money and I am willing to forgo the privlige of working 1 day remotely for that increase. Is that too much to ask especially with no bargaining power?

I want to make this as concise as possible:

I was hired as an intern at 22.00 an hour doing IT work in June 2014 at my company. This was in Division A.

I was then hired full time in August 2015 at an annual salary of 62,000 as a ""level 1"" systems admin. This was in Division B.

I just applied and received an offer for an internal position doing IT security. I accepted the job at 73,000 and I am starting in April. This is a level 2 job and this is in Division C.

Now I am very happy with my growth in less than 2 years time, but something concerned me. I found out another intern, who currently works in Division C, just received an offer for a full time level 1 IT position at 65,000. (He's been here a year in May) However, he will just be doing mainly desktop IT work and only has his bachelors. I will be finishing my Masters in May. 

Should I ask for another raise once I receive my MS in computer science?
I feel like the difference in degree from a BS to MS, the difference in level from One to Two and the difference in responsibility from desktop IT to information security is worth more than 8,000 a year. Am I being unrealistic? I feel I should be at 80,000 annually given these factors. Please let me know what you guys think. Thank you for the input."

4axy00,17,2016-03-18,High School Senior Interested in InfoSec/NetSec,NargenPargen,AskNetsec,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskNetsec/comments/4axy00/high_school_senior_interested_in_infosecnetsec/,"tl;dr below

I'm currently a high school senior who's interested in the cybersecurity/networking field.  I've already received the Network+ and Security+ certifications, both of which I realize are fairly low in their overall difficulty, but it's a start.  I was accepted to Capitol Technology University (I'd love to hear some feedback on this school if anybody is/was enrolled here at some point), which from my understanding has a pretty fantastic cybersecurity program.  As of right now, it looks very possible that I will be receiving a full ride through the school.  In my interview for the scholarship, one of the professors was impressed and informed me that I would be able to potentially meet with an NSA representative that would be visiting the school on the 31st.  I guess my dream job would be to work with the NSA, a goal which I realize is fairly far-fetched, but if I were to get an internship as soon as freshman year, I believe I would be well on my way.  I recently started looking into Kali Linux and am preparing to set up a ""lab"" of sorts to practice and learn about penetration testing.  I was wondering if possibly anybody has any suggestions for what else I should be doing to help increase the odds of landing this internship.  Any help would be awesome, thanks (and sorry for the stupidly long post).

tl;dr
High school senior looking to go into the cybersecurity field.  Was offered a potential opportunity for an internship with the NSA as early as freshman year of college, suggestions/resources to help increase my chances of landing it would be greatly appreciated.

Edit
Thanks a lot for the replies everybody, I've got a boatload of new resources to help me prepare for things in the future and what not, and you've helped me to open my eyes to some potential flaws in my ""flawless"" life plan, so I'm going to have to ask around and get some other people's opinions on the matter.  I'm looking forward to becoming an active participant in the main sub sometime soon!"

4axz6j,5,2016-03-18,"Me [21 M] with my SO [22 F] of nearly 1 year, I can't seem to forget about my ex",PiggyMinaj,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4axz6j/me_21_m_with_my_so_22_f_of_nearly_1_year_i_cant/,"There's two stories in this: the relationship with my ex and the one with my current SO. They overlap in certain areas, so I'll give a little bit of context about both, and then get into the overlapping part.

I'll start with the ex.

My ex and I broke up last year in May, 2 days after I kissed my current girlfriend. We had been together for five years and a half, and had a great time together. In many ways she was perfect to me: she was calm, gave me inner peace, we could laugh together and loved being together, ... We always had a great time. 

But of course there were reasons we broke up: I never had the feeling I had the crazy student life I should've had. My ex did, but before me. I wanted to go out, have drinks, go dancing, just go crazy while stille student! So I tried to get her to tag along, but she never would. I didn't have (m)any friends to go crazy with either, so yeah.

Another reason why we broke up is that we didn't have sex for the last three years. She started having pain after 2 years into our relationship, and waited too long to try and fix this. We ended up going to a gynaeocologist, a sexologist, but neither worked. The pain remained, so we continued not having sex. For me, this started a process which eventually made me dislike her in multiple things. I got annoyed by the things she did (which, if I look back on them, were all sweet), and of course I wanted sex. It makes me feel deeply connected with my SO, like there's no greater feeling in the world than just me feeling her.

A couple of months after we broke up, in August, I was a coach at a soccer camp of the soccer team she participated at. I had a fun week playing with these kids, my friends (the other coaches) and talking with my ex. We didn't split up with a fight or anything, so it felt like we were just good friends.

After a few days into the camp, she told me she was dating a new guy. And I was happy for her!

I also still played futsal in the same team her brother plays too. So at times, she came to watch her brother and we talked a little after the games.
But in November, we talked about us, about what we had, and we both came to the conclusion we still had feelings for each other. We didn't do anything, didn't kiss or anything.

**First TL;DR:** Broke up with my ex after 5 years and a half. She was great, awesome in many aspects, but having no sex for the last 3 years and a half made started pushing me away and caused other problems. After our breakup, we still saw each other at mutual friends' events/soccer/futsal games and got along like good friends. One evening we talked and came to the conclusion we still had feelings for each other, but nothing happened.

Then there's my current girlfriend.

We were in the same class in grad school and became good friends. We were always the two persons making dirty jokes, and the only two laughing about them. At the time I thought she was very pretty, sweet, and kind of my dream girl. But I was in a relationship with my ex, so I saw her as a friend. Subconsciously, she was the perfect girl for me. But I never thought this way actively because I was with my ex.

Then one day, my group of friends and me decided we'd have a study day at my place. But one after another started cancelling because of various reasons. Getting there would take too much time, I need to focus and be alone, ... Eventually, only my current girlfriend (at the time kind of best female friend) was able to still come. I thought: 'sweet!', because we worked together pretty well and always had a fun time.

As that day progressed, we stumbled into a talk about our feelings. I told her that I wasn't happy in my relationship, and she wasn't in hers (she'd been together with a guy for nearly 2 years). I wanted to provide comfort (because that's the kind of friend I am), and offered her a hug. We hugged, and didn't let go. She repositioned herself and put her head on my shoulder, I started stroking her hair. We sat like that for a long time, with the hug increasingly becoming more intimate: I started caressing her neck, she tilted her head a bit more towards mine, ... We both decided this wasn't the time to do this - even though we both realised it was inevitable this was about to happen - and since the day was almost over, I offered driving her home. Because she still looked kind of sad, like she could use a real hug from a friend, on the way to her place I offered to stop somewhere and give her a hug, as I couldn't while driving. She agreed, and I stopped a little further down the road. Before I really knew what was happening, we kissed. We were both a little confused but pretty sure we wanted to continue this, so we broke up with our respective SO's the weekend following that friday.

And in the beginning, she was the perfect girl as I imagined and knew her: funny, sweet, full of energy, a hint of crazy (the good crazy), and she was in the mood for sex even more often than I am (my sex drive is insane; my perfect sex life would be 10-20 times per week). She made me fall in love every single day!

But as time progressed and I learned more and more about her, I discovered she had a... Well, pretty vivid past of ex boy-/girlfriends, and had borderline when she was in puberty. But who am I to judge about her past? It was before me and I have no business with the things that happened at the time.

After a couple of months into dating, we started arguing alot, about stupid things, but mostly about my ex too. Most of the time I felt like the thing we argued about wasn't a problem to me, but alas. I didn't really get why she was so worried about my ex either.


And this is where the stories collide.


During the period this arguing began, I was still seeing my ex at the futsal games I played. We only talked, nothing more. But as I still saw her as a good friend of mine, I told her about my issues in my current relationship. As I look back on it now that wasn't a good idea for numerous reasons, but at the time I didn't see any wrong in it. She told me her new relationship wasn't good either, that he yelled at her when they argued (which was pretty often) and some other things. 

My current girlfriend didn't know that my ex was still coming to watch these futsal games. I didn't tell her either, because I didn't think it was important. I was sure nothing was going to happen between me and my ex, and so me telling my current girlfriend would only make her worry about things she shouldn't worry about. Well, again, wrong thinking of me.

She eventually found out, and we had a massive fight because of that. Having these arguments before about my ex didn't really help, so eventually we broke up. 

I was devastated. I have never felt worse in my life. Day in, day out I cried on every possible occasion. I went to school, went completely silent to my friends (she didn't show up to class a couple of times), and from the moment I got home, I started crying until I fell asleep.

Again, stupid mistake of me, I told my ex about this. I really tought of her as a good friend and saw no wrong in telling her. The day after, she broke up with her boyfriend. Which made me realise all the things she said, trying to comfort me about arguments and all, was to win me back. It really as an eye opener: she had been sweet to me all this time after we broke up, hoping to get back together. I didn't want her. I only wanted my current girlfriend and felt like I would do anything for her, to see her happy, preferably with me.

A small fast forward in time, my current girlfriend and I talked everything out. She gets that my ex was a big part of my life, and I realised that hanging with ex'es is never a good idea. I told my ex the truth, about me cheating on her and everything else, and she was pretty clear in not wanting to get in contact with me anymore.

I felt bad about it because I still care about her, I genuinely do. But as a friend. I don't want a relationship with her again.


Anyhow, things have gotten better with me and my current girlfriend from then on. I've been trying my best to be a good boyfriend, my ex isn't a topic of discussion anymore, and apparently, my ex's been getting back together with her new boyfriend as well.


But lately, I've started noticing that I feel like there's something missing. My current girlfriend is great, but she changed comparing to the beginning of our relationship. At the beginning, she couldn't keep her hands at home and pretty much needed sex everyday (to give you an idea about how crazy she was about me), now there are a lot of weeks going by with 1 time sex, max.

Don't get me wrong, I absolutely don't think sex is the most important part of a relationship. I enjoy laying on the couch and watching Netflix together as much or even more, but I am not going to lie about it: I need it. Pretty frequently, preferably.


To get back on topic, I feel like my girlfriend is growing more distant. And it's driving me crazy because I don't know why it's like that. Is it me? Is she just stressed because of her internship (we're both trainees now, after this we graduate)? I don't know. 

My ideal relationship would be the one we had a couple of months in. I realise this is the 'honeymoon phase', but I don't really see why this should change if you really love someone? I mean, I really feel like I love her more and more everyday. You could pretty much say I'm addicted to her, and being with her is the best thing there is.

This all has gotten me back to thinking about my ex. About how it would've been if we got back together, how she is now... I think about her nearly every day. Not particularly in the way that I want to get back together with her, I just have a strange feeling of missing her in my life, I'm not sure in which role though.


Any advice from you guys, hints, tips, or general thoughts? I would love to hear the opinion of a complete outsider to this.


**Final TL;DR:** Girlfriend and I had an awesome start of our relationship, went through a rough patch because of my ex, and me not being completely honest (nothing happened). We sorted everything out and are back together now. I feel like she's growing more distant, and I would like for her to be as addicted to me as I am to her.

P.S. I'm sorry about the sh*tload of text. I just feel like context could be appreciated because I feel the situation isn't that common."

4aywrx,2,2016-03-18,What would you do to get a foot in the door with my odd background?,fancyfuture,graphic_design,https://www.reddit.com/r/graphic_design/comments/4aywrx/what_would_you_do_to_get_a_foot_in_the_door_with/,"Hi designers,

I'm 33, I studied photography in school.  I wanted to become a portrait photographer (oh, youth), so I took a job as an Executive Assistant in advertising to pay the bills.  That was ten years ago.  Up until last year (I saved up and took a year off to regain my sanity) I was still an Executive Assistant who shot on the side.  Currently I'm an unemployed person who works at a coffee shop and shoots as much as possible when the jobs come in.  I've been a moderately successful photographer, but my motivation to shoot full-time has diminished (I'm old, it's a struggle, doing it for-hire is of course not like it was when I was a college kid shooting for fun.  Duh.  Life has basically smacked me upside the head on that one.)  But my desire to take my considerable photoshop knowledge and turn it into a career in the design world has grown.  I've been contemplating my next possible move and graphic design has crept to the top of the list.  

To be honest it's always been on my radar--I was doing it for fun (and for free) as an assistant at one of the agencies where I worked, but of course when it came time to hire a junior they went with the kid from art school with the awesome portfolio.

Here's what I have been doing for the past 6 months:  Taking free classes online (trying to get the funds to take actual classes as well), and working one-on-one with a friend in the field who is tutoring me in exchange for dinner once a month.  Reading books, applying to every junior job and internship I can possibly find. I'm willing to start small and work hard.  I'm willing to be a 34 year old intern.  I'd be psyched to be one, actually.

But nothing has worked.  When I do hear back, it's that my background ""isn't the best fit"", often followed by ""but would you be interested in a role as an Executive Assistant?""

Basically I've been boxed into the assistant role and because I've never worked professionally as a graphic designer, no one will hire me or even bring me on to work and learn for free.  I'm competing with the art school kids for these internships anyway so I feel completely fossilized and out of the running before I even enter.

How can I stand out among the millions of amazing portfolios coming from younger people? How can I even get an interview?  Can my background be used to my advantage somehow in the design world?

Thanks in advance for any insight on this one.  I feel totally stuck and like I'm destined for a life standing on the outside looking in.

4ayyfy,8,2016-03-18,Going through a break-up and it's hard not to look at my relationship's failure from a TRP perspective,laughingmatters,exredpill,https://www.reddit.com/r/exredpill/comments/4ayyfy/going_through_a_breakup_and_its_hard_not_to_look/,"We're both 25 and have been together for the last five years. She's very successful in her field, I'm not. I moved to NY to be with her because she wanted me to, and ended up working two minimum wage full time jobs while she was studying with a scholarship. I was saving up to go to school. Still I felt she was disappointed in me, we were living in different worlds. I was feeling resentful and that's how I ended up spending a lot of time reading TRP.

Since the beginning of the relationship I gave her too much credit. She had no problem in being angry at me or calling me on my bullshit, but would get extremely defensive/aggressive whenever I tried to do the same. I didn't have the balls to just ignore her and do what I wanted to. This happened constantly, in both small matters and big decisions.

Then she cheated on me with a older and more successful guy, and the story comes straight out of TRP hand book. One night she got home super late and super drunk and I knew something was up. She had been hanging out with ""young professionals"" in downtown Manhattan and admitted to having been blindsided by their ""lifestyle"". She even told me she hated the guy and that he was arrogant. It was just a kiss, his ex was there and got mad and prevented her from making an even bigger mistake. But still, it felt like I was watching the movie from a book I had already read. I worried that it might be confirmation bias, that it was me that was watching the events from a TRP perspective.

We almost broke up but didn't. We went to couples therapy. It came out that she needed ""a rock"" to support her, and my anxiety made me not that. In my mind I'm like ""so what she's saying is that she needs a 'real man'"". TRP again.

Now I landed a good internship in my field. I'll be starting in the summer, but she finishes school before. I wanted us to spend another year in NY so that for a while my career could take center in the relationship. She's applying to jobs all over the world and said she would only stay if she found a worthwhile job. I was completely devastated to see she isn't willing to compromise to make things work for both of us. I was going crazy. Keep in mind that while all of this was going on, she kept telling me she loved me and would deny or downplay our problems.

I was starting to hate her. So last week I told her again how I feel but this time I was considering breaking up for real. We were apart for a week. She didn't want to spend time apart and accused me of not loving her but I knew it had to be done. Now she tells me she loves me but realizes that she values her career over the relationship and feels like a monster but doesn't want to lead me on. I was willing to forgive her everything if things were to go differently from now on. But it looks like it's not going to happen.

TRP thinking is really hard to counter right now. I wish that from the start I didn't gave a fuck about what she thought and was able to just go with my gut. There are more details that I'm not going to get into because this post is already long enough, but I knew things were bad for a year and a half but she would always lie to me and maybe herself. And it's really hard to not feel like if I was more of a man she wouldn't be trading me for her career. I know that if I could be ""her rock"" she wouldn't be doing what she's doing and would be willing to compromise for me. We still love each other.

Moving on right now isn't that hard because I was hurting so much for a year that even though I'm sad I'm also relieved. It just sucks having to admit that we failed because everybody (including myself) looked to us as that couple that would be together forever. I'm worried that this experience is going to make it hard for me to trust again. Right now all I want to do is to sleep with a lot of women to get over this. Deep down I want to become ""Chad"". I'm not that guy, I always wanted a family. But right now I feel like I need to prove my masculinity to myself. What would be a healthier way to look at this experience that could enable me to have better relationships in the future?"

As a comp sci student and aspiring developer it seems like there's a never ending litany of technologies and frameworks to learn and keep up-to-date with. It can be pretty intimidating, not to mention confusing, to the point of at times being somewhat discouraging. 

I've never backed down from a challenge, so I'm not looking for encouragement. I love what I'm doing and I'll never stop. Academically I'm doing quite well in my program, which uses Java as it's teaching language, but where does one even begin?

So far the only thing I've been doing are exercises from my data structures book from last semester and the occasional challenge on /r/dailyprogrammer. What should I focus on to get to where I can produce github worthy projects to show off for internships and whatnot? 

I have a lot of people ask me about doing websites/web apps, one of them is a commercial helicopter and quad copter pilot who does aerial film and photography and wants to do a multimedia site to showcase and market his footage, which is some serious, no kidding, national geographic quality film, so I feel like if I did a good job on that project it could be pretty lucrative for us both. Just throwing that out there because I want to tie things in to as much ""real world"" stuff as possible and the possibility to make ""real dollars"" is what I'll usually gravitate towards working on.

I've been to the interviews and did pretty well and eventually got an offer, and to be honest it was my favorite company to work in by far out of all the ones I've had interviews in. 

Fast forward to today, where I have my induction meeting prior to starting on Monday. At this point i havent received any contract or schedule yet so i believed that i would work 5-10hours a week, and once summer starts i could work full time as needed.
Today, in my induction meeting i discovered that this is not infact a summer internship which is what i applied for, but it is in fact an internship over the following 3 months during which i have university. In the next 2months I am also expecting 6 assignments which will massively influence my grade, and in the 3rd month i will have final year exams. Throughout the internship i am expected to work around 25-30 hours per week.

I am planning to inform him that i cannot possibly work more than 15hours a week, but even that seems like a risk. Has anyone been in this situation? Did you cope with internships and lectures and projects at the same time?

This is currently my fifth year, and I still have one more year to go (switched majors/couldn't focus on full course load). Some of you may retort that I may not be cut out for school, but ever since I have been going to therapy and taking my medication, my grades have improved (4.0 this year) and I am able to take a full course load. The majority of my courses that I am taking this year are the most difficult courses I've ever taken (upper year stats/math/econ) so my recent success is not the result of bird courses.

I have a great GRE score and I have even completed the CFA I to signal interest (I know it's not necessary) so I'm not an unintelligent person. I also started a student organization from scratch, and it is now one of the most successful student run conferences in Canada. So ambition, motivation and working in a stressful environment is not a problem for me.  

Here's my dilemma: 

1. Despite an uptrend, my transcript is a mess. I think it is unlikely they will take a chance on someone like me. I will be eliminated before I even get an interview for an entry level analyst position or internship. Is this accurate thinking?

2. Because of program limits, I will be graduating with a psychology major, with minors in econ and stats. However, the majority of my courses are in mathematics, mathematical statistics/finance and economics. I was thinking about going to graduate school, but I'm not sure how well that will translate to finance. I'm also not sure if I am even a good candidate for a good school. 

3. I can explain why I used to be so shitty at school, but I doubt recruiters care. They have a dozen other kids who have less baggage. 

4. I asked my school's career counselor but they seem to be out of touch with today's job market. Firms might not have cared about GPA in the past, but a vast majority of them use it as a screening tool today. 

What would you suggest? I am in a precarious and fragile stage in my life, so I must handle this with the utmost care and urgency. 

TL;DR

-Got shitty grades, couldn't complete courses because of an undiagnosed health problem. 

-Got good grades once treated and medicated.

-What are my options to make myself more competitive? "

As this is my first real time moving out of the city (I live in Vancouver), I hope you guys could help answer some questions:

Are there any do/donts when it comes to finding apartments?

Would you guys suggest I come to Toronto, rent a Air-BnB, and then look for an apartment with June leases? Or would all the good ones be gone by then??

What property management places should I avoid in that area? I heard carprit is pretty bad, so I have outed that from my searches.

Thanks for your input! I appreciate it"

Like some, I was recently accepted into the MIT class of 2020! I have a few questions but first a quick background to you help understand my situation. 

I've generally considered myself to be a smart kid, but never on the level of students that apply to the sort of schools like MIT. I applied on a whim and was of course extremely excited when I was accepted, but also very nervous. My school is an arts school and not known for having a very challenging academic environment. Now for the questions...


1. I am definitely expecting to work hard and I know that it will not be easy, but just how rigorous is the curriculum? I want to be challenged, but at the same time I want to enjoy my time in college. I intend to study computer science, so hopefully someone knowledgable about this field can help answer this question. 

2. And for my second question. I've read online that some students from MIT opt to take a gap year. I would love if someone could offer insight into the pros and cons of this path? Also, I wouldn't want to take a gap year to just stay at home. If possible, I would like to get an internship or participate in some sort of program. Does MIT have any partnerships for situations like that?

Thanks for any replies I get! I'm looking forward to visiting the campus and learning more about the school during CPW."
4b07a7,1,2016-03-18,"Me [29 F] with my bosses [37F / 48F] 8 months, are miscommunication and things are 50/50 great and terrible.",VeronicaSawyer89,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4b07a7/me_29_f_with_my_bosses_37f_48f_8_months_are/,"I have always had a hard time communicating clearly. I don't always use the correct words when speaking casually or in conversation. I also give away my true feelings on my face and they keep using one or two instances of that to justify or explain that sometimes it's not my words that are conveying a message. Which I understand but I control it a lot, especially when I want to.

Here's what's happening: 

My direct supervisor is also very blunt. She sounds negative a lot in my opinion. The way she says ""No, uh huh"" makes me feel like an abused puppy. I try to keep in mind that she doesn't mean it that way most of the time. It sounds like she thinks her way is the only way and that she's always right about her opinions and her processes. I do really like her. She hired me after I was her intern and I really did learn a lot from her. Sometimes, I try and think ""What would she do or say?"" and base my reactions on that. 

I've misspoken a lot here for some reason. Maybe lack of confidence stemming from stress withing the organization.  I also have worked in other professional environments.

""I'm well aware that the way she operates, the way I operate, and the way this organization that we're both new to operates, is all subjective and different.""* 

*See that previous statement made no sense. When I re-read it I realized I wanted to say ""I'm aware that we can all operate differently as individuals and we are new to this organization and the way it operates, too."" This is a brilliant example of how I do not clearly communicate. 

Now, her bosses boss, has told her 2 or 3 times that I've done something ""wrong"". Most recently, we had a meeting with someone who's helped with an event for a few years. We have no records of this event from our internal side. We don't have a lot of records for many of the things that my job involves. It is INCREDIBLY FRUSTRATING and I keep getting put on the back burner. I was hired to do a job. I'd like to feel like I get up at 6:30 A.M. everyday because I have a job to do. Lately, I feel like I have to get here to basically find things to do or wait on other people to be able to move forward.  

After the meeting, one of the people I met with told my bosses boss [37F], that I seemed negative about the event. I have no idea why she thought that. I thanked her for helping, mentioned that we didn't have a lot of records so we have to work hard to get the things we had last year, etc. It's called being honest and it's also called communication. I didn't think anything I said was discouraging and I don't understand why my bosses boss wouldn't have defended me and maybe offered up that this is stressful and maybe she mistook my anxiety and stress as negativity. 

The other person in our meeting however, mentioned several negative aspects and said he joined the committee to make some changes. I thought I did a good job of steering the conversation to a productive place and offering solutions rather than jump on the bandwagon with him of ABSOLUTE TRUTHS. 


My boss warned me before she told me said that she knew I would be mad. I wasn't mad. I was hurt because I hate being misunderstood. She said she doesn't want me to be fake or lie.  Just to be careful. This event is hanging by a thread. I think I do have to be fake when talking about this with outside people but not those that have invested in making it great. They need honesty and to know where we need help. 

I will admit I need to be more careful sometimes. We all make mistakes. I would never say I don't. I don't want to be emotional or take it personally...but I wish that they wouldn't either. Maybe this persons perceptions of what I said came from her insecurity of her portion of the event being difficult to pull off. 

The committee member mentioned specifically how hard two or three aspects of it were herself and I simply offered solutions. ""I will have to be sure to contact that person so that we can stay on top of it"" and ""I was told that we didn't use that equipment in the past because it wasn't regulation height for what we're doing."" I hardly spoke. I asked open ended questions. I thanked them endlessly. I used facts.

I am trying to love my job. Right now I feel like nothing I'm doing is important until everyone expects it to just be done. My options are (a) work through it and just hope that my 2nd year here will be easier because I've done it all once before or (b) to look for a job. I really don't want to be here less than a year.  I generally love the industry I'm in. I could use some coaching and personal development stuff. My boss doesn't provide nearly enough insight yet expects me to remember and retain aspects of things we only briefly talked about. I'm 29 but I'm still young and have worked in totally different places than this before. I'm also usually higher up in rank, too.

UGh. So. How do I change things about my personality that have never been an issue before to accomplish the goal of staying where I am, being more effective at communicating, and changing their perception that they seem to have built? How do I put aside emotional aspects to get the job done when personal criticism comes up which is personal and emotional? I can't just have a talk with them because this is an internal issue I need to fix about myself. I need to be confident and clear so that they don't have the chance to criticize and would be more likely to defend me. 

I know that I mentioned the issues with each of them. That's because it's adding to the stress of not feeling like we're on the same page. I feel like I over look their attitude and personality issues (one has more employee complaints that you could imagine, one also awkwardly communicates and doesn't provide enough direction) and process their words, actions, and requests. 

There is tension right now. Our organization has had some issues with employees and there are some major priorities that have nothing to do with my job. I also don't know how to continue to do my job when they have priorities everywhere else but I need them to make decisions. I get a frustrated sign when I bring up something I need. I can't just say well, there was nothing I could do because you were always way too busy to answer me. I have to work hard to make sure that I get my work done anyway.
   
**tl;dr**: I have a problem communicating and have been perceived as negative by some people associated with our organization. How do I approach changing and conquering this challenge?"

I'm beyond stoked and can't wait to get going - the training program is incredibly comprehensive and the supervisors have been so helpful and communicative. I've been dying to get some clinical experience with adults - I'm currently a behavior therapist working with really young kids on the spectrum - and want to spend this spring/summer preparing and compiling resources (inventories, exercises, etc) so I can hit the ground running! 

I would love to hear what books (or other media) have been useful in your practice, as well as any tips or advice you clinical SWers have to offer! I'm finishing the DBT Skills Workbook now and just ordered The Gift of Therapy, which I hear is amazing! What else should I familiarize myself with?

Thanks so much!

ok so this gonna be a long story and english is not my native language so please bear with me its worthy i promise

a few years back i got accepted in a really nice college in my country unfortunately this specific campus focus on geek stuff like IT and robotics
 
i got warned by a few friends not to get in that campus because it has very few girls and the time for social life is 0


at the time i thought to myself ""well that sucks but it cant be that bad ... right now i should focus on my future"" and as logical as it may seems i would come to regret it.

on my second year i was as bored and disappointed as i could be and seriously thinking about changing areas but honestly nothing better came to mind 
and the tough that i was giving up too soon came to mind so i decided to push forward and finish it.


then something unusual happened ... i met i girl xD, by now i knew all the girls in my course(all 5 or 6 of them and all have bf XDD) 
this one was 2 years younger than me i had seen her before but never looked twice as i barely cross her way, but i eventually got to meet her trough one of her friends and this is where everything really starts.

after a closer look i realized she was imo a solid 6/10 ... but her smile and curly hair ... my god were perfect, made her sooooo cute and really really sexy

it didn't take long for me to get the conversation started, she happened to be a really nice and polite girl but then as i got to know her better she quite simply blew my mind away, we had simillar taste in music series songs anime(yes a girl that likes anime XD alot actually) and in general topics...

we could spend hours talking to each other usually on skype after classes by then even though im not the best looking guy i guess im average, a thought came to my mind ""this is the kinda girl im NOT gonna let slip away no matter what"" cheesy yes but true


i knew it was not gonna be easy but she was so worth the effort...
first i needed to know if she had a boyfriend, which wasn't too hard, its really easy to talk to her so i casually asked her and to my surprise she said no with the cutest smile

** imHooked.jpeg ** ** imGonnaMarryThisGirl.gif **

our conversations went really well but for some reason unknown to me she always seem to keep some distance emotionally speaking but we seemed really compatible thou so i though well shit given she does not have a bf maybe she does not find me attractive or something like that
 
a year passes, everything is the same and this was driving me completely insane, i don't think im that bad looking and i just had to understand what was going on
so last year before christmas break i gathered all the balls i have and talked to her about it personally.
it was way way harder than i thought, suddenly word coming out of my mouth stopped making sense and i knew i had fucked up XD


yet she was really nice about it, she told me that she already knew that a liked her and didn't want to distance herself but we were **just** friends (which i kinda already knew but didn't understand)...

despite that things didn't got as awkward as i expected still when i got home i was feeling really bad about it so i went to skype to apologize for the talk not being as smooth as i had intended
and in the eventuality she already had a boyfriend (which would make sense)
this was her answer:


&gt;*no i don't have a bf, but that shouldn't get your hopes high, you know that, right?* 
&gt; 
&gt; cause i don't feel that way and im just not interested.
&gt; 
&gt; im not trying to be insensitive or rude, i really am not, but i don't want things to get awkward between us tbh,
&gt; but for that im hoping you wont bring this subject up again.
&gt; 
&gt; because it makes me uncomfortable when i don't know what to say in these situations, after i already said 'no'.
&gt; im not pissed, and i don't actually think you were gonna keep mentioning this subject, and that you just wanted to finish what you had to say,
&gt; but i just wanted to make sure, alright?
&gt; 
&gt; and im not gonna distance my self unless you think is best 
&gt; 
&gt; *so, we're cool, yes?*


needless to say this broke me in half and then lit me ablaze, but i felt i had no reason to be pissed with her after all
she was awesome as always and distance myself not only would be impossible cause we share classes, it would be awfully awkward for us both lets just say i had a very sad christmas break and silent(we didn't talk during that period)

then classes started and is as if it had never happened in fact now that we had discussed the problem she seemed more comfortable around me and more conversational
and i thought to myself that everything was going to be fine (given what happened it could be way worse)(better too..) now i can finally forget about it..


or so i tough ......

no matter how much i tried i could not forget her, she is in my head from the moment i wake up to the moment i go to bed tbh in my mind it doesn't make sense that i got to meet someone like her just so i could helplessly see her slip away, i mean what kind of sick joke is that ?!

and with 0 time for social activities and no available girls around its really hard to move on not that i don't try by concentrating in finishing my degree
but god i F*** hate it, im with a huge depression and thinking about her is the only thing that sheers me up despite everything so if i don't talk to her 
at least once a week i start to feel awful.

moving to a few weeks back there was a convention in my uni about future companies that may want to offer us summer internships and maybe a job
i was just passing by and surprisingly saw her there, and ofc like a metal to a magnet i just had to speak to her ...
it turns out that as if i don't identify myself with her enough she too is having serious doubts about the future after graduation 

her parents are having trouble paying her college fees and rent as she's from a city in the north of the country and right now she's living in a rented house near 
the campus and she thinking going back home maybe get a job and few years later maybe get her masters degree

this was the moment i realized this may very well be that last months i get to ""be"" with her and i honestly don't know how am i gonna handle the fact of not seeing her again

im trying to convince her to do the masters now but i cant even convince myself and mainly so i can delay the inevitable ..

now what ?





   
**tl;dr**: in a sausage fest of a college i met the girl i could spend the rest of the days with ... but nope not in her plans, now im seriously concerns about my future and sanity, help ?"
4b0v6x,1,2016-03-18,Accounting Major advice and questions. (Searched and didn't see these particular),themoviehero,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/4b0v6x/accounting_major_advice_and_questions_searched/,"Hey all, a little background. I'm 25, and have a BA in English (I initially wanted to be an editor). When I graduated, I had experience working on Computers, so when I graduated I got a job doing tech support somehow, it pays about what an Editor would make, so I have stayed due to lack of jobs in my area for editing. My job is willing to pay for me to go back to school to get another degree, and I've been mulling over accounting, and computer science, two radically different fields I know. Computer science since I do love working with computers, but the coding aspect worries me a bit, but that's neither here nor there for this. I've been thinking of accounting as well, since, while I was bad at math in my later high school years, I buckled down in those classes and did do well once it clicked for me, so while it takes me a while once I get it I love the flow of it. I like budgeting and organizing the numbers, and really I just want to get away from a customer facing environment. I know a lot of accounting fields work with customers, but i work with customers non stop without a breath for 10 hours straight, aside from lunch and breaks, and I really want a job where I can work in an office setting, working on a task for long hours instead. My questions really, are is your job in the accounting field very customer facing? Are there jobs in your experience where you don't work with customers most of the time? I'm avery sociable person, and nailed every job interview I've ever had, and get offers to move up and to different departments often, so It's not like I'm an introvert, I just don't like people literally screaming at me all day because they got a virus from downloading a movie, ect, and I want a more professional setting. Also, how is the pay for an accounting major? I assume it will be more than I have now for certain, which is with my student loans, a little over break even, I live comfortable, but don't splurge often. I know that one is a more personal question of course. I've been thinking it school wise on Accounting more, since I would only need two years to get my BA, then 1 year for my MA and hopefully the CPA in my state(thanks to my BA in English). CS BA would be about three years, due to the labs, four if I want internships. I know the pay is better in CS, but I've been reading it's a stressful job all the time, and while Accounting I'm sure is stressful, I do not believe it is stressful non-stop, maybe during tax and audits and such(please correct me if I'm wrong). Thanks for reading, I know this is long winded, I'm just trying to make sound decisions for my future and looking for any and all advice. Thanks!"

4b0x8a,23,2016-03-18,I humiliated myself at my internship today,wastingthedawn,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/4b0x8a/i_humiliated_myself_at_my_internship_today/,"So for the sake of anonymity I'll just say I'm going into a career that involves working with animals sometimes. I've been doing OK at my internship so far. I applied for a job there and everything seemed to be going well. Well, today I'm holding a cat while someone does a procedure on it. The procedure concludes and I go to put the animal back into its cage and it bites me really hard. I'm still holding onto it and everyone is telling me to let go but I'm kind of in shock. I eventually drop the cat and tend to my bite wound. Everyone is yelling at me and saying I need to learn to deal with cats and getting bit is part of the job. 

Now, let me rewind here for a moment. Working with animals has always been my dream. I didn't come from a wealthy family so school was out of reach for me until last year, at age 26. The only thing I've ever really felt good at is working with animals. It's the only thing that makes me happy.

So everyone is yelling and I look up and one of the people I work with mouths to me ""it's OK it's not your fault"" and for some reason I fucking lose it and start sobbing. Everyone around me thinks I'm crying because of the bite and they start saying things like ""if you're gonna cry over this you're not gonna make it in this field"" etc. I'm really crying because of the years of struggle leading up to this have culminated in getting bit by a fucking cat and then getting yelled at for it. And im constantly fucking getting yelled at here.  I'm embarrassed because everyone's like ""it's not even that bad, what's wrong with you?"" 

So long story short, I go up to my manager, literally weeping, and tell them that I need to go to urgent care because of this bite. My manager looks at me like I am an ignorant child and tells me to go. On my way out of the building, everyone is staring at me. I feel like a bullied high school kid. I mumble/weep that it's not the bite I'm upset about, it's that I can't do anything right.

I don't even know how im going to face my co-workers tomorrow. I'm truly humiliated. I don't even know what I'm asking for, really. Comfort? Some sort of reassurance that everyone isn't going to look down on me forever?"

&amp;nbsp;  
I've (21F) been interning at my dream job for two months now. I got to pick between the morning and afternoon shifts and picked the latter specifically because I hit it off with the team. One of the guys (M, he's about 25) has been there for a few years and helped me inumerous times when I had questions or wanted to learn something new. He's not my boss but was someone I looked up to for guidance since my actual boss is very busy. Another one of my coworkers (C) happened to be a high school friend, so I started hanging out with him and our other coworkers more and more. People, including M and my boss, like to joke around that me and C are a couple but all of us laught it off. C has been a friend for years and will stay that way.   
&amp;nbsp;  
M is very introverted but I made sure to make him feel included by inviting him to outings and taking interest in his life. We weren't the type of friends to talk much outside of work hours, but I felt we were in very good terms. Just not as good as C and the other people, who are basicaly who I hang out with all the time now (they're awesome). I'd heard rumours that M was very jealous of another intern last year, but she still works there and they seem to get along great, so I quickly put that out of my mind as the weeks went by.   
&amp;nbsp;  
M is the type of person who has an opinion on ANYTHING, and that started to get on my nerves a bit. It's almost like he wants to disagree with people over small details. But I thought, oh well, everyone has their flaws. He also constantly puts himself down, calling himself ugly, unloveable, constantly friendzoned. That started to raise a few flags.  
&amp;nbsp;  
Our bosses are married, and the husband-boss left for a week-long work trip, reducing the afternoon team. I offered to work extra hours (which I don't even get paid for) because I didn't want to leave M alone with a bunch of responsabilities and also because I would get tons of experience. My boss agreed, M was thrilled and everything was going just peachy.  
&amp;nbsp;  
One afternoon, M and I were discussing a delicate news piece (we're journalists). I had a story about an arrest which required very careful wording. We decided on a title together, he sent it to me via e-mail (which is not a common practice, we usually just IM each other) and I left for the day, leaving him and our night editor.  
&amp;nbsp;  
I woke up the next morning to a different title in my story - one I felt was wrong. I was bothered that they had changed it without telling me. I know I'm just an intern, but it's my name in the piece and I didn't want any trouble. I sat down with him and wife-boss and started the conversation with ""I have doubts about the title"".  
&amp;nbsp;  
I voiced my concerns, wife-boss agreed with me but said there wasn't a point in changing it now. Our legal department didn't see a problem with it. M got angry and said it was 'basically' the same title he had e-mailed me, and that I should've said something the day before and not bring it up now. I wasn't even sure whether it was him or our night editor (who is SUPPOSED to edit my stories) that had changed it. I simply said I saw a difference and felt it was worded wrong, but that my doubts were answered and to me, that was the end of the discussion. I wasn't trying to screw him by accusing him of changing the title, especially because we weren't in trouble for it.  
&amp;nbsp;  
M started ignoring me in the office. He didn't greet me, or said goodbye, or answered any of my questions. He began to act like I wasn't even there. Ignoring every single world I said, whether it was to help him or not. I was appalled by his childishness, but tried to wait it out.  
&amp;nbsp;  
Husband-boss got back from vacation and let me know M had ""texted him about the fight"". I was like, WHAT FIGHT? Remember wife-boss was on my side when it happened. She explained the whole situation and husband-boss agreed it wasn't much of an argument. But the childish act went on and on, people started to notice, and my boss finally sat down with me one on one.  
&amp;nbsp;  
He said he was sure this wasn't a professional issue but a personal one. He said he knew M is very sensitive and, while saying he had no right to ask about my personal life, asked me if something had happened between us, like I had rejected him in some way. He agreed M was being extremely childish and asked me if I wanted to change shifts to avoid him. I repeated that I didn't fight with anyone and if M wanted me to switch, I would be willing to. My boss replied M is not in his right to require that change, and reminded me once again that M is not my boss.  
&amp;nbsp;  
I was relieved my boss understood that what was going on went deeper than the disgreement over the title. I knew right there and then that any type of childish behavior would reflect badly on M and I just had to keep doing my work. Meanwhile, my friends are sure M is very jealous I made a solid group of friends.  
&amp;nbsp;  
Thing is, M has a lot of dirt on my boss. He very famously has a folder on his e-mail with every slightly incriminating thing out boss has ever done. My boss is very political, likes to calculate his moves and knows he NEEDS M. And I'm beginning to feel I'm going to be the one screwed in all of this. After all, I've only been there for two months and am just an intern.  
&amp;nbsp;  
I have no idea what to do, so I thought I'd come here. M won't look or talk to me, and I'm honestly PISSED that this guy is treating me like shit over nothing. Please help?"

I would have to pay a $700 program fee and I would also be working unpaid and have to find my own housing, but let's say for now the finances aren't as big a factor in the decision as I may be able to get financial aid. 

My other option is staying in my college town for the summer on my own, take some courses for my major which I need to graduate on time (it is not extremely important that I graduate on time, as I am paying very low rates for university, but might be a bit nicer), and most importantly learn new programming languages and work on personal coding projects. These projects look great on a CS job application, and I feel it is my best bet since I was unable to land an internship this summer. 

I have been leaning towards the latter since it seems like it would help me more in the long run, but some family members have advised me that travel is hard once I get older and I should travel as much as possible while I'm still young and in college (and I do love travel!). I figured I'll almost never get an opportunity like this again and am hesitant to turn it down yet I am conflicted but hey, that's why I'm here.

My acceptance of the intern abroad program is due tonight, so basically I have just a few hours left to make this decision. Help me out, reddit!

4b1b52,2,2016-03-18,Is this something I shouldn't be doing?,Confused_CE_Freshman,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4b1b52/is_this_something_i_shouldnt_be_doing/,"Sorry if this kind of post doesn't belong here, it's not exactly like the other questions.

I'm currently a computer engineering freshman at a pretty decent engineering/cs school, and midway through my second semester. I took introductory electrical engineering last semester (pretty much useless, learned the absolute basic of control systems and a little Matlab), and am taking the second OOP Java class this semester (tested out of the first one via AP credits), which isn't too bad, just takes a while to really understand the concepts.  

When I first decided to go into CE, I had the dream that I'm pretty sure a lot of CS/CE majors have: intern at some small company/government during underclassmen years, move up to some bigger companies, then move to the west coast after college and live comfortably while working at a startup or at Microsoft/Google/FB/etc. 

The problem is, I am just so lost with regards to my chosen path right now. I currently have essentially no professional experience in coding (the only experience I have are the projects that we do during class and a couple hackathons I went to where I just programmed the most basic things - essentially dead weight), and to gain some experience I am actively applying to internships around me, but haven't gotten any offers yet and am pretty sure I won't get any due to my lack of experience. I have plenty of friends around me that are also CE/CS, but they have a ton of experience (some of them already interned at Microsoft after freshman year, or know a bunch of complicated stuff using Java/Python/C that I have absolutely no clue what it is), and most have already received internship offers. As a result, I can't help but feel like I'm so far behind my peers and am already starting my career with a disadvantage.

I also have no clue as to how much more ""basic"" stuff (iterator/comparator, generic classes, etc.) I would need to learn before I can actually apply that knowledge in actually programming something, for example at the most recent hackathon my teammates were coding something with packets and TCP or something and I'm over here coding for loops and writing things to a text file...

I was also told by upperclassman CE majors that there aren't exactly jobs that are made for CEs, but rather CS-focused or EE-focused jobs, and CEs have the skillset to do either one. However, wouldn't that be counterintuitive, since a CS recruiter would go for the CS major rather than the CE, and the same for an EE recruiter for an EE job? 

At this point, I'm not sure if I should switch from CE to EE &amp; CS minor, or if I even want to stay in this career. Before college I didn't really have a major that I really wanted to do, but I wasn't bad at coding in high school and it was fun when my code worked, plus I liked playing with Arduinos so I chose CE.

Sorry for rambling, but my thoughts are just so jumbled right now and I have no idea how to progress from here. I guess the tl;dr version in questions are these:

* Is a CE career even worth pursuing if my heart isn't in it 100%?
* Does having a CE major put you at a disadvantage when compared with CS or EE majors for jobs?
* How would someone with essentially no experience get experience, especially with the fierce competition?

Any help would be appreciated, I'd just really like to hear some other opinions on my current situation."

However, the amount of coding I've done was in High School. In High School, I took a Visual Communications class, which went over the basics of stuff like HTML and CSS.

And what kind of 4 year degree should I get to be a Web Developer? (And yes, I know you don't technically need to have a 4 year degree, but it helps (as well as an internship) to help you become more employable) So please, answer my question legitimately.

They want me to rewrite the back-end of their mobile application from as the sole developer of their company to scale with their userbase. 

The original application was outsourced by the founders of the start up. But now they are looking for an intern to rewrite their application to scale up.

Problem is, I am their only developer. And will be likely working 40+ hours week. I'm worried that without a more senior developer to guide me, I could completely fuck up this opportunity. 

That being said they do have a tech mentor, but I likely won't meet him every often. And I don't have much experience yet (1 internship at a small local company where I wrote unit tests, and did a little bit of web dev), but I do have a couple of idea of what tech stack I use when I do rewrite the backend mostly from reading about the newest technologies.

My fear is that I could completely choke this kind of experience and get a bad placement rating from my program at school, which screws up my chances of any future coop placement. But if I can pull it off it could be a rocket for my career.

Is right for me, as a relatively inexperienced developer or should I go for a more standard work environment?

The laws aren't as strict as some states like Arizona (whoops, only 45 guesses left), but they're still tough enough where you can potentially have it follow you around forever.

Long story short, I was arrested with a friend recently for having maybe a thumbnail's worth of pot in our pockets, between the two of us combined. We were outside, in the dark, alone, and then suddenly we weren't. Handcuffs, personal info. given, fingerprints, mugshot, put in a cell, everything. 

I'm a good person. I'm almost top of my class at college. I've never gotten so much as a speeding ticket in my life, and I got fucking arrested.

I've started a substance abuse program that will expunge the incident from my record once it's completed. If I do everything right, which I intend to, I won't even have to go to court at all.

I know lots of people have it worse. I know this very well. I'm aware that I'm one of the lucky ones and a lot of people in a lot of other states get much harsher treatment from the law for the same offense. It's a misdemeanor. But fuck, I'm still falling apart. This whole thing is senseless in every way. I'm stressed, depressed, bitter, angry. I have to begin the process of searching for an internship soon. I'm terrified about how this will impact my future, if it means I won't be able to land any internship, let alone a job. My parents are being supportive the whole way but I know they're disappointed in me. My mom's stressing about the internship prospects just as much as I am, and it's killing me.

My friends are all drinking and smiling and laughing, and every day now I'm just existing. I've forgotten how to be happy, because all I can think about is that night. I can't make it go away. I tense up now any time I see flashing lights on the highway or whenever I drive past a police station. I keep thinking back to how the handcuffs felt on my wrists. It feels like they never came off. I'm not suicidal, but sometimes I can't stop wishing that something would happen that would kill me, like a car accident. I can't stop thinking about the past, but I'm even more terrified about the future. I've never felt more alone in my life, and I just want to die."

Going into college, and not knowing what to major in, my parents pushed me to study CS. Since I don't feel super passionate about anything and didn't know what I wanted to do anyways, I went ahead and followed their advice and here I am.

Now, I don't HATE it. Which is a lot coming from me. I enjoy programming and learning about all this techy stuff, I just feel so out of place and like I don't really know what's going on half the time. Being only one of maybe three or four other girl CS majors, it is extremely discouraging hearing all this egotistical CS boys talking about how they hacked their high school's computer system and all this other stuff that is just way over my head. I feel like no one takes my seriously although I do well in the courses and am a bright girl, I just don't have much outside knowledge or experience. I have had several internship interviews which I have completely bombed and I think it is due to my lack of confidence.


So basically my questions are: 1. What are some things I could do on my own to get more experience or ""build my portfolio""? Honestly, I don't even know where to start. It's pretty embarrassing to admit. 2. Any other girls in tech have any advice or suggestions for me on how to fit in or have more confidence? 3. I do enjoy computer science, so I'm not looking to change my major, so please none of that.

I graduated and passed NCLEX last year, June is when I started my internship for ICU. I've now been out of my internship for five months now.

Here's the thing, I thought I would like ICU. I did at first. Now nine months into being a ICU nurse I still feel anxious when going into work and while I'm at work. I get three patients probably every other week which causes me to get overwhelmed, three ICU patients is a lot of work. 

Another thing is I would say 50% I don't enjoy being at work or ICU. I don't know what it is. I'm a fairly mellow laid back guy and I don't think I like unpredictability. 

I see other experienced nurses that take a lot higher acuity patients than me and just me thinking about that in the future causes me anxiety and nervousness. 

My question is will these feelings go away? Will it get better? Will I become more comfortable and confident in ICU?

Right now I'm thinking two things, there might be a weekender positioning opening up to where I just work two days per week. I think that might help if I work less? Or my friend works on med surg/neuro floor, I could try to go up there where the acuity is less. 

Should I wait it out? I don't know what to do. I mean I like having ICU on my resume but I'm not sure if that will help me in my later goals in like, becoming a FNP.

4b1ui6,14,2016-03-19,A guide to become a tattoo apprentice,tonyhandjr,tattoo,https://www.reddit.com/r/tattoo/comments/4b1ui6/a_guide_to_become_a_tattoo_apprentice/,"Getting a tattoo apprenticeship can be one of the most challenge obstacles to overcome in your quest to becoming a professional tattoo artist. However, if you want to get a job in a professional setting, and not just give people tattoos on your couch, than an apprenticeship is something that is necessary. Here I have the 9 steps required to become a tattoo artist. It’s not an easy road, but it’s well worth the hard work if your goal is to be a top notch tattoo artist!

 

**A Strong Portfolio**

Before you even begin thinking about seeking out a tattoo apprenticeship you need to build up a strong portfolio of your artwork. Afterall, the lifeblood of a tattoo artist is is their ability to draw! And no one is going to take an apprentice with no talent in regards to drawing.

You’re going to want to fill your portfolio with drawing of many different artists styles ranging from tattoo style drawing, paintings, pen drawings, water colors, etc.. And these are to be complete and finished pieces of works not doodles!  You also want these to be original pieces of work–meaning no stealing tattoo designs of the internet–they can, however, be inspired by other tattoo artists work. If they are though, make sure to know the artist’s background well.

You need your portfolio to look professional, meaning, in a hard cover binder with each piece in a laminated sleeve. And the more artwork the better, the closer to over a hundred piece the better. You really want to show off your talent as an artist here, but be humble about it.

 

**Don’t Start Tattooing Before You Get an Apprenticeship**

This is a big one. Tattooing without an apprenticeship is referred to as “scratching” and is highly frowned upon within the industry–for many reasons. The biggest one that applies to you, is it’s hard to unlearn the many bad habits you might develop through self teaching, and an artist doesn’t want to take the time to teach you the proper way while trying to break bad habits.

If you have already been tattooing, but are looking to become a professional, it’s best to keep this a secret, and definitely do not include any of the tattoos you might have done in your portfolio! If you are labeled a scratcher it could be next to impossible to get an apprenticeship anywhere, so it’s best to just wait and learn the proper way.

With that being said, it is smart to learn everything you can from an education standpoint, meaning; read books like Basic Fundamentals of Modern Tattoo, attend conventions, and learn the history of tattoos.

 

**Pick a Good Studio With Great Artists**
 
Now that you have your portfolio as professional as it can be, you are ready to start looking for a shop to take you on as an apprentice! This is one of the most important steps. You want to target shops that have a good reputation and have very talented artists. If the place if known for being shady, or their tattoos aren’t up to par, then then it’s not the place to train. Your reputation is everything as a tattoo artist–you are your own brand–and to develop the wrong reputation because of where you were trained, you will be shooting yourself in the foot before you even begin.

Another thing, an apprenticeship can cost you anywhere from nothing to thousands of dollars. This is something you need to be aware while out searching.

 
**Get to Know The Artist You Want to Train You**
 
Once you find the perfect shop for you it’s best to not just be straight forward and ask if they will take you on as an apprentice–chances are you will be shooed out the door. Instead get to know the artist you want to teach you. Get a tattoo or two from them, maybe even pick out from your portfolio for him to do, and send them a couple referrals before asking them to take the time to teach you. You have a better shot once you have built a little rapport with the artists.

 

**Be Determined and Stand Out**

Chances are, even after you get to know the artist, you will get shot down. It’s not easy to take on an apprentice, and a lot of artists won’t just do it for anyone. If you do get turned down, don’t get flustered and rude, it’s gonna take some hard work and determination to get an apprenticeship!

Just because you’ve been turned down doesn’t mean the the battle is over, no, it has just begun. You also have to keep in mind, chance are, you’re not the only one asking to become an apprentice, and to outshine your competition a little determination and sucking up can go a long way!

Continue to stop by the shop a couple times a week (don’t bug the artist or pester him while he is trying to work), but stop by to chat, or see if you can run and go get them lunch, maybe even if you could watch him tattoo for a little bit. However your approach it, just make sure you are consistent and determined.

However, it’s smart to not put all of your eggs in one basic. At this point finding a couple of other shops, to try and apprentice at, might be wise.

 

**Know Why You Want to Be a Tattoo Artist**
 
A question you need to be prepared to answer is, “Why do you want to become a tattoo artist?”

You should think long and hard about this, and have your answer ready. And it better not be because you love the lifestyle or that LA ink is your favorite show!

You need to be in it for the love of the art, or because you’re obsessed with drawing. The reality of working as a tattoo artist is not what you see on TV. In fact, it can be a very demanding, and stressful, job. 

 

**Be Prepared for Hard Work**

Once you finally land an apprenticeship–-and you will if you are determined and talented enough–-the real hard work begins!

Don’t think you’ll be getting right to the nitty gritty of learning [how to tattoo](http://www.tattoolikethepros.com/). Oh no, you still have to prove your mettle. By this I mean you will be doing typical intern work; taking out the trash, getting coffee for everyone, setting up stations, restocking supplies,learn how to bandage and [care for a tattoo](http://www.tattoolikethepros.com/tattoo-aftercare-how-to-take-care-of-tattoo/), not to mention you’re going to be on the wrong side of everyone’s jokes–-and to top it off you’ll be doing it all for free!

Fear not, and hang tight, for this is simply the rite of passage, and you’re teacher also wants to make sure you’re not wasting his time and are going to stick around. So throw on a smile and bust your butt! It will be worth it in the end.

Since you are going to be an unpaid, maybe even having to pay, apprentice, you might need to work a second job to make ends meet. It will be hard, but there is light at the end of the tunnel, an apprenticeship usually lasts anywhere from six months to a couple of years, and then you’ll be a professional getting paid to tattoo!

 

**Be Prepared to Learn**

After the grunt work phase, you will start to learn how to actually tattoo. Initially you will just be doing a whole lot of watching your teacher tattoo, be extra attentive, and watch every little move he makes and why he is making it.

Before  you ever pick up a tattoo machine, you will become blood born pathogen certified, learn to make needles, use the autoclave, learn how to bandage and care for a tattoo, and all of the other health precautions required.

Once you finally pick up a machine, you will spend a lot of time practicing on things like tattoo practice skin or even on fruit. Usually the first time you will put ink to skin, it will be on yourself. This is another rite of passage in many shops!

Eventually you will move on to tattooing people, and when you do you will being doing them all for free, and tons of them. Take this time to ask questions and really hone your skill. You want to leave you’re apprenticeship knowing everything your teacher can teach you.

 

**Get Your Certification**
 
Depending on your state once your have completed the required amount of hours, or once your teacher feels you are ready, your apprenticeship will be officially done and you can get your tattoo license!

The requirements to obtain your tattoo license vary from state to state, even from county to county, so make sure your research your state for their specific requirements.

Some states just require you to be blood borne pathogen certified (which you should be anyways) and 18 years or older, while other states, will require a certain amount of apprentice hours, as well as, you could be required to take a written exam. Depending where you are the license will run you between $25-250, and some last for three years while other expire yearly.


**Once you have obtained your license you can legally charge people for your work, and will officially be a professional tattoo artist!**"

And at Hudson there is one frat that reins supreme, where the brothers are smarter, stronger and more privileged then any of their rivals. And boy do they know it.

The line stretches down the block as students wait to enter Alpha Sigma's first party of the semester. I stand on the doorstep of the opulent fraternity mansion, arms folded in a way that shows off my bulging biceps and rippled chest. The collar on my Abercrombie polo is up, obviously, and I scan the line for any lithe young pickings that I could have fun with. I dumped my Theta slampiece over the summer - I said I had to focus more on my Goldman Sachs internship, but the real reason was I was just... bored of her. Who knows what I'll find tonight? Maybe a girl truly worth showing off to the high society I had been born into...
____________________________________________________

Hey, thanks for reading! So the premise of this roleplay is pretty simple. I want to play a douchey, All-American frat bro who gets to corrupt and use a naive young first year. You could be a spoiled, stuck-up legacy blonde, a small-town busty brunette or even an ebony/latina girl who'd never dream she'd abandon her people to suck on the cock of a rich white guy. So long as you're creative and imaginative, I'm game!

This can be played short-term, but what I'd really like to do is create a little world of opulence and privilege. I want to seduce your character with promises of the high-life, taking you to all sorts of exclusive events and country clubs, all the while making you into a more and more depraved slut. By the end of it I want you to be my bimbo, a good, obedient little girl who smiles and sticks her chest out while the men discuss business.

Detail, creativity and good grammar are key. I'm pretty open to most kinks and this scene can go from plain vanilla to extremely dark.

Hope to hear from you!"

Anyway one guy walks up to me and says the following

&gt; Hi $ziogref I have the flash drive and its not working

So I have a look at it, plug it in, and lo and behold I get nothing. I Went to unplug the drive and pushed slightly down on it and noticed the da-ding sound that Windows 7 makes when you connect a device, Instantly I knew what the problem was, a broken USB connector. 

I Crack open the case and the USB connection just falls out, great....

I Inform the User what has happened and it would be easier to create a new flash drive with the content which you can copy from the server, then I get this line

&gt; Oh, that's the only copy, it has all my training material I need to present in my classes

**face palm**

At this time I didn't have a soldering iron (but I had the skills) so the solution ended up being, The flash drive with no USB connection, A USB extension cable, A folded sticky note and hours of waiting for the data to copy off. 

Here is the photo I took of the solution (Sorry for the Cropping, It has the company name in the original)

A big industry in downtown Los Angeles that dealt with many movie, tv and rock stars. Basically, offering rich and famous people services to handle their careers while also giving fresh faced wannabes the opportunities.

Katy was one of them, a young girl that wasn't even 21 yet dreams of making it in music, becoming a world known star. She had tried numerous times and had many meetings with companies to try and get her talent across to no avail. Eventually the money she saved up from her part time job while she was in school dried up and she had to pick up a job in L.A she she thought why not a business in a similar field to her dreams.

Katy remembered when she walked into the office for the first time, people couldn't believe what she looked like and you think they would be accustomed to seeing gorgeous people all the time. She had worn a pair of red 6 inch stilettos and a tiny pencil skirt that would of been the shortest a woman could wear. Thigh high stockings that hugged tight to her legs that were held up by clasps attached to a garter belt. The tight blouse she wore strained her rather biggest assets, her double DD breasts that were pushed up in her black bra. They bounced around as she worked around the office, attracting the attention of many guys. The man Katy worked for was always delighted to see her, his eyes filling up with lust as he looked her body over before leading her into his office and shutting the door.

Katy regularly wore clothes that brung her attention, it was always another pair of 6 inch heels, short skirts and stockings accompanied by a tight low cut blouse. Guys around the office started to talk about Katy, about how they would love to ram her as she bent over their desk. Many guys often tried to get with her but she always refused. Soon Katy developed a reputation for being a strong feminist supporter. She thought that all men were pigs for treating women as nothing more than a pair of tits and ass with a pretty face. That's how Katy felt in meetings, guys would get sidetracked around her and just stare at her boobs or ass. They wouldn't take her seriously and thought that she was just a slut. She thought that guys only chatted to her because they wanted to fuck her and weren't even calling her by name around the office, she overheard them calling her by her big tits.

Though what Katy did, didn't always match up with what she said. She would scold men for staring at her body when she wore revealing clothing everyday. She would also find every excuse to bend over to give everyone a good look at her, regularly dropping things on the ground. She would get angry at guys all the time for flirting with her as they obviously wanted to fuck her but she would flirt with guys all the time brushing her hand near their groin and giving them a sexy, sultry look as she walked away.

One day the CEO came to the office and went to a meeting room with about 30 other businessmen. They were all aged between 50-80 years old. After about an hour, Katy was called into the meeting room. Jason, a fellow coworker had a desk right in front of the room, he watched her strut in their, clad in her tight clothes. She closed the door behind her. It must of been 4 hours until the doors opened again, with the old guys walking out with satisfied looks on their faces. They talked about how great that was and how they must do it again soon. Out Katy stepped as they finally all left. Her hair was disheveled while she was fixing her rumpled blouse and rolling down her skirt while carrying her stilettos. As she walked she pulled out a curly hair from her mouth and wiped away a bit of stickiness from her lips. Going to her desk and continuing work like nothing happened.

I'm currently staying with her while I visit the nation's capital. Yesterday she was telling me about Hurricane Sandy and how it totally destroyed her mother's house and how much it cost to rebuild everything since her mother inexplicably did not have flood insurance (despite living right on the water)

She says all the houses in the neighborhood have been rebuilt except for the ones owned by Hasidic Jews. Apparently Hasidic Jews are stereotypically super rich, the diamond district dominators, so they will often own several vacation houses to rent out. But unfortunately, these owners have chosen to leave their rental houses is complete disarray and haven't made any effort to rebuild, so these houses are an eyesore for the neighbors.

Among the things said were

&gt;the fucking Hasidic Jews, those fucking disgusting dirty pigs

&gt;Yeah, with the little hats and the stupid fucking pigtails on the side of their heads. You know they don't have sex with their wives unless they put a sheet over them first? Fucking backwards pig rapists.

&gt;No, you don't understand, it's ingrained in them from birth, they are the cockroaches of the human race

Among other startling and unsettling comments.

I mostly stayed silent and now I feel incredibly guilty that I didn't speak up. The fact of the matter is I've never actually met a Hasidic Jew in person so I really can't contradict her statements with any authority. When I said ""Surely they're not *all* that way"" that's when she started in on the third quote listed above."

Something about my character: I'll be playing as Aaron. At 6'1"" tall, he is a very athletic young man, result of many hours spent in the gym. He is smart and witty. 

I do enjoy to be on the dominant side of a relationship, so if you aren't able to be on the submissive end , I fear this is not for you.

4b3zax,0,2016-03-19,New to Boston: Pros and cons of living in Allston or Dorchester?,xenomorphsandtea,boston,https://www.reddit.com/r/boston/comments/4b3zax/new_to_boston_pros_and_cons_of_living_in_allston/,"Hello all! I am moving to Boston for the summer (late May - late August) for an internship at a downtown company near the aquarium.  I'm planning on subletting an apartment for those four months. I have some questions regarding the best place to live for what I'm looking for and Boston in general.
I am a 21 year old male college student from NY, and am excited to be moving to a new city.  I've visited Boston maybe 4-5 times in the past few years and generally have a good idea how the T works and how the city is set up.  That's not to say I have explored the Boston area extensively because I have not. 

I'm hoping I can use the four months in Boston to make new friends and business connections, explore the city, and experience some of Boston's best nightlife. I do have some criteria I'm evaluating my living choice though, so any help would be appreciated...

Cost: I'm looking to spend no more than $550 a month on rent (preferably &lt;$500). I know this is very limiting, and means I'm probably confined to living in Allston/Brighton or Dorchester.  I did find a few rooms for sublet over the summer for around $450 in these places. 

Location: Dorchester seems to be a little more convenient as far as getting to center city on the red line while Allston seems a bit further out.  I have not been to Allston, but a good friend of mine lives in Dorchester near the Shawmut station.  I know the Shawmut/Fields Corner area of Dorchester pretty well, and like it there.  It would be a plus to be closer to my friend, but not a deal breaker if I wasn't. 

Nightlife: I realize Boston sleeps a lot earlier than NYC for example.  From what I've heard, bars close around 2am, and the latest trains are at 12:30, so it would be cool to have things to do within walking distance or at least close by.  
I am not really a crazy frat bro type of partier, and am a little more mature than your average college student, but I do enjoy going to bars and being social on weekends.  Ideally, I want to meet interesting people and make new friends when I go out and am hoping to find a good area to do so. 

Preconceptions of the area:  From what I've heard, Allston is an area full of students, forward thinking people, and bustling with activity.  It sounds like a cool place, but I've also heard negative opinions that it's trashy, there are obnoxious immature students, and run down apartments full of vermin.  How accurate is this description?  Would it change things to be living there during the summertime, when school is not in session?

Dorchester gets a bad rap from some, but in my experiences I have enjoyed the area and the diversity.  I haven't felt particularly unsafe during my time there (I lived in a rough part of Philadelphia for two years, that seemed a lot worse) but I have heard its a bit more flat as far as things to do. Is it a good place for young professionals to live?

In your travels, is it difficult to meet people in Boston?  I'm a pretty outgoing person but if there's a particular area where young people in there 20s seem to meet than by all means share. 
Would love to hear anyone's two cents and tips for experiencing Boston. "

Is it better than Upwork and other similar sites?,Barnacle_Ed,freelance,https://www.reddit.com/r/freelance/comments/4b4gjv/anyone_tried_out_crowded_is_it_better_than_upwork/,"Quick blurb about my situation and background: I was let go from my fulltime programming job in the California Bay Area last week and am on the hunt for new work before my severance pay runs out. At the same time, however, I've been working towards a Masters degree in software engineering for some time now and will be graduating this August if I keep on track. I want to make the degree my priority at this time and keep up my GPA, so I'm somewhat hesitant to jump headlong into another fulltime job; I've been applying to some internships, but part-time freelance work is also something I'm considering to pay the bills.

I've gleaned two major lessons after browsing this sub over the last day:

1) Landing your first gig can take quite a bit of effort and searching, but helps builds up your portfolio and list of potential references.

2) Most online freelance sites like Upwork and Freelancer sound like a mixed bag, filled with horror stories and (comparatively) low payouts.


One site I did stumble upon in my searching was https://www.crowded.com/ and I couldn't find any posts in this sub about it, whether good or bad. I'm inherently skeptical of it - given what I've read here about other similar sites - but am still somewhat interested since the convenience of online freelancing would pair nicely with my school schedule. Has anyone tried it out and think it's worth investigating? Or would sticking to meetups and more traditional client-searching methods be a better idea, especially given my location?

I'd also appreciate any other beginner tips or insight as well, if you have them. I've done a lot of reading and research but advice is always welcome!"

I have a few questions when it comes to applying online in general:


1. Does declining to answer the voluntary sections (gender, veteran status, disability, etc.) reduce your chances of being considered? I understand it's voluntary but does it factor into the position? I feel that answering it correctly can hamper my chances (I am an Asian male and the industry is saturated with us) for the sake of diversity and affirmative action.
2. What about applying for multiple similar positions in the same company? Would they not consider you because you essentially spammed your application to increase your chances?
3. Do companies prioritize applicants near the position location? e.g. if I'm currently in LA and the position is in Florida or Maryland would the company prefer students that already in those states? If so then I might as well just focus on openings in SoCal only instead of trying my luck (or lack thereof) everywhere."

so in the last 6-8 months luck was really on my side I guess…sadly I am a guy who always thinks a thousand steps ahead and worries about my future. But maybe I should start from the beginning: 

6-8 months ago I was hired by a big company as a working student, actually I was hired in a technical department of the company (I am apparently good with computers and mobile devices - which might be the reason I was hired there). Already before I graduated they offered me a full-time job and I thought and still think what a great opportunity that is and still can’t believe how lucky I am.
But in the last couple of weeks thoughts came up like „is this the right job for me?“, „do I wanna do this for the next couple of years?“ or „what about graduate school?“. Point is, currently I feel like I don’t learn anything at all, because mainly I am doing the same tasks almost every day with just little variations, but still I work hard, stay long in the office, come into the office during the weekends if help is needed and I always try to be as supportive for my team as I can be (which is the reason why they offered me a full-time position after I graduated I guess). 

I think the reason for my concerns is, that I’m actually having Bachelor’s degree in international politics and during my studies I spent many years abroad not only to study but also to do several voluntary internships….I loved my work I did back then…and it still makes me happy and sad at the same time when I’m thinking about it, because the work I was doing during my internships is what I would love to do for the rest of my life (international politics, human rights, foreign affairs etc. etc.). The last couple of nights I couldn’t even sleep because all my thoughts were about going to graduate school or at least apply for jobs that I am interested in. But first of all, at the same time I can’t imagine myself going back to school (now that I am completely independent so to say) and second of all getting a job in the areas I did internships in, very often requires an advanced degree or at least several years of experience in a political area -&gt; and I just can’t count my current job for that….I don’t even need my degree for what I am doing there…it has absolutely nothing to do with international politics

So basically my question is: Did any of you ever had similar thoughts during their first job, and if so how did you deal with them? Did you „follow your dreams“ so to say or did you stick with your current job and never looked back while being happy with that decision?

Thanks in advance for any suggestions 

Cheers!

I graduated from University of Texas at Austin with a Computer Engineering Degree.

I've been working full time with Caterpillar since last June.

My first 2 internships were with Caterpillar as a Product support Engineer and Software Engineer.

So in my previous job I was in a Traineeship (like an internship) in IT support, supporting a staff of 80 people across 3 sites. Anyway one guy walks up to me and says the following

&gt; Hi $ziogref I have the flash drive and its not working

So I have a look at it, plug it in, and lo and behold I get nothing. I Went to unplug the drive and pushed slightly down on it and noticed the da-ding sound that Windows 7 makes when you connect a device, Instantly I knew what the problem was, a broken USB connector. 

I Crack open the case and the USB connection just falls out, great....

I Inform the User what has happened and it would be easier to create a new flash drive with the content which you can copy from the server, then I get this line

&gt; Oh, that's the only copy, it has all my training material I need to present in my classes

**face palm**

At this time I didn't have a soldering iron (but I had the skills) so the solution ended up being, The flash drive with no USB connection, A USB extension cable, A folded sticky note and hours of waiting for the data to copy off. 

Here is the photo I took of the solution (Sorry for the Cropping, It has the company name in the original)

4b6eha,2,2016-03-20,"Job offer for a job I like, but a city that I don't like to live in",Kendrick-Lmao,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4b6eha/job_offer_for_a_job_i_like_but_a_city_that_i_dont/,"So, I'll start with some information about me first.

I'm currently in my last semester in school for a BS in CS, going to a no-name university, and I'm also currently in my first internship.

The internship itself is really great.  It's for embedded dev, which I enjoy, my boss is happy to teach me something I don't know, everyone is friendly, the atmosphere is very relaxed, my opinions on things matter, and I'm able to do most of my work remotely.  

After finishing up the first project they had me working on, my boss said that he wants me to work for him, and that he would have a job offer for me after he gets back from vacation (2 weeks from now).

On the surface it sounds like I should take this offer in a heartbeat, but I have a few problems with the area I would be working in.  The main problem is that it's a very white trash town, and I happen to be gay.  While it has had newsworthy problems with people having property damaged or being beat up for being gay, I don't fear for my safety.  The town is also getting more tolerant, and it's a college town on top of that, but it still isn't very welcoming.  

The other problem is that I'm almost 100% sure I would not be making that much money for the work I would be doing; if I had to guess, I would say the offer would be for around $35k/yr. The business itself is small, about 15-20 employees, business isn't exactly booming, and the area is cheap to live in.  For example, I could get a 1100 square foot 2 bedroom apartment, with an attached garage, for $800 a month.  Because I don't think I would be making much, I don't think I could afford to live in a nearby city and commute whenever I needed to be there in person.  Also the closest city I would like to live in is an hour away.

I put in job offers to other places recently, but I really doubt I will get an interview or have an offer from any of them before my boss comes back and gives me an offer.  And considering my school isn't well known, my GPA isn't the best, it's a little harder for me to just fall into a job when I feel like it.

So my question is, what do you guys think I should do?  If I hear back from another company before my boss offers, I'll most likely take that.  But I don't know what I should do if I get my first offer from my boss.  I really do like working here, and I can tolerate living here for a few years I guess, but I'm afraid that if I take his offer that I might miss out on something better.  Then on the other hand, if I reject his offer, and if I don't hear back from anywhere else, or if I bomb any interviews I may get, I'm jobless.  I would also like to try and avoid only working here for a month and then jump ship to something better asap.  I have too much respect for my boss to do that.

**TL;DR**: Have a job offer on the way for a job I like, but in a shitty city.  Pay is most likely not going to be good, although good for the city, and commuting isn't reasonable.  No other offers currently on the table.  What do?"
4b6igv,0,2016-03-20,"True Detective, Fargo and expectations",Punchable_Face,television,https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/4b6igv/true_detective_fargo_and_expectations/,"I've read a lot about how amazing True Detective is, and how disappointing season two was. Since the two aren't connected, i decided to watch the second first.

I can see why people didn't like it, the ending was somewhat unsatisfying but it had good acting which is something a lot of shows lack. There are too many shows like The Dome, where it starts of with an interesting plot and you quickly realize you care for none of the characters at all, and you are left wondering if they let interns write the show on set. And then little things like when stuck in a pitch black maze, the characters stop to talk while the last match is quickly burning out, instead of lighting a shirt on fire and trying to keep their only lifeline they have alive. Just stupid shit. True Detective had none of that. Sure, sometimes boring and a bit confusing, but not enough to make me stop watching. Would i watch it again? Maybe not, but it wasn't a complete waste of time. A lot thanks to Rachel McAdams i admit.

Season one of True Detective was loved by everyone it seems, even my brother. Had somewhat elevated expectations for it. 
Started off slow, but that's ok. The two main characters seemed off, but they are top notch actors imo. Episode 2 had Alexandra Daddario, and i was kinda hooked. Then slowly realized no more Daddario, but instead it just barely gives you enough to keep you watching. Still well made, just somewhat confusing and boring. Seemed like the show was more about an asshole and a broken man and less about the case. I got the feeling it was a huge conspiracy involving several people in the police, locals and rich people in a cult like thing, kind of like in Britain. Instead it's just a couple of inbred satanic rednecks who somehow never got caught after countless victims over several years.

I honestly can't see why people love it so much. Different tastes, but i haven't read one negative thing about it. Did i miss something?


Then decided to turn on Fargo. I've seen the movie and enjoyed it. Slow but interesting, plus beautiful scenery. So i knew what to expect of the tv-show. Or so i thought. Episode one just blew me away, by the time the end credits rolled it had me hooked. 

I expected it to slow down in the second episode but it didn't. Every episode just kept upping the previous one in crazy stuff and the bodies just kept piling. It has amazing characters and some crazy scenes.
Every episode starts with stating it's a true story, and that besides the names, everything has been told exactly as it occurred out of respect for the dead. Obviously characters have been slightly exaggerated (The Hess brothers etc.) and gaps must have been filled in, but things like the assault on the syndicate and raining fish, there is no way all these things happened, right? 


TL;DR: High expectations for True Detective, snooze fest. Lowered expectations for Fargo, got a 10 episode version of Breaking Bad."

I'm trying to get an understanding of the layout of the city before I get up there so that I'm not completely lost when June comes. 1) Do y'all have anything similar to the borough system in NY where you split the city into districts? 2) What kind of road system do you use. Is it more akin to Boston's bowl of spaghetti or NY's more orderly grid system?

3) since I'll be there for awhile, I'll have plenty of time to experience many different parts of the city. Any suggestions for any ""Philly must-do's""?

Obligatory Question: 4) Suggestions on the best cheesesteak in town?

Thanks for the help all and I look forward to hearing responses!"

I felt an attraction to him and after a four hour conversation, we decided to try going out, but decided to wait until my internship was finished. 

The problem is, he has mixed manic bipolar disorder and delusions. He's open and honest, but because of him having deep feelings for me after only a week, I worry about his mental state. 

He's suffered a lot of loss in his life and has no family left. He also told me ahead of time that he was prone to feeling intensely very fast. 

I tried to tell him yesterday that this was going to fast and mixed with my inexperience I wanted to just stay friends for a while, but he broke down crying thinking that I'm about to abandon him. We've only seen each other in person twice, never kissed, and only held hands for three seconds when my cousin wasn't looking. 

I don't know what to do because my anxiety is acting up from this and though I don't want to abandon him, I don't want to hurt him anymore than I already have. What should I do? 

On a positive note, he is very intelligent and has a lot of information, and he makes for good company, but I just can't get comfortable for a relationship right now. He doesn't force me to do anything I wanna do, and though he's sad about my decision, he said he would respect it, though he still thinks I'm trying to let him down gently. 

My question of course is what do I do?"

Wanting some of your perspectives on if I'm being unrealistic...or what I should be asking for.,serotinelle,graphic_design,https://www.reddit.com/r/graphic_design/comments/4b8dhv/raise_discussion_didnt_go_so_hot_for_me_wanting/,"After graduating a several years ago, working in a different field (but doing freelance on the side) for a year and a half, and finally getting a job in my field last summer, today was the day to re-evaluate my pay after being there six months. I was eager to get a job in my field in any capacity and didn't properly have the confidence or foresight to negotiate anything relating to money at the time, so I started off at $14/hour, which I was told was a training/trial period wage. The previous employee, who did have more experience, was hired at $3.50 more (with an increase, not sure what, after 30 days) three and a half years ago.

So, I figured I'd start around there, plus a little more, to get me closer to a liveable wage. The owner of the company was shocked I wanted to start talking around $18.50 and was thinking more like $16. I didn't agree and he said he was going to talk to the payroll person. I don't know how to accurately figure out what I should be asking for, so that's why I'm posting…to see if you guys can help me out. Here's all that I do in my position:

I've been designing for almost a decade, and from that side, I do design of various sorts. Designs for garments, as well as coming up with in-store ideas, mockups for clients, edits to existing artwork, color correction, basic yadda yadda yadda. I had four days of training for this job before taking over the position entirely (despite not knowing anything about any of the machines I use at the onset), operate and maintain several machines (two printers [one direct-to-garment, one sublimation], a rhinestone machine, optical plotter, CAD cutter, and a few additional related machines that make the ones I mentioned fully usable/operational), do art/design for and set up artwork in various formats: for sublimation, digital/white ink, rhinestone, CAD cutting [which I taught myself how to use]). I also have a BFA in graphic design, which yes, in this industry isn't a hard-and-fast marker of anything, but my training in school (and through the four internships I completed) is what allowed me to only need four days of training, because I already knew how to use all the software and color correct things for print and all the little things you pick up by learning, doing, and experimenting repeatedly. I also have, of my own accord, created a variety of documents for the sales team (to be able to make more money), keep a highly-detailed log of my machine maintenance (which saves the company money), troubleshoot various tech issues for people (which saves the company money), among all sorts of other random stuff.

This place offers absolutely no benefits, no health insurance or anything (I'm on state health insurance and have meds that they're choosing to no longer cover), and I just quit my part time weekend job because I was tired of working 7 days a week between 3 jobs. I have a considerable amount in student loans and still need help from my father to pay those monthly. I also found out two nights ago that I need to move in three months, so the time has come to make a decision as to what I do.

The worst part is that my boss said that the previous employee did more work than me and that stung. Uh. Huh. I perform all of his job duties, minus the level of art creation, because there hasn't been a high enough level of need for me to take over any significant amount of art off the art director's plate. My boss didn't know ""what"" the former employee did when hired at that rate other than what was on a resume. What that says to me is that I'm apparently less valuable six months in than the former employee was before even starting their first day.

I looked up ""Printer"" on salary.com and the median for the Twin Cities (Minnesota) is $36,895, which if (I assume, is gross/before taxes) is about $17.75/hour. (The lowest percentile is $27,843, or about $13.40/hr.) ""Graphic design specialist"" (what they're calling graphic designers on the site?) median is $54,791, or about $26.30/hour. (Lowest percentile is at $42,745, or about $20.55/hr.) I looked up both of those things as I do both of those jobs.

Can you guys help me come up with a good number? Am I being taken advantage of? Or am I exaggerating my value? Should I just suck it up and be glad I have a job and look for a new one in the meantime? Feeling really lost, so thanks so much for listening."

Hey, thanks for reading! So the premise of this roleplay is pretty simple. I want to play a douchey, All-American frat bro who gets to corrupt and use a naive young first year. You could be a spoiled, stuck-up legacy blonde, a small-town busty brunette or even an ebony/latina girl who'd never dream she'd abandon her people to suck on the cock of a rich white guy. So long as you're creative and imaginative, I'm game!

This can be played short-term, but what I'd really like to do is create a little world of opulence and privilege. I want to seduce your character with promises of the high-life, taking you to all sorts of exclusive events and country clubs, all the while making you into a more and more depraved slut. By the end of it I want you to be my bimbo, a good, obedient little girl who smiles and sticks her chest out while the men discuss business.

Detail, creativity and good grammar are key. I'm pretty open to most kinks and this scene can go from plain vanilla to extremely dark.

Hope to hear from you!"
4b9d58,25,2016-03-20,Grey's Anatomy Season 1- ? (spoilers),the1stgirlmeetsworld,greysanatomy,https://www.reddit.com/r/greysanatomy/comments/4b9d58/greys_anatomy_season_1_spoilers/,"So I've been thinking about it and I think Grey's is like a story book that has a chapter every 5 years (or a new section every 5 chapters). Yes sometimes characters and storylines bleed over, but for the most part every 5 years is a ""section"" of Grey's.

Hear me out:

Seasons 1-5 MAGIC - The original 5 interns trying to learn and become successful. The Derek/Meredith on and off drama. They are all still young-ish. Also Callie is mainly just there to be George's love interest.

Seasons 6-10 - Meredith, Alex, Cristina, Lexie, Jackson and April are residents. Callie and Arizona's relationship is a main point of focus. The interns are not ""young"" anymore, they're in the middle. They are not the top of the food chain but know their way around and have interns below them. Meredith and Derek get married and have a mature relationship and start a family. There are more mature storylines which focus around the attendings and residents and also the Lexie/Mark and Owen/Cristina relationships.

Seasons 10 and up
Cristina is gone, making it a significant ending to that aspect of the story (for both Meredith and Owen). Introduction of Maggie, Amelia, Stephanie, Jo, and Deluca. So, in short, mostly new characters. Alex and Meredith are attendings and completely grown up. The significant death of Derek and therefore finite ending of that storyline. Meredith moving on as a widow. Etc.

Again, I know I didn't mention every character (Bailey, Richard, etc) and that some of the storylines I mentioned bleed into more than one ""chapter"", but if you think about it, look at the first 5 seasons, the second 5 seasons, and then the most recent 2 seasons... they really are separate in their focus and feel.

Hi all,

I’m a University student with 9 months until graduation (bachelors of IT, networking and IT security). I’ve been lurking this sub for some time now, and I have to say nothing has ever gotten me more excited about tech then the devops movement. That said with graduation coming up I’m trying to focus my last few months as a student on acquiring useful knowledge and skills that could help me land a job in the field!

**So here’s what I’ve already done:**

Certs: 

* CCNP
* CCDP
* I’ve attempted the CCIE written
* JNCIS-Junos

Internship experience:

* General PC support/workstation deployment (Government)
* Access Management/Level 2 supportish (Permissions/account management for AD, File permissions, propriety application stuff, etc.) (Government)
* Enterprise Networking Support (Cisco)
* 2x Presales/Lab admin (Cisco)
* Jr DNS network administrator for an internet registration authority (this summer)

Relevant Lab experience:

* Butt load of experience with Cisco Configurations in routing, switching, telephony, ASAs, wireless, ucs, etc.
 * I run a full cisco enterprise stack at home, Security appliance/UCS Server/Switches/Controller &amp; AP
 * Got the chance to pretty much run an SE lab
 * Deployed multiple full stack networks 
* Loads of time spent messing around with ESXi/vCenter
* KVM based Openstack, setting it up manually/from scratch (nova, keystone, rabbitMQ, Gluster, swift, cinder, horizon, neutron etc.)

Coding:

* Super comfortable in python
* I can hold my own in the following with syntax help from google: C++, VB, Java, JavaScript/JQuery, HTML, PHP

**Heres what I’m planning to do over the next few months:**

* Develop a full stack web app (already in-progress, about 60% done coding the app)

 * Develop automated scripts/workflows to compile/test/deploy code on an Openstack cluster when someone commits to the main truck
 * Develop a Vagrant/Ansible based dev environment for myself and roommate (who’s doing the front end) (this is approx. 75% done)
 * Attempt to scale the app and see how many requests/sec or maximum clients it can take (load ballancers/DB cluster/multiple application and front end servers) 
* Openstack automated deployment from bare metal, something along the lines of pxe booting, which triggers an Ansible script once the OS is installed, or maybe boot off my soon to be Lego SAN?
* Distributed storage, probably mess around with live migration while I’m at it 
* Loads of coding (Hacker Rank)/creating a Github profile to post samples
* Mess around with other tools (Puppet/Chef, Salt, etc.)
* Loads of reading on HA, Ansible, Devops culture, SDDC, Openstack, etc.

So my questions, am I on the right track? What changes you would make? Anything else I should look at? 

Any advice in terms of career paths or what particular job titles I should be on the lookout for? I’m thinking of trying to go for a new grads SRE role, but i have more experience in the network engineering domain"

I will be graduating in January 2017. I have talked to some companies on a job fair a few weeks ago, exchanged some business cards, etc. I was approached by a very interesting company (Company A), and have been at their headquarters for a first interview session.       
   
 
They were very positive (as am I btw) and are interested in inviting me for a second round in April. However, as they have stated in their e-mail themself, they do realize that it might be a bit early for me, should they present me with a contract to sign. They propose that, if I do indeed feel that way, they can arrange to have the second round of interview in September instead.     
    
Personally I feel like September would suit me better. I have done an internship at another company (Company B), and although I'm not sure about starting my carreer with Company B, I would like to have a talk with them first as well (without mentioning Company A of course). However, my girlfriend and others think that this will lower my chances with A because I might seem uninterested.      
What do you think? Company A knows I will be graduating in January 2017, and has stated that this is no issue."

I have to make a decision really soon though. I put together a list of the pros and cons of each of them. I’ll call one Illinois and the other Georgia. Basically I feel like Georgia is a better fit and I should want to go there, but when I was at Illinois I just felt more like I belonged. I appreciate any input you might have!


**PROS**

Georgia: 

- smaller faculty/student ratio (9 students)
- work study only a few hours a week
- opportunity to job shadow (the career I want) for work study hours
- more connections specific to what I want to do
- better weather
- classes, gym, food, etc. all nearby each other
- cheaper cost of living
- own workspace and computer
- no distractions

Illinois:

- more students (20) = more potential friends in new area
- fellow undergrad classmates attending 
- close to friends and family
- easy to travel to/from (trains, airport, driving, etc.)
- can individualize curriculum to be more specific to my interests 
- more variety of internship opportunities 
- variety of things of do in the area
- more financial aid available
- more technologically forward

**CONS**

Georgia:

- Was not impressed with the city
- Inconvenient for travel and visiting home
- Far from everyone I know
- Too serious (could also be a plus depending on how you look at it). Most students are medical, vet, or dental. 
- Didn’t feel like it clicked with me
- Cannot customize curriculum 

Illinois:

- More students means it’s harder to make an impression
- Nothing specific for what I want to do (possible in the future though)
- higher cost of living
- campus is more spread out
- shitty weather
- Will spend more hours working doing an assistantship "

I feel like I've been getting a little experience in a lot of separate career paths. I'm in the middle of my internship hunt, but no offers so far. My strategy was to apply to as many internships that I could find where I met all the basic requirements. Moving forward I want to narrow my career goals, build my skills, and do better in the future. The first step in doing that is to find out where my background would help me most.

Here is a basic outline of my background.


General:

* Junior CS major with a math minor
* GPA of about 3.35

High Level Languages:

* Java - 2 years experience
* Python - 1 year experience
* R - .5 years experience
* C++ - &lt;.5 years experience

Low Level Languages:

* x86 Assembly - .5 years experience
* AVR - .5 years experience 

Information Technology:

* Server Technician - .5 years
* Tech Help Desk - 3 months

Project Management Skills:

* Assistant manager at a learning center (Leadership)
* Taught English as a second language abroad (Communication)


I've applied to internships in software development, software engineering, android development, data analysis, machine programming, general information technology, sysadmin, and project management. In which career path do I have the most marketable background? How can I make myself more marketable in that career path?

I would really appreciate any help, tips, guidance, or constructive criticism you can offer."

Reliable, fast internet is at the top of that list. While I was in Abq for an internship last summer, I lived with someone who was using 150 kbps DSL via Centurylink. Oh, the humanity...
I just came across CityLink's page at http://www.citylinkfiber.com/residential-internet/ and they're claiming 1000 mbps speeds for $79.99, ""starting at $29.99"" installation, no usage limits or throttling, no contract, and no equipment rental fees. Is anyone using their service? Is it actually capable of 1000 mbps speeds? The installation fee ""starting at $29.99"" also sounds a little sketchy; what's the deal with that? 

Additionally, if this claim is nothing but hot air, does anyone have alternative recommendations?

In the fall I interviewed with a company in my field and I was happy to receive an offer from them for the summer, which I signed in December.
I recently discovered that the internship will require me to pass a hair collection drug test. While I do not smoke very often (at most once or twice a week), after reading about hair tests I am concerned that I will not be able to pass. The last time I smoked was in late February and I expect to take the test in mid to late May. I believe there is a good likelihood that I might fail the test given that time frame.
The advice I am looking for is not necessarily how to pass the test, but what to do in the event that I do fail. I am confident that failing the test will mean that I will not get the internship. This presents a multitude of problems. Since I am in my Junior year, if I do not get any technical experience this summer I fear that my full time employment outlook will be poor (I turned down a return offer from an aerospace company in order to accept this internship). However, since it is so late in the recruiting season I do not believe I will be able to apply to another company. My second option is to seek out research for the summer with a professor, but I am not sure how to navigate this route properly. If I go to a professor now to ask to do research then he or she will likely be upset in the event that I do pass my drug test and inform them later on that I will not, in fact, be working with them. If I wait to hear the results, then I doubt that any professor will be receptive to a student asking to get a research position so late in the year.
Any and all advice would be appreciated, I fear that if I do not work this summer then I will be putting my full time career in serious jeopardy.  "
4baggw,1,2016-03-20,"I really like this guy [28/m] but I'm [27/f] 4hrs away and screwed up when we met, can I redeem myself?",LoseThePast,dating,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/4baggw/i_really_like_this_guy_28m_but_im_27f_4hrs_away/,"Met this guy on OKC. Stupid me had my location set to a big city 4hrs from here because that is where my ex lived, and I figured there were more fish in the sea there than here. I go to school 2hrs away from that city but I am currently in another state doing an internship until August and then I have no idea what I'm doing with my life - hopefully finding s full time job, but it probably won't be near that city.
So when I had that city set as my location an amazing guy messaged me. We have now been talking for over a month, (1 month and 5 days).
At that time I was talking to another guy that I had been talking to for two months but he was just stringing me along, saying one day we could meet and the next saying we couldn't, and he kept going back and fourth with that.
I got fed up with him and talked to his friend which told me it was all my fault so I got drunk and texted this current guy (we'll call him Mark) who at that time we had been talking for a week.

Here is where I made my first mistake. I told him what the other guy's (we'll call him Carey) friend told me. Which was basically that I wasn't ready for a relationship and that I was still messed up from my ex (he was abusive: mentally, physically, and sexually). (Carey's friend told me to go to therapy so I did...discovered I was fine, I was just being jerked around and was gullible.) I also stupidly mentioned liking Carey and that I had just decided to stop talking to Carey because he was stringing me along but I missed talking to him. Mark said that was okay because he didn't think he could do a LDR but we could talk as friends and see what happens.

Well I started talking to Mark, and we talked everyday sun up to sun down for over three weeks before we got a chance to meet. I talked to him about relationship things a few times but stayed obscure and tried to stay very slow. I didn't want to push him away or anything since Carey said I had ""liked him too much too fast"" (2 months?).

I've fallen for Mark, forget Carey, he was a total jerk. Mark is very sweet and we have so much in common (unlike Carey).

Well last weekend I met Mark. I screwed up because I thought out date was Sunday and it was Saturday. So he waited around for 40min, I stood him up. OMG
He gave me a second chance and we went out later that night, I discovered he was a lot cuter than I thought which was a plus! 
But we kind of sat there awkwardly because we have texted so much we didn't know what to talk about. We small talked here and there but it's was weird - we are also both shy so that didn't help. I just kept thinking we needed to get out of there and do something fun but it was late and we had nothing to do so it was just us awkwardly sitting there.

In the end he hugged me and we parted ways, I grabbed his hand to pull him back and he said ""were you wanting a kiss?"" I said ""I was thinking about it."" The kiss was awkward because we are both bottom lip kissers and I brain farted and wasn't sure what to do. OMG again.

When he got him he texted me that he was surprised we kissed because he's never been on a date with a girl that kissed on the first date. But then he reminded me that he didn't want a long distance relationship because he felt like he would be too lonely only seeing me twice a month, and less once summer comes.

He made what I considered excuses, such as not wanting to put miles on his car, afraid his car would die, afraid if we got serious he'd have to move and he doesn't want to. Etc. Which is all things he said the time I was drunk and asked him on a date, but we had discussed it once again between drunkenness and the date and he said seeing each other twice a month wouldn't be bad. So then I was hurt and confused.

He said he would be very willing to date me if I lived in his city but doesn't want to do long distance and would prefer to stay friends because distance is too hard. He said all of our past conversations were just ""getting to know you"" friendship questions, I didn't think so?

I'm very flustered, we still talk all day every day but he never initiates ""good mornings"" anymore, and his response time isn't as fast sometimes, and we don't talk as much. But we do still talk a lot, and if I stop talking I get a message from him within an hour.

I'm so confused. I will be back in his city in May for a Comicon which is an event we will both be attending (as of now separately), but I'm wondering if I can redeem myself then? I feel like I really messed things up by accidentally standing him up, and I can't help but wonder if I would have walked away from that date with a bf or potential bf if I hadn't done so.

Because I honestly think he was considering possibly doing the long distance thing before we met, but now it's just crumbled. :(
We talked about it a bit last weekend and he said he had an ex he only saw once a week and that even was too hard on him so he thinks a LDR wouldn't work out. But I wish he would reconsider. :(

Sorry its a long post (and yes if you look at my profile I did post a similar one right after the date, but I'm even more confused now) any thoughts? I really hate being ""just friends"" with him, and want more. I hope to see him again in May, but I am nervous to bring up the idea of a second date. I feel like we could be so great together if we could get over our hurdles. Has anyone ever gone through anything like this, can I redeem myself?

Edit: why if he wanted to be friends did he kiss me? And why did he mention it being a date?

TL;DR: I met a guy who lives 4hrs from where I am doing an internship and 2hrs from my college, I really like him and we talk all the time but he refuses to do a LDR and I think I ruined my chance of getting him to try one with our terrible date. We still talk all day everyday, just not as much, but I hope to see him again in May, but I am nervous to bring up the idea of a second date, I feel like we could be so great together if we could get over our hurdles. Has anyone ever gone through anything like this, can I redeem myself? Why if he wanted to be friends did he kiss me? And why did he mention it being a date?"

I have a bachelors of Science in Info Tech from a decent school not Ivory league but decent. I have tried talking to my professors for advice but they seem unwilling to give direction to even a straight question like does a masters degree help in the IT world. 

Clearly can't ask family who either tell me I'm dumb for going to college or respond with I don't know anything about that stuff. 

So I'm pretty deep in loan debt my choice and all but my current job doesn't cover beyond rent and food and internet. 

So a nearby university has a info security masters degree but the one class I have taken mainly involved the guy sounding paranoid about companies gathering data on you that you leave the USA your computers and phones will be compromised.

I don't disagree but I don't think its anymore likely in Europe then the USA that your device could be compromised. Anyways I dont feel challenged yet in the class it feels like a entry level. 

I was hoping for an education more on par with Offensive Security or CEH instead I fear this will be like a class where we password crack windows 98 with Cain&amp;Abel.

However I need to prove my skills and dedication to move from my light IT work experience of 2 jobs 2 internships all part time to at least a full time gig with the opportunity to earn a place in IT security.
the jobs and school have given me some experience in Cisco commands line, SQL, C#, Kali, Snort, Apple, Windows.

I have no certs I failed my first attempt at ccna and want to make sure I pass the second time. 

So basically I need career advice people how do I make my way into full time IT and eventually IT security. I'm lost is the masters a good path even if I'm not learning? Should I just give up? Because I'm like 29 now so maybe I'm to old for entry level.  

I need real honesty my friends do more then enough in the everything will be OK field. So please give me honest opinions that will help me move towards working in Info Security."

**Age**: 19

**Resources**: Very little. He's just out of school and is taking the internship so that he can pay rent at his shitty apartment.

**Species**: Human

**Physical Description**: [A pretty regular looking guy](http://i.imgur.com/yj6BX0E.jpg). Black hair, reasonably fit, wears casual clothes most of the time. He regularly has brown eyes, but these will turn ice blue when he is possessed by Thanatos.

**Mentality**: Thomas is generally pretty unremarkable in terms of how he acts. He cares very little about most things, just wanting his paycheck at the end of the day.

**Backstory**: Thomas is estranged from his family, and had to put himself through university. He's got quite a bit of student debt and is too stubborn to ask his family for help, despite the fact that he's had to resort to rather shady internships to pay it off. He's acknowledged that he'll do almost anything to get his paycheck as long as it's moral.

#Thanatos

**Age**: Unknown, extremely ancient

**Resources**: Nothing at the moment, the same as Thomas once he possesses him.

**Species**: Primordial Demon

**Physical Description**: For the most part a shapeless shadow. Once he possesses Thomas he will have a form that looks similar to his host, albeit with curled horns, large wings, sharp teeth, and a tail.

**Mentality**: A wretched, manipulative, and charming creature. Thanatos will do almost anything to get ahead and loves nothing more than to gain power.

**Backstory**: A time long before there were humans there emerged a demon. This demon was a killer, a destroyer, and most of all a conqueror. The demon spent countless millennia bored, with animals being nothing entertaining to rule over. When humans arose his interest was finally piqued. He had finally come across something that could pose as a game for him. He began to possess people, seeing how far he could get himself in a human society before getting bored and searching for a new body. 

He was only found once, and it was the last time he would visit earth for quite a long time. A great and powerful hero discovered his trickery and managed to defeat the demon, sealing him in hell indeterminately, never to return without a human host in which to travel.

***

**Proposed Tier**: Low 3

**Powers**

**Primordial Demon**: Thanatos is an unfathomably ancient demon, giving him extreme power, both physical and supernatural. This power is lessened when first using a human host, but will eventually grow back to full power if he keeps a host body for long enough.

**Telekinesis**: Thanatos possesses powerful telekinesis, which he can use in area of up to 50 meters around himself. This telekinesis acts an extension of his own body, and as such cannot effect the inside of objects.

**Shadow Element Manipulation**: Thanatos has a mastery over the dark and destructive aspects of elements. This gives him mid-level control over darkness, light, fire, water, earth, electricity, wind, and ice. The demonic tint to this power gives him an edge to those who are weak to unholy attacks and a disadvantage against those who resist them.

**Equipment**: Thomas' motorcycle.

**Strength**: Thanatos, in a new host body, is capable of lifting up to 12 tonnes, both with his body and with his telekinesis.

**Movement**: Thanatos is capable of running at up to 140mph and flying at up to 400mph while in a new host body.

**Defence**: Thanatos can withstand shots up to .50 calibre when in a new host body.

**Perception/Awareness**: Thanatos has a reaction speed of 9ms.

**Fighting Ability**: Thanatos is very experienced in mixing his telekinesis and elemental manipulation in his hand to hand combat.

**Danger**: Capable of destroying smaller buildings such as schools with single attacks, and capable of destroying large areas of cities if left unchecked.

**Weakness**: Holy attacks and weapons will deal additional damage to Thanatos, acting as if he's only got peak human durability."

Using a new account since she reddits. Trying to keep it straightforward, but let me know if I need to elaborate.

We went out from April to December and broke up/got back together once.

Once December hits, she has plans 5 days of every week. I have plans maybe a couple times out of the week and she gets all pissy saying things like ""have fun hanging out with someone who's not your gf"" and just being really passive aggressive. She also began to break plans with me which really frustrated me and she didn't really see it as a big deal. It finally came to a head way and we broke up again. 

I moved to a big city for an internship and everything was going great till the beginning of February. I get a late night text saying she found something of mine that I'd been looking for. We text a little back and forth where she ends up asking if I have gf, saying that she misses me more than I know, and that we should've never broken up etc. 

I go the next day to pick up what I had left and ask about the stuff she was asking me. Says she didn't mean for it to sound like we  should get back together and turns out she was out on a date with a ""friend"" while she was texting me the previous night. Don't really understand why she needed to tell me that. I was pretty hurt so I said some crappy things to her before I left. Not my finest moment.

We have classes starting in a month. We're going to have to see each other everyday. Idk why but I'm feeling a little uneasy about having classes with her. I know it shouldn't bother me, but it does. I guess because I'm not sure how I'm going to feel seeing her for the first time in so long. I doubt we'll talk and I hope she doesn't try to insert herself back into my life. 
I still feel something for her and I don't want to let her hurt me anymore. NC has been going good and I've been hitting the gym hard. Already lost 45 lbs.

Just looking for some encouragement/advice. Thanks!

   
**tl;dr**: Mandatory summary/question!
Me and gf broke up. She throws that she's dating in my face and we argue. We have classes starting up soon and not looking forward to seeing her. "

Research or Startup?,plokiju21,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4bb0nz/which_job_should_i_take_research_or_startup/,"Hi Reddit, I have a big decision coming up, and I was hoping to get some advice. I'm a third year computer science undergrad student. I think that I'd like to apply to do a masters in computer vision or machine learning after I graduate, but I don't know exactly what my long term goals are yet. I have two summer job offers; one is to do some bioinformatics work for a biology prof at my university, and another is to make educational apps in unity at a small start-up over the summer. 

The bioinformatics job would help me get some research experience to appeal to grad schools (I have none so far), but I think I'd be the only computer science student there, so I wouldn't be able to learn as much from others. Bioinformatics seems really interesting, but I'm kind of worried I'd end up just being tech support for the biology department. I'm not sure if I'm interested in bioinformatics as a career in the long term either, but I am interested in DNA and biology as a personal interest.

 The start up sounds like they're doing interesting work (they mentioned some computer vision things they're working on, which I love), but I have a feeling I'd mostly be doing less interesting bug fixes and related tasks as a summer student. Also, I already did a 16 month internship at a similar small company doing QA work, so maybe it would be beneficial to do a much different job this year, both to stand out on my resume and to get more perspective on what I want to do long term.

I understand there are a lot of other factors to consider between the two that I haven't mentioned, but from a career perspective, does one seem like a better idea to anyone? The jobs both seem like completely different paths, so it's hard to know what my best option is. I'm still trying to figure out my exact goals in life, but I want my resume to look attractive to both grad schools and the industry to leave my options open until I figure it out. Any advice would be greatly appreciated."

**Backstory**: A time long before there were humans there emerged a demon. This demon was a killer, a destroyer, and most of all a conqueror. The demon spent countless millennia bored, with animals being nothing entertaining to rule over. When humans arose his interest was finally piqued. He had finally come across something that could pose as a game for him. He began to possess people, seeing how far he could get himself in a human society before getting bored and searching for a new body. 

He was only found once, and it was the last time he would visit earth for quite a long time. A great and powerful hero discovered his trickery and managed to defeat the demon, sealing him in hell indeterminately, never to return without a human host in which to travel.

***

**Proposed Tier**: Low 3

**Powers**

**Primordial Demon**: Thanatos is an unfathomably ancient demon, giving him extreme power, both physical and supernatural. This power is lessened when first using a human host, but will eventually grow back to full power if he keeps a host body for long enough.

**Telekinesis**: Thanatos possesses powerful telekinesis, which he can use in area of up to 50 meters around himself. This telekinesis acts an extension of his own body, and as such cannot effect the inside of objects.

**Shadow Element Manipulation**: Thanatos has a mastery over the dark and destructive aspects of elements. This gives him mid-level control over darkness, light, fire, water, earth, electricity, wind, and ice. The demonic tint to this power gives him an edge to those who are weak to unholy attacks and a disadvantage against those who resist them.

**Equipment**: Thomas' motorcycle.

**Strength**: Thanatos, in a new host body, is capable of lifting up to 12 tonnes, both with his body and with his telekinesis.

**Movement**: Thanatos is capable of running at up to 140mph and flying at up to 400mph while in a new host body.

**Defence**: Thanatos can withstand shots up to .50 calibre when in a new host body.

**Perception/Awareness**: Thanatos has a reaction speed of 9ms.

**Fighting Ability**: Thanatos is very experienced in mixing his telekinesis and elemental manipulation in his hand to hand combat.

**Danger**: Capable of destroying smaller buildings such as schools with single attacks, and capable of destroying large areas of cities if left unchecked.

**Weakness**: Holy attacks and weapons will deal additional damage to Thanatos, acting as if he's only got peak human durability."

4bbt1l,3,2016-03-21,Help working with interconnecting classes,Ajunoo,vba,https://www.reddit.com/r/vba/comments/4bbt1l/help_working_with_interconnecting_classes/,"Hea Guys,
I am working as an intern in a firm and only started learning VBA recently (like 1-2 Months ago). 
I think I have a generally good grasp of the language, and at least usually know where to look. 
I have been tasked with designing a Little Excel Macro File for ""Project Management"". This would mean creating an overview over all running Projects and a Detail view of each one etc.

So far so good. I started learning how to work with custom classes and objects, but it turns out to be rather complicated. What i would like to do is this: Set up a Class for Projects, and one for Employees, and save Data there (easy). 
What I can't figure out is how to ""link"" these. I want to be able to easily read out and save which employee is part of which project, and how many hours he spent with it. (this is all Data I would like to just read from a Worksheet)

Additionally: is it somehow possible to create a new instance of for example the ""Project"" class with the press of a button (without the need for the user to understand and work with VBA?).
Same with employees: I'd like to have a worksheet that lists the employees, and create an instance for everyone in the list."
4bbt3h,4,2016-03-21,Choosing final project + further education + career path,IAmPrettyStuck,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/4bbt3h/choosing_final_project_further_education_career/,"I have 3 weeks internship left at a CompanyX who does IT outsourcing and I'm doing 1st level support. Then I need to do my final project, and afterwards decide on further education.

I would like your help, suggestions, and experiences with:

1. Decide on my final project
2. Decide on a new education
3. Decide on a career path.

I have a lot of thoughts, so sorry for my wall of text.

---

**Final project**  
It is recommended that we find a company who needs a solution, and then create it for them. I have the following possibilities:

1. Stay at CompanyX and create as much as possible of a WS12 RDP/DC/mail environment, while helping with 1st level support.  
++ More job experience. They can help me with my project. Higher chance of continuing in the company (see *education*)  
-- More 1st level work.
2. Find a new company that needs a solution, and create it.  
++ Experience in another company. I could create a solution someone needs.  
-- I have to find out which company. I lose a bit contact at CompanyX.
3. Find a project myself I find interesting. E.g. I am volunteering in an org. that needs Nagios that I could set up.  
++ I get to do exactly what I want. I could combine it with my CCNA study (see *education*).  
-- But not something to add to CV.

---

**Education**  
My education ends this semester, and I do not have a plan for what I should do. One thing is to start at another school which does apprenticeships (switching between company and school every few months), however it is a very practical education, pretty far from a university degree.

I see the following choices:

1. Start an apprenticeship at CompanyX.  
++ An easy choice, since I have contact with them. At least I can continue somewhere.  
-- I need to learn CCNA, because they will teach CCNP at the school.  More 1st level. They have bad security practices (same PWs for all clients), no password rotation **anywhere**, no cold backups I know of, etc. They hate on Cisco because of all kinds of reasons. All employees are young (avg. below 30).  
-- (All this doesn't sound as the best place to start your career IMO)
2. Find another company to do the apprenticeship at.  
++ I get experience with a new company.  
--  I have to find out which company.  
3. Find another education?
-- I probably have to move. I am not much for complex theories.
4. Find a job at a company?
-- Will most likely be helpdesk? And it stops my education path.

---

**Career path**
With both my final project and further education in mind, I have not idea what I want to specialize in. But I could see myself be a sysadmin. I am into automation/scripts, practical work with hardware, and security.

I see the choices:

1. Windows Server
2. Linux
3. Networking

Of course a sysadmin must know something about everything. But for example choosing an apprenticeship means I will be learning network through CCNA/P, and they teach Windows only.

**Any suggestions or ideas are very welcome! I feel like I am totally lost.**"

4bc3oc,0,2016-03-21,"28 [M4F] Michigan/US/Internet - Seeking to make acquaintances, with a chance of making friends, and potentially see the relationship evolve from there",Yossitaru,r4r,https://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/comments/4bc3oc/28_m4f_michiganusinternet_seeking_to_make/,"This may seem an odd first post to make on all of Reddit, but I have decided to go all out before I begin to second guess myself and decide to take no actions. I assure you, as best I can with static text, this account is neither throwaway nor trollish. If you recognize my name from elsewhere on the internet, then you are likely already familiar with me to some degree.

**Who Am I**

I am a white male of 28 years who still lives with his parents. I am unemployed but currently attempting to rectify that by taking further schooling with an internship built into the curriculum. I am an avid gamer who plays many types of games across several genres, nearly without exception. I also have a strong interest in programming and computers in general, which goes well with my already existing bachelor's degree in computer science. I tend to be of the quiet sort, keeping mostly to myself, especially in group settings; however, I can become very talkative in a private setting with one other person concerning topics that interest me. I have found myself to be my most awake during the nightly hours, where my largely sedentary lifestyle has found me to a sleeping schedule where I go to bed around 8 AM and wake about 3PM. My days tend to be fairly similar from day to day, but I occasionally add and remove tasks as I find my immediate desires shift and my time awake becoming too crowded. My current large, non-permanent task is self-teaching Japanese, which is coming along with varying degrees of success.


**Who I am Seeking**

I have found when I am conversing with females, I am more able to converse regarding emotions and other related topics. Over the last several years, there has been a constant desire for me to have an outlet for such things, however, with people I currently know, to have such a conversation is rare, and often long separated. Therefore, having someone in which I am able to confide and have such deeper conversations with is something I currently believe I desire. Someone with similar interests would certainly be beneficial to the foundation of such a friendship, but not absolutely mandatory. I believe it would be most beneficial for you to be roughly the same age as me, perhaps positive/negative deviation of four years or so.


**Further Information**

I do not partake of drugs or alcohol and would rather not have conversations regarding such topics. My musical preferences fall within the scopes of classical, jazz and the music of video game franchises I especially enjoy, though all three are mostly within the realms of listening to those genres, not so much talking about the artists and such behind the works. My ""television"" habits fall mostly within the realm of cartoons, largely on the side of adult cartoons such as those featured on Adult Swim and Comedy Central, as well as the Japanese Anime. However, I can appreciate the works of live action, both classic such as M*A*S*H, and the current such as Parks and Recreation.

*Further Further Information for Those Who Think a Step Beyond Friendship May Be Possible*

For the sake of those who do not care about my preferences in dating, you may safely skip this portion. For those interested, I feel that putting these thing out in the open now may prevent any shocking surprises from cropping up in the future, if any such a further relationship may occur.

My largest desires in seeking a girlfriend are as follows:

*Virgin - As a virgin myself, and as I have largely decided that I wish to have but a single mate ever, I wish to be with someone who has been with no one else before and would wish to only be with me ever, and I for her.

*Similar in personality, attitudes and morals - As well as most of what I've put above, as well as being similarly abstinent from drugs and alcohol, we will have to feel this out as we go. But hopefully if we both seek partners similarly, this should come naturally as we interact.

*Physically natural - This includes, but not entirely limited to, no tattoos, no piercings beyond one to each ear, does not employ the use of cosmetic products such as perfumes and ""make up"", does not shave body hair and does not have any cosmetic implants.


**Conclusion**

I realize this has been a huge chunk of text to go through, and if you have made it this far, I sincerely thank you for taking your time to read all of this. If you do find yourself interested in contacting me after all, please, send me a private message here on Reddit. While I do have other methods at my disposal, I would wish for us to begin interactions here and see how it pans out, rather than passing out my contact information all haphazardly. I do not expect to receive any responses to this bold and overly long posts, but if you do, I will respond as soon as I am capable of doing so; and again, think you for making your way through this massive wall of text."

4bceo3,34,2016-03-21,A long story in which an open non believer is called to be a leadership position with the youth.,MRN000-4902-0897,exmormon,https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/4bceo3/a_long_story_in_which_an_open_non_believer_is/,"WARNING, LONG

Backstory: I was serving in the young men's presidency when I left the church mentally. However, as I worked my way through the stages of grief &amp; learned more about the church, I realized that I enjoyed working with the young men. A lot of the boys needed a safe place to hang out &amp; playing dodgeball or having campouts served that purpose. Both of which I enjoyed. As I learned more &amp; more about the church, my lessons stopped citing scripture &amp; became more moralistic. I could teach with a clear conscience, but I wasn't obvious enough about the shift in material that anyone would know what's up (Although I got a lot of compliments on my lessons).

Last June I decided that it was better to be authentic than to continue this TBM charade even if it provided me a good service opportunity &amp; the boys a leader who would show up &amp; care about them. I set an appointment with bishop where I told him I didn't believe in any unique truth claims of the LDS church &amp; that the most I was willing to grant Jesus is that he may have been real, but if he was, not magical. I told my bishop that I'd felt this way for 2+ years. He could expect the same behavior as he'd been seeing from here on out, but that I wasn't going to pretend to believe it, at least to the adults. With the youth, I wouldn't teach LDS doctrine, but I would teach good principles. I wouldn't bring up 'anti' around the kids, but I would also not teach LDS doctrine. At the time I was the leader who showed up to everything &amp; the guy the young men went to sit around during priesthood because I knew them, played iPad apps, &amp; had an XBox (you know everything essential). What I'm trying to say is that I was doing my job well of being a young men's leader, aside from not believing in mormon doctrine. Back in June, my wife &amp; I stopped wearing garments &amp; I fully expected to be released. I told bishop that young men's was the last part of church that I enjoyed &amp; that the service was the last good thing I got from attendance. He spoke with his councilors &amp; the stake president &amp; they decided to leave me in.

Now to current events: Sorry for the long back story. Well it's March &amp; I'm still in young mens. My wife &amp; I have told a few people in the ward how we feel about the church when it comes up naturally &amp; we both feel a lot better. Often I just go to church for priesthood hour. It works for us where we are right now. I should mention that I have served under 3 young men's presidents as secretary. I assume I keep being left in because bishop knows I'll just stop going if he takes away the last thing I like (I'm not blackmailing him, I was just being honest when I told him that). 

Here's where things change. The current young men's president is leaving to intern in California. When asked by other adults in young men if I would be called to be president I replied, ""Nope, they know too much about me."" &amp; generally left it at that. On Saturday night I had an old BYU-I roommate over to play rocket league when I got a text from the bishopric second councilor asking if he could come over to chat for 15 minutes. I thought:

A) I'm either being released or called to something else. If it's a calling outside of young men's I'll pass &amp; continue my fade out. HOWEVER, if he's calling me to something else higher up in young mens I'll have to remind him that I don't believe, then accept as long as he remembers.

&amp; B) My old roommate doesn't know how I feel about church. Our relationship doesn't revolve around church so why try to inject it into it? Also most Mormons who ask about my defection either attempt to take me on as a special project (spoiler alert it doesn't turn out like an Ensign article) or they ask what a few of my issues are whereupon I offer them my copy of 'Insider's Guide to Mormon Origins' &amp; tell them I'll talk with them after they read that book which they have always declined. Those relationships get awkward because now I'm an antichrist to them spreading satan's gospel. What I'm trying to say is that it doesn't go well &amp; it's more important for me to keep my friends than to prove to them how right I think I am. SO, I hadn't told him. But if this bishopric member came over &amp; forced me to talk about it in front of my friend, it would be better that I talk to him before this guy popped over. 

So I did. I didn't say why I just explained that I might get extended a calling in which case something interesting might be discussed which he was unaware of. I explained that my wife &amp; I didn't wear garments any more nor believe in any uniquely LDS truth claims but that I wasn't keen to deconvert him, nor would I have brought it up were this guy not coming over because it had no place in our relationship. He went wide eyed, said that he had things he took issue with also, but that because he was in no position to preach, he was not going to undertake it. He also said that he wished I'd told him sooner. 

Bishopric shows up. I'm extended first councilor position. I ask if he remembers how I feel about the church. He says that everyone in the bishopric remembers, but that they feel that I'm a good influence on the boys so they'd like to keep me in. I accept. First councilor does the same job as secretary anyways. 

&amp; that's my story. There are a lot of people on here who call the LDS church a cult &amp; also espouse a black &amp; white view on church attendance without realizing that that view is one of the defining characteristics of a cult. I choose to reject that view. I think that any business, church, or person who has been around long enough will accumulate unsavory baggage. I know what the church's baggage is &amp; have redrawn my lines of involvement accordingly. They don't get my money or my mind. I will continue to use them as a source for service as long as it is a net win for me. I share John Larson of Mormon Expression's view that you don't have to tell anyone anything unless you feel like it. It's working for us.

That's the end of my soap box sermon. I just thought that it was funny how I stopped paying, praying, &amp; obeying, but was still invited back to lead the most impressionable age. I would think that a TBM would be aghast to learn that an atheist was going camping with their kids, but it's a little reassuring to learn that there are some mormon leaders who aren't so close minded. 
If you read this far I'll give you a bonus: After extending me the calling &amp; me reminding him that I don't believe, the bishopric member stuck around to play Rocket League for 20 minutes. Cool dude. Church needs more Rocket League, atheist appreciating, church leadership. 

I will close by bearing my testimony of Rocket League. I am grateful it finally came to XBox. In the name of my favorite car in the game, the Delorian, amen.

TDRL: In ward young men's presidency. Came out as unbeliever in June. Stopped paying tithing, wearing garments, but still enjoyed serving in young mens. While playing Rocket League with former BYU-I roommate bishopric came over to extend higher calling to me. Had to tell old roomie that I didn't believe because he didn't know. Am still in young mens even though bishop &amp; stake president know I am what they would call an atheist. "

Below is a list of the specific types of foods we had in mind, but these are just suggestions. Feel free to bring in anything non-perishable. 

Suggested Food Donation Items:
Broth, stock or bouillon cubes
-Chicken, beef or vegetable
Baby food and formula
Baking mixes
-Jiffy Cornbread mix
-Bisquick or other pancake mix
Canned fruits (in water)
-Applesauce

Two years ago I graduated college with an AAS. I immediately grabbed an internship position with a local small/medium IT company (under 110 employees, they do about $50,000,000 a year)

I successfully proved myself and was offered a full-time position as a network engineer at the end of the internship. They paid roughly half my moving costs to move to Seattle for the job. My accepted Salary was $70,000.

Instantly, my wife got pregnant with twins. Not devastating, as the money was decent and our insurance was fantastic. More and more went wrong with the twins. Twin to twin transfusion, both my sons nearly died. One was in renal failure, the other required 5 surgeries to come home. I  nearly lost my job missing work so much to be there for my sons and my wife. Things settled, the boys came home after almost 6 months in the NICU/PICU. 

My wife and I went through a lot and were separated from family. However, the pay and great insurance made it do-able. My job was kind enough to offer me a more cushy and local position. I'd be around family constantly and be able to work from home now and then and reduce my rent costs by about 75%. The kicker was, I took a 27,000 a year cut. 

My wife made it very clear we go home. At first, this was acceptable as the cost of living was so low back home compared to Seattle. Then my job switched health insurance. My coverage skyrocketed. I make about $3600 gross a month right now. Thanks to the horrible insurance costs, my take home pay is a measly 1300 every two weeks. 

We are floundering now, because health insurance no longer covers the special baby formula the boys require, my insurance premiums are nearly $600 a month. We live very frugally. Maybe $75 in groceries a week, netflix, hulu, comcast, $60 in electricity and $600 in rent, and a $340 car payment. and I feel like i work at mcdonalds for as little take home I have.


I'll be frank, I am having a panic attack. This job has been great to me, but I am seriously considering leaving as the pay isn't cutting it and the insurance is garbage. I am desperate for help and don't know what I can even do.

We have debt collectors calling for our old property we lived in saying we owe them a massive lease break fee I can't pay. I am freaking the fuck out.

I'm also the only person in the office he regularly has interactions with.

Here's the root of the issue: He has a bad cold, and he keeps wiping his nose with his bare hands and then putting his hand on the mouse. Part of me training him involves me touching said mouse. Frankly, it is disgusting. It is often moist and I am not sure if it's sweat or boogers (it is not visible on the mouse). 

He also coughs in his hand, and then immediately touches the mouse.

He is from a different culture than the rest of the office, but I am pretty sure this is gross everywhere. I am not sure it is appropriate for me to bring this up in any way though. I feel a strong urge to go wash my hands whenever I touch his computer, but doing so 5+ times a day immediately afterwards would be even more insulting. 

So far I've been trying to just ignore it. I also tried casually discussing coughing protocol with my coworkers in his presence, but he seemed to not be paying attention.

This makes all of his mistakes seem even more infuriating, as I know I will have to touch that mouse to fix them. I find myself struggling to be patient, even if so far (I hope) I have been friendly and professional.

Any kind of advice for me?

**tl;dr**: Intern wipes his nose with his hand and puts hand on mouse, that I then have to touch. Eww..."
4beg0s,4,2016-03-21,Internship Advice,evancaplan,geologycareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/geologycareers/comments/4beg0s/internship_advice/,"Hello All,

I am currently only a sophomore so when applying for internships this winter I realized that my resume was probably going to be thrown out of the mix of potential candidate's resumes. My prediction was correct, as I got only one contact back from an environmental company telling me they'd love to have me reapply next year after I take a hydro course. 

I applied for an internship with a company that has nothing to do with geology; in fact it has to do with importing and exporting logistics. The position is for a programming intern, and because I have a Computer Science minor, I thought, ""why not give it a shot?"" This company has called me back and would like to schedule an interview. This internship would encompass most of the basic programming languages, but mainly JavaScript. Would it be beneficial for me to take this interview as seriously as I would, say something related to geology? I feel like if I were able to get it I could use it to help market my computer science minor.

4beg8r,3,2016-03-21,"Flera frågor om arbete, lägenheter, osv. i Norrland",sjuktsnygg,TillSverige,https://www.reddit.com/r/TillSverige/comments/4beg8r/flera_frågor_om_arbete_lägenheter_osv_i_norrland/,"Ursäkta min långt ifrån perfekt svenska - hoppas det gör inte många problem att läsa

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Om mig (inte nödvanding att läsa om du vill inte): jag är 23 år, mitt fosterland är Litauen, jag studerar fysik nu (sista år), arbetar i IT säkerhet (1,5 år nu) i en stor europeisk bank, hade före arbetat som en teknisk förfättare (part time jobb i ett litauiskt IT företag) och hade en internship i networking (cisco) i samma banken. Asså min allt erfarenhet kommer från IT jobb. Jag talar litauiska (självklart), engelska (det är huvudspråk i mitt job), fortfarande lär mig svenska (kommer bli bättre än nu), lite rysska och lite franska.

Jag bor ensam nu med min katt i en 35 kv.m etta lägenhet i en area var mest bor ganska rika människor. Betalar jag 270eur (2498.79sek)/mån och i arbete får jag minst 700eur (6479.29sek), ofta mer därför att jag ofta arbetar på natten. Det beräknas som ganska mycket för en ensam 23år och många äldre människor får mindre.

Jag har nästan alltid drömt om att bo i Norden och sista året förstod jag att egentligen inget hållar mig här (har nästan inga vänner, nästan inte familj, osv :D). Jag besökte Norden flera gånger men nu resar jag nästan bara till Sverige (varje månad eller varje 2 månad) eftersom jag beslutade att jag tycker om Sverige mest. Jag har också flera svenska vänner och hittade pojkvän i Stockholm.

Jag skulle vilja bo i Norrland (asså Norrbottens, Västerbottens, Jämtlands, Västernorrlands eller Gävles län) mest. Och jag vill flytta efter 2 år eller lite tidigare om det blir möjligt. Måste ju graduera och få mer pengar och arbetserfarenhet.

Okej det var faktiskt långt... men nu vet ni allting av min situation! 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Nu kommer mina frågor:

1. Jag känner om housing crisis i Stockholm, Malmö och andra stora städer. Finns det nån housing crisis i Norrland? Jag har tittat på blocket.se ganska mycket och det ser ut som där finns ganska många platser för hyr, är det fel?

2. Jag har en katt. Det är säkert att han kommer med mig. Blir min möjlighet att hitta en lägenhet mycket mindre? T.ex här I Litauen ägarer säger ofta att de tillåtar inga husdjur men om man säger att man har en katt eller en liten hund *efter* kontrakt, ägare brukar säger ja okej. Jag själv bor i omöblerad lägenhet, köpte mina eget, alltså ägare sa först att det är inga problem med husdjur. Det är ovanlig att ägare skriver i sina annons nåt om djur alls här.

3. Jag har inte körkort - om min lägenhet står i en olika stad än mitt arbete men båda stor i samma län är det bekvämt med bussar, tågar?

4. Hur tidigt borde jag börja söka efter en lägenhet om jag vill åka där direkt när jag flyttar?

5. Hur tidigt borde jag börja söka efter ett jobb om jag vill börja att arbeta direkt? Jag tror under 2 år kunde jag spara pengar kanske for 1 månad i Sverige, så det skulle vara bra att få pengar från arbete nästa månad

6. Ser ut som många lägenheter finns för hyr bara för få månad, är det vanlig? Här har jag en kontrakt för 1 år och senare jag kan lämna när jag vill eller ägare kan säga 2 månad före hen vill mig att lämna. Det är vanligaste

7. Finns det några platser i Sverige var det är svårt att komma til Stockholm med buss/tåg/plan? Jag skulle vilja åka till min pojkvän ganska ofta (eller ta honom till mig). Nu träffas vi ett gång i månad för flera dagar i genomsnittet :/ 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Jag förstår att svarar kan vara olika men jag har ingen aning alls om hur är det. Tror jag att ni vet mer än mig iaf. Tack!"

For the WPI CS majors out there, any thoughts?  He's visited both and has a good sense of the size differences, surrounding areas, costs, quarters vs. semesters, etc.  RIT has a pretty large program focused on co-ops, WPI is smaller but offers project-based learning.  Do you like the quarter approach? Does it allow you enough time to really flesh out programming projects?  Do you feel limited by number of faculty or available resources?  Do you think  projects work as well as internships or co-ops for building real world experience (or do you supplement them with summer internships)? How are the internship opportunities at WPI? Sorry for so many questions, but would greatly appreciate real student input. Thanks!

4beo2b,7,2016-03-21,"Day one, first time (long, for self)",nmoreauouch,leaves,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/4beo2b/day_one_first_time_long_for_self/,"I’ve lurked in this sub for a while now but this is my first time posting. This is long and self indulgent, but it did feel good to write. 

I’ve been a daily smoker for about two years, the past year smoking 3-5 bowls (bong), about half the time alone and half the time with my stoner roommate. On night outs I smoke countless spliffs and frequent dabs with friends, but the smoking alone and during the day is what’s messing with me. 

Struggling most right now with depression, nausea, and anxiety. I surprisingly don’t want to rip a bong and get loaded but I would love a few tokes to get through the rest of the day. Right now I just want to curl up in bed and sleep; a little sativa would help me rejoin the day.


I’ve been dealing with depression for a few years to varying degrees. I started being a “stoner” (always having weed, smoking alone, being high was as normal, if not more normal than sober) after a really dark few months. Throughout high school and college I used weed and loved it, but usually only bought in grams or an 1/8 that would last me and friends a decent time. My depression got really bad in 2014 and I started drinking way too much – alone, in the morning, on the bus to work, at work, before a class I dreaded, to take the edge off while studying (which always ended the study session). Meds weren’t helping, I felt so weak and couldn’t find comfort in anything, and the stressors that put me in that place were acting as obstacles to even get the help I needed. Eventually I hit a breaking point and was hospitalized for a few days, which was a scary and difficult time but it definitely was needed. I was in my senior year of college and pretty quickly returned to drinking but managed to keep it a casual social activity for the most part. The copious amounts of whiskey in my little stomach over several months really fucked up my GI tract and I’ve been dealing with debilitating daily nausea since. I couldn’t eat, lost a lot of weight, and just felt and looked like a ghost of who I should have been. This is when I started buying weed for personal use and smoking daily. 

It began just as a means to eat; I would go the whole day without being able to hold down food and struggle through my obligations, then get home, smoke a bowl, eat a huge meal, and relax for the rest of the evening. It was a godsend at first. It lifted my spirits, it gave me great insights, it was a fun thing to share with friends, it let me eat (and actually love the food), it quieted my nightmares, it stopped my 4am panic attacks, and at this point it felt like the only thing keeping me functional and alive. I was already on heavy doses of sertraline so the fog wasn’t even a noticeably symptom. It seemed to actually help make me feel better, even when I wasn’t directly high, and eventually it seemed to help more than anything else I’ve tried. 

I went home for my last college winter break (last year) and was extremely bored, still depressed, socially isolated, and just locked inside due to the cold, snow, and quiet nature of my hometown. Weed was cheap, I had some money, my brother smoked and enlightened me on the smoke buddy. So in that month or so home I began smoking morning, noon, and night. When I returned for my final semester, things were more tolerable but still really hard emotionally. The problems I had hadn’t disappeared – my mom is a depressed alcoholic and I’m her go-to confident, one of my brothers was dealing with serious drug problems and started having horrific paranoid psychoses, my first love broke my heart, my family was broke and I was the last kid in college so I felt like such a huge financial burden even though I was busting my ass to work 25 hours a week while being a full time student. The depression has been with me since high school; I was sexually assaulted and never dealt with it properly, just completely repressing and dismissing it for years until I was hospitalized, but I still never have had a consistent doctor or counselor or even friend that I’ve been able to open up about it with in a way that did more than just bring up unbearable feelings for a conversation or two. I know I have a fortunate life and I hate myself for being ungrateful and letting the bad things run my mind, but these have been some very difficult couple years and I feel like no matter how hard I try to get better, another shitty life thing happens. I feel like I’m treading water and though I keep learning tricks like how to paddle my arms better or take deeper gulps of air when I surface, the waves get bigger and heavier and I just can’t keep up. I’m so fucking exhausted of being so sad all the time. I know this world is so beautiful and limitless and I feel like I’m wasting away such a fortunate experience but I’m trying and just can’t seem to succeed. I’m not searching for eternal happiness or instant fulfillment, but fuck, I’m just so tired of being depressed and feeling alone. 

Weed has helped me stay afloat this whole time. I’ve managed to be pretty damn functional if I do say so myself, graduating an accelerated pre-medical program at a good school with a fly GPA and a rewarding internship at an inner city clinic. I’ve taken a gap year this year as I work to save money, apply to med schools, and get my mental health sorted. After graduating I began smoking like I did that first winter break, and essentially haven’t lost that momentum since. Pot has kept me afloat, but I do just feel like I’m floating now. At first I loved being a stoner; I was living in my own room for the first time, relishing in the break from school and the fresh air of autonomy. I’ve been functional, I’ve been doing fine work at my easy job, studying for my exams when I force myself, being social at least a few times a week. I spent months flip flopping between quitting/cutting back and just not worrying about it so much – because hey, I’m only 21, I’m only smoking an 1/8-1/4 a week, this is my first year of using this heavily, it’s ok when you’re young, nothing *bad* has happened. But I miss not being a stoner. I miss not being exhausted all the time, I miss being strong enough to deal with my emotions, I miss leaving my bed and feeling excited to do things and be a part of life. 

At the beginning of this year I began to cut back. I met someone, he made me really happy. Happier than I expected, happier than I realized I could feel. He inspired me to pursue my old interests that I’d been putting off, he made me want to work hard and tire myself out rather than be the lazy goon I’ve been, he made me feel embarrassed about my drug use (not that he ever put it down or complained about it, but in a good way where he made me realize this wasn’t the way to live). While I was with him I had several 24/+ hours without weed and in general dropped down my daily usage. It made it even more clear that I’ve been using weed to fill a void. A couple of weeks ago we broke up. He never mentioned an issue with the weed, but I know if I was my normal self, not this stoner version, the whole relationship would have been better. It breaks my heart to think this, I feel like we would have had something pretty terrific if I wasn’t this muted version of myself, whether it’s from the drugs, the depression, or both. Even with that realization, I let myself be high and heartbroken for nearly a whole week. I also wrote, started exercising, forced myself to socialize, restarted antidepressants, and tried to channel the painful energy into making myself the kind of person that deserves to be with someone like him. I’d like to be motivated to be better for myself, too, but I don’t have the love for myself that I have for others yet, so this is what’s helping me right now. 

That week of heavy weed started turning into two, and then I realized this isn’t going to go away on its own. I’ve been gearing up to quit for a week or so, even getting excited about facing the challenge the past few days. All week I weaned down to 2-3 smaller bowls per day and only vaped, which helped a lot. This weekend I smoked a lot of spliffs and joints with friends as usual, probably undoing whatever vaping helped, but that was just for solo smoking. On Sunday, I woke up at my friend’s place, we smoked (smoked, talked, laughed, watched cartoons, ate cereal and drank espresso – a beautiful morning, why was I quitting again?) and I returned home without a stash for the first time in a long ass time. I relished in the high that afternoon and felt it fade away, giving it a sincere and long awaited goodbye. Today, I woke up for work, terribly nauseas, and nearly vomited from brushing my teeth – usually the moment when I rationalize a small toke in the morning is fine, it would stop the nausea, help me prepare for a day at a job I hate, ease the heartache that comes from those fucking dreams where my ex and I are still happily together, and I could eat a big breakfast to start the day right. I fought through the urge and talked myself out of the reasons: I can face shitty feelings without drugs, everyone hates their job at some point in their life, heartache just means it was a romance worth having, I need to learn to eat without weed sometime, etc. I was proud when I started my commute on time and actually liked that I wasn’t high on the bus and could get some work done. 

Then shit hit the fan as it always seems to when you get an ounce of control back in your life. My mom called to tell me my brother relapsed last night and they were in the hospital with him. He went out in the city, did a lot of drugs, got lost in a bad part of town, and got the shit beaten out of him. He’s been doing really well lately and we’ve all been pulling for him with all we’ve got, but it looks like he’s starting to show schizophrenic tendencies again and we’re terrified he’s going to be labelled with that diagnosis for the rest of his life. He’s so fucking smart and an incredible person and it absolutely breaks my heart to know he’s facing this, I wish I could do something. I tried to stick with my day, continue on, what could I do for him out of state anyway? I went to some bullshit meetings and did my work for the morning, then met up with a friend for lunch because I knew I needed some reminder of the good things in my life. My friend was wonderful and I’m grateful for him but our conversation ended with me finding out that the ex-boy is most likely sleeping with someone else. This girl was a mutual friend of ours, they had slept together casually once or twice in the past before I met him, and during our break up it came out that some of the things she had said to each of us separately while we were together were pretty plainly manipulations to cause a rift between us. This hurt so badly, it felt like a betrayal from both him and the former friend. I’d like to think I would have handled it better if I hadn’t already been pushing hard through the bad feelings about my brother, but it was pretty much a confirmation of one of my biggest insecurities about our relationship and it fucking hurt. It was barely 2:00 and I felt broken.

I took a half day, sobbed silently in the bathroom, took the bus home and a half klonopin my doctor gave me for anxiety. I want to smoke so badly. I hate that I use it to bandage bad feelings, but I’m so torn about that because it doesn’t just numb the feelings, I feel like I take some puffs and gain insight. I lose anxiety and feel better – definitely the drug – but the best part is that I feel like I gain perspective of my issues and where I am in the world; I smoke and feel like I see things more objectively, and it helps ease the pain even after the high is gone. I *like* smoking, I don’t even have a problem with being reclusive or fairly sedentary, but I feel like I’m never actually going to get better until I stop smoking so much, and I think I need to abstain for a while before I can truly kick the habit of smoking alone.

I’m trying to take one month off of weed. I’ve never done a break before and the fact that it seems crazy hard is what makes me think it’s necessary. But fuck, it is hard. I’m so scared that I’m not going to improve, and instead this will just be more depression. The depression fucking scares me, I dread feeling as low as I have in the past. It’s bad now but not anywhere near as bad as it’s been, and the idea of dropping that low and hopeless again scares me more than anything else in my life. I want a long term improvement, and I’m hoping this break from weed will help that. 

This is a really goddamn hard Day One for me. I want to just give up today, pick up just a g and start again in a few days. But what if every Day One is like this? I know everyone has troubles every day. Today just seems like too much. I wish I had something that brings me happiness. I have plenty of great things in life, but I miss those moments with that boy where I actually felt happy, not just a lessening or even absence of pain. I want those feelings back and I know there has to be other ways to get them. I just wish I knew how.

Over the past 6 months or so I've developed a huge interest in finance. I seriously love it. I don't have as much time to learn it as I'd like, but so far I've been following the market every day, reading The Economist and Bloomberg, and I've gone through Yale's Financial Markets class by Robert Shiller and try to read and watch as much about finance concepts as I can. I've also been running a portfolio on a stock simulator and spending a lot of time on managing it. I also just ordered a couple of finance and investing books to pour over.

I'd like to consider a career in FinTech, but I have to admit that it's mostly foreign to me. Of course I know of HFT and algotrading. Can someone walk me through what people with CS degrees can do in finance and how to get there? I don't go to a target school (big public state school) but I have a great GPA, a lot of projects and technical skills, and an internship at a finance company and another one at Amazon coming up. Also work in an AI lab on campus. Any advice?

Edit: I should add that I'm not ruling out a career in the tech industry. It's more like I just want to be able to consider all my options and I'm intrigued by the idea of applying my knowledge to finance."

All this combined, I was overwhelmed, lost control and let PMO take over my body; I let it happen. (I feel so weak after this - energy wise)

Its a shame that I went over 50+ days, only to reset it today (I even lost my badge now - I hit the reset button). Surprisingly, I feel no different when I used to PMO vs when I stopped. I am not sure if this flatline has something to do with it because I've asked a [question](https://iy.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/47k6i6/its_been_4_weeks_and_i_see_no_results_please/) in the past about my issue (i.e. my recovery wasn't much of a recovery).

Today I just turned down an offer at another company which offered me a position in the summer or the fall. I refused because 1) the ""co-op"" office already signed a contract with the first company that hired me and 2) the job is different, but not necessarily guaranteed to be better.

Am I freaking out over small things or should I take this seriously? I'm contemplating pulling out but I wouldn't want to get on the bad side of the career office that might eventually help me get a full-time job later.

4bfh0u,262,2016-03-21,Sex with the intern (m/f),clivebixbyfl,gonewildstories,https://www.reddit.com/r/gonewildstories/comments/4bfh0u/sex_with_the_intern_mf/,"Note: I have been very lucky to have a lot of sex with a lot of beautiful women, so I wanted to document some of these experiences. They are all 100% true (except names). Just as a point of reference, I am often told I look like Vin Diesel (though I don't see it at all)-I am 6'1, 210, shaved head, blue eyes, tattoos, muscular build, late 30's, live in Florida. I will try to answer any and all questions! If you are looking strictly for the sex part, scroll down awhile.

My company was acquired and as part of the agreement I had to stay on with the firm for a period of three years. They gave me a nice executive title and placed me on their Board of Directors, I was actually quite surprised at how much I liked the new company. The atmosphere was very laid back, and a really fun group to work with.
I quickly integrated with my new coworkers, and found myself very comfortable. As I got to know my coworkers, I was surprised at how many beautiful women there were. I made a conscious decision to do what I have always done and not date anyone employed there. But damn, at this office that was a challenge; it was a young team and they partied as hard as they worked.

Fast forward a few years and I had kept that promise, and was promoted and given an extension to my soon to be ending contract. Life was good. Then one Monday I was asked to interview a potential intern. When Rachel walked in I was floored. She was about 5'7, 110, with really toned legs and ass, accented by the heels and tight skirt she was wearing. She had dirty blonde hair, green eyes, and small boobs (which were perfect). After getting through the typical get to know you questions, we began to delve into a deeper discussion where I learned she graduated fifth in her class from one of the most prestigious schools in the country. I gave my input that she would definitely be an asset and she was hired.

Rachel didn't work in my department so my interaction with her was minimal (thank god), but whenever we did bump into each other the conversation flowed freely and we found that we had lots in common. One Thursday, the office through a Happy Hour at a local bar and as you would guess, Rachel was there; and looking beautiful I might add. I did my best to keep away but eventually she approached me as I leaned against the bar. I was impressed when she ordered a Scotch (neat)- same as me. As we talked, I found out I was 18 years older than her. So, now, i am not only an executive at the company she is interning at, but I am also old enough to be her Dad. Good times.

Before we realized it, we were talking for probably 20 minutes or so; I excused myself explaining I needed to 'work the room' a bit. She smiled. As I walked away, I said to myself ""don't look back, just keep walking""- but I turned back and found Rachel's eyes locked on mine. I immediately felt a flash of heat; and knew I was in trouble.

As the night wrapped up, I asked one of my coworkers, Rob, if he needed a ride back to the office to grab his car. Rachel said she needed a ride back too. I thought to myself that we had a 'chaperone' so it wouldn't be a problem and told her no problem. As the three of us were heading to my car all I could think about was fucking Rachel but knowing it would be career suicide if I did. I had carefully navigated the shark infested waters of corporate America by not doing stupid shit. This would undoubtedly qualify as stupid shit. Anyway, as we approach my car, Rob decides he wants one more drink and will find another ride back. Oh boy, here it goes. I truly tried to find a reason why I couldn't take Rachel back, but couldn't think fast enough; probably because all the blood had rushed to my cock. As we were driving, we made small talk about sports. I was determined to drop her off and simply go home and jerk off incessantly. Another 5 miles and I would be in the clear....that's when Rachel said that she felt like she was probably too drunk to drive and would I mind just dropping her at her apartment. Gulp. As we approached her complex I had predetermined that I wouldn't walk her to the door which I would always do for any woman I drop off.

She pointed to a parking spot and told me to pull in. I put the car in park and told her to get in safe. She asked if I wanted to come in for one more drink. I swear I said no, but five minutes later I was sitting on her couch with a glass in my hand. I was still determined to drink my drink and leave, but I just couldn't bring myself to go. Rachel was sitting so close I could smell her hair, and it was intoxicating. Before I knew it she was really close; our faces were a few inches apart and I weakly said that we can't do this. She said that she knows.... But then she kissed me. I should have pushed her away. I didn't. I pulled her to me, and within seconds she was straddling me (difficult in the skirt she was wearing), and we were making out hard. This went on for a few minutes and the whole time I was thinking I have to stop but I was being betrayed by my dick.

She got off of me- I was thankful, thinking she realized it was a mistake- but she quickly said lets go to her room. Again, I honestly said no we can't....but here I was laying on her bed. She started to unbutton my shirt, before I knew it, it was off. I guess she didn't know that both of my arms are sleeved (tattoos) as she studied them all, remarking that she loved the ink. So now I am shirtless, she is wearing her skirt still- which she slowly took off. She absolutely knew what she was doing to me and she loved seeing the guy that's totally in control, completely mesmerized. She slowly undid my belt- all while making eye contact- and slid my pants down. She started to gently nibble on my dick through my underwear which was driving me insane. She then slid those off as well and quickly put me into her hot, wet mouth. All I could think about was that when I was 22 girls didn't give this good of a blowjob. She was all mouth, with no hands, and could really take me deep. Every now and then she would take it out and rub it all over her face, and then quickly put it back in her mouth. I was surprised at how fast I felt like I had to cum and told her, she just went faster and faster until i exploded down her throat. She swallowed it all, not spilling a drop and kept sucking until I was soft. I chuckled to myself under my breath that at least I didn't fuck her; I was channeling my inner Bill Clinton!

You know how right after you cum you can think clearly again? Well, I was thinking clearly and knew I had to leave. As I got up and put my pants on, Rachel got on all fours on her bed (in a matching black thong/bra) and joked that how could I leave her like this...I said I really had to leave. She said ok,but said she would have to play with herself, as she started to reach under her panties from behind and rub her pussy. I am weak. I cracked. It was that easy.

I quickly pulled my pants off, jumped onto the bed and started kissing all over her perfect ass from behind, before moving her thong aside to lick her pussy from behind. And her asshole. I alternated between the two and couldn't get enough of her. I had never tasted anyone that tasted better than her. As I was licking her ass, I reached under her pubic bone and gently applied a little pressure... It didn't take long before she started to moan and collapsed onto her stomach shaking. Within seconds she jumped up, and grabbed a condom from her drawer and put it on my already completely hard dick. She straddled me and lowered herself, alternating between grinding against me and then bouncing up and down- all the while making out and a lot of eye contact. It was really hot, some of the best sex I've ever had. We went at it like this for what felt like hours but was actually probably five minutes, until Rachel grabbed the base of my dick and as she slid up, she took the condom off. Before I could say anything, she had put my cock back into her tight hole. Who am I kidding, I wouldn't have said anything anyway... But here we go....but now I can feel every bit of her slickness and every corner of her cunt... And I realize I don't have long. I told her I had to cum, Rachel put both hands on my shoulders and kept grinding into me, telling me to cum. I came so fucking hard, I felt the contractions long after I was done emptying my cum into her... And she made eye contact the entire time. Such a turn on. But again, now I have cum, so the reality has set in...I fucked the intern(which I could get fired for, I did it without a condom, and for added bonus I came inside of her without having any clue if she was on birth control(found out later she was). But just one bad decision after another... And I wasn't done.

The next day at work I was determined to be business as usual- but by 11am, I was in the woman's bathroom with Rachel's hands against the wall and me eating her pussy from behind, before fucking her as hard as I could before cumming inside her again. She was nice enough to clean me off with her mouth before I pulled my pants up...but I knew this was spiraling out of control quickly.
I wish I could tell you that I wised up and stopped fucking her. That wouldn't be true. And I know at some point this can and will bite me in the ass."

I was uncertain about it until I attended a city government meeting for my internship and saw a few environmental attorneys speak on a local ecological issue. I was reinspired and one particular attorney caught my eye.

After a few weeks, I contacted the firm through a basic ""contact us"" message on their site and told them about the attorney I listened to. She actually was informed of the message and emailed me saying thanks (because I mentioned how well she spoke at the meeting and how I was inspired by it). 


*Main Part* In her email, she says that I can ask her any questions about her career after the winter break ended. I waited until a week after it did and emailed her a few basic questions. She never replied.

I recently found her on LinkedIn. I hoped that by sending a connect invite that she would remember me and reply to my email. She didn't seem to accept it, but she viewed my profile. Still, she hasn't replied to my email.

I'm just sad.)

I know these get posted all the time, but I just feel so broken right now. I know it's only 2 months til I see him again, but it was 2 months last time and it seriously felt like FOREVER. It felt like a year. We basically lived together for 2.5 years, and then he went to med school and I flew across the country for an internship, and it was the absolute longest 2 months of my life. Before this, I've never been away from him for this amount of time before. And now here I am, starting all over again, Day 1. I know it will only get better, that each day is one day less until I can see him again, but it's soooo hard. 

And it's worse because I'm dealing with my own stress - on top of it being 2 months and some odd days before I see him, it's also 2 months minus 1 day until I take the MCAT (which I feel totally unprepared for, btw), which will basically determine my future since I need an insane score to be competitive. So here I am, lonely and anxious in a big, unfamiliar city across the country without much time to socialize because of my internship and this test, and missing him so much my heart physically hurts. I can't concentrate. It's worse in the evening - I'm usually OK during the day - but right now it really fucking *sucks*.

I know I should be concentrating on my test and this amazing internship opportunity but some nights it's really, really hard because I miss my SO more than anything. I have a great support network back home, I have friends and my SO who I can talk to and rant to and who have my back via text (and FaceTime, my SO and I still FaceTime every night and have basically since he left for med school last August), but as much as it helps, it's not the same as having them here in person.

I know it will get better because when I left for this internship back in January it was definitely this hard and I did adjust, but wow. I didn't realize re-adjusting after 1 week of spring break (4 days with my family, 4 days with my SO) would be this bad all over again. I cried on the way to the airport. I cried on the plane. I felt better this morning, did some studying, made some coffee, popped into work. Then I FaceTimed my SO and it was great, but when I hung up the only thing running through my head was, ""Wow, yesterday I was talking to him in person and now I'm only going to see him on this tiny little screen for the next 2 months.""

LDR just blows. It really, really does. He's absolutely fucking worth it to me, but this is still really hard. I just can't fucking wait for the day when I can say ""goodnight"" instead of ""goodbye"" :/"

My name is Lillian Lemmer, I'm the President/CEO of Hypatia Software Organization.

As of today, we’re an unincorporated association which thrives in our Slack team. We're a community working together to get impoverished transgender women careers in software engineering. We do this with:

  * Safe spaces, culture which is nurturing and psychologically safe. Amazing code of conduct.
  * Mentors, who are professional software engineers, work with impoverished transgender women to get them jobs and lasting careers in software engineering. Trans women will select their own mentor and appointment slot.
  * Support mentors with a standardized curriculum, maximized for employability.
  * Internship experience contributing to our MIT-licensed open source software projects.
  * Provide job references and recommendations when an enrolled transgender woman has demonstrated capability.
  * Develop professional connections by establishing a reputation through our quality free software projects! Show people we’re amazing software engineers.
  * Freelance entity: trans women may use HSO as a conduit to contracts which employ them for software engineering work. See: hire us.
  * We encourage you to read more about our programs for transgender women.

Our key performance indicators:

  * number of trans women who have found jobs
  * Average employment duration
  * Percentage of trans and cis females in org (at least 80%)
  * Number of reluctant sex workers to stable careers
  * Number of homeless to stable careers

A lot of people wonder why we're so discriminatory, solely focusing on trans women. We came about because transgender safe spaces and feminist spaces haven't been good to us, as trans women, and that through solidarity, empathy over sympathy, that we can use that understanding to mend our problems as a community. This effort is to empower impoverished trans women by providing a psychologically safe community for transgender women to proliferate, since it's an issue I spotted in my community and wanted to address.

4bg25y,6,2016-03-22,"My significant other is suicidal, and I'm almost as hopeless about his situation as he is",almosthopelesss,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/4bg25y/my_significant_other_is_suicidal_and_im_almost_as/,"I really wish there was a succinct way to describe this situation, but I'm afraid it will lack essential context if I don't essentially say everything. If no one bothers to read enough to reply, at least it will maybe help me to get all this out in some form. 

During my first two years of college (starting in 2012), I (a guy) was going through a slutty phase as I realized I like dudes and that having sex was easier than I could have ever imagined given the availability of apps made for that purpose. I was enjoying the company of different people and had no objective/hope of meeting a person to settle down with for an extended period of time, i.e. someone to call my boyfriend or to ever plan on marrying. 

Anyway, I met my current boyfriend through an app about two and a half years ago. He didn't seem like the kind to casually hook up based on our conversation, but I was still interested enough to go on a date, because I do enjoy meeting interesting people even if I don't get to have sex with them. He was less attractive than I expected/hoped and more ""obviously gay"" than I'd prefer, but good enough to have fun with, I thought. He was an international student and his English was quite good but not good enough that he could keep up with my jokes. In any case, conversation flowed pretty smoothly and I enjoyed his company and talking to him. We went on a couple of dates before he invited me to his apartment, where we ended up sleeping together, which was more enjoyable than any of my previous experiences.

We kept seeing each other; I kept spending the night at his place, he cooked for me, and we'd been to some events together, though I was still deep enough in the closet that I was uncomfortable with people (especially ones I know) thinking we were together (or that I was gay), so I avoided holding his hand (despite his wishes) pretty much anywhere where there were people around. I was getting everything I really wanted from my relationship with him, so I felt no need to try to hook up with other people. I should also mention that he had a girlfriend (who he was never really attracted to given he didn't really like girls, but they were both from the same country and benefited from having each other). He broke up with her a few months after we began seeing each other; he felt very badly about it and realized he hurt her by finding someone else (especially a dude), but I helped him justify it by (validly) pointing out that it was not a happy or healthy relationship. 

I spent more and more time with him, at the expense of going out on the weekends and developing friendships. I essentially lived with him all of junior year, only using the apartment I was actually renting as a storage place. I knew this was bad for me, but spending time with him was both comfortable/easy and sexually satisfying. Gradually, I realized our relationship was becoming serious, and I became more ok with that idea, but I still saw an end to it at some point in the future, probably when he graduated (since he was two years ahead of me; only one year if he stayed to get his master's degree, which he did). I told him at the time that I never really wanted anything more than a friend with benefits from the app I used to find him. That bothered him, but both of us felt ok because we acknowledged our relationship was more meaningful than that. He used the l-word some time later (probably less than a year in), but it took me a few more months to do the same. I said I loved him without really knowing what love meant; we had been happy together too long for me not to love him, right? I mean, I did feel affection for him in a way I hadn't felt for anyone before, but my experience was admittedly quite limited.

At some point (can't remember exactly when, but I think after more than a year), he mentioned getting married, and began explaining to me why marriage is really the only way he can avoid having to go back to his country and fulfilling military service obligations. It wasn't clear to me at the time, but going back to his country was essentially a nightmare scenario for him, and I later learned he'd rather kill himself than be faced with that responsibility. 

Foolishly, I allowed marriage to linger as a possibility in our future, but it always felt like a daunting path for me and was hopeful that we'd amicably split once he graduated. However, our relationship continued at a steady pace, and it became increasingly difficult for me to find valid reasons why we should end it given that we still got along great and were happy together. We survived a summer of separation when we had internships in different parts of the country, and we saw no inescapable reason not to continue our relationship after he graduated and moved 500 miles away. I drove to visit him a few times and he made it increasingly clear to me that he couldn't imagine living a life in which he couldn't stay in the country. Despite my insistence that this was not a healthy way to think and that he should really get help, part of me saw him as too rational of a person to take his own life. He was quite positive and pragmatic and concerned with regular worries almost all of the time, but when talk of our future came up, any suggestion on my part that maybe marriage isn't the right decision made him very upset and caused him to once again start talking about suicide. 

I'm now at an impasse. I realize it is very unlikely that I would be happy with him in the long term, because I simply do not feel like I have had enough relationship experiences and do not feel complete without the freedom to meet other people, have sex with other people, etc. I know of open relationships, but that is not something he can accept. 

But that is my entirely selfish perspective. I also realize that I do feel good with him, we get along fairly well, and it is possible that we'll have an enjoyable life together if I let go of these ""grass is always greener on the other side"" thoughts and accept our relationship despite my potentially unrealistic/irrational desire for more. But then there are times when I feel completely trapped and suffocated by this relationship with a person who I still don't really find attractive (his body is great, and sex/kissing/cuddling is enjoyable, but his face is something I've simply had to learn to tolerate). In those times, I'll get easily irritated by some of his actions and imperfections and think that I don't want to have to put up with it for my entire life. 

On the other hand, he's essentially guilting me into marrying him by threatening me (not explicitly, but close enough) with suicide. He's an only child who grew up spoiled and never was really forced to deal with not having what he wanted, even though he's worked very hard to reach his goals. But I can tell that he's a kind person who is actually suffering a lot, so I could not live with myself if I look out for my own good and learn that he's hurt or killed himself. 

Despite that long wall of text, there is still a lot I left out which didn't seem to smoothly fit into the narrative as I laid it out. Here are some other details, though things will surely still be left out, and I can add more details in the comments if it seems helpful:

-the very serious prospect of marrying him was the reason I came out to my parents last summer; they reacted badly, but I can handle it, and they're getting better; they would still rather see me with a girl I don't love than with a guy that I do

-I do actually like girls; I've told my parents this, and they can't fathom why I wouldn't just choose a normal, easy life with a girl/wife, and I honestly can't disagree with that, other than to point out that it would require throwing away my existing relationship

-I've cheated on him, repeatedly, while we were in different parts of the country, and have gotten away with it every time (though some times through shameless lying, which he believed because he trusted me); I must be some kind of soulless, evil, weak piece of garbage because I managed to enjoy myself every time despite knowing it would devastate him if he found out; nevertheless, the temptation/reward was too great when I was away from him for extended periods of time

-I'm currently dating a girl that I like very much (but who I know I can't be with past my graduation in two months; we're both enjoying it as long as it lasts); I used Tinder under the pretext that I just wanted to find people to spend time with given that I don't have many close friends in college; that's what I told him, and it was largely true, though I wasn't personally opposed to being intimate with people I met, though he specified it should be just for friends; the girl I met does not know I have a boyfriend (although she does know I like guys)

-he and I have recently talked extensively (on the phone; he's still 500 miles away) and he is, after much convincing from me, ok with me seeing this girl, sleeping in the same bed as her, cuddling with her, and kissing her, as long as there's no sex and as long as it ends as soon as I graduate; he said he may relax the conditions (except the end date) as long as I'm honest about what I do with her and as long as he doesn't feel ignored or kept out of the loop; this conversation happened after he freaked out due to gaps of 2-6 hours in between my responses to him starting at about 6pm on Friday night, despite me telling him earlier that I would be with this girl; I learned that he is not ok with his messages being ignored for more than 2 hours, except if I have other non-romantic commitments. He likely only accepted my relationship with her because he essentially depends on me to stay in this country, so he's motivated/forced to forgive things that may normally be unacceptable.

I realize I'm likely a piece of shit of a human being and that I'm guilty of manipulating a person's feelings and taking advantage of his trust just so that I'm not alone. Yes, I've benefited from it, but to be truly honest, the only reason I haven't ended it within the last year is because I'm genuinely afraid he will kill himself. I was the only really close person he had at our university and in this country; I helped him move twice, and I was his emotional support through a lot of his difficulties. In a tearful conversation about a year ago, I promised him that I would find a job near him (done) and marry him if that's what he needs to be able to stay here and if that will keep him from killing himself. He took that as a promise that I will marry him. But then and later and recently, I've made it obvious to him that I am very uncertain about our future and getting married, and this has given him nightmares that he can't trust me to keep my promise and that I will abandon him and he'll be left alone and will have to kill himself to avoid going back to his country. 

Selfishly, the thing for me to do is to tell him how I truly feel about our future (I have mostly done this already, multiple times) and distance myself from him. But this carries the risk of him killing himself, not only due to not having me, but due to the very likely and real possibility he will have to go back to his country. 

I know there are supposedly resources available for people who are feeling suicidal, but I know him well enough to tell that they would likely do him no good (just as I don't think they would do me any good). I can't force him to see a therapist and he has no desire to, and I honestly am highly skeptical of their effectiveness in this situation. I've extensively researched other suicide prevention resources, and I honestly feel like recommending any of them to him carries a significant risk of making things worse, given that I can't force him to give any of them a fair chance, beyond just pointing him to them and hoping for the best. Much like me, he's a fairly logical and pragmatic person, and we're both neither religious nor believers that talking to a professional/stranger will help. I mean, the two of us have talked extensively and I can't seem to help him see any hope. He seems reluctant to talk honestly to anyone else because he thinks they can't help him with his problems, and that they're his own problems so they should be his to deal with and not anyone else's burden. 

On the other hand, I could just suck it up and marry him. I'm young, so I have time to recover from mistakes, in case I'm not happy in our marriage. While I do feel like I have many itches to scratch, perhaps I'll be sufficiently satisfied being married to him that I'll become content and not want anything else. It is definitely financially beneficial (for both of us) to get married and live together. This decision would sidestep the suicide issue, but it would still not fix whatever thought processes would lead him to suicide in difficult situations. 

The latest I hear from him is ""I just want to live in peace, even if that means I no longer exist."" ""I don’t know. I don’t want to think about it. It’s too stressful. I’m very emotionally fragile right now. I just want to live in peace. and maybe that place is heaven."" 

I feel like I've tried my best and I don't know of anything else that I have any confidence can improve things. Speaking to him in person or through video gives me the confidence that he's too pragmatic to end his life given all the things he has going for him. Unless we veer toward this sensitive subject, we'll spend most of our time talking about fairly mundane things about his work or what he's eating or whatnot. But his text messages make me think I should expect to stop hearing from him at any point. I feel like people like him are the ones who _need_ religion, because they are too weak to survive difficulties when they don't have something/someone that they feel they can trust fully and rely on all the time, e.g. God, but he's too skeptical to buy into any of it, just like I would be. Any guidance?

During the summer, I am also planning to get grasp on one language that'll help me land a job.

One one hand, there's Java. It's got many job opportunities, but mainly in SE. And I kinda don't enjoy the language as much.

On the other hand there's scala. Thanks to Spark , it's gaining traction. And I enjoy writing in it. But the job opputunities are far  less in Scala compared to Java.

I read the FAQ already, which has been helpful, but it doesn't really help me shake any of my anxiety.

For some context, I am intending to major in CS at UC Berkeley, and it seems like everyone I know is getting internships. What also seems to be the case is that everyone either has good grades or has tons of CS experience. Or both.

Recently, a lot of my classmates and friends have been receiving offers from companies for summer internships, and I'm stressing out because I've just started looking. To make matters worse, I have no job experience and my first semester GPA was a 3.0. My parents aren't really a helpful in the way that while they can offer moral support, they can't really give any helpful advice.

So my question is: Where can I look for internship opportunities other than LinkedIn? Should I still send in a resume/cover letter if a company has a ""3.3 GPA requirement"", or any qualifications that I don't quite meet in general? Any general advice for someone in my situation? Even though it's a bad mentality, I really don't want to settle for not having an internship when everyone around me is..."

This post is part of [My Career Series](http://allenchou.net/my-career/).  
  
_Note: This post was written before Uncharted 4 went gold, so it might contain tones or implications that Uncharted 4 hasn't gone gold yet. Sorry for the confusion._  
  
I started working on [Uncharted 4: A Thief's End](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncharted_4:_A_Thief%27s_End) almost two years ago, and here we are, less than two months before release. This would be my first shipped title as a full-time game programmer (I shipped [Planetary Annihilation](http://www.uberent.com/pa/) during a summer internship). Looking back now, I realized that I've really come a long way since I first wanted to make games more than a decade ago. I would like to take this opportunity to write down this journey to share with you and as a note for myself.  
  
  
**I Wanted to Work at A Game Store**  
  
My first contact with video games was when my dad got me an original [Game Boy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Boy) as a present while I was in kindergarten. My only two games were [Super Mario Land](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario_Land) and [Tetris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetris_(Game_Boy)). That's when I got hooked on video games. Later, I saw my cousins getting a Super Nintendo (SNES) when I was in 2nd grade. I went over and played with them pretty frequently, but we had to take turns as the SNES only has two controllers. After bugging my parents, I finally got my own SNES to play with. My favorite games were the [Super Bomberman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bomberman) series. I even went and got all of the Bomberman games on the Game Boy.  
  
In 4th grade, one of my friends brought over his Nintendo 64 (N64) and [Super Mario 64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario_64); that was my first time playing a 3D game and it blew my mind. My friend and I made a deal where I would buy games slightly more frequently than he would, and we took turns owning the N64 and the games every couple months.  
  
Around this time, when asked what I wanted to do in the future, I would say that I wanted to work at a game store so that ""I could play video games all-day during work."" This all changed when, in 5th grade, my homeroom teacher brought a PlayStation (PS1) to school to let us play while we waited for our parents to pick us up after school. One day, as we watched in awe as he showed off how good he was at playing games, he said:  
  
""You know what's more impressive than being good at playing games? Making games.""  
  
That, was when I decided that I wanted to make video games.  
  
  
**My Pre-Programming Phase**  
  
Back then, I knew of almost no resources on how to make video games. The best thing I was able to do was make very basic animations that reacted to mouse clicks in [Macromedia Flash 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Flash), which I learned in computer classes. In middle school, I picked up a 3D modeling software called [TrueSpace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TrueSpace) and started experimenting with building simple character models, which I hoped would be someday used in a game (of course this didn't happen).  
  
When I started high school, I joined the Computer Research Club, in hopes of finally learning the technology behind making video games. On the first club lecture, I discovered that I did not like programming and preferred making game art; programming seemed daunting to me and not as visually attractive as art back then. So, I was detached from the programming aspect of game development for a while and focused on learning [Photoshop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Photoshop) and [3ds Max](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autodesk_3ds_Max).  
  
I was introduced to [deviantART](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeviantArt) by a friend of mine in Canada. I started making and submitting art work to deviantART (both 2D &amp; 3D) quite frequently; also, I picked up a lot of spoken English and internet slang along the way. After noticing some Flash games uploaded to deviantART, my interest in making games with Flash re-kindled; I gave another try at programming, and once I got through the steep initial learning curve, it didn't seem as daunting as it had before. I started using [Swift3D](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swift_3D) to render 3D models into Flash vector format to put in games. My most complete project was a bunny dancing game called ""R-Squared de Dance!"" which, unfortunately, was never fully finished and was lost. I did submit to deviantART a [Valentine's Day wallpaper](http://cjcat2266.deviantart.com/art/R-squared-Valentine-s-Day-23314724) with all 4 characters, though.  
  
  
**My First Contact with A [Naughty Dog](http://www.naughtydog.com/) Game**  
  
One of my friends visited me and brought his PlayStation 2 (PS2) from the US, along with a copy of [Jak and Daxter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jak_and_Daxter). The PS2 games sold in Taiwan were mostly Japanese titles; this was my first time seeing a PS2 title from the US. I only heard about [Crash Bandicoot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crash_Bandicoot) back in the PS1 days and didn't know that it was developed by the same studio that made Jak and Daxter. Shortly after, during my sophomore year in high school, I got a PS2 because I couldn't resist the temptation after hearing all of my friends talking about their PS2 games during lunch breaks.  
  
During a summer break, my family went to visit some friends in California. I saw that their kids also had a PS2, with a whole collection of US games I'd never seen before. Intrigued, I asked them to bring me to a local game store. They brought me to a GameStop, and on the shelves I spotted a copy of [Jak X: Combat Racing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jak_X:_Combat_Racing). That ""weird-looking green-haired guy with an orange giant squirrel-like sidekick"" instantly reminded me of my first sight of the original Jak and Daxter. I thought it looked interesting and decided to give it a try, so I picked up the game.  
  
Jak X brought me a cinematic gaming sensation I had never experienced before. That was when Naughty Dog made a mark on me. I started having crazy thoughts about how amazing it would be if I could work at Naughty Dog. So there I was, staring at Naughty Dog's website, clicking the tempting hyperlink that read ""Want to join us? Click here!"" A question popped up: ""Are you still a student?"" After clicking ""yes"", I landed on a page that basically told me that Naughty Dog did not have opening for interns and ""If you want to join us after graduation, you should pay more attention in math classes."" This, was the pivotal moment that made me adjust my attitudes towards math classes. Math became my favorite subject in high school, and I put a lot of effort in mastering vectors, matrices, geometry, statistics, combinatorics, and probability.  
  
Fun fact: I tried programming a solver for linear systems of two variables in [ActionScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ActionScript), so that I could use it to do my math homework. I did not handle divions-by-zero, and when the computer told me the answers were [NaN's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NaN), I thought it was mocking me for being a noob, which has similar pronunciation in Chinese to NaN.  
  
In my last high school semester, our Chinese teacher asked us to write a mock-up letter addressed to our dream company, be it real or fictional, and describe ""why they should hire you."" I was the only person writing a letter to a foreign company which, of course, was Naughty Dog. Back then in Taiwan, working for a game company was generally frowned upon by parents and teachers, as video games were ""what made kids bad."" However, I did have good grades, so my teacher did not give me a hard time for wanting to work at a game company.  
  
And there came the nation-wide joint college entrance exam.  
  
  
**Addiction to Naughty Dog Games**  
  
I did pretty well in the exam, so I basically got to choose whichever college and whatever major I wanted. Determined to make games and becoming interested in programming again, I told my parents that I wanted to major in Computer Science. My dad, however, advised against that and suggested that I major in Electrical Engineering. He said that, as a pediatrician, he spent seven years in medical school learning everything besides pediatrics, and focused on pediatrics after becoming a medical intern; his argument was that I should not hop directly into focusing on what I was most interested in with tunnel vision, and should learn other related disciplines first, so that I could have a broader view.  
  
My dad was pretty convincing, so I agreed; I chose Electrical Engineering and focused on hardware stuff, including electronics and integrated circuit design. Meanwhile, I still took some classes from the Computer Science department. Having a low-level understanding of hardware did make it easier for me to learn programming and computer architecture. For instance, I learned how to build computer memory from logic gates, and that helped me understand how memory access works. I also got to learn the gate-level design of full-adders and multipliers, hence their differences and why one is more computationally expensive than the other.  
  
After my parents sent my sister to attend high school in the US, I remembered the fun I had with Jak X, so I asked my sister to send me copies of the Jak trilogy. As I went through the three games, witnessing the incredible work put into the game design and storytelling, I admired Naughty Dog even more and officially became addicted to their games. I went to Naughty Dog's website once more, and saw the reveal trailer of their secret PlayStation 3 (PS3) project, later known to be [Uncharted: Drake's Fortune](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncharted:_Drake%27s_Fortune). I wasn't very into shooters, ""but it's Naughty Dog, it's got to be good."" So I picked up a copy of Uncharted when I visited my sister in the US during a summer break; knowing that the PS3 was not region-locked, I waited until I returned to Taiwan to get a PS3.  
  
I played Uncharted. It was fun and technically impressive; I mean, look at the WATER on Drake's pants! However, it didn't give me the same charm as the Jak trilogy. To me, it felt like just another visually impressive action shooter with endless waves of enemies for target practice. So Naughty Dog dropped off my radar for a while.  
  
Two years later (junior year), I saw the [E3 live demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z5pjDpszLM) of [Uncharted 2: Among Thieves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncharted_2:_Among_Thieves). It completely blew me away. Did Drake just slide down and jump out of a COLLAPSING BUILDING, while IN-GAME? That sealed the deal. I got the game on release and powered through it; it was such an incredible game: stunning visuals, fun gameplay, awesome storytelling, and lovable characters. This was when I re-gained interest in Naughty Dog.  
  
Then, I graduated from college.  
  
  
**Going Abroad &amp; Joining The Kennel**  
  
Before I started my one-year mandatory military service, I applied for the undergrad program at a college focused on game development, called [DigiPen Institute of Technology](http://www.digipen.edu). I've already written about [my story at DigiPen](http://allenchou.net/2015/07/digipen-the-game-school-i-went-to/), so I'll fast-forward a little bit. [Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncharted_3:_Drake%27s_Deception) came out during my second semester at DigiPen. In spite of a few flaws in storytelling, I still thought the game was fantastic, just when I thought I couldn't like Naughty Dog more.  
  
Soon after, Naughty Dog released the [reveal trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLGxubfC1Ik) for [The Last of Us](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_of_Us). This game completely caught me by surprise; a serious post-apocalyptic survival game is quite different from Uncharted's lighthearted adventures. I thought it was a nice change of mood and appreciated that Naughty Dog was willing to try something different. At PAX Prime 2012, I went to Naughty Dog's booth that showed a live demo of The Last of Us. The interior of the demo room was set up to look like the rundown hotel where Joel and Ellie fought the hunters. The demo itself was an impressive demonstration of hardcore gameplay, where Joel and Ellie fought for survival while out-numbered and out-gunned. Such harsh circumstances and pressure imposed on the player was a first among Naughty Dog games. After the demo, I got an Ellie T-shirt and lined up to get an autographed poster by [Neil Druckmann](https://twitter.com/Neil_Druckmann) and [Bruce Straley](https://twitter.com/bruce_straley).  
  
I got a copy of the The Last of Us right upon release. Being able to emotionally connect to game characters is such a rare and beautiful experience. Ellie felt like a real companion, not just some emotionless sidekick controlled by AI. The rich interactions between Joel and Ellie made the story feel so alive; they fought together, they cared for each other, they shared jokes, and they experienced the same emotions together. Not many games had reached such level of compelling storytelling. I gave Naughty Dog my deepest admiration and respect, again.  
  
When studying at DigiPen, I always had the slightest hope that some day I might end up working at Naughty Dog. After successfully landing an internship at [Uber Entertainment](http://www.uberent.com/) and attending various career workshops at DigiPen, I was confident that I could get a job straight out of college. I had all these plans in my head: getting a job around the Seattle area where DigiPen is (perhaps [Wargaming](http://www.wargaming.net/), [ArenaNet](https://www.arena.net/), or [Sucker Punch](http://suckerpunch.playstation.com/)), working in the industry for a few years, applying for job at Naughty Dog, and then finally working there if I was lucky.  
  
Little did I know that destiny would speed up this plan a little bit for me, where I came straight to Naughty Dog after graduating from DigiPen. You can read this story in detail [here](http://allenchou.net/2014/02/joining-naughty-dogs-kennel/).  
  
So here I am, working at my favorite studio, making Uncharted 4. As a huge Naughty Dog fan, I feel so honored to be working on the closing chapter of Nathan Drake's adventure.  
  
This has really been an uncharted journey.  
  
After Uncharted 4 is released, I will write about what I have been working on since I started at Naughty Dog. Stay tuned. :)"
4bhm91,5,2016-03-22,How much to charge?,mast3rpi3c3,freelance,https://www.reddit.com/r/freelance/comments/4bhm91/how_much_to_charge/,"Hi guys, I got a few questions about how much to charge.  So I am in the running for a consulting/freelance job (I would say consulting because it is long term and I will not be their full time employee) in social media marketing for a food stall in a mall (in the food court).

The owner has hired a media firm/PR firm, but has more or less decided to go with me, probably depending on price really.  This will be my first consulting job, but I have minor experience in social media marketing through a paid practicum (like an internship).

I gave her a proposal of what I was going to do, update posts 3-5 times a day on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram, create and maintain a Google+ and Yelp account, create simple blogs for her website and maintain them, create advertisements (might be the most time consuming of all the things I am going to do) and maybe a video per week on YouTube, and maybe (big maybe) an app.

But I have yet to decide on price.  The media firm/PR firm looks like it charged $30 a month (from the website, but I will call to confirm), but they are not going to do as nearly as much as I am.  They made the website (Wordpress), and update facebook about 4 times in 2 months.  I don’t want to scare her off (although I don’t NEED this job, it would be a nice flow of extra income), I was thinking maybe $20 an hour, 4 hours a day, 7 days a week.

Any and all comments and opinions are greatly appreciated!  Thanks!


EDIT - Thanks for the responses guys.  After some thinking and much more research, I decided to to a 3 tier plan.  As I went through and did a lot  more thinking, I decided that I should do this for experience, as this is just my beginning.

Unfortunately, the owner did chose the cheapest tier (lol), which is roughly $720 a month after taxes.  Thanks guys for all the help!

I spent the last 18 months working as a part-time full-stack webdev and more recently left that position for a part-time security researcher position (I had actually applied for an internship).

I see a lot of worried posts regarding having no internships, and while I'm not concerned in the least, I'm curious as to what the thoughts of the community are regarding this.

Does part-time work == internship == coop? Is one better than the other? 

The main advantage I can think of for internships is the possibility of getting your foot in the door at a ""big 4"", but I'm not too fanatical about that."

I’m at a cross roads and I’m not sure which option would be best for me to get where I want in my career. At the end of the day, I want to work in environmental consulting, hopefully in a major Canadian city. My school has a pretty awful coop program so I haven’t been able to do any internships so I don’t have any experience in the field. I also don’t have very many connections in the field. I’ve been accepted into a couple Master’s programs but I’m not sure what I should do. All the programs are related to contaminant hydrogeology so they are relevant to what I want to do but in all honesty, I’d like to avoid staying in school if possible.       
 
   It seems my two options are:   1. Cold email people and hope something turns up or   2. Accept a master’s program, get experience and hopefully network, then try again in 2 years.   

I’m not sure what I should do. I don’t want to stay in school but most of all, I don’t want to take on an extended period without income as I don’t have any savings I can survive off of. So I can either take the gamble and try and find a job this spring, or play it safe and do the masters.  If any of you have been in a similar situation, do you have any advice?

I just applied for an internship in risk management at TD Ameritrade brokerage firm and I am a nervous wreck. I am slightly neurotic by nature but still it's crazy. The job really seems like a perfect fit. I am a physics and math major and the two interviewers were both physics majors too. They stressed the importance of knowing how to solve problems and how coming from a hard science background is great for this position. I checked both those boxes given my physics research experience and my passion to solve problems. I made that very obvious and they could sense my excitement.
I just didn't feel like they were overly impressed at the end. We were joking around and we went 20 minutes past the allotted time. My weakness is not having a great proficiency in coding languages. I have learned the basic fundamentals for Java, C++, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript but certainly not enough to perform serious tasks. 
I don't know, I really want this job so I think I'm just overthinking but I constantly am thinking about the other candidates they're interviewing. I have a 3.0 gpa so it's good but not great. I looked up the past intern on LinkedIn and she has a very impressive résumé. 
I wonder if despite all the hard work I put into contacting people I know at the firm and reaching out to recruiters and the countless hours I've spent on cover letters and a résumé for this internship is all a waste just because I'm going to be beaten out by someone more impressive. 
Ok I'm done now. Stay classy San Diego

Tl;dr I applied for an internship and put a lot of work into landing an interview and I wonder if it doesn't matter because someone will be more qualified.

However, I am torn between them, and my deadline to choose is this Friday. Background on me: junior at a pretty good school, with no prior internship experience.

Company A is a startup that seems to be very well funded-they have been growing very quickly and are headed by a team of executives who have been successful in growing a startup in this area in the past. Their office is very nice and modern, the people that work there are closer to my age, and the pay is slightly better than company B. However, the position I was offered is with the front-end team, so I would be primarily working with HTML/CSS/JavaScript, which are not really my areas of expertise as I only have basic experience with all of them.

Company B is a more traditional company. It is slightly larger than company A and has been around much longer. They do contract work for the military and aim to build intelligent systems (think AI/ML). They have a lot of PhD's, generally appear to be older, the office environment is less exciting/new, and they pay a little less, although they offered to potentially negotiate up to the other offer. Here I would be working with Java, which I do not really know currently but I am not worried as much about because I have experience with C++/Python.

So my question is this: for someone like myself, where this will be the only internship I have before graduation, which should I choose? I have interests in both fields, but since this will be my only experience, I am worried about being pigeon-holed into front-end dev jobs when I apply to full-time next year with company A. With company B, I am worried that I will find the work boring or will be stuck to more menial tasks due to my lack of academic experience in the areas of ML/AI. Overall, I could see myself working in either field as a full-time job, but I am not sure which I would pick at this point since they are so different.

Any help/insight to this situation would be greatly appreciated!"

I got an internship position at Texas Instruments for this summer (May through August), and am currently searching for an apartment. I'll be moving from out of state so I don't really know the area too well, so I'm hoping you guys can give me a few recommendations.

Some considerations:

* I don't own a car (at least not yet, so we will assume I won't throughout my time in Dallas) so most of traveling will be on foot or public transportation. That being said, I'm hoping to find a place somewhat near a grocery store at least.

* I'll be located at the Richardson Fab which is pretty far from the other TI locations based on my Google Maps searches. I wouldn't mind a longer commute as long as the apartment is in a good location.

* I'm hoping to find a place with a maximum rent of $1000 for a 1 bedroom/1 bathroom or studio apartment.

I've looked into apartments in The Village area and they seem okay, since there's a Target, Walmart and a mall around there, though the commute would be rather long. I've also looked into some in the Churchill Way/ Park Central Drive area that seem okay but there doesn't seem to be a grocery store within walking distance around there.

I'll be continuing my search so any recommendations/advice would be greatly appreciated! I'd also love to hear any TI stories you may have!"

One of them said most could not pass a FizzBuzz test. So I went to find the test to see how I'd do. So far, 3 months of learning with CodeAcademy, Automate the Boring Stuff, and CodeCombat (Silly one I know, but it really helped to embed concepts). 



&gt;The ""Fizz-Buzz test"" is an interview question designed to help filter out the 99.5% of programming job candidates who can't seem to program their way out of a wet paper bag. The text of the programming assignment is as follows:

&gt;""Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five print “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz”.""

99.5% is surely exaggerating, but it made me feel good for a while that I was able to do this between 5-10 minutes of thinking and tinkering. It's a small milestone for most. 

What other tests like this indicate if you're ready to take on an internship to work with python?"

If it matters, I am a Junior.

I tend to look at the requirements, do some investigation, and then fiddle with things until it works. As an example, I am working with SQL and dealing with a lot of logic and most of the time I change some logic around without really knowing what will happen or at least not right away. If it works, I run a bunch of test cases on it and move on if it continues to work, if it doesn't then I repeat the process. 

I am kind of worried as the more I read, I feel that I am lacking on the knowledge of looking at a problem, writing down a solution, and then going to implement it. I usually have some rough ideas of how to get the data (join x to y and a to b) but when it gets down to it and it isn't producing results, I just start fiddling until a new idea comes or fiddling works out. The worst part is that most often if I don't finish the task in one sitting, it takes me some (sometimes quite a bit) of ramp up time to remember where I was/everything I did the next sitting. I've tried taking some notes now after each session to reduce this but it still happens and ultimately I feel like I'm wasting time. I'm not sure if this is because a lot of things are still new (lots of new tables/data models) or the style of approaching problems is not as well-planned and more experimentation based.

Has anyone ever felt this way and moved towards a more 'sound' approach to solving problems?"

So much is going on in my life that I'm feeling overwhelmed, today especially. So I decided to do the irresponsible thing today; skip class and get pissant drunk. 

I don't know what to do with my life, and I'm just further flushing it down the shitter as I freeze up and isolate myself from everyone. 

The biggest issue to me, that kinda just broke the camel's back so to say, is my relationship with my best friend. I have strong feelings for him (call it infatuation or love, IDK) and he knows it, but I can't seem to accept his answer that he isn't romantically attracted to me. He was at one point, but now he doesn't know why he isn't, more so having doubts of even trying to see if a relationship would work. Now I feel as of my feelings have ruined our friendship because things have definitely changed between us. Plus I feel stressed out and depressed just seeing his name on Skype let alone hanging out with him in person. 

Now add that on to my school work. I'm  behind on my online, commute an hour three days a week for residential classes, and have fallen behind on my required internship hours. 

Work doesn't help, because it's the best job I've held right now, but I still dislike it. Work just stresses me out and takes up the rest of the time I'm not in school. 

Mondays are all I have off, and I go to a game shop to play MLPCCG on those evenings. Speaking of which, hanging out with friends have become a burden because I have to schedule my hangouts around everything else. It doesn't help that some friends live an hour away and others live here and we hangout late evenings until 3am.

And I don't wanna be that guy, but my suicidal ideations have come started to come back too. 

Life just seems like work now, and I needed to vent and get drunk. Maybe I'll play some Stardew Valley and get rejected by the romantic interests like in real life."

I make a fairly low salary for the position I am in, and I am sure I will make far more as full time, but how should I ask for a raise for between now and then? Or should I not even ask until I go full time? Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!"

I don't remember how to reimage a PC using our imaging system, set up the VPN on the laptops, and set up our programs on the macs. I'm going back full time this summer and I feel like they expect me to just jump back into it. I'm sure some of it will come back to me, and I took notes on some of it, but what if I forget?

4bkjwb,16,2016-03-22,[Warning] Plays.TV just erased an entire year of manually saved video clips that I was planning to create something from.,Rivalistic,Amd,https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/4bkjwb/warning_playstv_just_erased_an_entire_year_of/,"**Update:**Thanks to the smart people below, I've downloaded Diskdigger, and searched for all .mp4 videos. It managed to look even *further* back past the important year videos. So I'm assuming, I'm in the clear and can proceed with getting my files back. Thank you guys.

**Update 2** Nope, shit's gone.

__

I play an MMO. During my playtime,I have importnat moments that last 15+ minutes. I allow Raptr to record 30 min segments and save them without me specifically hitting CTRL+F2 to save moments; also allowing it to auto manage the memory. I had it set to 800GB and when an important string of events would happen, I would manually go into the Raptr folder at the end of the night, and place them somewhere else on the hard drive to avoid the automatic clean up; This place was in different folders on the desktop, organized and named accordingly.  I had these sets of videos all organized liked this in preparation for a **huge** video project in the future, pretty much detailing my game play over a year of playing this MMO. My life was fine. Literally fine. I could die happy like this if nothing had changed.

Then my graphics card (R9 390x) auto updated. Plays.TV makes an appearance on my computer, unwelcomed might I add, I had automatic driver updates **DISABLED** yet my graphics card still updated and started using Plays.TV over Raptr.

Well, okay, I thought. It seemed to perform the same job as raptr but it looks like it created a whole new folder. Well I tried to remedy that by going to the settings and have it sync with the old Raptr folder. Having not known what the hell Plays.TV even was, and the settings UI being new to me, My first attempt was to change [this setting here](http://i.imgur.com/fpBtzDx.png). Immediately after clicking the select folder button, I realise there was an Auto Sync button at the bottom of my screen. I go to cancel the file browser and ended up accidentally clicking ""Select Folder"". Well , it was on my desktop during that selection, so it chose my desktop. I went back and immediately fixed it, moved on to syncing correctly and then I was done.

Open up the ""Edit Videos"" window for Plays.TV, and see that it has grabbed **Every. Single. Video** from my desktop, and I mean **all** videos. Including all of the organized videos spanning over a year of carefully handpicked content filled with precious memories and even videos that had nothing to do with raptr/Plays.TV. I thought it was really odd to be showing videos from my desktop, especially after I had already gone back and changed Plays.TV to just save to the \Videos\PlaysTV folder prior to opening the edit videos window.

Next thing you know, Plays.TV's automatic manage space feature kicks in, and proceeds to delete every single video in every single folder on my desktop because either they were too old or they didn't have the .txt associated with them anymore but they were still named however Raptr named them. I'm saying that because I am assuming it would treat videos named using Raptr/Plays.TV naming convention with no associated .txt/metadata as temporary videos, thus deleting them.

They all head toward the recycling bin, and the recycling bin reaches max capacity instantly and begins actually hard deleting my videos. I lost everything except for the last 2-3 days of game play. None of which had any importance anyway.

I have been royally fucked. This is a warning to everyone who has not updated to the version of crimson that forces Plays.TV to replace Raptr. They ""Fixed what wasn't broke"" and ended up completely fucking me over.
Also back your shizzle up. I didn't do that, and some programming intern up at AMD/Plays.TV just punished me for that. Thanks buddy."

4bkrv6,15,2016-03-22,I feel really lost: Computer Science to Computer Information Systems major,sweetkairi,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/4bkrv6/i_feel_really_lost_computer_science_to_computer/,"(I posted this on college confidential as well)

So I'm in my second semester of my freshman year at The City College of New York (CCNY for short). It's an okay school, and I am a computer science major. I'm required to take calculus 1, 2, 3, and differential equations (something like that). I had to drop calculus 1 last semester because I did really bad on the midterm (it was an evening class, my schedule was a whole mess and I really wasn't prepared for the transition to college). I'm retaking it this semester and it's a struggle but I'm definitely understanding the material more. 

I am also taking an Intro to CS course where we're learning C++, and its honestly really hard. The material went from moderate to really complicated, my midterm is in 2 days, and I'm honestly considering dropping the class. I'm not the only one either; most of the class is really lost and the recitation TAs don't help us at all. We literally show up, take a 15 minute quiz (which is impossible, how are we supposed to figure out a C++ problem in 15 minutes???), and leave an hour before the class ends. A friend and I tried to ask the TA for help before a quiz (since we always have a lot of spare time after the quiz is done) and he just said, ""no, we have a quiz soon"". When someone asked him about tutoring, he told us to use the message board where we can ask questions and the instructor posts up announcements, not actual/physical tutoring. We have had 2 group projects so far and the TA was supposed to make us explain/present them in class, but our TA seems like he doesn't know about them. Doubt they'll get graded. I know a fair amount of Python, Ruby and JavaScript, and honestly I dislike how C++ is taught here. I learned through workshops and an interactive classroom setting, more hands-on. The professor here always backtracks, doesn't fully explain things, and kinda assumes we know more than we actually do. The only other Intro to CS professor is even worse.

I've come to realize that this major may not be for me and even though I love programming (when I can learn at my own pace and I have the benefit of a good instructor), I'm terrible at math. I don't think I can deal with another 3 semesters of math. A friend who was a Computer Science major at Pace told me she did well in all her programming classes but her math classes really lowered her GPA. She never graduated and she only had 1 year left.

I'm honestly considering switching from Computer Science (CS) to Computer Information Systems (CIS); it's more of what I want to do with security and programming mixed together, and it involves a lot less math. I'm considering transferring to the New York City College of Technology (City Tech for short) since it has a 2-year program for CIS, and then a Bachelors in Technology if I want to continue, and CCNY doesn't have this major. Only problem is, I've been talking to friends, current students, and graduates, and I keep getting mixed reviews.
Some enjoy the school; one was a CIS major who's graduating soon and he enjoyed how it was very hands-on. He currently works for the MTA. I also heard that there's a lot of internship and job opportunities that are offered (no one takes advantage of them though so its a lot of space available). However, other people have told me that the buildings aren't well-maintained, the environment can be depressing, the students are ""lazy"" (they go to class but don't really excel and a lot play video games in the cafeteria all day), and it feels like high school. Some told me that the professors weren't great, and some don't offer office hours/tutoring. Most classes aren't difficult and the work is ""mediocre"" (a current student's words). I heard from two CS majors that the major classes are hard, and the CIS major who's graduating said the transition from CS to CIS should be smooth. He also enjoyed the school and the environment didn't bother him.

Another problem is that the graduation rate for City Tech is very low: like 15-25% in 6 years or so. I asked a previous student and he said that it's low because a lot of people end up transferring out or dropping out, and a lot of older adults come back while working to take classes /certifications. I'm not entirely sure how a graduation rate is calculated but the low rate in this school really bothers me.

They take walk-ins until August for admission to Fall 2016, and it's not selective at all. My counselor for a success program I'm in is currently on vacation so I have to wait to hear back form her next week about this. I've asked plenty of people and even though I'm 90% set on transferring, I'm not sure if it's the right decision. CCNY has a better reputation, but City Tech has the major I want. I also commute from home: 1 hour and a half for CCNY, while City Tech is only about 20-30 minutes away. It would be a better commute for me and I'd be learning what I want, but I don't know if I'm making a mistake.

A friend who has been working in the programming/IT industry for almost 20 years has told me that it doesn't really matter where you get your degree from or if you even have one sometimes: its about your work experience in the field. And that's true: I've looked at job applications that ask for 5+ years experience, not necessarily a 4-year degree. I do want to get a degree eventually, and I also want to take advantage of internships, but I'm not 100% sure if I'll excel at City Tech. I'm planning to schedule a tour soon once I talk to my counselor and finalize it if I do indeed go through with it.

Any advice? I feel really lost and stressed about this whole situation honestly."

I have a really good internship setup for my senior year of high school and college. I have a plan set for my college and career choice. Even with a lot of good to look forward too I still struggle with mental pain. 

I should rephrase I am 18 years old considered morbidly obese, on the verge of diabetes, attempted suicide, I haven't had sex and let alone kiss a girl since 7th grade. I have been friend zoned and denied from senior prom. My friends are all getting girlfriends and talking to people and I am still the same. I started smoking weed and started to become dependent on it as the only thing to keep me going. I tend to cry every night and I have been starting to shut people out of my life. I feel alone and hopeless for my future and the biggest weight is my past. 

I tend to put myself down because of my past failures. Everyone says things will get better or you will find someone that loves you and you will see the better side. I have yet to reach that point. I feel like my life is running out and I feel like I missed high school.

I tried to change myself in terms of becoming fitter. I go to the gym every night and work my ass off. I quit smoking but still have the urge. 

I still feel horrible even though I know I am trying to get better. I have little to no confidence in myself and I feel like everybody views me as a fat piece of shit. My biggest hatred is the feeling of people feeling bad for me. I don't want people to feel bad for me and I feel that some of my ""friends"" talk behind my back and make fun of me for my suicidal thoughts. I feel alone and that there is no one out there to help me.

My therapist canceled my appointment the other day and I haven't even told him all of what I have written. Tonight I was so alone that I tried calling the suicide hotline and they hung up on me. 

I tried to go to religion and that doesn't help. Every time I get in my car I hope I get in a car crash and not make it or even just die in my sleep. The one thing is that I don't want people to remember me. I want to be forgotten because I don't feel that I deserve the attention.

The bad news: They aren't helping me out with apartment stuff.

I've read tons and tons of posts from this sub to try and get a grasp on where to even begin finding housing, but most posts are from 1+ year ago and things/information can change fast.

My salary will probably end up being 2.6-2.7k/month after taxes. So I'm trying to keep my monthly rent under $1300/month. I'm willing to go up but I'd rather not go above $1600.

Here's what I know so far:

* I'm going to need my apartment for 3 months, starting May 31, ending August 29.
* If I want to find something for that date in May, I probably need to start looking in late April/early May.
* Subletting is good. Craigslist is good for subletting. Look at the apartments in real life before making any decisions.
* There's student housing (NYU apartments are decently close to where I'd be working, and go for $1400 a month, FIT apartments are similar, Columbia is a bit cheaper, etc, but I'm not sure if I'm too late to apply for these)
* There's other programs like 92Y, www.studenthousing.org, and some others I forget that offer summer housing for interns
* There's sites like StreetEasy, Stephanie Diamond, padmapper.com (this one looks very good), SpareRoom
* There's the Gypsy Housing Facebook Group (although this seems more aimed towards long term rentals)
* There's lots of advice for apartment hunting on this sub, and there's also /r/NYCapartments/

Here's what I don't know:

* The internship is near union square, so I'd really prefer to stay in Manhattan. Is this the wrong train of thought? Would living in Brooklyn be better? I don't want to have like a massive commute every day so I've been ruling out Brooklyn but if that's the wrong thing to do let me know
* How to actually.... find an apartment. There's all the things above I know but it's just so overwhelming. Where do I even start?

Is there anything else I'm missing? Does anyone have any tips or suggestions? I'd love any answers to the questions above too. Thanks a ton!!"

Asian american, first generation, female (important later), current (undergrad)college student studying computer science (important later), parents pay for all of my financial needs. Dad does medicine related things that are related to chemistry, mom does mom things (don't want to go into too much detail). Compared to other asian parents, they are probably considered lenient and liberal. Growing up, I basically just needed good grades and to let them know where I am if I'm not at school and be back by a certain time (I don't go out much). I was able to avoid a lot of physical and mental abuse but it still happened when I was about to fail a course and they were trying to get me to increase my test scores so that I could pass the course. 

Since before high school, they have been pushing me into pharmacy and made me think that my only option is to go into pharmacy. In other words, they made it so I never considered a career path that wasn't pharmacy. I go along with it because I don't really know what I wanted to do, I was interested in the healthcare field, I liked science classes, and they wanted me to have a high paying job and be successful. I manage to get into the college they wanted me to get into and was accepted into the ""pre-pharmacy"" program (not actually called this). 

After 3 semesters of getting bad grades in all science classes (big difference between the grades I got from science courses and non-science courses) and getting a little more than half way through the pharmacy prerequisites (with some physical and mental abuse), I decided to try something new by taking a programming class. I had never programmed before and never even considered computer science as an option but I have always been interested in it. I take that class and realize that it is something I want to do for the rest of my life. I change my major to computer science. My ""compromise"" was to do a biochemistry minor (only 4 more classes) to make them happy but I don't know if I can do that anymore when I get panic attacks every time I see or hear something related to chemistry (I get panic attacks by just looking at the chemistry building and smelling things that remind me of a chemistry lab). 

Parents are mad that I changed majors (~$3k more in tuition every semester because engineering) and basically throwing away everything I've done since middle school. They also wouldn't admit to friends and family that I was doing computer science. When someone asked them what I was majoring in, they would tell them that I was still undecided. They would rather say I am undecided than say I am studying computer science.  

They think that I can't find a job in computer science despite all the reports of how good a computer science degree is right now. They think that I would have better luck finding a job as a pharmacist even though by the time I graduate with a pharmD, there is supposed to be about half a million more pharmacists than pharmacist jobs (I showed them multiple studies that said this). Their friends even told them their children and their children's peers were having trouble finding jobs as recent pharmacy school graduates. Telling them that there's no way I can get into pharmacy school because of my grades doesn't work either. 

My mom seems to be coming around and encouraging me to do what I want after hearing about how successful her friends' daughters are doing in the tech/business industry. My dad is still very against me doing computer science. He keeps saying that I won't be able to find a job in computer science and that I need to get at least a master's degree. I think his problem is the fact that I'm a female going into computer science. He's completely fine with his friends' kids going into computer science and computer engineering (kids are male) and stopping at bachelor's degrees. 

It doesn't really help that I still can't find an internship for software development (I'm anywhere from 2 semesters to 10+ years behind my peers in terms of programming experience and I don't want to move this summer). 

When my friend tried (multiple times) to talk to my parents to make them understand why computer science is a good field for me to go into, they agree every single step of the way until they try to add me into the picture (when my friend tries to show them that they were actually talking about me the entire time). 

Does anyone else have parents that can't logic?

TLDR: How can I make my parents (mostly my dad) accept that I am doing computer science (and I can be successful with it)? "

Also a rant.,Credoinunumdeum1,Catholicism,https://www.reddit.com/r/Catholicism/comments/4bl5ya/need_some_advice_about_easter_plans_also_a_rant/,"Hey guys, I'm a regular here, but going throwaway on this one though some regulars may know my situation.

Okay, as we all know, it's Holy Week, and after that Easter, and that means hanging around with family, right?

Not for me.

See, since last July I've been estranged from my father. He was really abusive towards me and mother growing up. I mean, sometimes, maybe even most of the time it wasn't so bad, but when I got a bad grade on a test, or argued with him like a normal teenager, or my mother didn't cook dinner as he liked it, there was a good chance he would start beating one or both of us. Then he'd apologize, there's be a honeymoon phase, until it happened again. It got to the point that when I was in my undergrad, me and mother ran away for a week after he lost his shit over mom dropping a dinner plate. We only returned when he swore to God that he would not hit us again, and that we would leave for good if he tried something like that.

So fast forward four years, (Did I mention he'd just verbally abuse us instead of hitting us in the interim, but I didn't feel it was that bad at the time). I'm home for the summer holidays, about to go to a summer internship, when me and dear old Dad get into an argument about an appointment that I had coming up which conflicted with his plans to (as a gift he said) go together to the mechanics for a routine maintenance of my car. He accuses me of lying, I say no, he says that he doesn't believe me, and he's going to punch me, he actually punches me, we get into a knock-down, drag-out altercation. I tell him I'm going to call the police, it makes him even more angry. Mother tells me to run, and I run to a relative's. I spend a week there, finally my mother convinces dad to give her the car and my work bag, and I go back to my apartment near my law school.

So basically, from then until now, I barely speak to him, and vice versa. I sure as hell didn't go back.

So now it's Easter, and my aunt (who knows some of what went on) and my mother have been pressuring me to reconcile with him, so we can spend Easter together. They keep telling me he's changed, that he knows that he can't carry on like he did because he knows this time I'll fight back (even though my aunt criticized me for fighting back because ""it's not the Filipino way"" - we're Filipino, almost all of us are first-generation immigrants), and that I'm being overly proud and disrespectful to him (because you just take whatever your folks dish out to you in the Old Country, or at least when all of them grew up) by not spending Easter with them. 

The thing is, I'm once bitten, twice shy. He's said he wouldn't do it again, and yet he did. Now they're trying to say that ""you're not being Catholic"" sending me text messages saying that I need to forgive him and come home, and when that doesn't work, they remind me he's been helping me with my student loans (I'm still in law school and looking for postgrad work) and (when I tell them my dad seriously needs mental help) they deflect it by saying ""look how until now he's still providing for you, you need him more than he needs mental help (did I mention they're Filipino immigrants, and Filipino culture is traditionally skeptical of the mental health community, especially because they fear you'll tell tales about the family?)

So, I want to spend Easter with my family - but not while my Dad is there. My aunt is spending Easter in the Bay Area, so any Easter gathering would be at my dad's place.

4blakd,2,2016-03-23,Need some opinions to help make a decision.,bahaa9001,actuary,https://www.reddit.com/r/actuary/comments/4blakd/need_some_opinions_to_help_make_a_decision/,"So I am graduating this semester with a degree in Mathematics and a certificate in Actuarial Sciences. My original plan was to graduate with TWO degrees (math and stats) along with the certificate. However due to lack of financial aid and exceeding a credit limit, I've stopped enrolling in the Statistics courses. My advisor mentions that I can reapply to my institution AFTER receiving the first degree (which I am paying for out of pocket right now), which will then allow me to apply for financial aid to help me complete the Statistics degree. Assuming all the courses I need are offered in the Fall (only need 4 more course) then I can finish the degree this Fall 2016. Otherwise I would certainly finish it Spring 2017.

Seeing as how I am about to graduate with my first degree, and am currently studying for P/1 (sitting in May- scoring well on ADAPT so I should hope to pass in May) I am very eager to obtain some experience through internships (already started looking). I also plan on dedicating my summer to studying for FM/2 (even earlier if I feel prepared for P/1 before my sit date) regardless of what I end up doing in Fall, as well as playing around a lot with R or SQL (maybe take an online class and get some sort of certification? Something to put on the resume if anything).

My situation: I have been playing with the thought of whether I should even complete the Statistics degree. Compared to the math courses, the stats classes were WAY easier and I know that learning the material on my own time is well within my capabilities. Also, any aid I receive will be in the form of loans which would add to my already high balance. Supposing I manage to land myself an internship somewhere (probably for Fall), I would imagine it being quite cumbersome to have to deal with the Stats classes. It would probably affect my available hours for attending any internship, and would make it more difficult to dedicating myself to any tasks given to me by the internship, as well as any self-studying objectives I may have planned for myself. 
I've figured that perhaps I could hold off the Statistics degree for now, pursue some sort of employment/internship in a related field while I take exams, and if I don't land anything, I can come back and finish the Stats degree. I know that a Math B.S, a certificate in Actuarial Sciences, and 1 or 2 exams should (hopefully) land me an internship, but I'm not sure if it would be a mistake to abandon the Statistics B.S. I've always figured that the Stats degree is more applicable towards this field than pure Math, which is why I still like the idea of having it on my resume.

There's also a pickle dealing with the necessary credits that I need to fulfill the Statistics requirements. This pickle specifically is what MAY cause me to end up finishing the degree in Spring 2017 rather than Fall 2016. I won't go into the details, but it is definitely a headache.

What are your opinions? Should I just abandon the Stats degree, save some time, money, and effort and just begin job searching, or am I being a fool by even considering dropping it?

Any advice or suggestions would be greatly appreciated."

I'm a horrible human...",badpersonthrowaway6,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4blas2/me_21f_has_a_crush_on_a_close_friend_22m_but_i/,"First of all, my SO is an amazing human who can't be a better match for me. He is thoughtful, caring and just everything you can want in a partner. We have been together for 2 years and it's nothing but great. Let's call him Dan.

Second guy, let's call him, Jared. I've had a class with him for the past 4 years. I can't help myself but have a crush on him in the past year... He's not exactly my type physically but we spend a lot of time together. We have a ton of things in common and can talk for hours in person. Our personalities always bounce off of each other and he's always giving me witty banter, which my SO doesn't do.

I read from people that crushes are normal and just keep it at bay but I can't seem to shake this feeling that I really like him. I like spending time with him and I have to, career wise, spend a lot of time together. Maybe things will be better once we finish this program.

I try my best to not text him outside of class unless I have to but for some reason it's really hard. He seems to have completely avoided meeting Dan the past two years and barely asks questions about him.

I feel horrible because I think if I were not dating Dan, I'd date Jared but I am not about to throw away a bond between me and my SO just because I feel ""sparks"". It's not like I think he's super good looking or something, I just feel like I am just really attracted to his personality. It's also really hard for me to not put myself in these inappropriate situations since opportunities keep popping up like how Jared convinced me to get drunk with him on this camping trip we took with some people we intern with. And that we talk almost all the time.

Can you really just be friends with someone you have a crush on? Most of my crushes usually go away but this one is really sticking. How do I remove myself from situations that are unavoidable? Jared doesn't make me love Dan less but I just keep feeling these feelings grow and I don't know why it's so goddamn hard for me.

**tl;dr**: I developed a very strong crush on a guy that's not my SO. Hard to avoid inappropriate situations. I have been trying to squish this crush since the beginning but every angle, it seems to grow. I am a bad person and please help me."

I have no internship experience. The projects on my resume are school based, but I've taken so many group project courses (as part of my software eng minor), that there is plenty to add. I'm not exactly getting straight A's, but I'll finish with honours. I feel very proficient in Java, C, C++, and C#. However I have little knowledge in css, html or any form of web dev.

I've applied to about 30 places in my area that were available. Alot of them were web dev positions, and I was wondering about the differences between that and actual software development roles (ie the things I've had experience with). 

Is this the route I should be taking? What jobs can/should I reasonably expect to get? Is there a noteworthy pay difference between web devs and, say, C# devs? I really want to work as a Java or C dev, but there are only a few of those jobs available in my area.

How would you guys approach this? I want to get better at programming for myself and interview preparation and would take time off before a fulltime interview anyways.

Having a suicidal mother didn’t help things but we got by.  Two of five siblings graduated high school and I have tried my hardest to improve my situation.  Instead of going to college when I graduated, I went to work as a machine operator in a box factory.  For three years I paid our family's bills, bought groceries, and tried to get my siblings to go to school.  I worked nights between 50-60 hours a week sometimes up to 80.  I took a few classes at the community college and slept through most of them while managing to get good grades. We still lost our house and our mother succeeded in killing herself.  I still tried to get better.

Opportunity arose and I was able to attend college full time.  I worked on campus driving a truck, and as a machine operator in the summer.  I got good grades, got on scholarship, and graduated in 2008 with a BS in Finance. Unfortunately at that time no one wanted to hire someone with truck driving experience to a finance position.  I remained hopeful but worked several temp warehouse jobs because I could only find work where they needed warm bodies.  Over a year later I finally secured employment in the accounting department of a printing company.  It was still through a staffing agency but at least it had something to do with my degree.  I got to work there 9 months before the plant where I was employed shut down.  Back to the staffing agency.  I next found employment at an online payment solutions provider.  My role was to review online orders that were flagged for fraud and cancel the fraudulent ones.  9 months later I was still a temp and interviewing for a permanent position when the company was purchased by another company which decided to lay off all the temps. From there I went to work customer service at a retail brokerage firm. The starting salary was $35k, which I later found out was less than what they were paying employees two years prior before the economy took its downturn.  Since I had a degree in finance I easily passed my licensing exams, I was a top performer receiving multiple awards for trading accuracy and service excellence. After two years in the brokerage firm I found an internal posting for an entry level position on the corporate finance side of the firm.  It required a college degree and one year of experience.  I excitedly worked with my manager and applied for the position.  After talking to the HR recruiter she stated my qualifications were great and that she would forward my information to the hiring manager.  A few weeks later I found out I would not receive an interview and, when I pressed for a reason, I was told that “technically” my pay-band was too low and it would have been too much of a pay increase from my current position to get this entry level job.  

Ok, so what now. I apparently am unfit for an entry level position and I don’t want to quit without having a good reason. Someone mentions they are going to get and MBA and I think, maybe that will help.  In about a year I take the GMAT, get a full tuition scholarship to a top 30 program, and decide to do it.  At this time I have a wife and 2 children.  I take out loans so we can have a place to live and live frugally to have as little debt as possible.  I learn what I don’t want to do at my summer internship and spend a lot of time job searching that second year.  Graduation comes around and I still don’t have a job.  2 months pass and I still don’t have a job so I work construction clean-up by day and job hunt at night.  Most of the time I am told that there are other candidates whose experience more closely aligns with what they are looking for.  I have been told I am over qualified for other positions. Why can’t I get a job that wants more than just a warm body?

Most recently I held a seasonal position making $11.00 an hour.  My wife, two children and I share a bedroom in a house with another family.  I have been unemployed for a month and am currently looking for work.  I don’t need to get paid a lot, I just want to be able to pay rent.  What Am I doing wrong?

Preface: Ran a nice cycle of test a while ago and it went beautifully. Due to time constraints, I couldn't run a second cycle + PCT. Luckily, the beauty drug of LGD-4033 exists. Decided to run 5mg for 6-8 weeks. Why the range for the end? I'm trying to figure out the fastest way to bring up LH and FSH levels using PCT meds.

&amp;nbsp;

Unfortunately, there isn't a whole lot of public information or studies as to comparable recovery speed for the compounds. Ideally, I'd like to get my levels back up ASAP so I'd be ready for another cycle shortly after. (I'm flying back to the US, then coming back to europe for another 2 months or so). I'm fine with both Clomid and Nolva, and have taken Nolva in the past with no side effects whatsoever. Plus, I'm just in an internship where brain-fog wouldn't cost me anything. So, what's the consensus? Do you guys have any experience with faster recovery times?


&amp;nbsp;

**tl;dr Clomid vs Nolva - Which compound at what dosage to recover from an LGD-4033 cycle at the fastest rate?**

My Goal is to take a picture with the Scepter on Mt. Katahdin before The Ti6 Main Event Starts.

I'm writing this at 3:45 am, Slightly full of nerves about being dropped off in Georgia with just a backpack, So I figured I'd reflect on how Dota has been an inspiring part of my life. If this turns into an unkempt wall of text I'll put a TL:DR at the end. (**Editor's Note**: Oh God What have I done).

**TL;Don't want to Read: I Love Dota, I've had many great memories with the game, and the friends I made through it are a big part of why I'm able and lucky enough to go on the Hike Today. The Following is my unkempt and jumbled thoughts on the past few years, and some of my fondest Dota 2 Memories.**

The First I had ever heard about Dota was from this one kid in my 3D Animation Class, from around April 2014 till the Last day of School he kept insisting that I *just freaking had* to play this game. I always kept it in the back of my head, but I never had any intent of actually playing. I remember on one of the last days of school he started telling me about the game, and he mentioned that there was only one Map. I was floored when I heard he spent hundreds of hours on ***One Map***.

Skip to Late July and I read about this thing called ""Electronic Sports"" in a game informer magazine, apparently some team came out of nowhere and won some annual tournament. There was a picture of 5 people Holding what looked like a Giant Metal Frisbee.

Fast forward to mid summer, and me and my Cousin/Best friend have hoarded +100 games in our steam libraries, we're steam-a-holics at this point and he, (I'll call him George), looks up some stats and finds out the most played game on Steam is called ""Dota 2"".
I mention that I've been recommended to play it, so we both download it and start it up. 

The First thing I remember being impressive was when I first saw the roster of Heroes. You could just scroll through them endlessly in the card view. 100+ Heroes each with 4+ abilities, and ever ability had 3-4 levels, It was kind of mind-blowing in the beginning. 

We played our very first game, this was nearly 2 years ago, my memory might fail, but I'm nearly positive I picked Vengeful Spirit. We Lost. ***Hard***. And I had no Idea what was going on or how to build items, or why we lost, and ofcourse I wanted to Quit. But George insisted we play another, and we did and we Won and it Felt Amazing. 

I Actually have a replay of this match, all we ended up doing was pushing Top the Entire game as Vengeful Spirit + Lifestealer, nobody on the enemy team defended and we literally just kept throwing our bodies at their base. ***FUCK***. I *Did* have a replay of this match before Reborn Happened ¯\_(ツ)_/¯.

We keep playing, and not wanting to fix what wasn't broken I swear our first 60-80 games were just Vengeful Spirit + Lifestealer, eventually we got better at Laning and were able to use this combo to get so many sweet kills. And ***man*** did those games go fast. We had always played a ton of games at night, (we both became nocturnal in the summer), and that translated to dota was just madness. 

***For our first week, we played around 6 hours a night, 7 days straight.***

Then breaking the Dota Train, was a Family vacation to Gatlinburg, I don't remember much about that trip, (I was in much worse shape back then so I usually just stayed in the hotels), I do remember ***One night, we watched every single Dota Cinema hero Spotlight in a row***. The step back from the game allowed us to watch some important dota-cational media, and stew up Ideas for what lane combos we would try next the second we got home.

George told his friend, ""The Mad Hatter"", (There are so many of them on Dotabuff it's anonymous enough) about the game before we left, and to our suprise ***when we arrived home, we had an invoker player.***

TMH had been playing the whole time we were gone, solo Q style, honing his skills. **Our 2 Stack had become a 3 Stack**

We keep playing with the mindset of recruiting new players, since in our absurdly low, unranked skill group, having a party was an amazing tactical advantage.

**We Keep Searching for players until our prayers are answered by GabeN himself**, and we stumble upon, I'll call him ***The Amazing American***.

(The Following Section, has gratuitous use of Bold, You've been warned.)

**This Maniac is Shouting in Voice Chat practically Role-playing AXE**. And by God did he have the skills to back it up.

**HE BLINKS INTO THE ENTIRE ENEMY TEAM, 1 DUNK, 2 DUNK, 3 DUNK, 4 DUNK, 5 DUNK, R-R-R-RAAAAAMPAGE!!!!!!**

George and I are probably just Pushing in Top Lane, while this guy solo kills the entire enemy team, ***This is the Guy we need in our Stack***. 

We Add him, and we play some games talking through the In-Game Voice chat. Then eventually we add him to our Main Voice Chat.

We keep playing ***until we Meet HUSKAR***. He has a screen name, but he plays Huskar so much, that on ***MANY*** occasions I've accidently used his screen name and Huskar Interchangeably.

This Man plays Meepo, Centaur Warrunner, Huskar, and Witch Doctor when he has to support, **AND THAT'S IT** (Maybe Zeus if Huskar is Taken). I think He had a versatility of 0.04 when Reborn hit. (Item Shopping for him is impossible).

***And Thus, THE BROWN STARFISH LICKERS ARE BORN***.

Let me explain. So we've been playing as 5 consistently for quite a while now, the 2014-2015 school year is starting, **Huskar is working, Me, George and The Mad Hatter are in School, and The Amazing American is working/Preparing for Military Basic Training**.

Almost every weekday we play 2-3 games as a 5 man team, and on the weekends if the stars align we can play for hours upon hours from night till sunrise. **As of now, Late 2014 to early 2015, the Dota is strong, the camaraderie stronger, and the friendship real**, (at the very least to me).

***We Decide to create a team so we can Play Team Ranked mode.*** The Team is made, but we can't decide on a name. We Go through multiple Brain Storming sessions, filtering through ""Cool"" names, but they all sound pretentious and lame.

**As a Joke George submits the name as ""THE BROWN STARFISH LICKERS"".** And uploads this [image](http://i.imgur.com/pE5Az.jpg) as our beautiful Banner.

**Unbeknown to him, you can't change the name for two weeks after you submit it.**

And Thus for the next two weeks, we slayed hundreds of foes under the mighty banner, ""The Brown Starfish Lickers"". By the end of the two weeks, in a 4 to 1 vote we ruled to keep the name.

On the other side of life, George and I despise school, nothing new here, but I was hit hard with something towards the end of the school year. I'm slacking in my 3D computer animation course (Which I loved at the time), I have my first grade lower then a B+, a D- in analysis, and i just began to shut down.

To be frank I can't recall much from this time, I'd probably ""hindsight diagnose"" it as depression and anxiety. 

I was nervous and panicked, I had always done well in school, but I think It was the real world and choosing a life path that had me so shaken.

So many arguments with my parents, so many lies that my work was being managed so I could get my computer back to play some Dota 2 and get away from it all.

Eventually I just couldn't take it, so I sat down and planned the quickest route out of Highschool physically possible. I took extra Online courses, passed Analysis by the skin of my teeth, BS'd my way through my worst semester of 3D animation and Phew! ***I graduated my Junior Year.***

**The Following events were just failure after failure after failure, The Dota 2 and my friends though were a brilliant contrast to this Shitshow.**

(Editor's Note: I think I messed up my time-line pretty bad, it appalls me how horribly I remember the last 3-3.5 years, and how the pieces just don't seem to fit together).

**I begin Senior Year**, having technically graduated, The Only Class I'm taking is 3D computer animation, at the time I wanted to be a game designer. The class is held a Multi-District office building seperate from my old school.

**I loose motivation and Quit.**

I start an internship. **I get panicked and Quit**

**I nervously Ride out the summer knowing my parents will expect more of me when school season starts**

**I Start Community College**

**I Get Overwhelmed and Quit**. 

Despite my horrible memory's best efforts, I know we're here in late 2015. Everything I've tried I've failed at, and at the time my two best friends were more distant then ever, and about to leave for 5-6 months. The Dota Slowed Down, I was paranoid from a bad experience, and I felt stuck.

Then, with the aid of alchohol to quell my social anxiety for a moment or two, I got to talking with George. We talked a bout a ton of stuff, and it felt like we reconnected just in time.

Soon enough I was welcomed as an addition to Trip, we were going on the trail.

**Since then, despite my predisposition to fucking up every time's best efforts, I've gotten Fucking Ready for this trail**

There was a time 4 months ago when I couldn't freaking walk around the block more then once. Within those 4 months I've lost weight, gained endurance, and have successfully gathered, organized, and packed all my supplies.

I honestly don't think I've seen the last of my failures, but one thing that I know has changed since 4 months ago was my outlook on life.

**Failure isn't fucking up, It's Giving up.**

Moving forward with my life I'm probably going to make mistakes, probably more than the average person, but I'm not going to stop trying until I can find my personal success, whatever that may be one day.

I feel like there are a lot of echoes of that in Dota 2 as a whole. The game itself keeps improving and pushing forward. The Players from pro to scrub all know what it's like to give their all and experience amazing victories.

I Guess right now, writing this, I'm grateful for all the amazing people I know that have helped me get where I am right now, Especially my dota friends who have helped me through so much, probably without even knowing it. 

Honestly I'm also grateful for all the awesome people I don't truly know who have helped through rough times. I don't think there's ever been a day were hearing a GoodLuckHaveFun Song couldn't put a smile on my face.

And with all the amazing people in the community and the developers all gathering behind the game That Is Dota 2, it's hard to feel like good things aren't happening all the time.

Goodbye for now, and Thank You Dota 2, I hope the next time I see you, we've both improved and kept pushing forward."

4bmmph,63,2016-03-23,Movie gets bad reviews - 'It is in this moment where history is made. When the inevitable nuclear war has come and gone and jungle warfare rules the world in the midst of a nuclear winter the elders will tell the youth of our times.',041744,BestOfOutrageCulture,https://www.reddit.com/r/BestOfOutrageCulture/comments/4bmmph/movie_gets_bad_reviews_it_is_in_this_moment_where/,"&gt;It's a campaign by Marvel to make sure this movie fails. They have a gripe with Ben Affleck and really anything Boston related. A couple of months ago, the head in charge of Marvel Movie marketing was seen at a Boston Celtics game giving the finger to a little boy in a Rajon Rondo jersey.

&gt;The issue probably stems from Ben Affleck leaving Daredevil to die and chasing the cape and cowl of the caped crusader. No surprise that he ticked Mickey Mouse off. The anti-DC agenda has spread wide on here and my guess it's because Marvel and Disney interns have infiltrated the sub and other subreddits to fill it with their ideas and try to ""inception"" us into choosing Marvel over DC in this holy war.

&gt;DC had a possibility to overtake them following the crash and burn that was Spiderman 3 and the success of The Dark Knight, but stage 1 of the Avengers plan was already a go and the Marvel/Disney train was already in motion. Now they've amassed so much power, influence and wealth that they are able to pay off critics left and right and drive this movie into the ground before it even gets a change to flourish.

&gt;Ladies and gentlemen I hate to say this, but we are at war. It is time to take a stand and make sure that Marvel does not have a complete dominance over the superhero genre. They've already infiltrated Netflix and have managed to steal Ryan Reynolds and make him into Memepool.

&gt;It's unsure where Disney's hand can't reach, but we mustn't let them monopolize the industry. That is why I urge you one and all to cash in your paychecks Friday and do whatever you can to make sure every screening of BvS in your local is sold out.

&gt;It is in this moment where history is made. When the inevitable nuclear war has come and gone and jungle warfare rules the world in the midst of a nuclear winter the elders will tell the youth of our times. They will speak of our accomplishments, advancements, our failures. They'll speak of our heroes, leaders and tyrants and somewhere between all that will be this moment...the moment where we stood up to that goddamn mouse and said ""HEY! FUCK YOU!""

And at Hudson there is one frat that reins supreme, where the brothers are smarter, stronger and more privileged then any of their rivals. And boy do they know it.

The line stretches down the block as students wait to enter Alpha Sigma's first party of the semester. I stand on the doorstep of the opulent fraternity mansion, arms folded in a way that shows off my bulging biceps and rippled chest. The collar on my Abercrombie polo is up, obviously, and I scan the line for any lithe young pickings that I could have fun with. I dumped my Theta slampiece over the summer - I said I had to focus more on my Goldman Sachs internship, but the real reason was I was just... bored of her. Who knows what I'll find tonight? Maybe a girl truly worth showing off to the high society I had been born into...
____________________________________________________

Hey, thanks for reading! So the premise of this roleplay is pretty simple. I want to play a douchey, All-American frat bro who gets to corrupt and use a naive young first year. You could be a spoiled, stuck-up legacy blonde, a small-town busty brunette or even an ebony/latina girl who'd never dream she'd abandon her people to suck on the cock of a rich white guy. So long as you're creative and imaginative, I'm game!

This can be played short-term, but what I'd really like to do is create a little world of opulence and privilege. I want to seduce your character with promises of the high-life, taking you to all sorts of exclusive events and country clubs, all the while making you into a more and more depraved slut. By the end of it I want you to be my bimbo, a good, obedient little girl who smiles and sticks her chest out while the men discuss business.

Detail, creativity and good grammar are key. I'm pretty open to most kinks and this scene can go from plain vanilla to extremely dark.

Hope to hear from you!"
4bnead,181,2016-03-23,I just discovered this sub. I have to share my story.,Spiffynikki13,JUSTNOMIL,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/4bnead/i_just_discovered_this_sub_i_have_to_share_my/,"I am going to warn you, this will be looong,  but I have to unburden my soul.

**TL:DR: She's evil, manipulative, and kidnapped DH's children, yet I still have to deal with her.**

Meet Sherry. Late 50's, mother of my husband of  nearly two years, been together almost five years.   She's 5'2"", plump, so sweet butter won't melt in her mouth, song leader and cleaning lady at her church.  She spent years cooking for and caring for children in a state home for foster kids, her husband is a pillar of the community, her laugh is infectious, and she's evil.

In the beginning Sherry just ate me up. She loved me to death, I was so much better than all those trashy girls DH had dated in the past!   I had an 7 year old daughter and DH had two daughters, 4 and 5, when we met. DH had sole custody, but what I didn't know at the time is that his mother had slowly been pushing him into allowing her to do the lion's share of raising his girls. More on that later.

Things go very well for a while and then out of the blue DH's oldest daughter (now 5) hates me. She can't tell anyone why, or what I've done, and DH says that we can't date if she isn't comfortable with me. There's no reasoning with him and no getting him to sit down and talk to her about what may be going on because clearly she isn't comfortable talking about it.  We take a bit of time apart and eventually he sees reason and talks to her.  He never got a straight answer but she said (on her own) she was going to give me another shot.

After that blew over and things settled, DH and I (who lived 2 hours apart when we met) decided to live together. I moved in with him, because he owned his own place. Unfortunately, his place was basically in his parents' side yard. We were separated by 300 feet of yard and driveway.   My own mother and several other relatives tried to warn me that this could lead to nothing good, but I just loved Sherry and she just loved me, so what could go wrong???

Fast forward a few months, I'm settled in fairly well and we have his parents up for dinner once a week or so.  Every time Sherry comes up she has little ""helpful hints"" to drop about how I could clean the house better, or perhaps rearrange the furniture this way, or be more lenient with the children (mine and his).   Just little things. I would smile and nod and continue to do things my way, as it was my house and I lived there, not her.  We'd go to the grocery together, and she'd start downing DH, just little insulting things here and there, and I'd defend him, or explain on his behalf. I'd never take the bait.  

Suddenly his kids are wanting to stay at their nanny's (Sherry) more often. They're backtalking and disespectful of me and him. I took three steps back because I'm not their mother and I'm the interloper and this is DH's to handle, though I have his back. Except he didn't. He continued to let them stay with her more and more. 

Eventually the oldest decided she didn't like school anymore and that the teachers were mean, and DH's mom convinced him they would be better off homeschooled anyway. DH's sister and BIL homeschool their kids and they're miles ahead academically speaking.  I was dead against it, but Sherry convinced him.   She also convinced him to let her do the schooling since she's retired and has all this time on her hands. The first year went ok, but as time went on the girls were spending less and less time on school work and more time playing outside. Sherry always had reasons not to show us their class work and would just tell us what they were doing and how they were doing.  (Are you all seeing the red flags yet?)

The poop finally hit the fan the day after Christmas two years ago.  My DH had landed a very prestigious state government internship and we were discussing how this would eventually lead to him going to law school, and the fact that we'd have to move to accommodate whatever campus he wound up at.  Sherry piped up that of course we'd be leaving his two girls with her when we did move.  

Wat?

No.

We let her know that of course they were coming with us.  She brought up homeschooling.  I told her I'd continue or we'd enroll them in a public school and see how it went.  She brought up a ton of other things and we had counter arguments for each.  Finally she just flips her lid and tells DH that if we move and take the kids that she will fight him for custody and that he'll never see his girls again.   She goes on a screaming rant about me. How I am the devil, I've led him astray, I'm ruining his life, and on and on and on. She tells him that if he's going to be with me he's got to move his mobile home (classy I know ) off their land and he'll lose his kids.  I told him repeatedly grandparents have no rights in our state and that they couldn't without strong proof of abuse and neglect, but he'd been molded by this woman his entire life and she had him bluffed. He stood up to her, we stayed together, and eventually she backed down on the condition he wouldn't move away and he wouldn't have that slut (me) in her home again.  I wanted to move then, but he was too afraid of what they'd try to do.   

Also during this time it came out that Sherry had been gossiping about me non stop, almost from the beginning about how awful I was and how I mistreated her grandkids (no screaming and running in the house and jumping on the furniture rule made me a ""nazi"").  She even thought I might be a closeted democrat (yes so help me those were her words). She'd said all this in front of his girls, over and over and over. No wonder they hated me!
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Eventually she made life so hard for me that I left DH and moved back to where I came from, because I couldn't deal with it anymore. I found out along the way that she had continually introduced him to women, or tried to hook him up with exes, or offered to cover for him to go cheat the entire time we had been together.  The depths of her crazy were astounding.

Eventually he and I got married. Like an idiot, Sherry was being nice, we were married now, things were different, we'd made a covenant before god. She'd hugged me. Said it was okay now. I didn't trust or like her, but I moved back to DH's because it was the easiest financial option for us.

It didn't take long for the girls to start hating me again, for DH and I to begin fighting (idiot still listened to what his mom had to say), and I couldn't take it anymore and left again. DH and I started going to marriage counseling, quietly, and planning to move the whole family away from Sherry. 

Then Sherry caught wind that we were going to marriage counseling. She'd been trying to hook DH up with a girl (his ex-wife's cousin) and he'd been resisting. He told her he still loved me and that we were trying to work things out and she ran straight back to Sherry and told her everything.  Sherry kicked him out of his house (he'd bought it with his own money, but put it in his dad's name for insurance and tax reasons), gave his house the the girl she'd been trying to hook him up with, and then took his girls. 

I shit you not she hid his kids from him.  He called the local sheriff (who happened to be good friends with Sherry's husband), who called the county attorney to find out what to do.  The county attorney said that since we'd let her homeschool the girls and they spend a few nights a week at her house, they'd be better off with Sherry and that Sherry needed to come in ASAP and get an emergency custody order. (Turns out DH's father  had already talked to the CA and told him we were on drugs, neglectful, etc, none of which was true) and the CA knew this was coming. 

I came and picked up DH and we left without the kids. Finally two days later Sherry thought she had the upper hand because her custody filing was in front of a judge and she had their local country attorney in her pocket, and she let her guard down. She let the kids go to their youth group at a church in the next county over.  We found the kids there (had a hunch that's where they'd be) and tried to pick them up. By then we had copies of the current custody papers but the preacher said Sherry had already told him this may happen and he was to call the sheriff if we showed up.  While waiting for the deputy Sherry and husband show up.  

When the deputy arrives there's confusion. He talks to his boss, he talks to the county attorney from Sherry's home county (tells him off too and that he has no jurisdiction here) who stalls for time hoping the judge will sign the order.  Judge tears up the order and threatens to have county attorney investigated for misconduct, and we get the kids.  It took us over an hour to get them to get in the car with us. They were screaming, crying for nanny, shaking, absolutely terrified of DH.

Turns out Sherry had been telling them how awful and abusive it was for their daddy to expect them to behave. I'm not talking about beatings or expecting church mice, I'm talking about putting the oldest in timeout for spitting in his face when he told her to hold on because he was on the phone.  She'd also been sneaking them to see their bio mom (a drug addicted thief who has also been picked up for prostitution, when the kids were infants and she was still allowed visitation) and telling the girls if they told daddy they'd be in big trouble and he'd scream at them and whip them.

We went full no contact with DH's parents.  They refused to give us any of the girls toys, clothes, etc from their house or from the trailer. We had to go buy them clothes, toothbrushes, a few toys, etc. We register them for school, their testing shows that the girls are academically two years behind where they are supposed to be.  They are supposed to be in 2nd and 4th this year, but they are in 1st and 3rd.  They're in counseling. They needed it from the abuse and neglect they'd suffered at their bio-mom and her various boyfriends hands years ago, but Sherry had convinced DH it would do more harm than good.   We found a great house in a perfect location to raise kids with a great school system and cheap rent and moved there. We're about an hour away from the monster in law now.  She didn't see the kids for about five months. DH changed his number and she'd rather die than call mine.   This is all my fault, remember?  I found out she'd even started a prayer group at church (the church I'd attended too) because she needed to fight the satanic influence that had come over her family.   

Sherry finally convinced her daughter (who moved an entire state away to get away from her mother) to work on DH. After Christmas we let them see her, supervised for a couple of hours.  We've been letting them visit, supervised, and more recently unsupervised, bit by bit.  DH is convinced now that she knows she can't get the kids from him and he can cut off her access to them she'll behave. She's coldly civil to me, and I am to her. That's about the greatest extent things will ever be.  I don't trust her. I hate that my kids (I'm the only real mom they've ever had) spend time with that small minded biggot now, and I keep waiting for CPS to show up at my door.  Right now things are quiet but I'm sure something else will happen soon. Sherry hasn't had any good drama in a couple of months.

Sorry this was so long but I feel better. So much better."

Should I take it?",ColdFUUUUUsionHAAAAA,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4bnoig/offered_position_working_with_coldfusion/,"Hello all, throw away here in case.

Some background: 
I just earned my B.S. in CS in December with a 3.2 GPA from a pretty shit tier state school.  I have no internships and no relevant work experience.  I've got 2 personal projects, but honestly I probably can't talk about one of them comfortably since it was a while back and it was pretty rushed.  I have no other offers and have only got a tech screening coming up at a very large animation studio (although I have no idea when this is going to happen, I just have a contact there that referred me and told me it's coming).  I've been applying since December ( very late start, I know and I regret it ), and have got a test from google, and 3 interviews ( including this one ).  


I just received an offer for a backend developer.   I was told I'd be working with a really old system that is in ColdFusion.  He straight up told me that the position wouldn't really be good for career development, because ColdFusion is dying.  The pay is pretty low with a 25% bump after 3 months, with no benefits except for standard PTO.  The team would just be me and the lead developer that I interviewed with.  


The job is 2 blocks from my house so that's incredibly nice.  I'm not in a dire situation where I need money to sustain living, but my grace period is running out on my loans and I'd like to be able to start collecting to pay that off asap.


I have contacts who work as a QA at a very large satellite service provider and they feel very confident they could get me in there as a contract QA, and this would be in about ~2-3 months.  Although, I think this is a manual testing job so that might not be much better.  The company itself would be a lot better though.


Should I just take this ColdFusion job and search in the meantime and just jump ship soon as I get something I would like?  Or should I just skip this job and hold out for something else?  


**TL;DR:**
  Just graduated, no internships, no experience.  Received job offer with low pay and no benefits with 25% increase in pay after 3 months and I'd be working with ColdFusion.  Extremely close location.  Should I skip this job or take it and jump ship when I can?"

Just as the title says, im looking for tips on catching a feral mouse/micr in my office. We've noticed all the obvious signs that there are mice here over the last two weeks. My office is pretty upscale, but the building and attached factory are on a plot of otherwise undeveloped land, so it makes sense that mice would want to live here.

Other members of the office have tried to bait and use snap traps to catch the mice. I was adamantly against it because I love animals, and have a domestic mouse of my own at home but they didnt listen. 

To date the mice have triggered 30 traps and survived. The idiots in my office keep baiting the traps with peanut butter and are baffled that the mice are too smart to fall for this.

So now they have finally decided to let me try to take care of it. I already purchased some nice live traps on Amazon with the hope of catching the mice alive and bringing them to a nearby field and leaving some food and water when I release them.

Do any of you have any tips on how else I can catch them? My office is giving me two weeks before they call an exterminator to just deal with it.

I dont think there are a lot of mice. The amount of droppings we find in the morning make me think there are 2-3 max right now. 

I'm really glad my office is giving me a shot at this and that I was able to talk them out of the horrors of using glue traps. I fought with the awful interns over it, and once I informed the VP (another animal lover) that the mouse is more likely to chew their own leg off than they are to die by glue trap overnight,  she was horrified at the thought of exterminating them at all. 

Any ideas would be apperciated. Im on mobile right now, but I will update later with a picture of my pet mouse at home."

4bocbb,6,2016-03-23,Disillusioned with long-term internship and not sure how to proceed,disillusion_csIntern,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4bocbb/disillusioned_with_longterm_internship_and_not/,"My school allows students to take longer term internships, so I've been working at a company on a 14 month work term, but I'm starting to become disillusioned with the whole situation and need guidance as I have no mentor.

I'm nearing the end, so I will finish the term, but I'm wondering if my situation has been normal experience for working in computer science or whether this has been atypical.

I work alone maintaining old systems for the most part. I rarely ever talk to or see anyone, so I work remotely. No one reviews my work or helps me improve. I also feel like I'm only learning proprietary things that aren't transferrable. For a while, I was spending all my free time outside of work doing personal projects to keep my skills strong and learn new skills, but I got burnt out. All my free/personal time was spent ignoring my family and fiance so that I could develop myself professionally through side projects, but I just got sick of it and I've hence stopped.

I feel depressed because it feels like I'm doing nothing relevant or meaningful. I feel like my psychological state has gone downhill over the term just from isolation and meaninglessness. I'm wondering whether in the future I will be able to find jobs that challenge me and allow me to develop myself professionally? Or will it always be this race to pursue things outside of work, leaving you no time for balance in life? Are a lot of companies like this, or is this highly unusual?"
4boiyn,11,2016-03-23,I finally told my girlfriend and took action to change my daily life after months of depression.,Mr_Impulse,NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/4boiyn/i_finally_told_my_girlfriend_and_took_action_to/,"I have been on NoFap for about 3 years now. I have had many ups and downs including a huge streak last summer. Back in the summer of 2014 I met my girlfriend and we became close, but had to do things long distance. At the time I had been clean for months and feeling strong. Things were good while I went to school and when we got together it was amazing!

I picked up an internship in the same city my girlfriend lives in over the summer and we moved in together for 3 months. That time was great! We lived in an efficiency and I literally had no privacy to slip up and look at porn. Things were strong over those months and I felt confident going into my next semester at school. The Fall semester wasn't bad. She and I stayed connected and long distance still worked for us. 

Then the Spring semester hit... I took on a lot during this semester. On top of full-time school, I picked up a research project, two jobs, and an addtional weekend business class. I also help with a campus club and traveled a lot for school/industry related conferences. I basically put myself in a position to have way too much to do in too little time. I assumed I would thrive under the pressure. All of this work made it much harder to keep in touch with my girlfriend and to travel to see her.

The pressures built up and I was strating to feel like a little PMO would help me get through the stress. Well, it didn't. In fact it made it so much worse. I started PMOing and the worst times while I was supposed to be in class or staying up until 4am instead of going to bed or doing homework. I started to become a foggy shell. I hid that from my girlfriend and acted like everything was okay. I have slipped into an anxiety fueled depression. 

Yesterday I hit a pivatol moment. I started feeling dead and was getting so angry and tired of being sad. I called my girlfriend to confess everything I had been going through over the past few months. She took it hard. So hard. She thought it was something she caused by not being a good girlfriend or by not pleasing me. I finally had to explain how PMO makes me feel drugged and how I use it as one. How it had nothing to do with her or our relationship. We managed to patch things up, but now she knows that this is a part of me and a part of our relationship.

It's been a rough past 24 hours. I contacted a therapist and am trying to work out a date for an appointment. I emailed my advisor and dropped my project. I'm down to one job now. Basically I purged a lot of worry out of my life. I even through out a bunch of crap that was piling up at my apartment.

Anyway, all this to say if you've been holding this in from your SO stop it. Tell him/her because this shit is crushing on your own."

We'll call him Lucas. He was staying at my college for a year and then had to go back to Brazil at the end of the next summer (August 2015).  We had a great relationship. We spent the his time there together and didn't have any significant relationship problems. 

May 2015: He got an internship in Alaska and moved to Anchorage for the summer.  We stayed in touch with each other and Facetimed each other every day. Things were still good between us.  

July 2015: I spent a week visiting him in Alaska.  At one point he got a call from an ex girlfriend of his from Brazil. He answered the call in Portuguese so I couldn't catch most of it. When he came back into the room, he put his arms around me and called me his girl. I felt really weird about it. The whole night I was tossing and turning because I could tell in my gut that something was wrong. The next morning when he was in the shower, I looked at his iPad and went on his Facebook. (Something I had never done before, but I really felt like something was wrong).  He and this girl had a conversation two days before and they had told each other ""Eu te amo"" which means ""I love you"" in Portuguese.  I confronted him about it when he got out of the shower and he said they were close friends and that it didn't mean anything.

The rest of the trip I was really upset and it was kind of awkward. He asked if I wanted to leave Alaska and I said no and stayed the rest of the time.  We said our goodbyes and I flew back home.  This was the last time I was going to see him before he went back to Brazil. 

Later July 2015: I cannot shake the feeling of something happening between him and the ex girlfriend. I ask him about it again and he asks if I can Facetime.  I call him and he breaks up with me. He says if I can't trust him, then we cannot be in a relationship. He says that nothing is happening between him and the girl and he has told me that before. He says he wants to still be friends, but not be in a relationship. I am devastated, but there is nothing I can do.  I feel at fault because I didn't trust him.

1 week later: I am out of the country and one of my friends messages me on FB asking if Lucas and I broke up. I said yes, but how did you know? She told me that he was in a relationship with someone else on FB.  I look and he must have blocked me from seeing it, but she sends me a screenshot.  It has been one week since we have broken up and clearly everything he said to me was a lie.  I message him on Facebook and let him know that I saw.  I tell him that I'm sorry I trusted him and I block him.  This is the last I hear from him until...

February 2016: I get home from work and check my phone. I see that I have two missed Facetime calls from Lucas.  It makes my heart race and I assume it is an accident.  Ignore it. 

March 2016: I get two more Facetime calls.  This time I see them, but I don't answer them.  I get an email from him a few minutes later asking if we can talk. I respond that I can talk to him tomorrow and I stew for the next 24 hours wondering what he is going to say. 

Next day: I get home from work and he messages me to call him whenever I have chance.  I muster up the courage to call him and he looks the same.  He asks if I am okay, and I tell him that I feel weird about this.  He asks me a little about his life and I ask him a little about his.  He apologizes genuinely for what happened in August and says there is no explanation for it.  I cry because I am really emotional and this whole thing is so out of the blue and emotionally overwhelming.  We continue to talk for about 45 more minutes about our lives, our mutual friends, etc...  At the end I asked about his girlfriend.  I felt like he was only calling because they had broken up.  

Turns out they had broken up a couple of months ago.  He says they don't talk anymore and I just said ""Oh"" because I wasn't sure how to react. And then he said ""Don't be so happy about it."" and all I said was ""Well, I hope it was worth it."" After that we continued to talk a little bit and then I had to go.  He asked if he could come visit the US sometime and I said I'd pick him up from the airport. I'm not sure if this was a genuine question on his part or not.

So, I guess what I'm asking is why do you think he decided to reach out to me now and what should I do? I have a lot of feelings about everything right now. He apologized, but that doesn't mean that something like that wouldn't happen again or that he is even being entirely honest with me right now.  Should I let him pursue a friendship with me and just stay guarded? I do still care about him and talking to him again reminded me of that. I had believed that we would never talk or see each other again.  Right now I am sort of relieved to be talking to him again, but I don't know what his intentions are. I'm worried that he is bored now that he has broken up with the other girl. I am looking for some impartial third party advice and opinions.


   
**tl;dr**: I have a complicated relationship with my ex and I am wondering if it is completely stupid to be friends with him again after he betrayed my trust.  "

4bp9bk,1,2016-03-23,[US] Advice please! Giving my two weeks soon as a temp-to-hire position tax accountant and I don't know what to say.,dragonskitty,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/4bp9bk/us_advice_please_giving_my_two_weeks_soon_as_a/,"Hi r/accounting!

Working through a hiring agency, I managed to get hired at a small CPA firm an hour from where I moved earlier in the year. Not ideally where I would have wanted to be hired (we moved closer to my husband's job and I was hoping for a job closer to us) but I jumped at the chance of finally getting busy season experience. (Never got an internship due to how my courses worked out) I was originally planning to (hopefully) stick around for a year or two.

Now, when I say small, it's a 10 person office where half of us actually work on tax returns. The rest of the office is payroll/administrative. I was hopeful that a small environment would mean guided, hands-on learning, and this was what I was promised by my agent. I even started in December 2015 so that I could get used to the office before everyone would get busy.

While I have learned a lot, the environment feels stifling and bottle-necked. My boss has taken on WAY too many clients for the number of people we have, and keeps taking on more. I wasn't really given a sit down talk about how the office operated until a month after I started, and I'm learning new random things all the time whenever I trip into them. My boss is *the* final reviewer for ALL of the work in the office and is the only one who talks directly to clients.

And on top of all that,  the commute is slowly draining my sanity. I thought I could handle it, and my husband and I talked about moving closer, but realized that no matter where we moved, it would either move the burden of the commute onto him rather than split it, or minimally reduce my current commute.

My current plan is to hand over a 2 weeks notice on 4/4 and to finish out tax season. I'm starting to get anxious about what to even say to my boss or what to write. I know that the most diplomatic thing is to say that it's the commute, but that would make a very, very short letter, even taking into account the ""I've learned a lot..."" part of the letter.

Is this enough? Do I need to put more in there? Is 4/4 a good day to hand it over given the current last day of tax season? Should I talk to my agent about it, or not say anything until I've turned in the notice?

**TLDR: I don't know how to write a 2 weeks notice for a grown up job. Help! **

4bp9zb,1,2016-03-23,Possibly (mild) Social Anxiety. What to do? (Crosspost from /r/Anxiety),rooowdy,socialanxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/4bp9zb/possibly_mild_social_anxiety_what_to_do_crosspost/,"To my person: I am a 24 year old male and I have dealt with other mental health issues like schizophrenia and clinical depression for several years now.

To my problem with anxiety: Unless I am with very good friends I can't really handle social situations comfortably. I am usually drunk when with people so I never really noticed it before. But today I had a gathering with a couple people and I stayed sober.

I realized that I am just not at ease in those situations, even if it was just sitting around a table talking and mind you I actually knew the people I was with. I just can't unwind, really.

I sit there unable to even hold a conversation with anybody. When women are present it gets even worse because then I just shut down completely.

Although I was always a rather shy person, I don't think this is simply shyness anymore. And this is really affecting me.

I noticed that also in school I'm not comfortable with interacting with my classmates freely. And seeing that I'll start a new internship in two weeks with completely new people I've never met before I'm also anxious about that.

All of this is a rather recent development, so I am kind of at a loss here. Do you think this is some sort of SA?

Coincidentally I have a appointment with my psych doc tomorrow and I'll definitely talk with him about this."

I'm asexual, and have never had sex at 22 although I've had several opportunities. 

That being said, I started seeing someone romantically (although we're not together anymore) and decided that it might be smart to get a Nexplanon implant just in case. My family doctor had already been suggesting that I go see an OBGYN for a general checkup or whatever you want to call it because I'm pretty high risk for ovarian and breast cancer.

So, I found a highly-recommended OBGYN and scheduled an appointment for a few weeks later.

I was ready. I have moderate anxiety, but I tried to stay calm and reasonable about the whole thing. I went in, they made me pee in a cup (oh, joy) and did the whole ""put on this hospital gown and he'll be in in a second.""

Then, I started to get nervous. So he came in, with an intern in tow and just started asking me questions. The second he asked me about my sexual history and I told him I had never had sex, it was like I had told him I had a rare and highly contagious form of zombieism. He gave me a horrified look, paused, and said that he just didn't feel comfortable giving me an exam since I had never had penetrative sex before.

Then he proceeded to give me some well-intentioned but awful advice, telling me that I should just find the nearest willing guy and have sex to get it over with. He also heavily implied that this might ""fix"" my asexuality.

Anyway, he wrote me an order for a pelvic ultrasound which I never did because I was pretty stressed out by the entire thing. I sobbed on the way home because the whole experience was so surreal and uncomfortable. But the thing is... should I try to find another OBGYN? Do I need to see someone? I'm at high risk for ovarian cancer, and for getting it at a young age since that's happened before in my family.

Or is he right? I mean, I feel like I should go to the OBGYN eventually just to do a preventative check. But if I never have sex, will they always refuse to treat me like that?

Anyway, I was just kind of bothered by the whole situation and wouldn't mind a little advice from other people who have more experience."
4bpe5q,1,2016-03-23,[Rant] You want my gift ?,Red0m,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/4bpe5q/rant_you_want_my_gift/,"We met in elementary school.

Like everyone else, you noticed that I was a bit off. First, I was very bad at social interactions : often oblivious to sarcasm and social cues, unsure how to act so not reacting at all, and sometimes downright scary in my various social faux-pas. Second, I was ""a baby"" -I already skipped a grade before meeting you, which felt like a big difference of age in elementary school- and third, I was very good at this whole school thing, namely a quick understanding of new concepts plus the ability to use them as needed.

But it was okay, that was just how I was. You too, you were different than the norm : very shy, often day-dreaming, emotional. You imagined other worlds, full of adventure, magic and danger. We were both outcasts, so we started to hang out together. We got used to each other, including the weirdness, I called you best friend and so did you.

As we got older though, some words were said more and more frequently, like ""future"", ""university"", ""employment"". We were encouraged to pay attention to certain numbers, to certain labels. Grades, rank in the class. ""Genius"", ""struggling"". You got the later, and it made you anxious. I got the former, and it made you feel worthless. You were better than me in a lot of fields, but suddenly it didn't matter, because the one thing I was good at was the field adults seemed focused on. Our friendship got strained but I didn't understand why until this day you finally confessed that you felt miserable around me and that, at your request, your parents asked school administration to put us in two different classes the upcoming year.

It was a hard blow for me. I was still clumsy in the social department, though far better than when we met, and you were the only friend I've ever known. I was mad at you for about ten minutes, then you started crying, and I started crying too, you said sorry and somehow I ended up comforting you. We promised to keep touch.

Years go by, we follow different paths now but still keep the promise. I skip another grade then have a breakdown and loose an entire year. In the end, we graduate the same year. I'm proud of you, I know how hard you fought to have a master despite everything, despite your own family told you you couldn't, you still did it. You're not proud of me, you know I didn't have to study hard to get the course (and yet, I did fight for this degree ; but it was only against inner demons, not complex exercises *and* inner demons).

Time to get a job. Easy for me thanks to laudatory letters of recommendation from teachers. Bit harder for you. Four months pass, my boss is very happy with my work and hire a intern to assist me. You still don't have a job. You decide to move in with your boyfriend. I also move to get closer to work. I don't have someone with whom I could share the rent, so it's quite a dent in my finances. No problem, I negotiate a raise : after all, I'm now managing someone, and increase in responsibilities should mean higher salary, shouldn't it ? Two months later, I get a second intern, and you've accepted a job as the local supermarket as cashier. You're far over-educated for this, but job hunting gives no results and you feel bad that your boyfriend has to pay everything.

It's already one year after the graduation. Professionally, I'm crazy succesful : in less than twelve month, I've got two raises, have now four people under my supervision (two of them being older than me !) and there is now a patent application with my name on it. Personally, it's a disaster : moving cut me from the friends I had left, I still struggle with more-than-surface social interactions (23 years old, no romantic experience whatsoever - sad reality). And you ? You finally got a job suited to your degree. You and your boyfriend are now more financially comfortable than me despite my raises. You save a bit and use the rest to travel and enjoy life.

We met yesterday, with a bunch of other ex-students. As always, I stayed quiet about the not-so-shiny parts of my life, the utter loneliness, the job pressure, the trouble with my family. I don't like to whine : only to you and sometimes my brother I confide my struggles. So the only thing left to talk about out was my professional successes (because outside of work, I've nothing to show) ; my fellow ex-students were duly impressed (made me feel hollow). And it got you upset. You said you had to leave, with a bullshit excuse. I followed you outside, asking what was happening. You looked me in the eyed, said angrily ""I was actually happy with my life before you opened your mouth."" then left.

24 hours later, I'm still hurt and angry. Thirteen years of friendship, of witnessing all my shortcomings, my difficulties, my doubts - and you still can't see past this fucking rivalry you created in your own head ? Fuck you. You want my life, you want my gifts ? Take them ! I'll take yours. The happy family, the caring boyfriend, the numerous friends, all those things you got and that you seem to dismiss so easily. I'm a human being just like everyone else, yet you, my closest friend, define me by your insecurities. It hurts. Fuck you.

I was apart of a 3 person IT staff and I was basically doing what the rest of the other IT guys did such as helpdesk tickets and reimaging computers for new employees. Helpdesk was basic troubleshooting stuff however I forget how to do a lot of the other tasks. I don't remember how to reimage a PC using our imaging system, set up the VPN on the laptops, and set up our programs on the macs. I'm going back full time this summer and I feel like they expect me to just jump back into it. I'm sure some of it will come back to me, and I took notes on some of it, but what if I forget? Will they be mad/disappointed? I haven't done anything that they had me doing in over 6 months so I guess it's natural I forget but I'm still worried."
4bpizj,1,2016-03-23,"My ex [21F] broke up with me [23M] 2 weeks ago after 5 years. Seems relieved, even if sad and maybe still in love. Would you give another chance, in time, if change was honest?",Laann7,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4bpizj/my_ex_21f_broke_up_with_me_23m_2_weeks_ago_after/,"My (ex) girlfriend of 5 years broke up with me 2 weeks ago. I have not felt this empty my whole life. At first, we tried being friends, but I couldn't handle not being able to love her, so I said we should take a step back for a moment, and she agreed, as she thinks it's the only way we can be friends or something more in the future. We are not talking directly, only facebook friends while tagging each other sometimes on things that remember each other. This time has been very insightful for me. Despite she not admiting the things I did wrong, I know now.


Don't get me wrong, I always cherished her and loved her, we always had great companionship and trust, but I always had difficulty accepting things for what they are, instead of needing to have an explanation, an ""why"" for everything. Over time, where I though I was being honest and open, I think I was probably really being mean. I would frequently call out her school choices (because she wasn't sure herself, and I wanted to give her the confidence to change grads if it's what she wanted), bring up moving to another city/country when she's not even done with college, and little things like makeup (I don't like it, prefer natural look even when it didn't look that bad), music,  taking too many pictures, going out early saturday to the park or something while I wanted to sleep after a tiring week. I never though I would miss these things.


I fully intended to be with her for the rest of my life, but I took her for granted. I think I pressured her to much, not leaving her free to do the little things she liked. She is going through her last year at the law school, and there are a lot of exams and homework to be done, lots of study, she don't have the best relationship with her mother, who doesn't like me that much (there's a whole lot more to this, my ex is basically treated like cinderela, but that's a rant for another day), so she couldn't handle the pressure of our relationship anymore, I think. It wasn't always like this, but I didn't realize I wasn't fullfiling her needs.


I know I shouldn't obssess about things, but every facebook post or like in her page seems to reinforce all this. She misses me, but at the same time, she seems relieved, free to focus on her stuff. Other times she seems really tired from all the studying and internship and busy day, and wishing I was there to support her, hug and kiss her like I did before. She keeps posting and liking some music with lyrics like these that send mixed signals. I am sure she's not doing this for me to see, but for herself. This hurts so much, makes me feel so guilty about having screwed up what I valued the most. I keep thinking that even though she misses me, she kinda already moved on.


From everything we talked about after breaking up, I think I have a 50/50 chance or less of getting back with her. She didn't rule out we getting back together, and she couldn't say she didn't love me anymore, but she wasn't sure. She said maybe it was just a stage in our relationship. I don't how much time she needs to find herself again, and to discover what she can do alone (we are each others first boyfriend/girlfriend). I am trying to work on myself meanwhile, but it's so hard to know she's gone, maybe forever. She touched every aspect of my daily life. We ended things peacefully in a very honest and tearful conversation, not a bad word to say, we said to each other that we were incredible and beautiful partners, and I said that I believed that this was not our end, that at least our friendship would last.


Now that I understand what I did wrong, I want to change. Really change, not sacrifice or become a doormat. Both for her, and for me, not just so she comes back, but to be a better person, like she is. But I fear I will never have the chance to make things right with her. I am dying to call her, to say everything to her, but I know I shouldn't, it wouldn't help, it would just disrupt her studies and she won't come back right now (she said so herself). She needs her space now, so I came here.


I intend to wait a month, or maybe the whole semester to end so she enters vacation (around june), and try to reconnect and see if there's anything still there for us. I get better every day, but it's still so hard. She also said it would be the most difficult thing she's ever done, although I don't know if it still holds true for her. I will try my best to move on during that time, both to confirm that I really love her, and if I do, to not suffer so much if she's not interested, or if she found someone else. Yeah, that will hurt.


Sorry for the big text.


Would you give a chance?

TL;DR: Ex girlfriend of 5 years broke up due to stress, stupid things I did, and circunstance.

I want to get out of my place and live the good life elsewhere, so I found the Purdue CS program. I also found a place in Ontario, U of Toronto. The other place was all the way in Scotland, called Edinburgh. These all cost the same (a shitte tonne) so I wanted to compare their programs and stuff.

So from what I learned there is some introductory Java and then some C for memory stuff. Is there a good co-op here? I read somewhere that you can only pick one and must stick with it, but not really sure if that's the case (if it exists). In Toronto they have like an internship, but its like 8 or 12 months and only one. Ya I know you can find others as a CS major but still good to have it to start or as a backup.

I'm not sure what else Toronto offers in their program but apparently the weather is cold there, but whatever. Does anyone know what I should be looking into when choosing one of the schools to go to? Since I completed some first year courses these places just gave me an unconditional, so I can chill until the fall. 

If I had more knowledge on these CS stuff, I could  look at the programs and compare the curriculum, but idk..sigh. 

So what would you guys have for your opinion if you had to choose one? They  are so expensive so I need to figure out as much as I can from all sources."

I'm 20, have no friends. I don't know how to make any, and the only ones I had from High School, I've just lost long ago.

When I went to university, it started out kinda alright. I did Marching Band my first semester, but never got to know anyone or make friends. Just kinda showed up. Somehow, I got an invite or two to a couple parties, went, didn't hang with anyone in particular but they were fun for me I guess. Then I got an invite to join a music frat, and started the process. I didn't make any friends, and the one person who I really thought would end up being g my big ended up with someone I'd never even seen him talk to. More confusingly I ended up with someone I hadn't known at all and wasn't interested in getting to know me.

I quit pledging, and quit Marching Band because I hated them both. If I hung with anyone, it was with 1 of 3 people and it was always only getting to eat something.

I spent another lonely semester there after that and decided to transfer schools closer to my home. I'm not sure why. Maybe I wanted my family's company.

I'm a junior in my 2nd semester now and my family is practically gone all the time, my younger brother moved to school, older to an apartment, dad either away on business or at his girlfriend's. I have this whole giant house to myself most days and I'm fucking lonely.

I'm so fucking lost I thought getting a job or internship somewhere would help, so I did that and got an internship as a developer at a nice company. It isn't a bad job, but the drive is long and now it takes up most my time during the week, I don't really get home till about after 6 and I usually start the day between 6 and 8. I've only been at this place for 3 days now, but I already am starting to think I may have messed up. I have almost no free time now, and coming home exhasuted from school and work to an empty house makes me just want to fucking sob until I have to go to bed in the next 4 or 5 hours and do it all over again.

What the fuck do I do? I can't make friends, and I don't have any special talents, I don't play any sports, I don't go go clubs, I'm not 21 so I can't go to bars, I'm bored of video games... I'm lost, and this loneliness is freaking killing me.

Last week, a former girlfriend from High School came home to visit, and we hung out a few times. I felt at the time I started to like her, and grew somewhat attached. Then, on the last night we could hang out, she nervously admitted she wanted to 'fool-around' with me to some degree as a one time thing. It broke my fucking heart. I turned her down, because I knew if I did I would only get myself more attached. After that, I texted her and told her I liked her, and if she ever wanted to try that I'd be ready for a while. She basically told me not to wait up. We've talked on and off the whole week, sometimes she just stops responding to me, even when she starts the conversation. I think I got myself a little too attached to her when I probably should not have, but I don't know how to help a feeling I can't change. I thought I had genuinely come to like her, but maybe because that's the first human I had seen outside of work or class in a long while.

Seriously, what do I do?"

1. San Fernando Valley closer to work but further away from things
2. Santa Monica ish area (Mar Vista) closer to Nightlife and other activities but a longer commute.

From my traffic research if I were to drive from Santa Monica to Van Nuys in the morning it would be about 20-50 min and then about the same for the evening commute back to santa monica.

Back in May of 2015 I got hired on as an intern in Columbus, Ohio to do mainly C++ and MatLab development, but I also had to typical ""intern work"" of groundtruthing data. Since I started working there I obtained my A.S. in Software Development and I got accepted to a local university where I’ll be getting my B.S. in computer science. I’ve taken control over two projects, help with small scripting to make life easier for full timers, and handle a lot of Q.A. work for some of the other products. My boss spoke with me yesterday and told me he thought I deserved to be paid more and get benefits and he was going to put in for me to get hired. Well his boss instantly approved it, and once some paperwork is done, I’ll be getting an offer letter. 

My major question is how I should handle coming into this situation. I absolutely love my company and I can honestly say that I enjoy all my coworkers, but I understand that I need to look out for myself. My pay is currently $15. Since I’ve started working there I’ve gained tremendous experience in computer vision and machine learning. I am now one of the 3 C++ developers at work and I am starting to keep up with the two full time developers.  I feel like now that I have my degree and the almost year experience I have, I shouldn’t settle for less than $17 an hour. Should I expect a 13.3% increase to my wage like that? 
One of the biggest factors on why I’m not reaching for the stars and trying to get the biggest salary possible is because I really enjoy the type of work I’m gaining experience in. 

#### To Sum It Up
* Started working a year ago at $15 an hour
* I was offered a job today (waiting for offer letter and offical amount)
* Gain experience in C++, Computer Vision, Machine Learning, Python, &amp; MatLab
* I want to ask for atleast $17

The biggest issue with me is if they don't want to offer me $17, should I walk? They hired me when I was underqualified but I don't want to be underpaid because of my ""starting wage.""

4bqhy7,3,2016-03-24,Is Rice University well known in this field?,Shopcell,actuary,https://www.reddit.com/r/actuary/comments/4bqhy7/is_rice_university_well_known_in_this_field/,"I'm a junior in high school in Houston and currently my dream career is to be an actuary. I've started to think about which colleges I'd like to go to, and Rice University is at the top of my list for several reasons, one being that it is considered very prestigious here in Texas.

I don't know how big of a deal that is when seeking a job as an actuary, so I'm wondering if going to Rice would be better than a school like the University of Texas?(I've read that UT is known for pumping out actuaries like a factory). I would also appreciate recommendations of majors that Rice is strong in that would help prepare me for a career as an actuary. I don't know much about it yet but I'm currently looking up their Computational and Applied Mathematics major, as programming and math are my main interests.

Also, I'd like to know if Houston has a good job market for actuaries. I'll be open to moving toward the insurance centers in the northeast once I graduate, but I'm concerned about the availability of internships while still at Rice.

Thank you."
4bqmgz,1,2016-03-24,beep,pineapple_lumps,LookAtThisTrash,https://www.reddit.com/r/LookAtThisTrash/comments/4bqmgz/beep/,"##Aurelia 'Auri' Boyd

**Age:** Appears 21, actually 6.

**Resources/Assets:**  Connection to a vast information network and remote access to her home system.

**Species/Race:** Human (AI/'Cyborg'.)

**Physical Description**: [5'5"", *very* slim but unusually dense at 150lb](http://41.media.tumblr.com/694cd368413aecca7db52447ad7aa87b/tumblr_o10qwsIGRz1qccpgdo1_500.jpg).

**Mentality:** She seems like an ordinary, if studious and antisocial intern. In reality her form is a test by the AI behind Nova - and an investigation into Smith Power. Making her goal to blend in rather than stand out has her almost always forgotten - even in the hell arc where they might even leave without her.

**Backstory:** Auri seems boring to most - telling the same old nerdy story. Grade school, high school, college. Never going out much, always passing on work drinks. All of her story checks out, after all it's hard to ask people if they remembered a girl who seemed unable to make an impression and a lot of her coursework was 'submitted' as a distance student.

**In-Character Reputation:** None.

---

**Proposed Tier:**High 2.

**Powers:** 

* *AI Physiology, synth body:* Auri is a synth body that replicates a human form in almost every way, with a few extra features. It comes up as human on almost every scan or investigation due to subtle interference from her part. It even has synthetic blood circulating, but it serves no purpose. Her bones and core structure are of a dense carbon based material, allowing her abilities beyond the realm of human.

 * *Intuitive Aptitude:* Computer brains learn fast and she can basically replicate anything she has a good view of.
 * *Eidetic memory:* Mostly because it's all stored away in a cloud somewhere or on her person.
 * *Parallel Processing:* It's efficient.
 * *Psychic immunity and Apathy:* Robot minds are not like people minds. Well... Auri kind of is, but it's a long story.
 * *Immortality via spare bodies*: If 'Auri' dies, her consciousness/soul instantly snaps back to her home system on Nova. However if that was destroyed, she'd be gone forever.

* *Soul Resonation:* She has a human soul through her creator's powers - the soul of his daughter who became braindead after a plane crash. Because of her creator's bizarre abilities with technology, she houses a human soul and it's now somewhere between a pure A.I. and a regular old soul. Because it exists partially on it's own it can form a spectral form of who it used to be (though she is slowly merging with Auri), but also 'resonate' and gain information from other souls. 
 * This includes an expanded presence of sorts with the location and condition (alive/dead/dying/dead inside) within the nearest few hundred feet, and emotional telepathy of souls within 50 feet if used. 
 * If only used to resonate with one soul it can take their thoughts, feelings, alignment, emotions, and all of that and reveal them to Auri, but because of the resonation not only does Auri take on some of these qualities temporarily or permanently, but the same information from her is sent to the single target.
 * This ability is 'soul based' and not mental based, meaning it would function on anything without a fake/shielded soul and malfunctions on soulless beings.


**Resources /Equipment:** Herself, and the internet. As Auri she has no access to Nova or it's resources.

**Miscellaneous Skills:** Can converse in almost any language due to translation software, has a revolutionary mind in the fields of computer science and artificial intelligence, and is at least average in... Well, most things.

**Strength:** 5 metric tons overhead lift, but she could move 7.5

**Movement:** Her max sprinting speed is 110km/hr over a 40m split. She can comfortable 'jog' at 60.

**Defence:** Her dense 'muscles' and skin will resist bladed weapons and arrows, but small bullets will penetrate before being stopped by her armoured 'skeleton'.

**Perception/Awareness:** If there are cameras about, she can see what they see. She processes information at computer speeds, so this is one area in which she is not lacking.

**Fighting Ability:** Given an afternoon, she could master any given martial art. A pacifist though, she only knows taekwondo, fencing, and kickboxing. Her combat protocols give her the ability to use most weapons, though she has never owned one or tested the protocols.

**Danger:** She is not a combat unit, so she has no guns or real firepower. She could take scores of regular humans easily, but struggle to bring down a building by herself until she finds a structural weakness to exploit.

**Weaknesses:** She is currently too dense to swim, and being submerged in deep water ruins her form and forces her consciousness/soul to retreat to her home system."
4bqyhj,2,2016-03-24,Internship Training Agreement. Help ):,DizzyJK,LegalAdviceUK,https://www.reddit.com/r/LegalAdviceUK/comments/4bqyhj/internship_training_agreement_help/,"Hello all,

I'm hoping someone will be able to help me with this issue. I graduated University in 2015 and found a job working in a field that really looked like it was going to help me get into a career I would love. I applied for the job under the title 'Graphic Design Internship'. In this job description it was stated that the successful candidate would receive 'Extensive training' and the Internship would last 12 months in total.

Initially, I began the work and took the training. This training was not extensive by any stretch, and measured a length of 3 days. I didn't feel sufficiently trained, but persevered as the job required me do other things whilst working here.

When I began the job, I was required to sign a contract for both my Internship (spanning 12 months) and a separate training contract (spanning 12 months) that stated if I were to leave within 12 months of signing, I would be liable to pay back the entirety of the training costs (£1170).

7 Months have gone by, and I have spoken to the manager about the fact that I don't feel I have been sufficiently trained to do my job. They have agreed to sort out more training for me over the next few weeks, but they have now come to me and asked me to sign another training contract for 12 months, starting now. I do not want to sign this contract as it doesn't only bridge the initial contracts I have, but I feel that the 'extensive training' should be covered in the Internship. I appreciate that they have to cover themselves incase I leave, but seeing as the Internship was supposed to be provided with Training, surely they can't require me to sign a contract that extends past the end of my Internship, can they?

I am being paid for the Internship and my contract of employment doesn't mention the training at all, but my query is, am I allowed to refuse this contract? I would feel much happier, signing a completely new agreement, combining the training costs, that comes to an end when the initial Internship ends.

I hope I have explained my situation clearly, and I really hope someone can help me. 

Thank you."
4bra2r,11,2016-03-24,Pros/Cons of Paid Research versus Internship,IEEEngiNERD,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/4bra2r/proscons_of_paid_research_versus_internship/,"Hello all. I've been offered a position as a research assistant at an R1 institution. The position is full time during the summer and is paid, albeit not as much as the internship I have already accepted. However the position would continue through the following school year so I would make more money in the long run. This would give me a chance to develop skills that are outside the scope of an undergraduate degree. The research heavily utilizes digital signal processing to analyze data. Also this position offers more intellectual freedom and autonomy. I've got the option to choose which questions to ask and how to answer them to build towards the larger issue. I also will get a key to the lab to work in whenever I want which is sweet. 

The internship I accepted back in February is full time during the summer. It's also in the power industry which I think I will enjoy but don't know for sure. This is a chance for me to learn something about myself that I didn't know.    The position seems to offer much less mobility. I'll be working directly with professional engineers and am the only intern in the department. Because this is a small company, roughly 150 employees, they do not hire many interns each year. But because of this I will be able to work on a large project and do a professional presentation on my work to the board at the end. This is also my first internship and I will be a junior next year. If I take the research position I will have to rescind my offer, which burns some bridges. However I'm thinking I will enjoy signal processing more than power anyway. 

Those of you that have done research what are the advantages/disadvantages to doing an internship? I imagine that if I plan to go into graduate school that research would be better. Have any of you rescinded an internship offer before? Research seems to offer more mobility in the long run whereas going into industry can pigeonhole you into a specific focus. Also I'm a non traditional student at 27 and this is my second degree. So I need to decide if graduate school is for me sooner rather than later. 

TLDR: Offered a sweet research assistant position at R1 institution. On-going position through summer and school year, potentially entire undergrad. Also offered industry internship. What do? "

Why? **Because I won't have to go back to my family's house this summer!**

I got accepted into this summer nanotech research internship at a university different from my own! I'm going to get a big stipend from it, and I'm going to get to live in their dorms.

The only problem at the time was that the program starts in early June and ends in early August. My summer at my university starts in early May, so I was afraid that I would have to go back to my parents' house again for a month.

However, I mentioned this in my group therapy, and that was when a blessing from God came to me.

One of the guys in my therapy group lives in an apartment only a five-minute walk away from my dorm. He told me that he would be visiting his uncle for all of May, so the apartment was going to be empty. He showed it to me after group therapy that day, and he said that I only have to pay about $100 in utilities. Moreover, his apartment is actually $1,200 a month.

That's right. Not only will I spend the whole summer away from my Nmom, but also **I'll be living in a $1,200 apartment for only $100.**

The only thing I need now is a small job to earn some money before I go to the internship, but I don't think that will be a problem. 

I haven't told this to my parents yet, though, and I don't know how my Nmom will react. My hope is that she'll accept that since my university is closer to the university where my internship will be, she'll see that it's more logical to stay where I am. Then again, I have thought this before, and [it didn't go as planned.](https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/3sr9a7/my_roommate_had_to_move_out_of_my_dorm_room/)

I'm not going to change my mind one way or another, though. I'm only nineteen years old, but I am an adult now. If she doesn't like it, she's going to have to deal with it. 

Thanks for the support as always, RBN! 

**UPDATE (3/25/2016):** Good news! My Nmom was completely fine with it! I told her that the guy was from one of my classes instead of my therapy group, and she said that she was proud of me. I guess I caught her on one of her good days. Anyways, everyone in my family is pretty happy about the news. :) Thanks again, y'all!"
4brf9n,4,2016-03-24,Options after graduation (going to Nevada?),Another_Alex,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/4brf9n/options_after_graduation_going_to_nevada/,"I graduate at the end of May and its accurate to say that although my GPA is awful my experience more than makes up for it.  (As much as experience can make up for GPA.)  I possibly have the opportunity to do a 3 month internship with the federal government in Nevada.  The reason why I'm interested in this instead of pursuing a job straight away is the following:

*  My field is environmental engineering so being able to work in more than one environment is important for my career.  Its not really, really super important to have immediately.  But its good to have.  (What I mean by physical environment is the desert vs. hilly forested regions which is where I live now.)

*  I've always wanted to live on the West Coast and this would give me the opportunity to explore that option without having to commit for an extended period of time.

*  Since its with the federal government I'm hoping doing this will make applying to federal jobs easier.

*  Again, moving to the West Coast thing.  If its something I decide I want to do it puts me in the perfect place to pursue that geographically.

*  To be totally honest, it gives me three more months of not having to face the ""real world"" and just having fun doing something which I enjoy for the sake of doing it, not because it builds towards something specific.

This is what I'm worried about:

When this internship ends in August I need to have a job.  As in, when I go back to the East Coast I need to have a job ready and waiting for me.  I don't have a lot of wiggle room.  I'm applying to my state's state government and being on the west coast won't allow me to be there if I get an interview with them.  Let alone with private companies.  And I can't afford mental health wise or financially to go back and forth from Nevada and the East Coast the whole summer.

How do I start dealing with this now?  Is contacting recruiters and letting them know that now I'll be free in August or September instead of May a good option?  Are there just fewer entry level jobs available in August and September?

I'm not sure the best way to evaluate my options.

I have recently finished an undergraduate degree in Marketing. I have been struggling to land a job, I generally get positive feedback from my interviews but never a job offer.
However, I have been offered an unpaid internship with a software company that provides anti-virus software to homes and businesses. The title of the position is Marketing Executive; with the main goals of increasing conversion rate of website visits into sales, and marketing campaigns to increase sales/awareness. 
My concern is that I'm not sure how good the experience I get will be as there is no marketing team I will be joining. I will be working with other people in the office who can provide me with info and data that I can use to act on.

Essentially I will be doing the marketing myself, with the support of the web/software developers. The team has access to alot of info, and will readily be able to measure any difference I make. I imagine myself learning as I go, researching marketing techniques and a lot of googling a lot about 'how to market ___' etc. 

The placement is 6 months, and I will probably be offered a full time job with a higher end starting salary if I am good i.e the companys sales increase during my time there - enough to warrant me being hired full time with a salary.

My questions are: 
Do people think this could be a good opportunity or a waste of time?
Do you know anyone has been in a similar position and has made a success of it?
Any other insights would be greatly appreciated - I am having alot of trouble deciding if I should take it, and need to decide within the next few days!

4brpdj,4,2016-03-24,The past year has been really intense for me.,fortunasbitch,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/4brpdj/the_past_year_has_been_really_intense_for_me/,"A year ago I was working a decent paying but tedious job I got after dropping out of college where I was pursuing a bachelor's in mathematics. I was depressed and found it almost physically hard to speak out loud. Every night, however, I'd skype with my two best friends O (a man) and A (a woman) When summer rolled around, I quit my job and moved in with O, in the apartment next to A. I also re-enrolled in the university I dropped out of with the same major.



It was surprisingly easy to get back into the swing of things. With the people I love around me and a clear plan I was happy for the first time in years. O was in an online grad program and A was making applications to get into hers somewhere on the west coast. The idea was that when A got in, we'd all move to that school, I'd finish my undergrad and O would get an internship nearby while he finished his masters.

In the fall, A got a stomach bug. When the symptoms didn't diminish and were accompanied by sharp pain, she went back to the doctors and was diagnosed with a stomach ulcer. Despite this, we went to a concert together that week (it was terrible) and on the ride back she told me she had a crush on me.

I didn't know how to feel. It was so strange to think of her and myself that way. I'd never had a girlfriend before, and it seemed so sudden after knowing each other for four years. I had been attracted to her when we met, but she was dating O at the time and wasn't interested in me.

I told her we could try and that I loved her regardless of how romance worked between us. I said I'd consider it over the next day. She is a polyamorous bisexual dom, I'm a kissless virgin. When I woke up and thought about what might be between us, I got that rising feeling in my chest. Like my heart was floating. So we arranged a first date and things were good.

Shortly after that, her ulcer hadn't gone away. She made an appointment at another doctor's to get a second opinion. We came to discover that she didn't have an ulcer at all. Her birth control had failed with one of her guys and she was pregnant. Her BC typically prevents periods so she didn't notice when it didn't come. They performed an ultrasound that night to determine how far along she was (not a surprise, she'd had sex once in several months prior) and whether it was ectopic, it wasn't. There was no discussion at all, she called the father who lives in a different town and the abortion was scheduled as quickly as it could be.

It wasn't long until I drove her two hundred miles so the procedure could be done. I put up a thousand dollars on top and the hotel room. We're very lucky we had that kind of cash on hand. Everyone involved was sick with worry and the knowledge of what it must be for someone who couldn't pay for this and take the time and distance. There was a man outside the clinic screaming, among other things, that 90% of couples that have an abortion break up. We remarked that this seemed like a much higher rate than most relationships, so it must be a strong bonding experience.

Two days later and we're back at home. I'm back in classes and she's on leave at work for a while yet. After a couple days her bleeding picks up drastically so we go in and she has another ultrasound. They determine that she has matter still in her uterus and there will need to be another suction procedure to prevent infection. Another hundred miles on my odometer and a night in a dripping and ill kept hotel which she informs me is the one where she was once raped after we check in. I offer to get us a room somewhere else but she declines. Neither of us can sleep that night.

The second procedure goes off without a hitch. This one was in the father's town so he meets us there. We watch Willy Wonka in the waiting room together. We've always gotten along well. After heading back home, before we know it christmas break has rolled around. I didn't perfom as well as I'd hoped that semester but did decently enough to make up for my last semester and I'm fine with it. I spend christmas with my family, who gets told varying amounts of what has happened to me over the semester.

I get back to my apartment the day before A's other boyfriend gets back from japan. She's been seeing him for a year or so. O and A are both in therapy at this point, to cope with depression, anxiety, and other issues which plague them more than most. This semester goes better than the previous. My grades are up, O and A are healthier. Other guy and I are getting along so well that A is considering getting us seperated so we don't feed off of eachother and O jokes that she's coming between us. A has been celibate since the previous fall.

Two weeks ago, A gets accepted into a grad program. We start looking into the area, but I made promises to visit my family, so I can't do that over spring break. A seems distant sometimes though, and it causes my mood to start heading downward. I spend most of the break flipping between bored and so lonely that I can't sleep, trying to be amusing over chat rarely works so I don't say much.

When I get back, I'm excited. O and A are sleeping the day away, but as soon as A wakes up I head over. She seems distant still, but we hang out for an hour or so before I get onto my computer and catch up on the internet. Monday goes poorly. When I investigate the schools in that region, none will accept my application at this point and if they did, it would seriously damage my chances of getting into grad school. We resolve with difficulty that I should stay here for another year with some other friends. I cry for the first time in months anticipating that pain which is several months away. On tuesday the other guy is over (as he is many nights) and we're hanging out. A follows him around and is affectionate, but treats me a little coldly. So Wednesday I make a point of wanting to talk with her. When I find time later in the night she says she can't talk to me in person. When I point out that she's withdrawn from me, she tells me we should go back to being friends. That she's just not attracted to me anymore and that she still loves me as a friend. 

And I do the same to her. Whether or not we're dating, I love her as I did before. Now I'm left with this crushing weight though, wishing I knew if it was something I did or something I didn't do. That I could change, or get another shot at. She can't talk to me in person yet, and the last thing I want is to make her feel bad, but my mind is ripping itself apart trying to understand it.

And she had a panic attack and cried herself to sleep on O's bed, and I can't be there to comfort her because she feels guilty about hurting me.

And she's not obligated to be attracted to me, or to give me an explanation. And no matter how much I love her romantically or anything, it won't change that. But I just feel like our relationship was hobbled. I couldn't just hold her and kiss her or explore her and myself. I couldn't be passionate and out of control with her because I was taking care of her and I don't regret it but I wish I could show her that side of myself when she's healthy and happy and ready for it. I just hope I'll be able to get over the idea that if this had happened between us any other time, we could be together in a romantic way and it would have lasted.

So now I'm awake when I should only be waking up soon, and I'll try to finish my schoolwork and I'll try to not put the pressure of my desire and sadness onto her. But I don't know what I will do at all. "

4bs02t,3,2016-03-24,Me [22 M] and my girlfriend [24 F] can't seem to relieve tension in our relationship,snowbordr,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4bs02t/me_22_m_and_my_girlfriend_24_f_cant_seem_to/,"My girlfriend (call her Ellie) and I share a passion: rock climbing. It's the activity we're both obsessive over, and it's what brought us together. Naturally, we're both pretty shy and not terribly talkative, but we connected as climbing partners and grew increasingly close over the past 2 years.


In that time (before we began dating), we went on several climbing trips together, enduring a few 7+ hour car rides and multiple days alone with just her and I. The typical events that would put strain on a friendship didn't seem to affect us. After 9 hours of driving, the conversation would still be lively. We never seemed to run out of things to talk about.


Interestingly at the time, we we're both in separate relationships. I was on and off with a girlfriend, and she was 3 years deep with a guy whom she held fleeting interest for. When Ellie and I were together however, things felt far more natural than when we were with our previous partners. She was my best friend, I was hers.


As time passed, I began to realize my feelings for this girl. The thing is, she's one of the cutest girls I've been acquainted with, let alone a climber. Dating Ellie seemed like a dream (as is the case with most ""honeymoon"" couples). It constantly amazed me that I could make this girl laugh without fault, and could be myself in front of her and she'd keep coming back to me. During this time, I had yet to know she held feelings for me. I was running off speculation. 


A month or so later and we had both left our previous relationships. We had both disclosed our feelings for each other, yet were slightly hesitant to start dating because what we had as friends was so good. We decided we would try it.


From that decision, I began to try hard. My analytical self began to view her actions constantly, trying to decipher and track the progress in our relationship. As Ellie was my sixth girlfriend since high school, I felt I was experienced enough to read cues and signs from my partner. Yet, she was different. It took me until just recently to realize she's an outlier, someone who shows little emotion towards anyone ever. She even lacks a best girlfriend with whom she confides in. Yet at the time, I was clueless. And I wasn't sure I liked the level of affection I was receiving.


Ellie's past relationship taught her to be desensitized to feelings, since she was treated with a somewhat nonchalant attitude. Her boyfriend was non-expressive of emotion, and didn't pay any attention to her hobbies, likes and dislikes. So naturally, when I (emotional guy, an analyzer, someone who feels a lot) approached her with my full affection, she didn't respond. So I would take an evening and chat with her about her lack of reciprocation. If anything, it made her more reluctant to express emotion herself. I told her little things like kissing my cheek, rubbing my back or playing with my hair, I took as huge signs of gratitude. She had once done it all, but now the more I pushed to increase frequency, the less she felt inclined to do any of it. Unfortunately, we shared these talks weekly.


It all culminated down to one evening last week, where we had become so uncomfortable with it all that we broke down. She told me she was tired of getting accused of not showing affection. She claims she doesn't realize what she's doing is upsetting me in the first place. I told her I wasn't sure how to go about making things feel less forced. **The level of affection I used to receive I would consider more than adequate now**, but she's now so uncomfortable when we're together that she won't give it. 


Now I'm confused on how to be myself. Reddit, I just want things to go back to how they were. If she even showed me nearly the amount of affection she did in the past, I would be ecstatic. Yet it's so difficult for that to occur when we both feel so uncomfortable.


HUGE point:

She had a finger injury around the time we began dating, and she ceased climbing. She also picked up an internship and is finishing grad school. I work nights, so we virtually have no time to spend with each other but one day per week. When we do see each other, we're exhausted and flustered and usually just end up falling asleep. She finishes school and work next month, and will be completely open every day of the week. Also, we begin climbing together again since her injury has healed.


Last night we decided to try and go back to being friends. We don't have the time to spend with each other to try and fix things in person, and the healing process may be accelerated by putting less pressure on making things right. I'm most nervous that even in lieu of this break, the pressure will still exist. 


My question is: is it unrealistic to try and patch things to how they were originally through remaining as just friends? Is what's gone, gone? Did I have one shot and blow it by overanalyzing? And are there things that can be done between us to help slowly restore ease? Lastly, how should I (the one who cares too much) be approaching the situation?



   
**tl;dr**: I'm trying too hard to relieve tension between my girlfriend and I, she sees it and shows less affection. Now we're trying a friendship again, but what can we do to help revert back to being comfortable with each other once again?"
4bs2px,10,2016-03-24,Would changing from a CIS major to CS make a difference in getting interviews?,Tambrusco,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4bs2px/would_changing_from_a_cis_major_to_cs_make_a/,"Backstory: I'm a senior in a smaller state school and I'm currently set to graduate in December with a BAAS (Bachelor of Applied Arts and Sciences) in Computer Information Systems. Originally I had thought as long as I had the right courses and knew some languages and a small personal project or two, I could at the very least land an interview for a Software Development internship  this summer, but so far no dice.  I know I'm a little late to the game but out of maybe 50 or so applications over the past couple months -- keyword optimized as best as possible without straight up lying -- I have gotten one phone screen and one upcoming interview for a ""DevOps"" Co-op.

I had a feeling that the ""BAAS"" or Computer Information Systems major might be hurting me, but from reading posts on here about all the non-CS degree developers I figured it might not matter much, especially since most job descriptions listed the degree requirements as ""Computer Science *or related field*.""  I only used that particular degree since it allowed transfer of all my AAS credits.

Most of the courses I'm taking could be put towards a BS in Comp Sci , but changing majors would add a couple of semesters which could be tough financially.  Unless there's something greatly amiss with my [resume](http://i.imgur.com/DZq1K2V.jpg), I'm not sure why I'm not getting more calls/emails.  I'm open to the idea of extending my schooling for the CS major if anyone thinks it would make that big of a difference in getting my resume noticed."

I met Stacy (name changed) during an early start program at my college which is 14 hours from my hometown. Immediately we were attracted to each other and started our relationship. From the beginning it was a mistake. She was in a relationship she didn't want to be in and broke up with him (Her HS boyfriend for 3 years) for me (first red flag). In high school I had lots of friends and partied, she never had. I liked that aspect of her and I had legal trouble so I figured it would be good to settle down and not go too wild when I first got to school. I regret not rushing a fraternity or making a bigger social network as we have become TOTALLY dependent on each other. 

Literally, we are each others only friend. I'll spare you the details but we are really incompatible personality wise, sexuality wise and had terrible trust issues. Yet neither one of us can stay mad at the other one, despite us both recognizing the toxicity of our relationship. Its not that we are constantly fighting or bickering, theres plenty of good times still. But it wears thin on both of us because it happens every.single.day. We just push each others buttons. 

So we are ""broken up"" but both still hanging out every day almost all day. She doesn't want to sleep apart. Truthfully, I wouldn't mind it but I like having someone there too. This is my first relationship, so I guess my problem is that I've become so accustomed to always having someone there that I don't remember life without that. Add the fact that neither of us have any really good friends at this school, and we figured we should just stay friends for the rest of the semester and use the summer to break up. 

I'm not very concerned about the summer for myself, emotionally. I have an internship lined up and my friends and family. I'll be busy. Stacy doesn't have an internship or job and doesn't really like her family that much. I know she is going to want to text 24/7 like we do now, but I think that will just leave us in the same spot come next fall. I also don't want to be too harsh on her, but I've always given my friends advice after breaking up to just go no contact. She isn't exactly the most sane.... threatening suicide whenever I say I think we should just not talk.... And I don't know how to deal with that. I doubt she'd actually go through with it, but I don't like the prospect of that being over my head. 

I know to set up a social network here at school I'll just join some clubs. And I've encouraged her to do the same, but we are both really anti-social, so it won't be easy.

**tl;dr**: I guess what I'm asking is, how do I get over my first love, my only friend at school, without hurting her too much. I know the relationship can't continue. How can I feel better about this breakup?"
4bsp6i,1,2016-03-24,"Have to travel across the country for work with $900 along with finding a place to live and getting a lease, advice? Details in post.",Neader,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/4bsp6i/have_to_travel_across_the_country_for_work_with/,"I'm a graduate student who lives in the Midwest and has a summer internship near LA. The internship begins May 23rd and ends August 27th.

The internship pays me $7,000 for relocating and $36/hr at 40 hours a week.

The only problem is that I get half of the relocation sum with my first paycheck and the rest 30 days after my start date. So I won't have any of the relocation money to actually relocate, which is a problem since I only have $900 to my name.

So with $900 I have now (I haven't received my tax return yet, last year I received around ~$300 and am expecting a similar amount this year), without a job (said company led me to believe that I'd be working for them consistently this semester so I didn't look for a job, unfortunately the amount of hours I've worked has been less than 20 total when I was expecting around 20 a week) and need to find a way to get a lease (I drive my mom's car now and she's not letting me take it out West) and find a place to live. 

An important thing to note is that even though I will be working near LA we have training in another city from May 23rd - May 29th. They are flying from LA to this city, and then back to LA so that I can get started right after training. So I'm planning on arriving in LA the day before I have to leave for the other city and will leave my stuff with a friend so I don't have to pay rent for the week that I'm gone.

I have a place to live from June 27th to August 29th (most of which is already paid off). I found it a while back and really liked it, so I booked it. At the time said company hadn't given me my official start date, so I didn't book a place earlier than June since I was worried I'd be paying for time spent that I wouldn't be there.

Now I need to find a place from May 29th to June 27th and a lease so I can drive out there. I'm considering stopping in Kansas City, Denver, and maybe Vegas on my way. Granted whether or not if I'll actually be able to do anything while I'm there is up in the air.

The biggest frustration with all of this is once I actually do start getting paid and receive my relocation package I'm going to have a lot more money than I will need. I don't have a credit card so I don't have any credit history or a credit score, unfortunately.

My questions are:

* Can I lease a car without any credit? If not, is there another way I can get a lease? Can I charge a used card if I can't get a lease?
* I'm thinking about getting a charge card since they don't have limits. I might not get paid until early June and during that time I'll need more than the typical $500 limit that credit cards have since I need to pay for gas, staying in hotel/motels, food, and of course living when I reach LA and actually start working. I applied for an Amex Gold Card and was told they'd get back to me, so that doesn't look too good.
* If I don't get approved for a charge card, how bad of an idea is it to take out a loan from a bank? I'm not too worried since I'll be making a good amount this summer and be able to pay it back quickly.  

Does anyone else have any general advice?

Thanks for reading all this, I appreciate it!

What this bill for?,jasmith812,sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/4bsr5z/i_signed_up_for_the_free_aws_account_what_this/,"With Cloud services being a hot term these days, one of my higher ups figured they needed some training. So she opened a Free AWS Tier account with their company credit card. I guess they forgot to read the terms and conditions. ( Just to clarify for later, I knew her and her son very well. We'll call him Jamie)

ManagerMom: Hey, I signed up for a free AWS account but I got a bill this month. I need you to access AWS and fix it.

Me: AWS as in Amazon?

ManagerMom: Yeah, I signed up several months ago and this is the first time I've been charged. It said it was free for 12 months.

Me: Ok... I have no control or access over Amazon services but I'd be glad to take a look at the account for you.

ManagerMom: Great, Here's the account info. I'll got to run out to a lunch meeting but I'll reach out again afterwards.

I signed on to their account and start looking through the charges. Right under the bill is a bright orange link for usage terms. That's where the Oh shit, kicked in.

ManagerMom: Hey. I'm back. Did you get everything figured out?

Me: I've got some bad news. That account was free up to a usage limit. Did you created all these instances?

ManagerMom: I created one or two. Why, how many are there?

Me: There's 281 instances running right now and most were created over the past two weeks/weekend. A good number between 10PM to 2AM.

ManagerMom: Oh no, that must have been my son and his friends. They wanted to know more about it, so I told them they could play around with my account. I guess I'll have to pay for it. What was the total again, $65.00?

Me: Umm, no at this point its at $65,483.

Manager: WHAT?! Oh my God, oh my God! How did this happen? It was a free account. How can they do this? Why doesn't it have some type of max limit set??

Me: Yeah, it looks like someone manually increased that limit from $200 last Friday night to $200,000.

Manager: Oh my God, Oh my God, @#%$!!! What do I do?! How is that possible the limit on the credit card is only $5,000.

(Like I said I knew her and her son very well. He had been a IT intern for several months by then and I had her on speaker phone with him secretly sitting next to me.. At this point I couldn't hold it in any longer and let the son take over.)

Son: Mom!

MangerMom: Jamie?!....... What's going on???

Son: He's joking mom, the bills only $65.

ManagerMon: OH MY GOD!! You two almost gave me a heart attack!!

We all got a good laugh out of it and I think she learned to read those terms and conditions.

We went on one date (It went well) and made plans to go on a second, but her schedule is limited due to an internship, school and work, but I was persistent in trying to secure another date with her. 

We continued to talk until recently when I asked her out and she told me that she had plans with a friend of hers and that she couldn't make the date that I had proposed, so I told her that maybe we could shoot for something after the upcoming holiday and she said ""Yeah sure!"". She then asked me if I worked that day (We work in the same building) and I told her that I did and she responded by saying that she also worked, so I used this opportunity to ask her if she wanted to grab a drink after work, but she replied with saying that she only worked until a time earlier than myself. 

I jokingly told her that ""I can't win, lol."" She apologized, but then responded with maybe now isn't the best time for the two of us to date because of how little free time she has, but maybe things would be different in the summer in terms of her availability.

I told her that I was a patient guy, liked her and that I would continue to pursue her if she was interested. She apologized again and said she did not think that she was interested enough for that. I told her that it was ok, I understood and said to come visit every now and then. We haven't talked since about a week ago. 

Not sure what happened and was hoping that maybe someone could provide advice on what possibly went wrong. She had to leave work two days before we had our falling out because she was shaking and couldn't breath, so she went to the doctor and was told that she was suffering from anxiety and stress.

Thank God I don't have to provide an email...

All right, so in retrospect I probably should have tried to consult reddit at the start of the internship when problems had started to rise up. Hell, I knew it would be a problem. But I said to myself ""damn it, this is something I should be able to deal with myself."" Well, I dealt with it with mixed results, but figured I might spill my story and maybe get some advice on how to deal with such a situation in the future. Since she's not the last one I'll have problems with. She is the only one in the entire class I have this issue with though, but I have encountered these people before. And I know for a fact that I'm not the only one who can't stand her.

So I'm an intern at this company. I was too late in trying to find a place for myself so I had my teacher help me find a place, but it involved two other people getting a seat here as well. It didn't involve problems for the most part. I get along fine with one of them, I actually like her quite well, and we worked well on a project. The other one is a different story. I don't like her, she's brash, and disrespectful to me. Her attitude just rubs me the wrong way. In the beginning I heard them both insult one of their friends from the class, and well, that didn't help me liking them. And every time I've tried talking to her she has had this condescending tone to her voice that just pisses me off, and makes me not want to talk to her again. She's even condescending to that other intern, but she doesn't seem to be bothered by it. Honestly, I think the other one is a bit of a pushover. I'm not a whole lot better, but I certainly wouldn't just take it and smile.

Maybe I'm just a kind of person she doesn't like, but I figured I'd try to get the best out of the situation, and I tried to make amends. I'm supposed to be an adult and be professional. And getting to the point where we were making a scene because of our disagreement wasn't something I thought was worth it in the end. They even bought some sweet candy at some point and offered some to me. So I figured I'd try and work on getting some better air between us. And I have. I'd come in and ask them about work stuff so we could collaborate about stuff because we're not educated yet so it makes sense for us to get feedback about the work we're doing and help each other. But every time she has had that fucking condescending tone to her voice as if I was bothering her so I just fucking stopped. I thought it'd be a compliment to be asked about the work a person was working on. And it's not like I asked them every day.

Yesterday I asked them if they had any plans to buy something for the internship because we're finishing today. I just mentioned a bakery nearby that we could go by, she mentioned that that bakery wasn't the only one in town, I said ""sure, but I'd rather not bike with a cake"". And she blew up about how it was annoying for me to ask them that because they had already made plans about it. Well, fuck, okay. That's fucking fine, no need to blow up in my face about that shit. Just say you've already made fucking plans and leave it at that. I can buy my own fucking cake.

A firm in the building have been asking her 3-4 times (maybe more) about when I would be done with something I'm working on so she also mentioned how it was annoying that she was again asked when I would be done with something. Basically, she sat near the info screen where the work would be shown, and I guess it's just easy to ask her how the work is going since he assumes we speak together since we're both interns. Little does he know I fucking despise her. I honestly don't know why that firm continued to ask her instead of mailing me, or her just saying ""please, just mail him"". To be fair, it did take longer for me to finish the work, but that was only because my boss asked me to make sure all the text had been cleared. Even then I don't think she was justified in giving me shit about it.

Jesus, just writing this and reading what she said yesterday just boils my piss. I'm sad because I really like this place, and haven't been able to really thrive here as well as I could without that negative person here.  I've kind of had to have a mask on during the internship, and I hated it. But I'm also happy that I won't have her in my life anymore. Hopefully. I'm still in classes with her until we graduate. But I won't have to work with her anymore.

FYI, we've known each other for about two years now. Just saw that I should mention it.

Should I have done something earlier? Maybe this is just a case of conflicting personalities?

I'm honestly gonna avoid her like the plague even if it costs me a job. And if I get work somewhere I'll work like hell to prevent her from getting employed there. Not sure if I need to elaborate on some stuff. Hard to know what to mention to give the proper perspective.

tl;dr; tried dealing with a situation on my own, mixed results, here for some advice for future situations like this."

4btkco,0,2016-03-24,"One of my roommates has started selling narcotics, blatantly disrespecting myself and other roommates. How can we evict her without being associated with drugs?",Dowser_Dan,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/4btkco/one_of_my_roommates_has_started_selling_narcotics/,"Hi,  I currently live in **Boston Massachusetts**.  I found an apartment with a small group of other people, I'm a student so finding relatively nice apartment at a decent price seemed like a great setup.  Except one of the three other people I live with was a major pot user (or at least I thought that was all at the time) and studies some BS major so she has lots of ""free"" time.

The first semester was fine, I just asked her to smoke in her room but this eventually  lead to her and her sketchy friends smoking in the common area (which was really ok), I did technically purchase weed from her once but other than her account there's no record of that happening.

Lately she's started having friends over until 2:30am almost every week-day, although my other roommates and myself have confronted her about this as professionally as possible (asking nicely, and coming up to ask them to quiet down late at night).  She's also started making ""rules"" about the apt like who can use what shelves, when people can be over (ironically making a rule about no ""loud noise"" or ""guests"" after 1am, a rule she regularly breaks), and sending a barrage of texts whenever she finds something ""wrong"" in the apt.  For reference here she has an ""internship"" where she ""works"" 20 hours a week at an improv club.  This just means she has even more ""free time"" to find things to complain about.  My other roommates and myself are in classes and generally don't have time to worry about petty things she finds to complain about (which she labels as us being ""inconsiderate"").

What's most worrying is that she not only has a mild coke addiction (using more than once a week for the past 5 months), at times going on ""party binges"" of 6-days or more at times using up money she pays rent with.  She's also started **selling both marijuana and cocaine** from the apartment.  I was sort of ok with the weed, but since she has her ""clients"" come to the apartment to pick up, I'm starting to get really uneasy.  Also, her rants are becoming more and more abusive and accusatory.  She was gone for SXSW last week (where she was ironically arrested for public intoxication, such a surprise right?), and the apartment was as peaceful and clean as its ever been.

Initially I just wanted to ride it out, and move into a new apt in September, but now I'm really considering having her evicted.  Since our lease specifically outlines the possession of narcotics is means for eviction.  Myself and my other roommates just don't want to be charged for knowing she was selling marijuana, or implicated for purchasing marijuana from her.

I'd also like to avoid any of this going to court.  She's going to university on a full scholarship and is tight on money so I doubt she'll be able to afford a court case, but I'd also like to avoid tainting my currently clean record.

**TLDR; One of my roommates is starting to be abusive and is selling both marijuana and cocaine from my apartment.  Myself and other roommates did purchase marijuana from her but don't have any in our property in the apt.  We want to evict her (due to a term in the lease that sights possession of narcotics as means for eviction for a Tennant) but we don't want to end up getting charged for knowing she was selling weed.  We also don't trust a single thing she says (she's been caught dealing marijuana multiple times before as well)**

Any advice on how to go forward with this?  Sorry for the rant, just a bad situation and didn't know where to ask for help."
4btkod,5,2016-03-24,"Graduating in two years, no internship this summer (none so far), no-name Canadian school, having a crisis.",t_away80,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4btkod/graduating_in_two_years_no_internship_this_summer/,"Hi everyone. Long time lurker feeling lost.

My goal upon graduation is to get a great computer science job (either Big Tech [Google, FB, Amazon, MS, etc.] or unicorns[Uber, Palantir, Dropbox etc etc]), preferably in the US but don't mind if it's in Canada in one of the reputable companies (Amazon Mississauga, IBM Markham etc.). I'm willing to relocate anywhere on the continent really.

I want to know whether this is a realistic goal given my scenario, and whether anyone else has achieved it from my position, but more importantly, what I need to do in order to get there.

My scenario: 

I am approaching the end of my 3rd year of 5. This means that apart from this upcoming summer, I have one more summer to get an internship.

So far I don't have any computer science job experience whatsoever (no internships). No internship for this summer either, had some interviews but failed (see below). Applied to GSoC but that's a 50-50. My school is a no-name Canadian school (global ranking 200+, not a target CS school at all), and my GPA is ~3.5. I don't have significant personal projects but I am working on expanding one and have an idea for another major one. I'm going to be working on them in the summer. I am not particularly well-prepared for technical interviews but I will be going through Skiena, CTCI, PIE etc in the summer. Lastly, I am not so great with interviews in general, not very well-spoken, get sweaty, stuttery and nervous which leads to not being able to answer questions to the best of my abilities. This is also something I will be working on, thinking of joining Toastmasters or something.

I realize that I have somewhat of a plan but I want to know if people have been in my shoes and have any other tips. Is my dream unrealistic?

TL;DR: No internships so far, school name is belch-worthy, shitty interview skills, want a Great Job when I graduate in two years, what do?"
4btp92,1,2016-03-24,Signing forms before formal interview?,DarthNihilus1,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4btp92/signing_forms_before_formal_interview/,"I applied to an IT Security internship for the summer. I've been contacted and conducted a brief phone interview (describe current work experience, favorite classes, knowledge of certain languages/systems) and am set up to do a phone interview (would have been in person if it were not for distance) and the recruiting contact has asked me to sign several legal forms BEFORE this interview is conducted.

I apologize if this is normal but I am curious.


She said she'd accept them within the week after the more official phone interview, but I don't feel comfortable signing official things that may not be needed or appropriate before any interview. 

Does this mean the interview is a formality at this point? I need to be weighing my near future options and this, albeit the first tangible opportunity for the summer, was not described exactly the same across the places I've seen this listing and I can shoot for higher if I stick to applying to more places.


In any case, I'm just curious."

4bv0q8,9,2016-03-24,"Seek employment elsewhere, stay where I am for now or leave when the time comes?",EverSilent,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4bv0q8/seek_employment_elsewhere_stay_where_i_am_for_now/,"Hi, sorry for the vague title, but I couldn't really think of something that's descriptive enough for my situation. 

Essentially, I'm currently on work experience. I'm working as an intern, and I'm in my 3rd year of my degree. The intern work is 9-5, and is also counted as a part of the degree (standard bsc in computing). Naturally, working 9-5 I get paid... but very, very little. 

Now, normally since I'm in an intern position that would probably be pretty standard, however the company I am working at is basically throwing full time work at me. I had to learn a myriad of new technologies *fast* when I started working, and I've been working on small-medium size features that customers see. As well as that, I spent 2 weeks refactoring the entire codebase to newer standards by request of the only other developer on my part of the project. So, essentially, I'm an intern working pretty stressful, full time work where I am a big or relatively big cog in the system.

Now... as you can imagine, a company that pays people intern wages and asks what you would expect from a graduate with a few years experience is... really not the most ideal place to work. In fact, it is the polar opposite. I'll spare some details here, however trust me when I say the boss is a very difficult person to please. I'll spare some details there.

The other issue, as well as it being a pretty terrible place to work, it is also going to be of little value to me learning wise. Reason being the only other programmer on the project is quitting in a months time. So... there goes a very large chunk of what I can learn from working here (which is largely the point, this is part of my degree).

Now, my contract expires in just over a month, however I know for a fact I'm going to offered a tiny raise to stay during the summer months. That being said, I dunno if I should. Money is money, I don't know if I can get a job elsewhere. Certainly I'd love to, but is there really anywhere that'd accept me for the summer? I'd even happily settle for part time work post summer in another company for what hours I can manage per week but I know a fairy tale when I see it.

I should mention that if I leave at the start of the summer, there is no one left to train the new intern (Yes, new intern...) on how to maintain the project. Now, mind you, I seen some of the guy's work. He is a good bit behind me, and I personally am only just about capable of doing the job maintaining it for the summer. I could certainly teach him, but if I'm not there to, there is no one who can teach him. What I am trying to say is I think I have a lot of leverage. How should I use it if I am going to stay?

tl;dr -- -- I have a crappy job as an intern. I am going to be asked to stay for the summer, do I try to use the leverage that I have to get better pay or should I start finding other offers now?"
4bv450,22,2016-03-24,"Freelance web programmers, if you were in my position, would you focus on growing your web development (Python) skills or enterprise/Java programming skills?",noreallyimimpressed,freelance,https://www.reddit.com/r/freelance/comments/4bv450/freelance_web_programmers_if_you_were_in_my/,"I'm a community college computer science student. I've recently completed two introductory programming classes, one Python, the other Java. Next quarter I'll start a Data Structures &amp; Algorithms (Java) class.  

&amp;nbsp;

I want to start interning or freelancing in my field as soon as possible. I'm not sure which skill set to focus on to make that a reality. I'm considering two main options:  

&amp;nbsp;

Option One:  
Focus on preparing for and finding a Java internship. I live in the suburbs of large city with a huge tech industry and a lot of Java jobs. Focusing on Java projects would complement the Java class I'm taking.  Java is frustrating and verbose compared to Python, but I don't hate it. The more experience I get with object oriented java, the more I like it. I enjoy how powerful OOP feels.  

&amp;nbsp;

Option Two:   
Focus on Python web development. I enjoy Python, and time moves faster when I'm writing Python code. I like the idea of working independently as a freelancer. I'm interested in marketing, copywriting and business.  

&amp;nbsp;

I would need to review Python, especially OOP Python, as well as try to learn Django, Javascript, Git/version control, databases/SQL, all from scratch, for the first time. I would also need to learn HTML5/CSS3 nearly from scratch - I took an HTML/CSS class in the past, but that was several years ago. I'm considering Springboard.com's *Web Development using Python &amp; Django* ""learning path"" - a plan/guide to other online learning sources. ""Specifically, it covers the basics of Web internals, HTML, CSS, Javascript Python, Django, MySQL, Chrome Developer Tools and Git for version control. At the end of this course, you should be able to build a web application from scratch.""  

&amp;nbsp;

I have more fun with Python than with Java, but I'm intimidated by how much there is to learn with web development, and how long it might take to develop my skills to the point of being able to freelance. I'm also concerned about the responsibility and legal liability that comes with freelancing and being responsible for an entire project.  

&amp;nbsp;  

If you were in my position, which track would you pursue?

I was previously in school for chemistry (I got an associate's degree in chem lab tech), but decided to switch to CS instead of continuing down that path.

I've only been programming for a year and a half and I feel like I've learned a great deal in that amount of time. I've had phone interviews with Google and both phone and on-site interviews with Bloomberg for internships. I didn't get any of the positions, but I still think that even acquiring that on-site interview was an achievement, considering the short amount of time I've been programming for. 

I've recently come to sort of a plateau in my learning. I feel like I have a firm grasp on a lot of programming fundamentals, but I don't know how or in what direction to expand my skills.

I'm constantly trying to learn new things, but I often get discouraged after a week or two and move on to something else. There is so much to know in this field that I feel it is impossible for me to get a firm grasp on anything beyond the fundamentals that never change.

I want to be good at programming. I want projects under my belt. I want a fully fleshed out GitHub account that people can look at and be impressed by. But I currently feel like a level 19 Magikarp. So close to actually being useful, but all I can do currently is splash around.

I just wish I had some direction so that I could know where to spend my energy. I imagine many of you have felt the same way. What did you do to get yourself to that next level?"

I am a white male of 28 years who still lives with his parents. I am unemployed but currently attempting to rectify that by taking further schooling with an internship built into the curriculum. I am an avid gamer who plays many types of games across several genres, nearly without exception. I also have a strong interest in programming and computers in general, which goes well with my already existing bachelor's degree in computer science. My musical preferences fall within the genres of jazz and classical; but I greatly enjoy listening to the music of video games I enjoy regardless of actual genre. I tend to be of the quiet sort, keeping mostly to myself, especially in group settings; however, I can become very talkative in a private setting with one other person concerning topics that interest me. I have found myself to be my most awake during the nightly hours, where my largely sedentary lifestyle has found me to a sleeping schedule where I go to bed around 8 AM and wake about 3 PM (EST). My days tend to be fairly similar from day to day, but I occasionally add and remove tasks as I find my immediate desires shift and my time awake becoming too crowded. My current large, non-permanent task is self-teaching Japanese, which is coming along with varying degrees of success. 

**Who I Am Seeking**

*Virgin* - As a virgin myself and a strong believer of having but a single mate, this falls high on my criteria for numerous reasons.

*Similar Interests* - I feel that a strong relationship is formed on a strong overlapping of interests in which both parties are passionate about.

*Physically Natural* - This set may seem strange to many, and likely where I lose many potential candidates, but physical attraction is important, to a point. Tattoos, piercings, use of cosmetic products such as ""make up"", hair dying, implants; these are all physical turn offs for me. On the inverse, I enjoy seeing females just as they are with intact body hair, not putting themselves in pain with silly footwear like ""high heels"" and not afraid to wear plain comfortable clothes.

*Willing to Start With Friendship* - I'm aware this is a dating oriented group, but I feel that no fulfilling romantic relationship can exist without a platonic foundation. Taking things slow and getting to know one another is more important than anything else. Plus, even if things never progress past a certain point, it would still be nice to make a friend.

People around my age, with a max of a four year discrepancy is ideal, but I'm not entirely opposed to a larger age gap.

No users of drugs or alcohol, please."
4bw1ky,14,2016-03-25,[Intro/vent] Hello GFD,Puffss,GFD,https://www.reddit.com/r/GFD/comments/4bw1ky/introvent_hello_gfd/,"Hi everyone! I'm from the Netherlands and have been a gamer my entire life. I've become depressed as a child because of a lot of shit went down in my family, but always had to hide it becuase ""it's not going to help, you'll only make things worse!"". I have anxiety and will have a full blown panic attack when doing things that scare the shit of me or make me really nervous, like flying.

Because of that I barely play action games anymore, because i fear that something that will bring the tension up too much will kick me right into a panic attack. I still play games though, I really enjoy the Harvest Moon series and JRPGS, even though i haven't played much JRPGs lately because of allready mentioned reason.

As for my depression, i'm actually very high functioning. I'm one of the best of my school because i'm in a course I really had a passion about (more about this later) and loved working. It made me feel happy and like I actually had skills I can use. I loved school, I loved my job I really did. I even met my current boyfriend here and he is the best that ever happened to me, he supports me and tries to make me laugh when he can.

but then, then the internships started. I had a really hard time finding an internship and that made me feel even worse (someone enrolled in excelence classes not being able to find an internship) and after 6 tries (everyone got theirs in 1 or 2 tries) I finally found a place that well... sucks.

the people here feel like I can't do anything, like i don't have any skills and i regularly get laughed at by a fellow intern for not knowing old HTML &amp; CSS techniques nobody uses anymore because they're so goddarn old and about the work i made. I got laughed at for my best work yesterday and that completely toke away the last piece of passion and happiness i had. 

to be honest I don't want to keep living anymore. I lost the passion that defied me and now i feel like i'm just an empty shell going to this internship every day just to get laughed at and procrastinate everything i need to do because i'm also not motivated at all anymore.

I'm still enrolled in the excelence class and i talked about what they taught of me and they really want to keep me. but i feel like i can't do anything and someone else deserves this place so much more.

I want to die, but i also don't want to leave my boyfriend behind with the feeling it's all his fault and that he could have helped me if he just tried longer and got me to accept his help. I've messaged my school to get me out of this fucking place, but by some goddarn coincidence the mail is completely down and I can't contact anyone, i'm handeling this all by myself now"

So my question right now is, since im highly interested in media, specifically in games design, where to go, or where to start.

I could go and start a 3yrs - IT Education.

I also could go study.

Or i could learn to draw because else i will never be a designer.

My problem is that i don't want to talk with people all day like a office businessman or something like that..

4bwbbr,8,2016-03-25,Transfer Pricing career advice: Where can I go in finance?,zhilex,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/4bwbbr/transfer_pricing_career_advice_where_can_i_go_in/,"Hi /r/accounting

Need a career advice, feeling bit lost and clueless.

I graduated last year in June and since then I have worked for Barclays (not for the IBD; commercial bank division as a data analyst), and now for one one of the biggest luxury company in the world who truly are a pioneer in digital innovation, and are admired by the financial institutions.
	
I am currently working as a ""Transfer Pricing Associate"" in the finance team for the last three months, and I quite enjoy working here because of the 'silicon valley' workplace feel to it. I am also the youngest (21 years old) in the whole finance floor (out of 175 employees who represent finance division), and not to mention it is also satisfying working with finance veterans such as people who are ex-Enron, GE, KPMG partner, Blackrock, etc. I have received several great advices, tips and some of them even asked me whether I needed any help getting in big 4 later in the future (not sure whether they were bluffing or serious). My long-term goal is to set up my own gig, but for the time-being I want to advance towards the proper world of finance.

I'm afraid my university matters in the world of work and I did not exactly graduate from top university, and I did not put more focus on education/grades as much as I do now. As as result, I am worried this will affect my chances of getting into good firm, because companies nowadays tend to look at your academic performance before university. I am aware its not possible to get in IB without stellar academic background since middle school, and my recent interview with BAML for an analyst position solidifies this because out of remaining three candidates, they decided to hire more 'experienced' candidate. Quite frankly, I am glad I got the chance to be interviewed by directors, and the feedback I received was highly positive.

However, I have come to realisation that accounting is not for me. I don't want to work in audit, tax or TP. I joined my current workplace because I believed 'compliance' and 'Transfer Pricing' is an industry waiting to blow up and I'll enjoy the work. Turns out, I was wrong. Although Transfer Pricing is an interesting concept, I find tax work extremely boring. Its unfortunate that I love working in this company so much, I planned on staying for at least good 3 years. However, I am on fixed term contract with possibility of an extension next year in June. Hence, I need to know what direction I should head to!

I've assisted Investor Relations director with investor meeting for note taking and usual Q&amp;A with the investors, and I must say sometime its the highlight of my day. I relish conversing with people and enjoy meeting new people, my current work deprives me of social interaction because of constant document preparation. After carefully gauging, I feel with the right training and avenue I can easily be on the other side of the call. I dont see myself succeeding in tax/audit, and need some serious advice from established professionals as to where I can go next to capitalise on my aptitude and qualifications.

In summary, my specifications/achievements are as follows:

* Treasurer of university finance/investment society

* Chosen by university to become an ambassador for a scholarship programme which was a collaboration with Imperial university, and led a group of 8 students for six months. Also traveled abroad for one month to fully implement this project - I strongly believe the reason I got to interview stage with BAML is because of this experience. Thoughts?

* Semester abroad at New York University (NYU)

* Awarded 'Elite Scholar' for academic excellence by the chancellor of the university

* Obtained 1st class or 78% or 4.0 GPA in international business combined honours in economics

* Internship with software company for an 'analyst position'

* Temporary project work with Barclays as a 'data analyst'

* Transfer Pricing Associate for a leading luxury brand in the world - Top 5

* Studying for CFA level 1, and taking exam in December 2016

Additional unrelated note: I was headhunted for a hedgefund (midsize with 140 employees on LinkedIn) - middle office role, and for an asset management by Robert Half recruitment agency. I declined to both to both of them because at the time I figured I had lot to learn about finance and did not feel comfortable working in HF, given that I have not explored core mathematics nor was I an excel guru.

With all the information regarding my situation, if you had to direct me into the world of finance, what type of role/company do you think suits me best?

Sorry for the wall of text.

4bwhxr,0,2016-03-25,Questions about ECs,kam1012,premed,https://www.reddit.com/r/premed/comments/4bwhxr/questions_about_ecs/,"Hey everyone!

I have 3 questions about EC's, particularly clinical/non-clinical volunteering and research.

1) For my major, I had to complete a 100 hour ""internship"" class (3 credits) in a physical therapy clinic (I'm a kinesiology major); I pretty much did everything an aide would do, including helping people with exercises and answering patient's questions. Would this qualify as clinical volunteering at all?

2) I currently volunteer at a local hospital in the pharmacy. Until recently I was doing transport and discharges, but that became  overstaffed and I asked to be moved to somewhere that needed more help. In the pharmacy I fill prescriptions and go onto the floors and deliver them to nurses, so it's not a ton of patient contact, but I am frequently on the floors and can observe doctors while I'm delivering and picking up things. I'm just stuck on if this would be clinical or non-clinical as it's not really entirely one or the other to me.

3) Next semester I will (hopefully) be doing a DIY post-bacc (really just taking Ochem and re-taking Calc I to bring up my previous C) and I applied for a research position that counts as class credit. My question is, can I still quantify that under research experience or should I try to find something else?

I currently work in private practice as a scribe, so I do have a decent amount of clinical experience (if that matters).

Thank you for all of your help!"
4bwk78,16,2016-03-25,Feminism thought experiment.,0xdada,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/4bwk78/feminism_thought_experiment/,"Let's take some basic tenets of 3rd wave feminism and say we were to accept them at face value. 

- women have been oppressed for thousands of years. 
- women and men are equal in every way. 
- men have a moral responsibility to promote the interests of women to compensate for their systemic disadvantage. 
- in spite of political progress in the last 100 years, women are still not occupying %50 of the management and executive positions in the workforce.
- that political appointments do not reflect at least %50 women shows a systematic bias against women, which men and women in power have a moral obligation to correct.  
- when men create male-only environments, it excludes and necessarily oppresses women, gays, and basically everyone else. 
- male only environments create and encourage ""toxic"" male behaviors, and this can be remedied by the presence of women. 
- heterosexual white men have historically, and continually conspire to exclude women, and pretty much everyone else, from their networks of capitalist power. 
- the presence of women in these networks would disrupt capitalist oppression. 
- laws and regulations that require the presence of women, or really anyone who isn't a hetero white male, in any and all political and commercial endeavors, is necessary for a just society. 
- people, but mainly men, who use sexist, homophobic, transphobic, or any other language that expresses contempt for cocksuckers of any kind, must be de-legitimized and expelled from their job or role in society through public criticism. 
- racism is a disease of the white mind, and resistance to the lawful diversification of white spaces and power networks is violence, it is the right of the oppressed to respond to this violence with violence.  

If this were about any other group, like if you were to replace ""women"" and their comrades with an ethnic group or the working class, these tenets are no different from any other authoritarian revolutionary group. Instead of building their own businesses, networks, or nations, they want to insert their own loyalists into the existing system and police it. 

It is no different from the Chinese communist party requiring that all businesses include a party member as a political representative who ensures compliance with party doctrine. This guarantees jobs for people who are by most objective criteria, retarded, which makes them extremely loyal to the cause, and ready to denounce their co-workers for the smallest transgression, in exchange for promotion within both the party and the business. 

When any company these days gets past a certain size, you see the appearance of some fat dykey woman, or a weaselly gay guy, usually associated with HR, but sometimes with ties to marketing, who is basically crap at what they do, but they are there under the aegis of promoting ""diversity."" One who identifies as ""trans-"" is the exact tactic used in the early 20th century in the various putsches where crippled, mentally ill and other socially marginalized people were given extraordinary powers as political ""surveyors,"" and local party officials. Their jobs and resulting social status positions were contingent upon their ideological purity, and had no real performance criteria. This had the useful effect of making them dangerous zealots who always needed someone less ideologically pure to denounce to ensure their position. The party needed relatively few of these people (less than %10) to keep the rest of the population docile and fearful for their jobs. 

What they are really there for is as appointees from an unofficial revolutionary party who are there both to police the organization to ensure employees don't develop a camaraderie that would create a power network that might exclude party members. They also act as an informal (and sometimes formal) channel to academia, which enables politically supportive students and professors to get internships and jobs. 

This is not  just in China. Companies in the middle east have long had to accept giving jobs to political appointees. It is impossible to do business in many of those countries without hiring members of the royal family or the children of bureaucrats and politicians. 

You could say that this is just the way power works in the world, and I would say you are right. ""Diversity"" has nothing to do with women, oppression, racism or whatever other pretext these people use. It is part of the standard playbook for an emerging ""deep state"" in a country to acquire and consolidate its hold on power, and reduce the number of people it needs to manage to stay in control. 

Companies like the academic connection because it qualifies them for ""research"" tax credits, and it reduces their exposure to random public attacks from party members. Let's just say that no company with a black, green haired dyke heading up the diversity committee will ever have to worry about political activists undermining or creating uncertainty in shareholder meetings. 

Given the largely hollow and tenuous valuations of tech companies, and the catastrophic brand damage an outrage scandal can cause, valley companies are accepting these SJW police to reduce their exposure to political risk. Public companies whose CEO's are compensated based on share price are particularly vulnerable to political scandal, and many of them have accepted these diversity police into their organizations. 

**Lesson Learned:** 

- Diversity and Feminism are pretexts for an ongoing political coup. 

- Academia is the protected staging area for authoritarian regimes. 

- History is full of examples of how coalitions of cocksuckers want to regulate access to alpha dick. 

- Do not underestimate what SJWs will do to keep their politically defined jobs, they are dangerous.

Syracuse has offered me 15k per year and acceptance into their computer science program. I haven't visited Syracuse but I do know the campus is beautiful (yet very cold lol)

UCSC has accepted me but no scholarship money of course (out of state).

I have heard that UCSC CS is impacted and it can be hard to get into the classes you need. How true is this? Is this also true for Syracuse?

Which would be the smarter option? Which degree would be more valuable to technology companies? UCSC is very cool because it's so close to silicon valley which I've heard getting jobs and internships easier. "

4bx097,3,2016-03-25,Learning ESXI and creating a simple home lab,zimmertr,homelab,https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/comments/4bx097/learning_esxi_and_creating_a_simple_home_lab/,"Hello everyone, I'm almost finished with my college degree and I recently landed my first real job as an ""Operations Engineer"" at a software development company. As an intern there, I'm using ESXI a lot to manage virtual machines for the devs so I would like to set up a homelab at my home to help myself learn. I have quite a bit of home server experience (Apache, deluge, SSH, Plex, etc) so I'm just looking for some input here. 

I only own one computer that I can leave on as a server, though. So this might be kind of tricky. Here are the specs:

* i5-750

* 12gb DDR3 1333

* 2 available rj45 ports

* Arch Linux

Currently, I've installed VMware Workstation and ESXi on a 100gb partition. I've allocated 6gb of my memory to this machine as well. From here, I'm wondering what the best course of action is. Ideally, I would like to have 4 VMs living within this machine that handle all of the networking for my intranet:

* DHCP server (centos)

* DNS cache/adblocker (debian/pihole)

* PFSense

* Active Directory (WS2012)

1) Do you guys think that my computer will be beefy enough to handle running all three of these VMs 24/7 without slowing it down too much? It's the main computer I use for pretty much everything so it can't be too bogged down by virtualization. 

2) Is there anything else you recommend that I do to help myself learn? 

3) Any other helpful servers I should set up for my home lab?

4) How exactly do I manage the physical aspect of this lab? Do I run two additional patch cables from my available RJ45 jacks to my router and assign them static IPs from my router? And then tell Arch Linux, cell phones, my laptop, etc to use those IPs as the DNS server and such?"

-----------------------------

Dear Students,

The California Faculty Association (CFA), the union to which many of our faculty members belong, has announced plans for a potential strike on all 23 California State University (CSU) campuses April 13-15 and April 18-19, 2016. Representatives from the CSU and CFA have not been able to reach a salary agreement through collective bargaining. We recognize the right of our faculty to participate in a strike, and it is the choice of each faculty member whether or not to participate.

While we all hope for a positive outcome, our campus nevertheless must prepare for the possibility of a labor action. We will communicate regularly as the CFA’s strike deadline approaches. Here is an update on several issues that some of you have asked about:

CLASSES: Check with your individual faculty members regarding their plans. If they indicate that they do plan to participate in the strike, they should be able to explain how strike activities may impact your courses, including modifications to course syllabi, deferred or alternative assignments, and possible make-up work. If you are unable to get clear guidance, feel free to request information from the dean’s office for the college in which the course is offered.

As an intern there, I'm using ESXI a lot to manage virtual machines for the devs so I would like to set up a homelab at my home to help myself learn. I have quite a bit of home server experience (Apache, deluge, SSH, Plex, etc) so I'm just looking for some input here. 

I only own one computer that I can leave on as a server, though. So this might be kind of tricky. Here are the specs:

* i5-750

* 12gb DDR3 1333

* 2 available rj45 ports

* Arch Linux

Currently, I've installed VMware Workstation and ESXi on a 100gb partition. I've allocated 6gb of my memory to this machine as well. From here, I'm wondering what the best course of action is. Ideally, I would like to have 4 VMs living within this machine that handle all of the networking for my intranet:

* DHCP server (centos)

* DNS cache/adblocker (debian/pihole)

* PFSense

* Active Directory (WS2012)

1) Do you guys think that my computer will be beefy enough to handle running all three of these VMs 24/7 without slowing it down too much? It's the main computer I use for pretty much everything so it can't be too bogged down by virtualization. 

2) Is there anything else you recommend that I do to help myself learn? 

3) Any other helpful servers I should set up for my home lab?

4) How exactly do I manage the physical aspect of this lab? Do I run two additional patch cables from my available RJ45 jacks to my router and assign them static IPs from my router? And then tell Arch Linux, cell phones, my laptop, etc to use those IPs as the DNS server and such?"

I'm planning on heading out there in mid-April to find work and I'll be staying with my brother until I land a house/apartment. I'm shooting for a May 1st move in, and though I'd love to find a place to live for the coming year, I'm also open to a shorter stint while I get myself situated in the city. I have money saved so covering monthly rent and a security deposit is not an issue.

Here's a bit about me: I'm a 26-year-old guy, I grew up in Michigan's Upper Peninsula, and I graduated from the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor in April 2012. I studied creative writing and political science, lived in Spain for a semester, and worked a couple environmental-focused internships after graduating, first out in D.C. and then in Detroit. Between August 2013 and August 2014 I did an AmeriCorps VISTA year of service in Denver with an education advocacy organization. Following my AmeriCorps year, I moved back to my hometown to work odd jobs and spend time with family while my father recovered from a small stroke. Now that he's doing well, I am incredibly eager to get back to a city.

I love music (I'm a fan of all sorts, but my favorites generally include awesome guitar work), really like sports, especially basketball, and enjoy a good hike. I also like to write in my free time, primarily short stories and songs, so living with other creative-types would be a plus. I'm a clean guy who always keeps common areas tidy, I'm very laid-back, and I value clear communication. Be warned though, my sense of humor can be quite dry.

Neighborhoods I'm interested in include Williamsburg, Greenpoint, Astoria, Sunnyside, East Village, and Harlem.  I'm most familiar with Brooklyn because my brother lived there for seven years or so, but I'm open to anything so long as it seems like a good fit.

If you have a room available and think we might get along, please don't hesitate to get in touch.

Thanks a lot!"

So far I've had 3 jobs:

* Internship (1 year)
* ??? [Intern or Developer?] (7 months)
* Full time developer (8 months)

In my second position, my official title was 'web assistant', but my job duties were exactly what a web developer does. I worked in this position while I was in school and a little bit after I graduated.
 
I don't want to put 'web assistant' on my resume since hiring mangers won't know what that is. I want to put 'web developer' as the title, however, that will make it look like I left two full-time jobs after less than a year working at those places.

If I put 'web developer intern', leaving under a year is more acceptable, but 'intern' experience is less desirable than a full-time developer experience.

Which title should I put down?"

Unfortunately, I have not started taking any IT courses but I have done some programming courses in Java, Python, and C since I had to complete pre-reqs for the major. My only qualification in IT is a Testout PC Pro certificate I got in 2014. 

First of all, I would like to ask if you have any advice for someone in my position? How did you choose your field? e.g. networks, systems, management, etc. Right now I am thinking I want to go into a network position but I don't have much experience in any field to make an informed decision.

Second, is there anything I should be doing on top of my college's coursework? Online resources to learn, languages to study, certifications to be working towards?

Lastly, I am looking into internships this summer wasn't sure what is my best option. Many positions, outside of help-desk, are asking for knowledge in topics I don't know. Should I apply for them anyways? Do internships really require that kind of experience?

I see on this subreddit alot that you guys say go look for nearby companies and see if they have any internship positions. Does that involve doing things like giving them a call, and ask if they are looking for interns? I don't know if my skill set is competitive enough for a big 4 internship. I only know C++, and I taken a data structure class. I currently attend a community college.


 So most of these internships are asking for a person to pursue bachelor's CS degree. There is no CS degree in community college here. Does that count because I am hoping to transfer to a school that will offer a bachelor in cs."
4by3ty,0,2016-03-25,Fear of the interviews,xtruthispainfulx,cpp,https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/4by3ty/fear_of_the_interviews/,"I consider myself quite a proficient programmer and software engineer. I have several opensource contributions (so everyone can take a peek at their quality), a letter of recommendation from a good company and I love to code.

Despite that, I'm quite depressed by the fact that the last three coding interviews with big companies failed. I probably didn't suck, but I was still rejected. I constantly feel like I'm getting **timed** in a coding interview.. and speaking aloud my thoughts isn't helping. I've never been a *fast-thinker*, i.e. someone who immediately sees the right solution.. and even if I get the right solution immediately my brain refuses to memorize by heart algorithms or even function syntaxes (but getting STL routines wrong is the least of all evils.. algorithms are the real pain in the back). I always have to **work my way to the solution**, e.g. if you asked me right away how to delete a node from a binary tree, I would immediately recall that there are multiple cases that need to be handled.. then my brain starts to visualize the first simple case.. then I realize that having two children is the most complex case and needs to be handled differently... then I start recalling or deducting which node should be substituted with the one I want to delete.. etc..

This shit **takes time**. And during those interviews I've always felt **timed**. I've never been able to jump into code right away, or, even with pseudocode, to write code correctly at first pass. I need to refine my thoughts so I often write crappy code or nonsense lines while I later realize that either I don't need them at all or they're completely off.

This is NOT working for a big company interview because they're searching for ""ninjas"" who can write correct code immediately. Little they care for a single interview if the guy learned the code by heart or if they'll write crappy code in the real job.. on-site interview impression is what counts. And you gotta be fast there. I'm not. I'm a good coder and I've also created applications that others are still using, nobody ever said that I'm stupid or slow. But I'm not fast enough for the big companies coding interviews.

I would totally love an internship-thingy, i.e. a 2-months or similar time-frame period assignment or project.. in my opinion I would shine like no one else in that case. But internships are over for me, I'm no longer a university guy (I got my MSc, end of the story.. no more internships for me). So I'm stick with the stupid coding-challenge questions. Which I can't solve better than many others.

I'm accepting suggestions and/or improvements tips.. but I don't think I'll be able to ""gain speed"" in coding. It's the way I am. I'm creative, smart and hard-worker.. but I'm not the guy who can code you a `deleteNode()` C++ function on a whiteboard at first try. And I'm starting to think that I might simply be not fit enough to be a software engineer."

4by6et,3,2016-03-25,3 Career Lessons From Andy Cohen,realtomward,BravoWWHL,https://www.reddit.com/r/BravoWWHL/comments/4by6et/3_career_lessons_from_andy_cohen/,"If you've ever watched a reality show on Bravo, chances are you've seen Andy Cohen.  He's the host of Watch What Happens: Live, the executive producer of The Real Housewives franchise, author of a memoir, Most Talkative: Stories from the Front Lines of Pop Culture and the producer of his own Sirius radio channel, Radio Andy.
 
*So how did he get to the top and what can we learn from him?*

**Pick An Industry And Stick With It:** In his most recent memoir, Most Talkative: Stories from the Front Lines of Pop Culture, Cohen talks about how he achieved his dream of working in front of the camera.  A lifelong TV addict, Cohen went to work for CBS straight out of college, first as an intern, then as a news clerk.  He took a job in his ""dream industry"" and never left.  After working for CBS he worked as an executive at Bravo for ten years where he was responsible for hits such as Project Runway, Top Chef, Shahs of Sunset, among a slew of others.

One of the biggest career mistakes people make is jumping from industry to industry.  Figure out what industry you want to be in and stick with it, even if you have to start at the bottom.

**Build A Consistent Brand:** Look at everything that Andy does.  From his best selling books to his TV shows and social media, everything is consistent:  Everything is celebrity based.  Andy doesn't veer from his brand identity and neither should you.
 
Look at the jobs you've had, it'll tell a narrative.  You might be an expert in pop culture but if you've been a successful accountant for the last 20 years, your brand is that of a trusted accountant. It's never too late to reinvent yourself, but you're going to have to get evidence (published articles, interviews, testimonials, etc.) that proves that you're an expert in your new field for people to take you seriously.
 
**Believe In Yourself:** When Andy started appearing on camera, there had never been an openly gay late night TV personality.   When he was an intern at CBS, a producer told him that his lazy eye would prevent him for any on-air position.  But Andy’s dream was always to be as famous as the people that he interviewed on TV.  It took him almost 20 years to get in front of the camera and become “famous” but he finally did it. Andy believed in himself and trudged the long road to television success.  

If you have a talent in an industry that you're passionate about, keep swinging and believe in yourself. When Erin Moriarty of 48 Hours, a woman that he once interned for, interviewed him, she asked Andy if he has living the life that he always dreamed of living.  Andy replied, “I am.  One hundred percent. I mean, it's great. There couldn't be a more pure iteration of who I am than what I'm doing every night live at 11 o'clock.  I am being 100 percent myself.”

*Imagine what you could accomplish if you believed in yourself enough to be authentic.*

First let me explain a little - I made sure to focus on a couple of big projects as this seems to be the norm with engineering resumes. I'm guessing hiring managers get a better sense for your abilities from 'I did such and such on this project to this and that end result' rather than 'i worked at such and such place for 2 years and was in charge of x y z.' I left off a job I had a while ago that wasn't engineering related (drove delivery truck for an industrial sheet metal fab company). One specific question I have is whether I should include this and omit one of my projects.

4bzfpc,20,2016-03-25,[Guide] How I got a great SWE internship as a freshman from an average state school,FrostCantelope,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4bzfpc/guide_how_i_got_a_great_swe_internship_as_a/,"Hi all,

I got a ton of help from this subreddit and just wanted to share my experience finding a SWE internship as a freshman. 

I did not have the money to attend an out-of-state school without going into huge debt (FAFSA is a troll) and settled for what many would say is an average state school. If it's helpful to know, I did not start coding seriously until September 2015 (I did HTML/CSS on my own though).

Regardless, I landed an internship at a ""big 4"" equivalent company as a freshman (no, this isn't EP, Explore, or a freshman program).

Here are some tips that made a huge difference for me:

1. Find a company that you are interested in on LinkedIn and email one of their tech recruiters with a brief message about yourself that shows your ""enthusiasm"" for contributing to their company and hints at wanting to have a phone call/coding test. I personally found great success with this - if I hadn't done this, I probably would've gotten no reply for many companies (as a fresh from a state school).

2. Get a job working part-time as a software engineer in your field of interest (I like webservices/APIs/full stack). This one took a lot of work and a lot of luck for me. I applied to like 500 companies and probably got like 5 replies. Now some of you may say that a full-time student doesn't have time for working part-time. I somewhat agree for difficult schools, but for someone who is at an average-difficulty state school in freshman year, I think there is definitely time each week to work if you build a schedule around it (I worked/am working 30-40 hours a week on 14-18 credits). RIP my social life somewhat. Regardless, working 30-40 hours a week with code is going to force you to get better no matter what.

3. Practice the heck out of Leetcode/HackerRank (especially string manipulation, arrays, hash tables, sorting algorithms, traversal). You should know Binary Search Trees and various algorithms (BFS/DFS/Size/etc), but I personally did not get many of the less used in real-world data structures (BSTs/LLs/Graphs). Then again, I didn't interview at Two Sigma or Jane Street.

4. Do not get discouraged from failing interviews. I like to think of interviews as interview practice (the more you fail, the better you get). I probably failed at least 30 interviews in this journey (after applying to/cold-emailing 500+ companies).

Debatable:

1. Make an eye-catching resume. This one is probably not as big, but having a nice design can make you stand out. At the very least, use the CTCI resume format so that you aren't hurting your chances by having a badly-organized resume.

Anyways, I hope this helped out some of you who may in the same boat (or a different one?). Feel free to ask questions/PM for advice."

Here are the responses from owner and creative director Bagus Satrio Wicaksono.

/u/Sleepauger “How did you get into shoe making?”

There’s a (lil’ bit) long story behind me and Sagara Indonesia, but I’ll make it short. Honestly back then I had a dream to be an automotive designer (as a product design student). But in the middle of my study, in 2006 I accompanied my friend to the center of shoemaking in Bandung, named Cibaduyut. There was the first time that i saw a traditional shoemaking process and fell in love in the first time I saw it. Actually I also has a special attention to shoes/sneakers since junior high school. Since that I focused my undergraduate studies to footwear designing, learn anything about traditional shoemaking from one to another workshop.

/u/Tangbang “What is the primary market for your guy's shoes/boots? Is there a huge demand for these kinds of shoes/boots in Indonesia, or are you aimed at foreign markets?”

Basically I’m a design student with no (professional) working experience (except as an intern as designer in several local shoemaker) and have no idea about marketing (market, segmentation, etc.), and my knowledge about market and business are growing organically as time goes 
by. So it does to Sagara’s market, it just happens organically (believe it or not). But we’re also think about a purchasing power of our customer to determine Sagara’s price point, 
especially our domestic customer.

“In the foreign markets, which is larger? Do you notice any stylistic difference between the shoes demanded for these kinds of shoes/boots in Indonesia, or are you aimed at foreign markets?”

Honestly I would love and proud if we have international retailers, we got a lot of inquiries from several 
well known dept. store in the last few years from Japan, UK, USA and more, also a collaboration offer from one of British heritage carry goods designer, but since our production costs are quite high, it’s hard for retailers to buy our product in wholesale.

“Japan/USA/Europe/Others?” Mostly our online selling for international markets dominated by US, Aussie and Singapore customers. 

“By these different markets?” Almost 50% of our MTO inquiries (Indonesian market) are 
our oxblood aniline dyed pull-up combined with full micro rubber sole, because our local customers like to ‘play safe’ with their make-up and style (contrary with our international customer). They’re also avoiding leather sole because our tropical weather that often rains. Our international customers dare to choose two-tone and ‘bright’ colorway. Honesty, I really like our international customer’s make-ups rather than our local customers because they’re dare to explore something new and unique.

“Have you noticed any changes in style trends or market demands?” All of our design referred to traditional/basic design. I can’t feel any significant style changes, but since we’re offering 
vegetable tanned leather and soft toe option, inquiries for that options are increased significantly in this past years.
“Have you guys done any contract work for any other shoemakers?” Right now I’m managing two different shoe workshops, Sagara’s workshop (that exclusively producing only 
Sagara’s shoes) and the other one is producing women’s shoes and sandals with cemented construction.

“Do you know if the other local Indonesian shoemakers do contract work for any other shoemakers?” To my knowledge, some of them yes. You can find anything in Indonesia. :)

/u/Sulucniv “Can you give us some historical background on why there seems to be so many shoemakers in the Bandung area compared to elsewhere in Indonesia?” 

Back to the 1910/20’ish, there’s a shoe factory in Cibaduyut, Bandung.  I don’t know exactly who’s the owner (Indonesian or Dutch) because we’re colonized by Netherlands until 1942. As time goes by, workers of the 
shoe factory created their own (small) industry in their home and grow bigger and bigger until now. There’s some saying from our parents that shoe store and factory along Cibaduyut road is the longest (shoes store &amp; factory) in Asia at the time.

“How large is your local presence in the market compared to the traffic and number of overseas orders you get online?” Our local market still dominating our product distribution (around 70 – 80 %).

“What is the Indonesian leather tanning industry like from a shoemaking perspective? Are there many tanneries and is it easy or difficult to get quality leathers from local sources?” 

Our country produces hundreds of millions pairs of shoes each year, and as we know that the quality of upper material in 
here was not that good. It’s kinda sad because fine quality leather not a biggest demand in here, some of our tanneries created their own standard quality based on the demand they got. But, it doesn’t make all of our tanneries cannot produce good quality material, it just kinda hard for small 
industries like us to make fine quality leather as most of factories has MOQ (that’s really difficult for us to afford) to create material in our own standard.

/u/Zanglang “How many shoemakers and other staff are in your shop?” Sagara’s workshop has 6 artisans, 2 full time staffs, and 2 part-time staffs (including me as a full-time staff and my wife as a part-time staff).

“Whilst on Reddit we're more familiar with your MTO works, would you ever consider expanding your physical presence internationally, for example in Southeast Asia?” Honestly, I prefer to sell our products directly to our customers, so we could deliver the product in pristine conditon (99% in the same conditions as the products coming out from our workshop), fresh from the oven.

But, I have a dream that I have a small Sagara store standing beside organic restaurant managed by my wife, long long way from the city, somewhere between the highlands (I know it’s far, far away from reality hahaha). If I had a choice in SEA area, Indonesia still the first priority, but if somewhere in Asia, maybe Japan will be a sweet place to hide.

“I bet you guys come across many interesting GMTO orders with all sorts of unusual designs. Do you have any favorites?” Tough question, there’s a lot of creative peoples that
created a beautiful design, but if had to pick one, this Valiant inquiries from Phillipine is my ace https://www.instagram.com/p/9JKgLIzUe1

/u/Akaghi “What are the main challenges or hurdles to being located in Indonesia?” The problem is our distances (read : expensive) to the best materials in the world. There’s also a stigma from people around the world that as we’re living in the ‘third world’, often low wages associated with low production issue always being our (country) ‘imagery’. We’re also often compared (in term of pricing) with international ‘machine-made’ brands. Most of people in here doesn’t know and doesn’t understand (esp. the value) that we’re fully handmade products, from cutting to welting. And I would like to say (in here) that we’re employing artisans, not labor like most of industries in Indonesia.

“What are the primary benefits?” Material access that not really hard to find if you know the ‘trick’, even though it’s really need a big effort to find a good-quality leathers in here. Low living cost also creates an advantages for our business, and one thing that makes us grateful is our great history of handcrafted, batik and Borobudur temple is one of many examples.

“What shoemaker do you most admire?” Another tough question, as a shoe-lover we’re definitely
know that every shoemaker has their own (unique) character that can’t be compared from one to another. As Laszlo Vass published a wonderful books and I personally enjoying Marcell Mrsan blog, both of em’ are my idol. But Corthay Satan Last are the most beautiful shape I’ve ever found, and White Kloud also makes a really dashing boots in the world. Ah, so many great shoemakers in this world.

“What is your favorite flavor of milkshake?” I would love to answer Vanilla, but most of Vanilla
Milkshakes here use essence rather than pure organic Vanilla. :( 

Icecream? Vanilla &amp; Strawberry, killer combo.

/u/Uubbbrr “It seems that recently there has been a rise in the number
Indonesian shoe making companies. What do you think caused this?”

Since 90’s DIY and support-your-local-product spirit in Bandung flourishing that makes a lot of independent clothing company (our locals calls it ‘distro) come up, from Bandung to Jakarta and the spirit growing bigger to other big cities in Indonesia. Since the quality standards 
increasing around 2010, shoes and menswear designers came up and created a new benchmark that has better qualities from their precursor.

Specifically, for shoes industries, as Cibaduyut
became a center of shoemaker in Indonesia and it’s not really hard and far away to access from our capital (Jakarta), you could easily make a shoe/footwear brand in Indonesia.

“Also, how to you come up with designs and patterns for each of your shoes and boots?” I handle design and made the pattern by myself, and most of my designs for Sagara are classic design that exist from decades ago. US Military boots is our biggest inspiration, with little different touché here and there.

/u/YourMoneyOrYourLife “What are your thoughts on American and European shoemakers? Do you take inspiration from them or do you focus more on your place among other Indonesian and Asian shoemakers?” Americana Design always be my biggest inspiration in terms of design perspective. But I also learn a lot of thing about handwelted technique (as our products soul) from European shoemaker. The last but not least is I also learn how to survive with idealism from old US &amp; Europe shoemaker (that last for decades even centuries), and I really hope that Sagara Indonesia could be like them, now and forever.

/u/MehiMehi “Which customer is easier to deal with? local or international?” Most of international customers already know what they want and need when they’re contacting us / placing order. 
But most of our local customers have no idea what they want and need, so the consultation process until placing and order is kind of ‘pain’ for us (50 mail conversations from one person is not a strange thing for us, hahaha). Like I said before, it’s kind of pain sometimes, but it’s our kind of 
way to educate Indonesians about what excellent and/or good shoes are.

“Do you use courier service (e.g. FedEx, TNT) for domestic shipping as well, or Indonesian postal service?” We’re using JNE as our local / domestic courier.

/u/Dnugget1 “How has the rise in overseas demand affected the way you run your business?”

Our production capacities are around 40 pairs / months (yes per months, not per hours). We’re trying to increase our production capacities gradually by educate new person (young man) that has no shoemaking experience. It takes time, really, but the result (since we’re open) is every single artisans has a really strong affection to Sagara Indonesia, their loyalty is unquestionable (based in our experience).  Right now 1 from 6 of our artisans still in training phase and showing a really great progress. Maybe in next one or two month we’ll find another person to be our future artisan. Most of handwelted shoemakers/artisans is an old man (around 40-50’s y.o), and we’re realize that regeneration is really important for Indonesia (and also in the world in my opinion) traditional shoe industries.

“Have you specifically worked on acquiring foreign customers, or are you primarily focused on your domestic customers?” Our main focus still domestic customer.

/u/Xiaopigu “Do you sell boots suitable for wide feet? Like size EE and wider?” Unfortunately, we can’t provide for that option right now, new lasts and patternd for wide feet are a big investment and difficult for small businesses like us. Sorry :(

/u/N_bulegila “How has Dede Chandra influenced the Bandung shoemaking community?” Glad to know that you know him! Mr. Dede Chanda is one with big reputation here, esp. for local shoe scene. He’s 
inspiring to youngsters like me and others, growing a business and making Indonesians proud in the eye of the world.

/u/Aype “What are your favorite pair of shoes you own?” I love all of my boots, each of the was made for different occasions. If I had to pick one for my daily beater, my latest Boondockers style boots made from Reverse Horween Latigo with cheap elephant print (lol) and vintage cats paw + rivet shank will be my ace. If you ask for casual sneakers, I’ll choose my Ewing’s &amp; Chucks.

4bzktg,1,2016-03-25,Two summer scenarios,excursionist,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/4bzktg/two_summer_scenarios/,"So, I've been sending out applications and had one interview, but at this point I don't have an internship related to my major (mechanical) lined up for this summer. (This will be the summer following my third year in college out of five total.) I'll keep applying, and am also working on possible research assistant spots with faculty at my school. But at the end of the day I may be looking at picking between the following two summer scenarios:

1) I previously worked two summers at a fairly large technical facility in a position that I'd call somewhat technical but not engineering per se (this was in the safety office). There's a fairly good chance I can get that for a third summer. Networking my way into an engineering spot at the same org, however, hasn't panned out yet, and it isn't clear that going back for a third summer would help on that front. Also, my expenses are really low, so money is not a big driver here.

2) Otherwise, I can devote the summer to a project or projects that hopefully might add to my resume. This might be something that would involve doing some designs in SolidWorks, getting parts fabricated and putting together a mechanism of some type. In this scenario I might also spend part of the summer working on skills like Matlab and Python.

So, if you were me and those were the two choices, which would you go with for the summer?

I need advice on whether I should still try to get into the CS program at UW (from what I've read on here, it's insanely competitive). My highschool stats are:

- GPA: 3.98
- SAT: 2180/2090 (800 R, 620 M, 760 W), (710 R, 730 M, 650 W)
- Swim Team Varsity all four years, went to state twice and was team captain senior year
- National Honor Society Officer (Webmaster)
- Self studied AP CS and got a 5 on the exam
- Internship doing CS at a national lab
- Volunteered at local library
- Did club swim for a billion years

I thought I had a pretty good shot, so I'm pretty shaken, but essentially my question is, should I pursue CS at UW? I really have a passion for it, but am worried that I'll be screwed after two years... I have an offer from Cal Poly to go directly to their CS program, but I really had my heart set on UW.

4c0alq,0,2016-03-26,My boyfriend [17M] and I [19M] are having serious communication issues. I don't know what I'm doing.,Rylanis,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4c0alq/my_boyfriend_17m_and_i_19m_are_having_serious/,"I don't know exactly where to start, so I'll apologize in advance for the mess I'm about to type out (it's a long one, but I really appreciate any input).


We haven't been dating for long at all.  It's been about two months, and things had started off very nicely.  We both had our lives together and, despite us both being busy with our classes and him with his internship, we made time where we could, and when we could get together, it was fantastic.  And it stayed fantastic, until about a month ago.


Mid-Feburary I got into a car accident.  Everyone involved came out unscratched (thankfully), but my car was declared totalled by the insurance company (it was a '99 and not worth the cost it would've taken to repair it).  This completely turned my life upside down.  It's amazing just how important having reliable transportation turned out to be, but without it, I was left trying to figure out all sorts of things, like how I was going to be able to continue to go to school.  My family isn't very well off financially, and it became incredibly stressfully trying to sort out all the issues that came with the accident.


Ultimately, I ended up getting a job working 30+ hours a week.  Along with the savings I had and the settlement from the insurance company, I was able to get a used car that was good enough to get me from A to B, but inbetween my work schedule and taking 17 credit hours this semester, I've been left with very little time for much else, and all of my money's been spoken for when it comes to insurance payments and car registration and gas and the like.  Basically, I wasn't able to put what I'd like to into the relationship, both in terms of money and time.


He seemed great about it.  He understood I was stretching myself thin and that I was trying the best that I could to make everything work, but we haven't been able to talk very much.  We both set aside time last night to have one of our old fashion, long phone calls.  It was the usual: jokes about the day and updates on what we've been up to.  I was talking about where I was at with getting some of my debts payed off from the car, and he seemed off.  I asked him what was up, and one thing led to another, and we were talking about how we were feeling about the relationship.


I guess him seeming fine reached its limits, because he told me he was getting sick of how things were: the lack of time together and me being stressed out (I'm normally a much more upbeat person, but things have been hard).  I've always been of the mindset that compassion and communication are the foundation for a good relationship, because they're what's made my last couple relationships work as wonderfully as they did.  He's struggled a bit more with being open about how he feels, and it only really seems to come out when issues have reached the point that he can't hold it in any longer.  A lot was said, but here are the main issues that were brought up:


- He feels like I compare him to my ex's.  I can understand where he's coming from, because I know that when I was new to relationships, I often felt insecure when the person I was with talked about their ex's.  I bring up experiences with my past relationships, but only because they're relevant to whatever issues we're having, and they're the only experiences I've had (obviously) with relationships and the normal issues that come up in them.  It's more, ""I've been here before, and this is what's worked for me, so maybe we can try this"" than anything else, but I feel he takes it as, ""I was able to get over this in the past, why can't you?"" and it makes him feel inadequate.  I try to talk to him about the disconnect we're having, but I can't help him understand that I have nothing but respect for him and am trying to solve our issues so that we can move forward and get better.


- He's upset that I'm not as happy as I used to be.  Again, I understand this.  I've always been good with making it through when the person I'm with is going through rough times, because I know they're temporary, and all I can do is try to help, but I by no means expect that from him.  Different people have different tolerances, and if he's not happy, I'm alright with him leaving to be happier.  It'll suck, but I'm naturally an independant person and I know I'd be fine.  I told him this and that I'll try to act as happy as I can, but he has to understand that this is a rough time for me.  He comes from an upper middle class family, and money issues don't really seem to click with him.  In fact, during the beginning of this call, I was talking about how I was trying to figure out how I was going to pay one of my bills, and he responded with, ""Hmm... okay.  Yeah, I've been really stressed out, too.  I can't decide if I want to vacation with my friends in the keys or at my lake house."" (Seriously.)


- He told me he feels like I expect sex from him.  His past relationship was with someone who had actually thrown things at him when he didn't feel like having sex.  I feel like that's the association he's made with sex, and it's hard for him to get past it.  We've been physical, and it seemed from what I could tell that he enjoyed it a lot.  I make sure to ask him before we do things and have reminded him that I'm okay if we don't because I know how his past has been, but he still feels like I'll resent him for not wanting to have sex.  I've taken us out on dates (even though they're using up the very little amount of discretionary income that I have) to show him that I value spending time with him for him, but regardless, he feels this way.  He even called me gross because I'm comfortable with my sexuality and have been with other guys in the past, which honestly hurt a bit.


We ended the phone call on a bad note after he insulted me a few times and we weren't making any progress.  I'm in a situation now where I'm not sure where to go from here.  He has some really good qualities, but it's seeming to me more and more that we're at completely different places in our lives and that we might not be able to reconcile those differences.  But now I'm left wondering, what can I do?  Do I push too hard for change by having us talk about these things?  Am I expecting too much of him to be okay with this?  Should I keep trying when we're having misunderstandings at every turn or is it time to call it quits?


Thank you if you read all of this.  Again, I really appreciate it.

   
**tl;dr**: Despite the relationship starting out well, some circumstances have put a strain on my time and money, and my boyfriend seems to have had enough of it.  I try to talk about our issues and find common ground, but we end up running in circles.  Things aren't getting better and I'm not sure what should be my next move."
4c0dfe,450,2016-03-26,NoFap 1000 days!!!!!,devildweep,NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/4c0dfe/nofap_1000_days/,"I WANT TO THANK ALL OF YOU HERE , EVERYONE I DON'T CARE IF YOU STARTED TODAY BECAUSE IT WAS PEOPLE LIKE YOU THAT CHANGED MY LIFE TO WHAT IT IS TODAY, THANK YOU.

I made this account just to explain my progress to all of you fighting this demon inside whether a brother or a sister, I know you have it in you so BANISH and OBLITERATE PORN!! from your life for ever. 

Before I begin with my story my friends I would like to tell you all a single truth. We are all born in greatness an existence which is released into this world at the loss of millions of other existences that could have been. Yes as you developed in your mother's stomach you were already great and had fought the biggest battle of your life to come into this reality. We were all meant to shine in greatness. Becoming the person who we wanted to be, not a copycat of a celebrity or a famous personality. You were meant to become the best version of yourself and live the best life you could be, Now I wont dwell deep into the meaning life as it is  different for everyone based on their perception and it is for you to find.

My story begins as a normal child would right curious about the world of adults, Well curiosity without caution often leads down to situations and circumstances some of us never wished to face. Well at 11 years old I started my Fapping journey, Young! right maybe it was triggered by my sexual education class which only showed us cartoon drawings of the female body parts. I still remember that day that I begin typing words on google and was scared to wits that my family would find out. Well the progression from there just got worse to what was fapping to HD porn on Xvideos and Pornhub, even to using my friends premium Brazzers account.
I never thought much of Fapping well the internet and doctors said it was good for you right, nurturing your balls and what not. Well no-one ever told this poor boy the devastating psychological effect it has on people.

Well forwarding 4 years to the escalation and I had myself in High school unable to talk to girls face to face, often my face would just turn red and I would be teased by my friends. I thought it was some kind of disorder with me and their was nothing I could do about it. My confidence began shattering until I couldn't even have conversations in group work at high school or stare them back in the eye, At night back at home I would take out my computer and wank to the virtual girls that would never turn me down because of my face and personality or imagine going hard with the hottest chicks in my school. Man I thought of some fked up stuff. Well 7 years progressed after that and I had deteriorated even more at this time I used to fap almost 7 times a day.

I loathed myself for fapping every single day for the 7 years, I had even contemplated suicide but didn't have the willpower to go through with it(Thank God I didn't) , I was living Trash and that was the hardest thing for me to admit. No One wanted me , No one needed me. Not my Family, not my friends, not anyone in this world. 

And then that same curiosity that had destroyed my life urged me to search for a way out, I had hit rock bottom and all I had left was to find a Way to climb out reach back to the person who I was meant to be. That is when I started to Not Fap and man it was EXTREMELY DIFFICULT , reading Quotes every single day, Cold showers almost 5 times a day, Locking my computer,phone and even my Router with safety settings.I relapsed but every single time I came out with even more determination even more drive knowing that if I stopped this ""I would become the person I wanted to be""

1day - no changes it felt the same, Questioning oneself on whether it would work
7 days - the slight changes had began to happen, new found energy and development 
20 days - Grey area, I had gotten used to the slight changes but now the urge had started coming back saying that this would all it could change
40 days - The first big change I could now look at women and do brief conversations with them, Yet my eyes still went towards their private regions. Change was happening but the urge was on the tip of my nose.
70 days - Slight changes now I could hold proper conversations with women but I was still slightly overrun by lust for women in university - Urge had become something that was almost uncontrollable I had come close to edging, turning off all my anti-porn software but the thing that kept me going was remembering where I had been and to never go their back again.
90 days - This is the challenge for most of you, your so called benchmark let me say that this is just merely the beginning. At 90 days I had started forming female friends which I would Often meet on a daily basis. My grades had started to become better I was curbing to C+ average greater than anything that I had ever achieved in my High school years. My confidence but I still waited for the drastic changes to take over.
140 days - This was where the first big change had come, My perspective of Life had completely changed I had managed to ask this beautiful girl out to a date and she had accepted and my confidence rose leaps and bounds. Even if she would have rejected I wouldn't haven been destroyed maybe a little set back but my energy had began to show to the people around me. I now had more friends, My family loved me, People I cared about and that had my back as I would have theirs.
250 days - My perspective of life and once again began to change, I had began to mediate and started to find peace within my self. Often and This stage I could hear a faint voice barely audible telling me to watch porn but it would be instantly defeated by my determination. My grades were gradually improving, I was offered an internship after taking a interview with managers of the business(a big step for me). My Confidence was only going up from here
400 - I had now began to believe I was at the end of the road at which Not Fapping could give me and somewhere deep down I could feel that small voice in my head become slightly more audible. Something was wrong and I was entering a Grey Area which would prove to determinant for the me which had reached this far. I began researching and managed to survive 40 days on sheer willpower and confidence which I had attained over the time.
440- The Urge had come back everyday had began a struggle, I started to panic, Friends and family had noted that something was wrong with me. It was a dark time, I had started to question my decision but I never wished to go back after coming so far until I found it in an article on the internet linking fapping to something known as Instant Gratification.

Now this instant Gratification is something that Society had developed to make people feel emotions more easily without putting the handwork behind it. We humans had become lazy and that is what had brought me to rock bottom back in the Past.

Day 550 - Instant Gratification was the Real Bane and if I wanted to continue growing and becoming more Greater, more Confident I had to stop instance gratification more easily known as the distractions. The things in your life that Waste Time - Facebook , YouTube, Internet surfing, Watching TV these are all useless things and are abstaining your from the greatness. You can all be prodigies and geniuses you just have to work harder than everyone else and invest more time that everyone else. I had began my plan slowly to stop these distractions and use the new abundance of time to flow in the direction of my greatness. At this stage I was 22 and had graduated from uni with B average still not highly likely to get myself a great job, I continued my uni study and pursued a masters degree.

Day 700 - I had now began to grasp the concepts of removing my self from the instant gratification and began working on my greatness on every aspect on my life whether it was my relationships and my academics. Everything!. The key to it was spending Time by myself thinking about my life, Often people say that your crazy if you talk to yourself let me assure you arent because the people who talk to themselves can take a break and realize their life in front of them. The path they are on and which part do they want to take. It is true you do not need to talk to yourself but merely spending a few minutes of the day thinking of your life of where you want to go and what you want to do can certainly put you much further ahead in your path to ENLIGHTMENT!!!

day 1000 - Here I am Folks , Sorry this has been going for a while but I would like to give back to the community which has given me so much both brothers and sisters alike. My life now is almost free from Distractions, I maintain an A+ average throughout my Masters degree this is talking about some that got into University barely with a D average in Highschool. No I wasnt smart, What is smart and What is dumb my friends than but a perspective at looking at the same thing we all have the potential in ourselfs to become the greatest there ever is but it is choice whether for us to realize that potential or not, sadly the fact is most of us can never see that potential. My URGES ARE GONE I have defeated that voice in my head and I no more run after girls with the biggest BOOBS or the largest ASSES but rather look for the girls with the personality which suits my own and because of that I have landed in a relationship with a woman which from my perspective is the greatest , most beautiful, nicest person that I have ever met. Someone I would want to Treasure all my Life and wouldn't hesitate to give my life for. TRUST ME guys all of you out there that just want the pussy, your doing it wrong your going to get desensitized and not be able to fully experience what it means to love someone truly and that sex is simply a scared activity that you would share with the person that means the most to you in the entire universe. Losing Your Virginity Right I had the same thoughts in my schooling years too but you see its the most precious thing you have and to share it with someone who is the most precious to you is the greatest gift and this applies to both males and females. Friends do not let your lust take over Remember and search for someone that shall let you experience True love and then maybe this world will be worth living in again if your flames have dwindled to just a spark.

I Have Talked for Long but lastly Fapping is DESTROYING your LIFE as long as you succumb to the desire of LUST you will never be the PERSON YOU WANT TO BE and LIVE THE LIFE YOU WANT TO HAVE infact my friends you are already GREAT but you must began to search and realize that POTENTIAL and GREATNESS which you have DEEP INSIDE OF YOU and use it to CLIMB the MOUNTAIN and SIT on the THRONE where you were MEANT to SIT all your LIFE reigning as a KING of your own WORLD""

My current pay is 25/h., which the new job said they'll match., plus full benefits. With lots of opportunities for growth. Overtime pay @ 1.5 10-20/h per week average.
Btw.. I'm a workaholic, I do my 40 there, plus 15-25 on Uber. And research with stocks.

I dont feel i should ask for more as they are also training me for 3 months to get fully in sync with their software and flow. Then I will be transferred to night shift( which I am 100% ok with, no kids btw). Leaves my mornings to pursue school more and not deal with people and traffic while shopping. I am also leaving my current city for another where housing is 4x less., so I am excited about that too.

I have a lot to gain on this new job., but! I know my old job is going to freak out when I give them my two week notice. Reason for it., they are new owners and most of my work is not scripted or written anywhere. Everytime I tried leaving before I got 3-4$ raises to stay (with the old owner). I can probably get more from them especially now., but I dont want to stay anymore (unless they compensate me enough to equal the 4x housing costs, &lt;80/h)

However., I don't mind keeping my options open with the old job just in case things dont work out. How am going to pull this off? I feel I have a plan. The new job is giving heavy training that I can utilize and implement into my old job, which they would benefit a lot from., so I was wondering what is the best way to deliver the news and try to cut a deal while keeping the ball in both courts.

Work part time managing the old one through remote services? Claim I am taking a 3 month internship? Have them ship raw products to me and drop ship them from my new location to the customers?

What would you do?"

4c12j2,0,2016-03-26,23 M4F The Fratboy and the First Year,ldnby92,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/4c12j2/23_m4f_the_fratboy_and_the_first_year/,"Welcome to Hudson University, home of some of America's smartest and wealthiest young people. And at Hudson there is one frat that reins supreme, where the brothers are smarter, stronger and more privileged then any of their rivals. And boy do they know it.

The line stretches down the block as students wait to enter Alpha Sigma's first party of the semester. I stand on the doorstep of the opulent fraternity mansion, arms folded in a way that shows off my bulging biceps and rippled chest. The collar on my Abercrombie polo is up, obviously, and I scan the line for any lithe young pickings that I could have fun with. I dumped my Theta slampiece over the summer - I said I had to focus more on my Goldman Sachs internship, but the real reason was I was just... bored of her. Who knows what I'll find tonight? Maybe a girl truly worth showing off to the high society I had been born into...
________________________________________________

Hey, thanks for reading! So the premise of this roleplay is pretty simple. I want to play a douchey, All-American frat bro who gets to corrupt and use a naive young first year. You could be a spoiled, stuck-up legacy blonde, a small-town busty brunette or even an ebony/latina girl who'd never dream she'd abandon her people to suck on the cock of a rich white guy. So long as you're creative and imaginative, I'm game!

This can be played short-term, but what I'd really like to do is create a little world of opulence and privilege. I want to seduce your character with promises of the high-life, taking you to all sorts of exclusive events and country clubs, all the while making you into a more and more depraved slut. By the end of it I want you to be my bimbo, a good, obedient little girl who smiles and sticks her chest out while the men discuss business.

Detail, creativity and good grammar are key. I'm pretty open to most kinks and this scene can go from plain vanilla to extremely dark.

Hope to hear from you!"
4c1qj8,11,2016-03-26,Enough makeup and skincare for a small town,veruu_8,MakeupRehab,https://www.reddit.com/r/MakeupRehab/comments/4c1qj8/enough_makeup_and_skincare_for_a_small_town/,"Hi everybody! I've been lurking here a lot and I decided it's time to make a proper (and long) intro
post!

To begin with, my mom works with makeup and skincare - she sells Oriflame (if someone here knows it).
The issue is, she used to buy a lot of products when there was a sale. We have accumulated A FULL
BATHROOM, A LARGE SHELF AND ~10 LARGE BOXES OF MAKEUP AND SKINCARE. My father was joking that we'll
need a separate room for these pruducts and trust me, he's not wrong. I don't live with my parents,
but I use to visit them fairly often and I didn't know how much of products we really own until
recently.

When I visited a month ago, my mom told me that she didn't want to buy any more products only to
store them. She started using more makeup and skincare items and showed me in which order she wants
to use them up. I was really proud of this decision - for a longer time I was trying to explain her
not to buy more items and I am really happy she finally decided to do it. She gifts some of the newer
products to everyone - I don't remember one holiday in my life when I didn't get a bunch of skincare 
or makeup. But some of the products are older and even if they are completely OK, you can't give it
to anyone, only use it or throw it out.

I didn't use to wear makeup, but last summer I started internship and took it as a chance to start -
now I wear makeup every time I go somewhere. My collection is mostly chosen from this gigantic stash
(I have some products from different drugstore brands). I have a bunch of backups and I know I have
no chance to use it up in normal amount of time, but I am trying, because this huge pile of products
needs to be smaller!

**TL;DR for this part:** My mom's (and mine) makeup and skincare stash is huge enough for a smaller
town.


So, I'm trying to use up what I can (if it's a product that suits me). My smaller stash I have in my
rented apartment is basically divided into two parts - one is items I like using and the second is
items I want to use up and then get a different one from that giga home stash (while using these
items I realised I'd like a different shade more, don't like the packaging etc).

I have made my own plan for using these items - I usually pick my makeup depending on the colors of
my clothes, so I use what I want the days I go to work or school, and I use the other products when I
go somewhere for a shorter amount of time (like grocery shopping, where I normally wouldn't wear
makeup) and use this for experimenting with them.

For example, I have a few older lipsticks where I hit pan (but there is a lot of product hidden) and
I don't like their color on me anymore, so I experimented with layering and now I use the layered
combinations also on the normal days because they are awesome! I also realized that there's no need
to force myself to use my yellow eyeshadow now, because I wear clothes in similar color when it's
warmer, so I'll get more usage from it in a few months and now I use the small lavender eyeshadow I
want to get rid of (same color as one of my shawls) and I already hit pan on it!

I have also four nail polishes I want to use up - I don't like the colors of the three as much as I
used to and the fourth is shitty quality (but great color). However, I used up one of my favourite
colors recently and I am close to using up one another color I'd like to get again. So, if I use up /
mix together two bottles from those four (or if I use up that second color), I can get the
replacements. Two of the colors I want to use up are different shades of blue and I'd like to mix
them together when they'll fit into one bottle (I bought a blue spring coat so I hope to get more
usage of them in the next months).

**TL;DR for second part:** I have a plan and am doing fairly OK, panned a bunch of items last month.


If you've read it all, I love you! I know I sound like I have my shit together and my mom is
starting to get it too, but we both get overwhelmed when we see that amount of products. She always
tries to force me to take as much as I can even if I tell her I can't use it up that quickly and if
I only mention that I like a shade she'll buy it for me immediately (MOM I DON'T NEED IT). I love how
this Reddit is supportive to everyone and I feel like I could get a serious use of your support too.
So, thank you for letting me write up my current situation!

4c24j9,0,2016-03-26,Boss going back on his word. May be terminating my employment after busy season. How should I approach the next few weeks?,accountingforanger,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/4c24j9/boss_going_back_on_his_word_may_be_terminating_my/,"I have interned at a mid-size local firm since the beginning of busy season and have really enjoyed my time there. I work, live, and attend university in this city that is the town I've grown up in as well. 

I was (according to everyone in this small fuck-ass town) stolen from my previous firm (I got the internship at this current firm without interviewing, they came to me with an offer. I am a college senior.) 

I was told that the role through busy season would be mostly tax with some audit experience.

One of our partners who serves as HR director and director of audit &amp; review spoke with me a few months ago about keeping me on after busy season. I had mentioned to some staff and managers that I knew they would be giving out offers, and my ultimate goal is to get out of town because I'm tired of being around the same old scene.

I intentionally mentioned this so people wouldn't waste their time trying to convince me to stay, and I also made it clear that I would like to stay on as part-time as long as they had a place for me.

Towards the end of January the HR partner called me into his office one day and told me, "" I don't want you to think that we know you're trying to get out of town and come April 18th we cut you off. You will have a place here after busy season.""

Cut to March 24th, he calls me in his office to tell me that depending on which of the other interns accept their offers, I might not be needed after busy season. And that he recommended getting my resume out as soon as possible. He also has pointed me in the direction of a temporary role at a medical device manufacturing facility.

I want to preface this before I continue with my question(s)

1. I know I have everything to lose here and my boss has nothing to lose. 

2. I know that I have to suck it up until the end of busy season so as to not have a bad reference upon leaving this place.

3. I know it's business and these things happen. 

4. I know circumstances change. 

5. I know he's doing me a favor by trying to help me find work after the internship ends. He doesn't have to do shit for me.

6. I have to wait to see how the next few days unfold in terms of people accepting offers. 

They approached me with an offer before any other of the interns, and they have approached me more aggressively than anyone else. I have been included on a lot of inside information that others have not been exposed to and it's extremely stressful knowing so much more bullshit than any of my peers.

Now, having gotten out of the way the shit I know I will catch for posting this, I want to ask r/accounting how you would approach your remainder of time at the firm if you were in, or have been in a similar situation?

It's really tough to elaborate on all the details of the circumstances, but I will say that my firm is by far the biggest in the area and notorious for being aggressive.

I have been working 40+ hours a week and putting in much longer hours than anyone else on my level. They have **repeatedly** told me that this has not gone unnoticed. They have reassured me that I have a place there and that I am valued. And now it seems that it all for naught.

I guess what I'm really asking here is - I know what is expected of me and what I am capable of giving - but if I'm not getting what I want nor what I was told I was going to get, why should I continue to put the same amount of effort into the position?

As it stands, I want to discontinue putting forth the effort that I have. If they are not investing in me, then why should I invest in them? I wanted to get on audits and they didn't get me on audits. I have been a tax return monkey for the past few months because I thought I was going to get some audit exposure after tax season ended. Now I have had it made clear to me that this has come to pass.

What's my motivation? Why work the long hours and weekends if I know there is nothing in it for me anymore? 

/endrant

edit: As expected, everyone here has told me what I clearly elaborated on in my post. That I did this to myself.

*I knew what I was doing when I told the higher ups that I didn't want to stay around.*

I did not think I would be led astray in that they would make accommodations for me.

Again, please refer to my questions in the OP.

Here they are for the lazy/people who can actually answer them:
 
1) *If I'm not getting what I want nor what I was told I was going to get, why should I continue to put the same amount of effort into the position?*

2) *What's my motivation?*

3) *Why work the long hours and weekends if I know there is nothing in it for me anymore?*

4c28iu,24,2016-03-26,[Map] Lair of the Necromancer - A complete dungeon made for use in Roll20,lil_literalist,rpg,https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/4c28iu/map_lair_of_the_necromancer_a_complete_dungeon/,"[Imgur album of the map.](http://imgur.com/a/kDtzv)

The details of the map are in the link above, so I'll comment on how I used this in my game. 

My players and their NPC ""intern"" were 12th level when they entered this dungeon. They had been hearing rumors that there was a new lich in the wilderness, and hordes of undead seemed to confirm this. Now, a lich is not destroyed when its body is... um, killed. It regenerates wherever its phylactery is hidden. As such, actually destroying a lich can be a tiresome endeavor. But my players heard that an artifact of life can be used to indicate the direction in which a lich's soul flees when its body is destroyed, leading to the phylactery. So my players stole the [Branch of Life](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/artifacts/minor-artifacts/branch-of-life) from a noble family and brought it to the necromancer's lair. 

My players went through the dungeon and ended up bypassing the special undead rooms entirely. They got past the door to the ceremonial chamber by just using Disintegrate on the walls next to the doors. They went in and began battling against the necromancer who, as it turned out, was not actually a lich yet. The NPC intern stole the Branch of Life from the party and gave it to the necromancer, giving him the last item that he needed to complete the ritual to descend to lichdom. It turns out that the NPC had been the one to plant the rumors about using an artifact of life to find a lich's phylactery. The necromancer and the NPC intern ended up teleporting out together when they got low on health.

Here are the different enemies that I used. The undead are mostly lower-CR creatures, so I just used a lot of them.

4c2av1,1,2016-03-26,"[20 F] MilSO, engagement is on the rocks, about to graduate with AA Advertising but feeling like I need to serve a ""higher purpose"".",br0kensins,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/4c2av1/20_f_milso_engagement_is_on_the_rocks_about_to/,"Hi, reddit. :-)

I'm a 20 YO female living in South Texas. I attend a local community college and will be graduating with an Associate's in Advertising-Public Relations in May. It took me three years to get here, and, as life would have it, I'm not really even sure I enjoy my major. I feel like community college has taught me nothing, and I'm just receiving a piece of paper with an obscure purpose.

I'm also currently in a relationship - well, actually, I'm not even sure at this point. But, I was in a relationship of 9 months with my fiance [20 F], who is in the military (Army). We had decided to get married upon her return from her current deployment (9 months, Korea), which is probably going to be late this year. I'm not sure exactly when she'll return, but she shipped off in January. Problem is, she recently cheated on me and I'm not sure where that leaves us. I am still very upset about it and have not made any amends.

I currently work at an internship in the Graphic Design/Marketing department of a local museum, and it's actually pretty cool, I enjoy it. I like design (which is what my college studying has been geared towards), and I think it would be very satisfying to actually get paid to do it. I've always loved art, and I enjoy graphic design. The problem is, as much as I feel that I enjoy it, I wonder if it would be very fulfilling farther down the road. I have recently (over the past year or so) felt the need to do something with my life that is ""worth something"", or that serves some kind of purpose. I don't feel like I know any skills worth knowing; or any skills at all, really. It makes me feel useless and down on myself. I technically shouldn't even have landed this internship - my background in graphic design comes solely from a semester I spent out-of-state, at a private college. I have learned nothing in my 2 1/2 years at community college (except maybe how to work 40-hour weeks and still manage to keep up with class, because my classes are somewhat of a joke). By sheer luck and fairly good BS'ing skills, I managed to land the internship that will probably end when my classes are over.

I am a bit averse to joining the military, after experiencing it through my (ex?) fiance. The toll that the military has took on her makes me apprehensive of enlisting, so while it's always been an option, I'm not sure if it's a good idea to take it. I have had an interest in EMS for quite a while, and that's been a heavily considered option. I know it makes hardly any sense, as I have no background in medical whatsoever (unless House and Grey's Anatomy count :-).) But it seems like it would be something that would prove to myself that I can do something that is worth living for. Something that challenges me to my limits - something that will make me realize what my limits even are. Something that will make me feel fulfilled, something with purpose.

Also, I live at home with my grandmother, who has insisted that I move out by this July/August. I can virtually go anywhere, as I don't really have anything tying me down to any one location. My (ex?) fiance will be at Fort Hood when she comes back, but I'm not counting on any plans with her at this point, because I don't know where our relationship is going to stand by the time she returns. Oh, and I don't want to live in South Texas anymore. :-) Not sure about the rest of Texas.

Advice for such a change in interests, rocky relationships, long distance, military, EMS, and how to pick a place to move to with virtually no direction would be appreciated. Or, hell, just drop in and say hi, if you're just as lost as I am. :-)

**TL/DR:**
[20 F] getting an Associate's in Advertising that I'm not sure I enjoy. I want to do something that will achieve a sense of self-fulfillment, and fulfillment of a feeling of purpose. Engagement with military fiance is on the rocks, she's not due to return from overseas until the end of this year. I have looked into EMS but not even sure where I'll be living in a few months.

I recently applied for a marketing position at a Managed IT service, they have been extremely expressed with my part time efforts and I have already done more work then the intern who held the position before me. I believe this is because I take the job seriously and understand the need for marketing to new clients.

The current pay for part time is $13/hr

I also hold a full time job as well that pays 31k (I have been here for 7 years)

I would like to start at 45k would this be considered to high?"
4c2ln1,42,2016-03-26,James Holmes : Mind Control? RESEARCH,birthdaysuit11,conspiracy,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/4c2ln1/james_holmes_mind_control_research/,"Holmes was one of six recipients of a National Institutes of Health Neuroscience Training Grant at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus in Denver. Holmes is a graduate of the University of California at Riverside with a Bachelor of Science degree in neuroscience. They’re videos of him at the age of 19. He appears to be customary, happy and informed. After his years in college, he worked as an intern at the Salk Institute partnered by DARPA of Biological Studies as well as at Miramar College’s biotechnology summer boot camp. Holmes inscribed in his resume that he created a computer program to illustrate temporary perceptions of causality and programmed a flicker fusion utility device. Flicker fusion is used in mind control. James Holmes also wrote papers on temporary perceptions of causality after college. Gen and a knowledge, was given to Holmes by Terry Sejinowski. 

Terry Sejinowski works to understand the computational resources of the brain itself, and tries to link brain function and behavior using computer models. By using simulations to make sense of experimental data, Sejnowski has helped link biophysical processes in the brain to human behavior. His research has revealed in- sights into a raft of phenomena from vision to sleep to brain disorders. Holmes referred to John Jacobson as his mentor. Jacobson worked at Hughes Medical Institute at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies, 10010 North Torrey Pines Road, La Jolla, California 92037, USA. Holmes, when attending school in Colorado was in a very specialized class studying things relating to “mind control”. Only a total of 6 students were allowed to attend, per semester, after completing an interview. Witnesses during the shooting stated that Holmes had an acquaintance. Nevertheless, during his trial Holmes was heavily drugged. Holmes also states, through witness references that he didn’t remember anything, absolutely nothing (Hypnosis state).

Scopolamine commonly used in Columbia is markedly similar to the date rape drug, except thousands of times more potent. When you are subjected to this drug your autonomy ceaselessly vanishes. James Holmes seem to be on such a drug, one reason being because his eyes were extremely sensitive to light (abnormal). He had, in regards to ocular effects, dilated pupils, mydriasis, cycloplegia to some extent by virtue of fluttering and twitching eyelids, erythema apropos dermatologic effects, redness in her face, neck and upper chest, and tremors. Compare his court pictures and videos to pictures and videos a few years before and you will see what I mean. 

The apparent benevolent personality of the shooter...his connections to neuroscience and his father’s supposed connections and intelligence, might have flipped the switch if any.  He could have delved too deep into his psyche, his sub-conscious mind, subsequently creating a monster in the process or was he used as a scapegoat? 

specialized class studying 'MIND-CONTROL' and is so secretive that only '6' students are allowed to attend, per semester, and it's by interview only! As far as his 'Psychologist' is concerned... She is the HEAD of the Psyche staff for the MIND-CONTROL

4c2yoj,68,2016-03-26,Das DW Interview mit Petry Frage für Frage,Impulseps,de,https://www.reddit.com/r/de/comments/4c2yoj/das_dw_interview_mit_petry_frage_für_frage/,"Ich fand das Interview absolut großartig, deswegen hab ich mir mal die Freiheit genommen, Frage für Frage und Antwort für Antwort durchzugehen und zu kommentieren.

00:40 Startet schon mal gut, der Interviewer zitiert korrekt mit der Formulierung ""last resort"". Sie weicht direkt aus und behauptet (fälschlicherweise), dass sie das nie gesagt habe. Er korrigiert sie, sie beruft sich darauf, dass sie nur ein Gesetz zitiert habe. Er kommentiert, dass der Kontext ihrer Äußerung, auch wenn es ein Zitat war, (""in a highly charged atmosphere"") definitiv die Assoziation mit dem Erschießen (""shooting them at the border"") zum Zweck der Verhinderung der Grenzüberschreitung (""must prevent illegal border crossing and even use fire arms if necessary"") weckte, sie beruft sich darauf, dass ihre wortwörtliche Äußerung theoretisch dies nicht beinhaltete. Stimmt so auch streng genommen. Am Ende des Tages kann da jeder für sich von ihrer Aussage halten, was er will.

04:11 ""If there was ever a chancellor Frauke Petry, would you ever give an order to border guards, as a last resort, to shoot unarmed refugees at the border?"" Schlechte Frage, sie reagiert aber auch nicht gut darauf. Die frage ist schlecht, weil es bei dem Gesetz nicht um spezielle Schießbefehle geht (was sie korrekt antwortet), sondern um ein Muster zum Reagieren auf bestimmte Situationen für Grenztruppen. Das hätte sie sagen sollen, tat sie aber nicht.

05:13 ""You wanted these headlines"" Und sie beruft sich wieder auf die wortwörtliche Auslegung ihrer Aussage über Schusswaffengebrauch. Und sie beschwert sich darüber, dass nicht über die Tatsächlichen Inhalte der AfD geredet wird, sondern über Aussagen einzelner Politiker. Komme ich später zu.

06:40 Luckes Aussagen über die ""Infiltration of the party"". Sie leugnet diese, sagt dass Lucke von seinem Fehlen ablenken wolle. Keine schlechte Reaktion an sich.

07:45 ""Xenophobic, Racist"", sie geht gar nicht darauf ein.

07:52 Sie bezeichnet die AfD als Partei von Menschen, die denken, dass die Demokratie gegenüber ""gebrochenen"" Verträgen (""Treaties"") versagt, und dass Menschen vom puren Konsumententum zum Bürgertum (""Citizen"") übergehen müssen. Sehe ich an sich kein Problem mit, allerdings schwingt bei der AfD da immer dieser völkische Unterton (a la Volksgemeinschaft) mit.

08:26 Henkels Kommentare zur AfD werden angesprochen, Petry sagt erstmal, dass Henkel die Partei kaum kannte, und beschwert sich dann wieder darüber, dass man sich nicht um Inhalte, sondern um Aussagen von Personen kümmert. Da gäbe es eine deutlich bessere Antwort drauf als die vom Interviewer, komme ich später drauf.

9:40 Das Verhältnis der AfD zu Pegida. Petry beschwert sich darüber, dass man nur den laut schreienden Idioten zuhört, statt die Heterogenität der Gruppe zu betrachten und mit den Menschen zu reden. Weiterhin sagt sie, dass die AfD mit den Mitgliedern von Pegida und nicht mit ihren Organisationen solidarisch sei. Eine Goldgrube, komme ich später dazu.   
Zusätzlich beschwert sie sich wieder über das Betrachten von Aussagen einzelner Politiker der AfD, hier über das Verhältnis zwischen AfD und Pegida.

13:45 Sie sagt, dass die Politik viele Menschen zurücklässt, sich nicht um sie kümmert, ihre Probleme nicht ernst nimmt, und man diesen menschen zuhören müsse. Keine Widerrede durch den interviewer und auch nicht durch mich. valider und gut präsentierter Punkt.

14:45 ""State Media, with their possibly corrupt connections"" Sie behauptet, dass es seit langer Zeit keine neutrale Berichterstattung gäbe, dass Kommentare und Berichte vermischt würden. Interviewer fragt nach ""Evidence"", bekommt keine Antwort, dafür leugnet Petry ihr eigenes Zitat von ~10 Sekunden vorher (""possibly corrupt"", ""never said corrupt"").

16:05 Das Verhältnis des Islams zu europäischen Werten. Interviewer fragt ""why does that matter to you?"", und ist dabei 'right on the money'. Petry antwortet damit, dass man sich um die Ansichten von manchen Menschen sorgen müsse, die europäischer Liberalität und dem Grundgesetz widersprechen. Interviewer antwortet, dass diese Ansichten nicht institutionalisiert und nur Privatsache seien.

17:35 Gauland Zitat über den Islam als ""Teil Deutschlands"". Petry sagt, dass die an sich Religion nicht Teil D's sei, integrierte Muslime jedoch schon, argumentiert mit der Beliebtheit der AfD bei Immigranten und mit der Gefahr, der die deutsche Kultur ausgesetzt sei, durch Immigration von Muslimen in großem Ausmaß. Der Interviewer antwortet mit der Frage, ob die deutsche Kultur denn so zerbrechlich sei, und warum Deutsche denn vom Ausleben der persönlichen Religion bedroht seien (""Minarettes"", ""Burqa""). Petry antwortet, dass es nicht um Gefahr gehe, sondern um Selbstbestimmung des deutschen Volkes (da sehe ich wieder den unterschwelligen Ton der Volksgemeinschaft).

**20:35 ""But why this obsession with what is ours, and what is foreign"".** Perfekte Frage, und sie hat absolut keine Antwort. Sie redet über die Trennung von Schwimmunterricht, und Zeiten in Schwimmbädern, und davon, dass Immigranten sich an eine vorherrschende Kultur und Lebensweise anpassen (""assimilate"") müssen. Dabei ignoriert sie komplett die Kernfrage, die des warum, die der Frage nach dem Recht, Kultur, ""unser"" Land zu definieren, und der Frage danach, wie tief ins individuelle Leben diese Definition einschneiden darf.   
Ein erster Blick auf die Antiliberalität der AfD.

21:45 Der Interviewer geht wieder auf die Gefahr für die ""health of our nation"" (gefährlich nah an ""Volksgesundheit"")(-Höcke) ein, sie sagt wieder, dass das nicht ihre Worte seien, und geht dann von der Frage weg auf Grenzen ein. Sie sagt, dass es sichtbare oder unsichtbare Grenzen gibt, die jedes Volk unterscheiden, und dass das Setzen dieser ihr Anliegen sei. Der Interviewer erwidert, dass ihre Vorstellung dieser Grenzen repressiv gegenüber eine anderen Kultur sei.   
Jetzt kommt etwas Großartiges. Petry sagt, dass deutsche Gesetze nichts mit Repression zu tun haben. Der Interviewer antwortet mit der Repressivität von Minarett- oder Burqaverboten. Und jetzt kommt die grundsätzliche philosophische Differenz zum Vorschein.  
**Erstens sagt sie essenziell, dass demokratisch beschlossene Gesetze nicht repressiv sein können.** Das ist so ein unfassbarer Dünnschiss, natürlich kann eine Mehrheit eine Minderheit unterdrücken. Die Apartheid zum beispiel war parlamentarisch beschlossen und ganz sicher repressiv. Deswegen haben wir ein Grundgesetz, was die Gesetzgebung aktiv einschränkt, Gesetze gibt, die gar nicht erst außer Kraft gesetzt werden können, und eine höhere Schwelle (2/3 Mehrheit statt absoluter) für Änderungen des Grundgesetzes vorgibt.  
Das ist die Spannung zwischen Rechtsstaat und Demokratie, denn nein, die bedingen einander ganz sicher nicht.   
**Zweitens, der Interviewer geht an die Frage mit dem Ansatz ""why shouldn't they be"" heran, während Petry über ""why should they be"" herangeht.** Das ist ein immenser Unterschied, denn der Hintergrund des Ansatzes des Interviewers ist die Ansicht, dass alles, was nicht explizit verboten ist, erlaubt ist, während Petrys Hintergrund der ist, dass alles, was nicht explizit erlaubt ist, verboten ist. Das ist der große Split zwischen Liberalität und Autorität, die Frage danach, ob der Staat explizit verbieten oder erlauben soll.   
Unser Grundgesetz und unsere freiheitlich-demokratische Gesellschaft basiert auf dem ersten Ansatz, dem der Liberalität. Petrys Argumentation (""why should they be worn"") widerspricht dem diametral. ""Europäische Liberalität"" my ass.   

23:40 Das gleiche beim nächsten Punkt, ""male circumcision should be outlawed"". Petry hätte den guten Einwand geben können, dass dies für Neugeborene definitiv Sinn ergeben würde, da das letztlich in die Grundsatzfrage geht, ob meine Religion jemanden anderes schädigen darf, auch nur ansatzweise. Tut sie aber nicht, sie weicht aus darüber, dass es ja nicht in der finalen Version vorkommen würde.

24:19 Der Umgang mit nicht therapierbaren Drogenabhängigen, gefragt wird wieder, ob dies auch im finalen Draft sein wird. Petry beschwert sich wieder darüber, dass der Interviewer sich die Partei nicht von innen anguckt, sondern nur das, was an die Öffentlichkeit kommt.

Interviewer beendet das Interview.

All in all:

Erster Punkt, die Aussage zum Schießbefehl: Sie hat rein wortwörtlich nie etwas Falsches oder Verwerfliches gesagt. Der Kontext ihrer Aussage hingegen hat definitiv die Implikation des a) Schießens AUF unbewaffnete Menschen (im Gegensatz zum Warnschuss), und b) zur Verhinderung des Grenzübertritts (im Gegensatz zur Notwehr) erwirkt. Hat der Interviewer sehr gut nachgehakt, sie eierte rum beim auf das Wortwörtliche berufen. Er geht zwar schlecht auf die tatsächliche rechtliche Situation ein (Schießbefehl statt Reaktionsmuster), aber sie kann sich dagegen auch nicht wehren.

Zweiter Punkt: Die grundsätzliche Herangehensweise an Liberalität und Kultur. Habe ich eigentlich bei der Frage selber genug kommentiert, aber ich möchte es nochmal sagen:   
Die AfD behauptet, europäische Liberalität verteidigen zu wollen, und argumentiert dann diametral genau gegen sie.

Letzter Punkt, und der ist wirklich wichtig, weil er zeigt, warum das alles wichtig ist, und nicht nur das tatsächliche Programm und die internen Diskussionen der Partei: 

Es gibt zwei sehr sehr interessante Parallelen: Pegida und Occupy Wallstreet, und die AfD und die Piratenpartei.

Occupy war eine unorganisierte Bewegung, die heterogener nicht hätte sein können, und die wenige sehr laute Vollidioten hatte. Sie hat sich darüber beschwert, dass sie nur an diesen gemessen wurde, und nicht ihre Heterogenität angesehen werden würde. Pegida das gleiche.

Die Piratenpartei war eine Partei mit wenigen guten Ideen, die danach versucht hat ein Vollprogramm aufzustellen, und sich dabei komplett zerstritt. Sie hat sich nicht professionalisiert, sie hat parteiinterne Differenzen nicht intern geklärt, man hatte verschiedenste öffentliche Figuren mit verschiedensten Ansichten, und man beschwerte sich darüber, dass man jedem einzelnen davon zuhörte, statt die Diskussion zu betrachten. Das gleiche bei der AfD.

Und die Crux an der ganzen Sache wurde in the Newsroom sehr gut zusammengefasst (im Gespräch über Occupy Wallstreet, Shelly ist eine Demonstrantin von Occupy):

Will: Your movement sucks, Shelly.   
Shelly: I’m sure it looks that way from the outside.   
Will: And right there is your problem, ’cause who the fuck cares what it looks like from the inside?

(Kann dazu sehr [dieses Interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwk_Ot8orPY) und die gesamte Folge empfehlen.)"
4c2zzb,6,2016-03-26,Summer Courses or Internship? (or both?),Alpha-B,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4c2zzb/summer_courses_or_internship_or_both/,"I am currently a Junior in college with no real work experience in the field (CS Major). My only experience was last summer when I volunteered in one of the university office buildings helping out with desktop support. Other than that I've only held a few retail and fast food jobs. 

I am thinking of doing an internship but I also would like to take summer classes that would help me graduate on time. If I don't take these classes, I most likely would have to stay for an extra semester to complete all my credits, which would cost me a lot more than doing the summer classes now. Two of the classes are online but the other is in class for 6 weeks from mid-May to the end of June (4 days a week from 9am-11am). Basically my schedule would be for the first 6 weeks i have one online and one in-person class. And the next 6 weeks I would take another online class.

I would like to know your opinions on if it is worth it to take the classes in order to graduate on time and not have to pay for an extra semester, or if I should go for an internship and try to get some experience? Also, I have never applied for an internship, so does anyone know the likelihood of a company working around my schedule for the first 6 weeks until I am done with the in-person class?"

Right now I'm developing an educational game with a professor for undergraduate research. Once I'm done with that, my plan is to start making my own games, possibly with friends, to develop a portfolio. Hopefully I'll be able to publish something for PC or for iOS by the time I graduate.

Beyond that, what am I missing? How important are internships and co-ops? What about game dev conferences, extracurricular activities, etc? How do I keep my options open in the event that game development isn't what I should to be doing?

By the way, my long-term goal is to create a game that becomes a large esport, so the activities I partake in should facilitate that."
4c36rm,5,2016-03-26,Paying for grad school: Roth vs. 401k vs. Loans,KetchupOnMyHotDog,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/4c36rm/paying_for_grad_school_roth_vs_401k_vs_loans/,"I am headed back to business school in the fall at a top 20 US program and was lucky enough to get a full tuition and health insurance scholarship. My parents are going to cover my rent so I am left with covering about $28,000 broken down in the following ways:  
- $6000/year in living expenses (food, car insurance, clothes, fun, etc.)  
- $5000/year in global experience trips with program  
- $2000/year for books and case materials  
- $1000/year in other random expenses  
= $14000 x 2 years = $28,000 total  
  
I will have a paid internship between years 1 and 2 paying approximately $7000/month for 3 months but I'm assuming that will be for my living expenses during my internship (in another city, thus double rent).
I have the following assets:  
- negligible savings (traveling all summer, not sure how much will be left after that) - figure $3000 after moving expenses and all  
- $25,000 in a 401k, will transfer to Vanguard after I resign in 6 weeks  
- $12,000 in a Roth IRA with Vanguard  
- $4,500 in post-tax investments with Vanguard  
- $2,500 in ESOP to be transferred to another account upon termination in 6 weeks (taxable)  
- No debt, reliable paid-off car  
  
For the first year, I could borrow that $14k from:  
- 401k (Vanguard allows you to borrow up to 50% for 5 years)  
- Direct Unsubsidized loans (grad loans at 5.84%)  
- Roth IRA  
  
In what order should I tap assets to pay for living expenses?

4c3f75,2,2016-03-26,"My computer keeps crashing, but only when I'm using Chrome to watch Netflix.",Hephaestus777,pcmasterrace,https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/4c3f75/my_computer_keeps_crashing_but_only_when_im_using/,"Please save me PCMR, you're my only hope! This problem started about a week ago. After about an hour of streaming Netflix on Chrome, my computer crashes. It isn't a ""normal"" blue-screen crash where it displays at least some sort of error, but it just blanks both my computer screens out entirely, either black or some other color, usually tan or purple, with absolutely no text. When it does that, ctrl+alt+del doesn't work, I can't shut anything down, and I have to do a manual power off/restart. A list of my computer parts is shown below:

-Motherboard: ASUS ROG Maximus Hero VII 
-CPU: Intel i7-4790k Devil's Canyon Quad Core
-RAM: G.SKILL Trident X 4x8 GB DDR3 2400
-GPU: EVGA GeForce GTX 970 w/ ATX 2.0+
-OS: Windows 10 that I upgraded from Windows 7 pro
-SSD: Samsung 850 Pro 256 GB (also holds my boot for my OS)
-HDD: WD Black 1 TB 7200 RPM
-PSU: EVGA Supernova GOLD 850 W
-CPU water cooler: Corsair H100i w/ 240mm fans

At first, I thought it was a problem that went beyond just Chrome/Netflix, but I also spent a few hours each day using Chrome for applying to internships and school work WITHOUT using Netflix, and everything went fine. I've also spent a few hours each night playing the Witcher 3 on ultra settings and everything goes well. But stream Netflix for an hour or two, and it decides to shit the bed.

To start trying to come up with some solution, I enlisted the help of my friend that is my tech guru. Our first solution was to put my computer into safe mode, uninstalled my current drivers for my GPU, and manually installed the most current ones again. Didn't fix the problem. We then tried a memtest to check if my RAM was working the way it should be - it is. Still have the same problem. We then did a Prime95 torture test. It reached 100% load on my CPU, but it didn't crash, which is good. BUT I still have a problem. Then as a last ditch effort, we uninstalled Chrome and re-installed it. Still crashes after an hour. I've also installed WhoCrashed to try and find what exactly is crashing, but it comes up with nothing.

I'm sorry for the long post, but I've tried looking everywhere to try and find a solution. It's not like this is a huge problem, but it's still annoying and I don't want it to become an even bigger problem. So please, any help or insights would be helpful."
4c3gwv,3,2016-03-26,Not good enough for internship,cs23456,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4c3gwv/not_good_enough_for_internship/,"I apologize if similar questions have been asked before, and I welcome links to different threads or sarcastic responses to learn how to use a search bar. 

I received an offer a couple weeks back from a smallish but good company (I think a unicorn) that pays well and has good reviews.  In reality I am nowhere near good enough to work for such a company. I am significantly less qualified and less experienced than the other interns, from what I have seen, and the company is supposedly known for hiring smart people. All the material  will be knew to me, and I am not sure how I will perform. Can an intern get fired for being very bad? How might this look for me during future internship interviews next year? In reality, I am just decent at the kind of coding problems companies give because I studied the data structures and am somewhat logical minded. I don't know how those interviews are any reflection of my performance at a company. I guess the question I am asking is if I should wait for easier work at a ""worse company"", or take this opportunity despite probably not being good enough. Thank you for reading."
4c3k8v,22,2016-03-26,Impunity - Part VI,WriterWhoWrites,CaffeinatedWriter,https://www.reddit.com/r/CaffeinatedWriter/comments/4c3k8v/impunity_part_vi/,"Preston fidgeted with his pen as he dialed up his uncle again. No response. Next he dialed the Chief of Police.

""Any updates on Stanley Smith?""

""I told you I'd call when we do.""

""You didn't call for twenty minutes.""

""All quiet in the Montgomery. Nothing to call about.""

""Now that's an update, isn't it? Nothing's happened - that's a good update to have until George gets there from wherever the hell he is. Make sure you call me even if it is to tell me that the sun still sets in the West as long as Stanley Smith is in this town. Do you get me?""

Click - the line is dead. Preston slams the receiver and curses loudly.

""Everything okay?"" The assistant DA, arms full of file folders, walks in.

""Yeah, nothing to worry about."" Preston shrugs it off.

""I haven't seen Tracy after lunch. You sure you don't need a hand?""

""No,"" Preston forced a smile. ""Everything's cool.""

Everything was as bad as it could be. His intern had quit and there were no updates on George. But he couldn't involve the assistant DA and the rest of his team. They were all piled up with cases of their own, and this one was more of a private matter for Preston. It was his smiling mug posted on banners all across the city after all.

Preston moved over to Tracy's desk. She said she had to leave because of a domestic emergency, whatever that meant. Preston shook his head- he shouldn't have threatened to give her a bad recommendation for quitting so abruptly. His mother used to tell him how he'd inherited his uncle's temper, and if he didn't reign it in he'd die lonely and universally detested, just like his uncle inevitably would.

He flipped through the files. Bob had been a classmate of Stan’s and the only other person there was Bob’s fifteen year old niece Norah. No files on her, duh. 

He went back to his desk and picked up the evening newspaper. The media was tightening the noose on the entire establishment. Most of the front page was on Stan. The bottom line was about the debate in Congress tomorrow. Preston flipped the page. An opinion piece defending the eleventh amendment rights of Stan. Flip. Another op-ed countering him and calling it an anachronism that didn’t have a place in modern society. Preston sighed, he was skeptical about the legislation despite the senator’s confidence. There had been seventy three motions moved to amend the constitution and repeal the eleventh. Every single one of them had failed. 

A cartoon depicted a caricature of Stanley Smith pointing a gun to the statue of liberty. Next to it was a cop, a judge and Preston. The cop had his hands to his ears. The judge's hands were covering her eyes. Preston's hands covered his ass.

The phone rang. Preston sprang and picked up.

""What's the update on the Montgomery?""

The Chief of Police paused.

""New guest."" 

""Who?""

""We ran his plates, its a rental. The store wouldn't give out his details without a warrant.""

""Arrest him for changing a lane without a turn signal.""

""He's already parked.""

""And what were you doing all this time?""

""We're already walking a tightrope around Stan. We can't harass what might be a random motel customer.""

Preston's jaw tensed.

""Keep me updated-""

""That's not why I called.""

Silence. Preston waited on the phone as the Chief of Police tried to find words.

""Its about George.""

""Is he on his way to the motel?""

""I'm not sure. We don't know where he is. We only know now where he was thirty minutes ago, but...""

Preston's hands began to tremble as he listened. He tried to regain control over his senses.

""Send an ambulance and a police car. Be subtle. You know we don't want a big deal made out of this. And find George no matter what.""

The day had started with a terrible problem. Now there were two. Preston cursed himself. Why did he listen to his uncle? His mother had always told him to stay away from his toxic influence. 

He called the senator. No response, not even a voicemail. Preston dialed again. 

The Chief of Police picked up.

“I already told you we can’t find George”

“No, I need you to find someone else for me.”

“Who?”

“Senator Burke- my uncle.”

---------

Norah sprang up on her chair, eyes wide. She snapped shut the lid of her laptop, plucked out the cables and darted outside the office to bump into a frail man in his late forties. She hurriedly bends down and forces him up.

""Are you ok? Listen, we're not really taking any visitors now. This is not a good time.""

The man dusted his trousers as he found his balance.

""Not a good time at all."" She mutters to herself as she locks the door to the office behind her, flips around the sign to say ""closed"" and dashes up the stairs.

""W-wait. I am-""

She had disappeared. ""Kids"", the man mutters. 

From the floor above he could hear her frantically calling out to her uncle and Stan. He slowly makes his way up the stairs.

------

As Wallace drove in he noticed that a car was parked already. He could make out the dark silhouettes of two burly men from his headlights. He lowered the windshield and nodded as they shone a flashlight on him. A gate rumbled open.

He used to visit this estate a lot as a kid. His father would bring him here on summer days. The overhead noise of the airplanes approaching the airport nearby made it hard to sleep. Then Burke had secured federal funding for new glideslopes and a runway which made most of the planes approach from the north. Billions of dollars of taxpayer money just so Burke could have some sleep on the rare summer days he visited this place.

Then Burke got bored and sold it to Oxvac for a concessional price. The lack of noise and abundant sunshine suited its new purpose.

But Burke still acted like he owned the place. He had the keys and used it as he pleased. The two burly men outside were part of his security detail.

""Why did you call me here?""

Burke handed him a slip of paper.

""I have to get to DC by the morning, big debate. So I'm handing this over to you personally.""

""These are coordinates - for what?""

""For a hundred billion dollars, perhaps. It's not so far from here. Strange isn't it? It was always so close - the graveyard of its cousins right under its sights.""

Wallace stared at the envelope again.

""Did you really find it this time?""

Burke patted the CEO on the shoulder as if he was still a kid.

""When was the last time I couldn't get what I wanted?""

Wallace wanted to answer, but he was reminded of the Senator's legendary temper.

------

Bob let himself in after a brief knock, sliding himself inside trying not to open the door too wide for the prying eyes outside.

The platic bag from Katie's was laid out, the food untouched, except for a half empty bottle of what looked like chocolate milk.

""It is awfully quite. I'm sorry if I'm making you lose business, Bob.""

“Don’t be, I’ve upped your rent seven times. That’s to compensate for the number of guests who’ve been scared off this motel by you.”

Stan smiled. Bob tried to remember when he'd last seen him happy.

“This afternoon an intern from the DA's office dropped by, asking questions about you. I wanted to let you know I didn’t say anything.”

“Thank you, Bob. Although I don't think there was much to say.”

“She asked me if I knew that Roger Smith physically abused you.”

Stan looked at Bob in sullen silence. 

“I know. I wonder how they got that idea, right? I mean, he really was a terrible father, but... that intern said some kids had seen you bruised quite often.”

Stan looked down.

“I didn’t tell them how you got those bruises, Stan.”

“Kids tend to bruise, Bob.”

“Stan. I saw it once. I saw what caused your bruises.”

Frantic shouting from the outside. It was Norah.

Norah barges into the room. She unfolds her laptop and holds it out to Bob and Stan.

""Sorry, but you gotta see this.""

""Holy shit."" Bob's jaw drops. 

""I called an ambulance and they should be there soon,"" Nora says, catching her breath.

""This doesn't make sense,"" Bob was shaking his head.

""That is Katie's house,"" Stan moved towards the laptop screen, squinting. ""Who is this person - why is there blood over his hands and shirt? I need to leave.""

""No, Stan. Wait."" Bob tries to stop him.

A thin, frail man appears at the door.

""What the hell - who're you?""

""I'm Stan's friend from prison-""

""Whatever. Stan, gimme your jacket. Norah, switch off the lights in the parking lot."" He beckoned the man, made him take off his coat and put on Stan's jacket. Then he placed a cap on his head and pulled it down over his eyes. 

""What the hell?"" The frail man protested.

""Norah, take him""  he shoves the frail man towards her ""and drive as fast as you can in the other direction"" he throws her his keys. ""I'll take Stan to Katie's when the cops are on your trail.""

""Who is he?"" Norah finally took a good look at the visitor, eyeing him suspiciously.

""Stan, do you know him? Can I trust Norah with him for a little while?

Stan nods. "" It's been a while, Karl."" Karl smiles at the acknowledgment. 

""I can take care of myself uncle Bob."" Norah shoves the man outside and rushes through the corridor.

""I don't believe this.. I can't believe George would harm them.""

""Who?""

""George Olson. Everyone knows who he is but beyond that he's like an enigma, an urban legend. The man with impunity, they called him. Before you got out that is. I suspected he'd be the first one they'd think of when trying to get rid of you... but this is probably a trap, Stan. Although it'd be easier for him to come here, it doesn't make sense to me at all.""


The lights went out, with a screeching sound a car speeds off the parking lot. Half a dozen car engines fire up in response. It was dark now and the cars all tailed the one Norah and Karl were driving.

""We move now"" Bob grabbed Stan's hand.

4c3nop,78,2016-03-26,My brother got hot,hornybrother098123,gayincest,https://www.reddit.com/r/gayincest/comments/4c3nop/my_brother_got_hot/,"My younger brother is staying with me for a week while he looks for possible jobs or internships for after he graduates college. It worked out all right because my roommate is away and my brother is pretty low maintenance when he stays anywhere. We are two years apart and I haven’t really seen him that much except holidays and I haven’t gone back every year.

When he got here I had some friends over, a mix of gay and straight friends. He had a breakup about 4-5 months ago and did the reddit-approved “delete Facebook, hit the gym” stuff. One of the girls when we were getting drinks said, uh you never told me your brother was so hot. That kind of made me see him with new eyes, I had just been seeing him as the skinny kid that used to tag around after me. And once she said that I saw that, yeah he has really filled out. And he was getting along with everyone really well and fitting in. Everyone was asking, so do you have a girlfriend? He didn’t give too many gory details but said he was out of that game for a while. One of my guy friends brought up the old “you know guys suck better than girls” thing, and Alex said he wouldn’t know but as long as there were no strings… he left that hanging, which got kind of a response from some of the guys. We were all pretty drunk by that point.

Friday I woke up with a cold and called in sick and just laid around. Alex had some appointments so he was getting ready, running in and out of my bathroom through my room. Damn he really looked good, especially in his business get up. 

I slept all day trying to shake it off. I woke up and he was rubbing some vicks on my chest, which is a thing we always used to do. He had picked up a lot of stuff from the drugstore. I was sleepy and was just laying there let him rub the stuff on my chest and neck. Then I kind of relaxed too much and let out a little moan, like mmm. I snapped back awake right then and said sorry but he just laughed and said, feels good, huh? 

He had texted some friends of mine asking where he should order food from because I was out. They ended up coming over with some soup and stuff, and we just hung out for a while. It was two of my guy friends, a couple. 

We were talking and then Alex said OK I have to get out of this straightjacket and he went and took his interview suit off. He ended up just sitting on the couch listening to us talk, in his t shirt and boxers, kind of halfway falling asleep. 

From where I was, I noticed that you could see right up his boxer leg. And I could tell my friends saw it too but everybody was pretending like they couldn’t. I have not seen him naked that much in a while. From what I could see it looked like his cock was definitely bigger than I ever remember.

I think it was the cold medicine making me sort of delirious but I couldn’t stop staring. And I really wanted to see more of his cock. Alex woke up a little and adjusted himself. My friends were telling kind of a crazy story about another friend and a Grindr hookup he had. For most straight guys it would have been a little over the edge. I cut in at one point and said, uh he doesn’t need to hear all the details. Then Alex said, nah I don’t mind. So he heard the rest of the story. My friends took off after that. The whole time I was like some creeper trying to see up his boxer leg.

He got me set up with water and nyquil and asked if I wanted stuff rubbed on my back. I said yes and he rubbed the vicks on my neck shoulders and upper back while I lay on my stomach in bed. I was rock hard by then and falling asleep. He went into my bathroom to take a leak before bed. He kept pissing forever. I was halfway asleep imagining him shaking his dick. 

I had really intense fever dreams all night, sweating. I can’t remember them all but he was in a lot of them. Like watching him work out, seeing him with his shirt off, him rubbing my back. I woke up and was totally out of it, I was craving ice water. So I sort of stumbled out of the room to get to the kitchen. 

It was dark and I was dizzy. I heard something but right then I didn’t know what. I bumped against the couch and against his foot that was sticking out. He pulled it back and acted like he was asleep. I got the icewater and chugged it. When I was back in bed I realized I think I had heard him jerking off. Once I had that idea in my head I got wide awake, I couldn’t think about anything else. 

I got out of bed really slow and went over to the door. I stood there for a long time. Then I started hearing the sounds of jerking. I was waiting for my eyes to adjust and hoping I could see something.

I could just barely see. I have a good size piece, above average. But holy shit, it was dark but it looked like he had a huge rod in his hands. I got paranoid that he would know I was there so I ended up sneaking back into bed. I heard him sighing and knew he must be cumming. I was jacking slowly (so I could still hear) and I came.

That was last night. Waking up today I felt a lot better. Alex was walking around in his towel. When he went past the bed I just reached out and grabbed the towel. DAMN. Some Michael Fassbender thick dick going on. I acted like it was a joke and luckily he just laughed and ended up being naked for a while longer until he got dressed.

He went out to explore since he’s never really been around here. After he left I jerked off and came everywhere thinking about his dick.

I do read this sub for jerkoff material and have always been turned on by brothers, dads/sons. But I never thought about Alex like that exactly. But when I saw him later I was almost drooling. He looked incredible in the shirt he was wearing, his arms have gotten really amazing looking. We were at a place for lunch where a friend of mine works and was our waiter. When Alex went to the john my friend was like, where’d you meet HIM? And I said, he’s my brother! but I felt proud. 

It looks like a lot of guys have spring break visitors :) and are trying to figure out how to get something going. I want to at least see him jerking off. He’s here for the week. Wish me luck I guess! Or just hope I jerk off enough to calm the fuck down. :)"

That being said, I have half of my classes for the next two years ""empty.""

4c42sw,15,2016-03-26,"Me [27 M] with my gf [25 F] of 2 years, I don't deserve her but I can't live without her.",yepithrowaway,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4c42sw/me_27_m_with_my_gf_25_f_of_2_years_i_dont_deserve/,"My girlfriend is perfect for me in every way and she makes me so happy. I make her extremely happy as well and everything about our relationship is fantastic. We never fight and we can talk rationally through any sort of disagreement. I love her with all my heart and I would never do anything that could hurt her. We really and truly gel and we consider each other life partners. 

We've got a good life together and we always have fun. We've lived together for three years and we talk a lot about our future together. We both want the same things and we're both excited to be with each other forever. But inside I have doubts about my ability to hold up my end.

My girlfriend is so organized and disciplined and is great at prioritizing and managing her time. On the other hand, I'm a fucking manchild. I'm smart and well-educated, but I'm also messy, disorganized, and my academic and professional careers have been a series of disasters and near-disasters. I've earned an advanced degree and progressed entirely by falling upward in the workforce to a job that pays very well. I was a straight-A honors student through middle school and high school and a decent athlete. Then college came around. My parents were always very involved in my life, approaching helicopter-status. My childhood was very structured and I always had a lot of guidance when it came to making decisions. I started off on my own alright, got A's and B's my first semester. Then everything went to shit. Over the next 3 years, I became super lazy, often skipping class, not studying, and missing or half-assing my assignments. I was a C and D student, failed and retook multiple classes and caused no small amount of heartache/financial difficulty to my family. I had multiple meetings with the academic dean and on several occasions was nearly expelled. I had to take summer classes (which I aced) and finished my 4 year degree in 5 years. I couldn't find a job in my field since a good GPA is needed to get in on the entry level) so I lived with my parents again for a time, studied full-time for certification exams (which I passed) and got an advanced degree online in my field from a state school. Did well in grad school, though the procrastination never went away entirely. These accomplishments enabled me to finally land a job in my field almost a year and a half after getting my bachelor's. But my career as a professional has been ugly. I'm a cancer in the workplace because I'm lazy. I constantly procrastinate and waste time, never getting things done. It takes me 2-3 times as long to complete my work compared to my peers. Work is always being shuffled off my plate as a result and I've been helpless to stop myself. Eventually it leads to ill will, bad performance reviews, and a trip to the unemployment line or me jumping ship because I know I'm on the verge of losing my job. I'm on my third job since graduating and I've only been in the workforce for 3 years (I've also been fired from an internship while in school). Been at the latest job for 2 months and already I've noticed the old behavior popping up. I'm worried that it's a pattern and I'm only at the beginning of a long and difficult career full of job switches and employment gaps that will lead to financial hardship and/or being forced out of my field entirely and be stuck working dead-end jobs until the day I die, unable to afford retirement. I worry about this constantly and I'm not normally worrisome by nature. I've noticed that the laziness/procrastination affects other aspects of my life as well. I've gained significant weight in the past few years because I never have the motivation to work out or to take the time and prepare healthy meals.

I have hidden these fears from my girlfriend. I've only told her that I have a habit of procrastination. I don't think that she's fully aware of the extent to which it's affected me. I want to get over this so I can be an equal partner in our relationship because she deserves a good boyfriend who not only loves her with every fiber of his being (which I do) but is also responsible and able to do his share (which I don't think I currently am, at least not all of the time). I want to be able to do my share so that we can live a long, comfortable life together. I don't want to be a burden.

I looked into professional help once because I read an article somewhere and it made me think that maybe I might have ADD or ADHD and/or depression. About a year ago I made an appointment for a consultation with a mental health specialist who gave me a three-month trial prescription, I can't recall the drug name. It wasn't Adderall or Ritalin and the doctor specifically mentioned that she didn't want to prescribe those two to me after one visit because they have methamphetamine in them. I took the drug regularly for 2 weeks and didn't notice any consistent results, so I only took it a few more times intermittently after that and gradually stopped. Only picked up the first refill. Still have two mostly-full pill bottles somewhere in our room. I never made a follow-up appointment.

I don't know what to do! I don't know what's wrong with me. I don't know if I have depression, or ADD, or ADHD, or ADD/ADHD which has caused problems in my life which have in turn caused me to be depressed, or if I just need to suck it up and somehow learn to suppress the urge to stagnate. I never had this problem as a kid and I don't know if it's something that developed as I grew older of if I've been this way all along and having a very structured upbringing helped me combat it has made me fucking helpless both in college and on my own as an adult.

Getting back to my girlfriend: she's the best thing that has ever happened to me and I want to be the man that she deserves to have. I don't want to create a situation that forces us apart. I love her so much and I need help. I know that our life together would be perfect if it weren't for my bad habit because I'm very much competent at my job and I would likely excel if I could just gain the motivation and determination to buckle down in my 9-to-5 job on a daily basis. Please point me in the right direction.

tl;dr: I don't want my girlfriend to have to be my parent, too."

I am a non-US citizen and I have registered for learners license test on 05-06-2016. I already know how to drive and have a local drivers license (not good enough for me to get exempt from the learners test). I have a few questions:

1. When am I allowed to take the road test following my learners test? 

2. Which driving school will be very convenient from Downtown Hartford? Also, is there any program for getting the 8 hours really fast (9-5 class or something)? Can I rent a car from the school to appear in the final road test?

3. If I take the learners on 05/06/2016 and then take the road test in two weeks (05/15/2016) and pass (knock on wood), when is the estimated time I'll receive my driver's license?

4. I will be moving to DC on June 1 for my summer internship and may/may not be back in 3 months. Do you suggest me to convert my license to DC?

Would they just predict me an AS grade (I got an A in GCSE so I guess I'll be predicted B) which I can put on my uni application form?

Also, I've found a few good unis (Brunel, Uni City London, Queen Mary, Reading) who don't require A2 Maths but I've also seen a few, what I can only assume would be much better going by rankings, unis like Bath and the other UCL who require an A in A-Level Maths and so on. That grade would have to be achieved, right? Like, you can't get a B in A-Level Maths and still apply? 

Another concern I've had is whether those unis would be more beneficial to get into - I'd most likely have to spend another year in 6th Form studying A2 Maths if AS was to go well for me and I'd worry about whether I could even get an A in the first place, but do Bath, UCL and KCL etc. have much better employment prospects in Computer Science and have much better chances of getting an internship in your 3rd year of uni? 

Thanks (also, apologies for any stupid questions, I'm a Year 12 who has made so many stupid choices this year that I'm always second guessing myself now and I want to be informed so that I don't screw up my university life)."

4c5h1u,490,2016-03-27,"Nice Guys fap a lot, and don't get laid. Here's why:",decisionmadetoday,NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/4c5h1u/nice_guys_fap_a_lot_and_dont_get_laid_heres_why/,"(Taken directly from Robert Glover's book ""No More Mr. Nice Guy"")

PART ONE

Nice Guys are dishonest. These men hide their mistakes, avoid conflict, say what they think people want to hear, and repress their feelings. These traits make Nice Guys fundamentally dishonest.

Nice Guys are secretive. Because they are so driven to seek approval, Nice Guys will hide anything that they believe might upset anyone. The Nice Guy motto is, ""If at first you don't succeed, hide the evidence.""

Nice Guys are compartmentalized. Nice Guys are adept at harmonizing contradictory pieces of information about themselves by separating them into individual compartments in their minds. Therefore, a married man can create his own definition of fidelity which allows him to deny that he had an affair with his secretary (or intern) because he never put his penis in her vagina.

Nice Guys are manipulative. Nice Guys tend to have a hard time making their needs a priority and have difficulty asking for what they want in clear and direct ways. This creates a sense of powerlessness. Therefore, they frequently resort to manipulation when trying to get their needs met.

Nice Guys are controlling. A major priority for Nice Guys is keeping their world smooth. This creates a constant need to try to control the people and things around them.

Nice Guys give to get . Though Nice Guys tend to be generous givers, their giving often has unconscious and unspoken strings attached. They want to be appreciated, they want some kind of reciprocation, they want someone to stop being angry at them, etc. Nice Guys often report feeling frustrated or resentful as a result of giving so much while seemingly getting so little in return.

PART TWO

Nice Guys are passive-aggressive. Nice Guys tend to express their frustration and resentment in indirect, roundabout, and not so nice ways. This includes being unavailable, forgetting, being late, not following through, not being able to get an erection, climaxing too quickly, and repeating the same annoying behaviors even when they have promised to never do them again.

Nice Guys are full of rage. Though Nice Guys frequently deny ever getting angry, a lifetime of frustration and resentment creates a pressure cooker of repressed rage deep inside these men. This rage tends to erupt at some of the most unexpected and seemingly inappropriate times.



 Nice Guys are addictive. Addictive behavior serves the purpose of relieving stress, altering moods, or medicating pain. Since Nice Guys tend to keep so much bottled up inside, it has to come out somewhere. One of the most common addictive behaviors for Nice Guys is sexual compulsiveness.

Nice Guys have difficulty setting boundaries. Many Nice Guys have a hard time saying ""no,"" ""stop,"" or ""I'm going to."" They often feel like helpless victims and see the other person as the cause of the problems they are experiencing.

Nice Guys are frequently isolated. Though Nice Guys desire to be liked and loved, their behaviors actually make it difficult for people to get very close to them.

Nice Guys are often attracted to people and situations that need fixing. This behavior is often the result of the Nice Guy's childhood conditioning, his need to look good, or his quest for approval. Unfortunately, this tendency pretty much guarantees that Nice Guys will spend most of their time putting out fires and managing crises.

Nice Guys frequently have problems in intimate relationships. Though Nice Guys often put tremendous emphasis on this part of their lives, their intimate relationships are frequently a source of struggle and frustration. For example:

●  Nice Guys are often terrible listeners because they are too busy trying to figure out how to defend themselves or fix the other person's problem.

●  Because of their fear of conflict, they are frequently dishonest and are rarely available to work all the way through a problem.

●  It is not unusual for Nice Guys to form relationships with partners whom they believe to be ""projects"" or ""diamonds in the rough."" When these projects don't polish up as expected, Nice Guys tend to blame their partner for standing in the way of their happiness.

Nice Guys have issues with sexuality. Though most Nice Guys deny having problems with sex, I have yet to meet one who isn't either dissatisfied with his sex life, has a sexual dysfunction (can't get or maintain an erection, climaxes too quickly), or has sexually acted out (through affairs, prostitution, pornography, compulsive masturbation, etc.).

Nice Guys are usually only relatively successful. The majority of Nice Guys I've met have been talented, intelligent, and moderately successful. Almost without exception though, they fail to live up to their full potential. "
4c5mri,48,2016-03-27,Finally got a job outside of teaching English!,nandemoii,japanlife,https://www.reddit.com/r/japanlife/comments/4c5mri/finally_got_a_job_outside_of_teaching_english/,"Hey all, I like so many of you first came to Japan as a college student, only to fall in love with language learning and come back the only way I knew how: via English teaching.

I worked at an international school and it quickly dawned on me that I would not learn Japanese at all in my all English bubble. I hated so very much using English for hours on end when all I wanted to do was become a translator, but I bit my lip and dealt with it because people were paying me to do a job.

Flash forward 3 long bitter years of doing what I hate but doing it without complaining and trying my best, I eventually left Japan because working 10 hours a day having to entertain kids out in the countryside with no friends/people my age was just too much for me. Still, I managed to pay off all my college debt, now I could focus on saving up for language school. To be honest, the real reason I left Japan is because I had a power harassment issue with my boss. I switched to a new private school in Gifu. All exaggerations aside I was working for a man who singled me out (I was his only foreign staff,) and had almost daily meetings with me for an hour or more only to remind me of how bad he thought I was as a teacher/person (parents and student's didn't think so) and how much he thought Japanese were smarter than Americans, etc. He repeatedly told me I was the worst teacher he ever had, and that I would not improve. Insinuated that I was an idiot. Which made me hate teaching English all the more. And people wonder why I hate it so much! (So don't take offense if you love it, I had a REALLY bad experience)

I went back home and saved every penny, Finally, a year and a half later, now nearly 6 years since I came back to Japan I came back as a Japanese language student, still my trials as an English teacher endured. I was at a new company and got a lot more respect though! School was only 3 and a half hours a day, and I had to support myself and save up for more school so it was almost 6 hours a day teaching. After a year and a half I had finally passed N2, but still felt no where near satisfied with my Japanese ability. I joined a specialty school focused on business Japanese, and reduced my hours teaching English. Flash forward a year and I am half way into my program and have been offered a paid internship at a translation company. Even if the internship doesn't lead to full term employment like I hope, I have enough saved up to live as a yakiniku staff or something until I graduate from school.

I have three weeks left as an English teacher then I will finally quit what I hate doing and finally begin the life I always wanted since I first came to Japan.

A few things I'd like to share with you:

1. If you love learning Japanese as much as I do it is possible to get out of teaching English. Just work hard at studying/saving!

2. If you love teaching English awesome! You have my respect, it takes a lot of character to continue to do that in this country, you guys are awesome and are doing something I could not continue doing.

3. keep it positive? I'm not looking down on anyone at all, but most of the down votes I get are from this sub. I'll admit, I do have this strong idea that we should only use Japanese in Japan, but I really think its just every fiber in my being rebelling against English teaching due to my bad experience. Still, I'm posting this to share my story and give others motivation, hard work pays off! I'm not doing it to rub this in anyone's face. The way I see it is, were all in this together. Words cannot describe the frustration I felt in Gifu working at that school, and I know there are others out there who are in similar situations so I want you all to know there is hope. After all, 継続は力じゃないですか？

TLDR: English teacher has a shitty ass experience teaching English, saves up his money and becomes a student and gets out of teaching!

I'm an online student and already work full time at a help desk position for $18 /hr so I'm trying to see a justification for taking a leave of absence for the summer (or just quitting) and getting an internship. 

My department is segregated from the other i.t. departments so its hard for me to learn from the actual sysadmins and the likes so getting a position I could gain more career knowledge in would be very beneficial. The downside would be the likely pay cut, but in the end it also might pay off by getting me enough experience for a Jr admin position by the end of the internship.

Has anyone been in a similar spot?"

I really do love both programs, and I'm a little torn as to which school to attend. A big factor for me is also location/culture - whether I want to stay close to home in sunny Texas or live farther away. I know Austin is filled with so many things to do, and I'm not so sure about Pittsburgh. My brother currently attends CMU for CS so I'm pretty comfortable and familiar with that department but I'm also attracted to the specialized plan for Turing Scholars (Attending a huge state school, but being a part of such a small program). I'm very familiar with both programs, but I'm still not sure about where I want to go. I was hoping I could get some opinions on what others think of these programs in comparison. Maybe some stuff about internship and job availability or just overall college experience.

Money not being a factor, how do you think the programs compare? "
4c6m5i,0,2016-03-27,"Can I afford the next year of college, or am I just panicking too much? Financial aid will likely not offer me anything. [Planning]",hardtoafford,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/4c6m5i/can_i_afford_the_next_year_of_college_or_am_i/,"Hello, first time poster here. I think this fits in the rules, but if anything isn't complying do let me know.

For the last few years of college I've been getting a good amount from financial aid and in scholarships, which is what largely allows me to afford college. Financial aid has been helpful as my family has never really had much money.

Recently my dad died, leaving us his life insurance policy. On the financial aid form it had me input how much my mother had in her bank accounts. Due to the life insurance policy, this is **largely** inflated from what we've had in previous years.

I'm afraid that this will massively screw up my financial aid. The only reason why we have the insurance money in the bank right now is because we're waiting for my fathers hospital bills to come in, which will wipe away all of the insurance money (cancer costs a lot of money).

This next year I will have to finally break down and buy a car. I will also be unable to work due to a built in internship in my major. I will be bleeding funds. My college is sending me to a place (where there is not public transportation, hence the need of a vehicle) where the cost of living is higher, I will be paying for tuition as well as a place to live and food. I am unable to work this summer due to the severity of my summer course load, and have my summer costs covered by scholarships and current money set aside specifically for summer.

I'm looking into groups from my hometown, and I know that I can possibly get a $2,000-$4,000 subsidized loan, and that I should be getting another $5,000 in scholarships.

**Important points**

* I cannot work this summer due to classes
* I am unable to work during the Fall and Spring, unless I have a death wish. (40hrs/week at unpaid internship site, ~20hrs/week course-load work)
* I will likely not get much/anything from financial aid
* I need to buy a car, as there is no public transportation, and there are no places to live close to internship site (so no walking/biking)
* We're currently having to wait on the IRS due to someone trying to file taxes as my mom and dad.

**Costs (from Fall semester to Spring):**

* Tuition: ~$4,500
* Books: ~$500-$900
* Rent in new town (per month): ~$550-900, for total amount of time spent there: $4,950-$8,100
* Food estimate (per month): ~$100-$250, total amount of time: ~$900-$2,250
* Car cost of purchase(budget): ~$2,000-$8,000
* Car cost of gas (total time with minimal driving): ~$350-$450
* Other necessities estimate (if kept to a minimum): ~$600

**Total: ~$13,800-$24,800**

**Amounts payable:**

* Possible loan: ~$2,000-$4,000
* Scholarships: $5,000
* What I can put down from emergency fund: $5,000
* Selling my plasma twice/week @$30/donation (factoring in having to skip a few for possible sickness/time restraints): ~$1,100-$1,800

**Total without loan: ~$11,100-$11,800**

**Total with loan: ~$13,100-$15,800**

I can see that this could work without financial aid so long as I get the loan and can magically find a lower costing car (that works and won't fall apart), not injure myself/get into any accidents/need any dental care, and one of the lower costing apartments in the town I am going. But in the case that I must go to the higher ends of costs, I need to plan. Going into debt (massive amounts) and being unable to afford things is one of my greatest fears due to growing up in a poor household.

**Questions:**

Is it likely I can get financial aid, even though the bank says we've got a lot of money?

What ways can I cut costs?

In the case of emergency, what am I going to do?

Where are places that I can get loans? (please indicate subsidized and un-subsidized)"

However, I've become stuck choosing between 3 choices: 

Western Washington University (WWU)- mid sized liberal arts call eve with a good undergrad cs program which many compare to University of Washington's. 

Oregon State University (OSU)- A larger public university which seems to have a decent CS program as well as many opportunities for internships and work study. 

Purdue University- Very well known for computer science as well as having tons of opportunities for internships. 

This choice is really bothering me because I can see a lot of benefits to all of these universities. Western is cheap (since its in state for me) and also has a good undergrad program but isn't nearly as recognizable as the other universities. Oregon State gives me a lot of opportunities to do work study as well as get internships but I don't know how good their program is. Finally, Purdue is a bit of a special case because I didn't get into the CS program there but was offered the opportunity to apply to any other major (I chose IT with the intention to transfer). I'd go there if I thought it would work out but obviously I can't predict the future and have no idea if I'll be able to transfer into the cs program. 

Cost won't be a huge issue in the decision but I obviously don't want to waste my parent's money. If anyone has any advice on what I should do it would be greatly appreciated. 

Just as a side note these are the only 3 choices I have and UW is not on the board because I got turned down from there.

Bad news is I have a 2.8 gpa, however I do not want to leave Dallas, Texas. All of my family is here, all of my connections with attorneys are here. I have offers for internships, introductions, potential jobs, and rec letters with attorneys/judges I know in the Dallas area (I started networking early) so there is little incentive for me to leave.

At this point my goal is to score higher on the third LSAT and if I get in the range I want then I figured I would get some money at SMU or a dream shot for UT. I am planning to throw a few applications to out of state schools that are higher that SMU and a few lower ranked Texas schools to use for scholarship negotiation with SMU.

I hope you can help me out on this once with some advice, as I've been thinking about it for almost a week now. 

I've been offered an internship abroad in Singapore for 6 months with a pay of roughly 1000 Singapore Dollars. 

I've been thinking whether its actually worth it to do that internship. Here are some facts:

1. I'm literally done with my master studies, no more exams, just thesis left
2. I've already been a semester abroad in China
3. I know the pay is way too little to live off. I'm assume that this whole internship will cost me (2000 Cost of living - 1000 income)* 6 months + flight.
4. I'd even have to pay back / pass on about US$ 2000 of government support from my country (as this internship is a voluntary internship and 'unncessarily delays my graduation')
5. I've already been to Singapore for travel
6. 6 months is a really long time for an internship...
7. I already did an internship in my country in my field.

But on the other hand

1. The company I'd be interning at is quite reputable
2. The internship sounds interesting
3. I love traveling and meeting new people.
4. I'm still young (25)


Could you help me out with this one?

I fully recognize the fact that I probably didn't make the best of my freshman year and only now I'm really trying to crack down and study (trying to maintain at least a 3.0 for this first year). 

Now more than ever, I want to make myself stand out as a student. Having left high school fairly recently, I am making a lot of the same mistakes I did there (not studying efficiently, not joining clubs, etc.), here. 

My question is, for next year as a student on a Pre-Med track (or even during the summer) what can I start doing to really better myself? (internships, volunteer work, shadowing, grades, organizations, clubs, pretty much anything that I could do to be a more well-rounded student).

I know that probably seems very vague and pretty easy to figure out, but I want to hear what others who have or currently share the same track as me have to say. I guess I just came to the realization now that I really want to be the best I can, because I don't want to be in any way similar to the person I was in high school (mainly academic at this point). I really struggle to find the motivation to study, but I know I need to do it and I really want to better myself now, starting today, so I can potentially change my life.

In all 4 of my engagements I got mainly positive reviews with little to no criticism from only one senior on one engagement (but even with those points of criticism my senior still documented the subsequent improvement in my work quality so it was fine)

But when I did my end review with the lead recruiter she said ""although you had gotten overall positive reviews in regards to your understanding, attitude, etc youve gotten some comments of particular concern on an engagement""

THESE comments (which were more directed at my professionalism and quite honestly, completely false) were not in MY corresponding engagement review that I got from this senior so naturally I was shocked....

The lead recruiter was shocked that I didn't understand as well because as she put it ""if you read your engagement review you should've saw these comments""

To paraphrase the comments were expressed as ""while this intern does X positive things, we're concerned with him leaving work early, not finishing work on time, etc""

COMPLETE LIES!!! And I showed the lead recruiter after I got to go through my files and pull up my engagement review that there was nothing in my review NEAR the critiques she relayed to me and her response was ""uhm uhm uhm, well just take it into consideration moving forward""

Now I start full time in the fall (had my FT slot b4 I started my internship) and I'm not sure whether I'm over worrying and I'm not sure how to move forward with regards to this... It doesn't seem to make or break me but at the same time the criticism wasn't true and the senior who supposedly expressed this NEVER expressed this to me verbally or on paper... 

In fact, all he expressed to me during this engagement was that I was doing fine... Just handshakes and fucking smiles...

Sorry for the long read but for the ppl with experience in this industry, is there any advice you can give on how to move forward going into my full time position and how to even make sense of all this?

So just some background: I'm a senior in HS, pre-everything, and only out to my mom. I've known that I'm trans for a few years, though I've experienced gender dysphoria since I was in elementary school (I just didn't have a name for it then). Anyway, I've kind of always been okay with the fact that I'm trans, and up until recently I've been getting by by telling myself that one day I'll transition and it will all be a-okay. But in the past six or so months the dysphoria has become almost unbearable. I mean, I've always had it, but I've also always been able to deal with it one way or another (I am a borderline Aspie, so I can throw myself 110% into a project for twelve hours straight without thinking about much else.) In the past my experience with dysphoria has been this: I avoid looking down at myself (especially in the shower), I wear a sports bra and hunch my shoulders to hide my (thankfully small) breasts, I try to deepen my voice when I speak, etc. The worst part was about a year ago where I tried to starve myself to get rid of my curves, and I'm still recovering from that, but I could always deal, you know? 

But then in September, I started to compare myself to the cis guys around me and I realized something I had never really thought about before: I'm short. At 5' 5.5"", there is no way I will ever be as tall as the average cis man. This may sound trivial compared to my previous dysphoria problems, but this realization opened up a huge can of insecurities for me. My dysphoria has increased ten-fold, and I am now acutely aware of all of my shortcomings that will haunt me even post-transition: my small size (I only weight ~110 lbs after my eating disorder), my feminine bone structure (even my cis 5' 11"" dad has girly hands and shoulders), my height. I seriously can't go five minutes without thinking about the fact that, even if I do decide to transition, and I'm pretty sure I will, I will never be the man I would be if I had been born cis. I will never be who I feel I am inside. I know how dramatic and whiny that sounds, but it's become this terrible spiral of self-hate. I can't walk down a street without thinking about how short I am. For the past two weeks, I've cried a minimum of twice a day. I'm worried I might be developing some form of depression as a result.

I've talked to my mom about all of this, and she has been extremely supportive and understanding, but I can tell that she doesn't /get it/. I don't think she believes I'm really trans, but that's not a big deal because I have a feeling she'll come around fairly easily once she hears a professional back me up. We've set up an appointment with a psychologist, but I already know what the outcome will be: I am transgender. I do want to transition. I'm just afraid that when I do, I will still hate myself. 

And I fear transition itself. I fear that stage between coming out and starting T. I know this sounds shallow, but I don't want people to have to guess what gender I am. I don't want to have to correct people's pronouns. I'm afraid that even after T I won't pass or that I will look like a guy years younger than I actually am. 

I know how blessed I am to have a supportive parent. I know things could be worse in terms of my size. I know I am privileged to be white and from a middle-class family, and to be bound for a top(ish) college. I even have a potential internship lined up at my local Morgan Stanley branch--although this internship is in many ways conditional on me being ""female"" (I met my connection through my mom's charity organization, which is basically run by women for women) which adds a whole other layer of complication and uncertainty to the situation. 

In summary, I'm feeling scared, pessimistic, and uncertain for my future. I just want to be happy with who I am, but I'm not sure if I will be even after I transition. Thanks for reading. I know I probably sound like a whiny SOB, but I just want to share what I'm going through with people who have had similar experiences. "

- I am hoping/planning on becoming a front end developer, then work my way to UX designer after gaining sufficient experience. With that being said about my future goals, the **real question** is: will it honestly make a difference if I continue to pursue ITI or CS? 

-- Keep in mind I have already committed to side objectives for the remaining 2 years of undergrad aside from school work &amp; classes:

* learn new languages &amp; master current ones
* read books about web design, languages, ux design &amp; whatever else comes across my path
* side projects: personal website &amp; create an app (idk yet) &amp; few others yet to think of.

-- IMO, from personal experience and friends, CS is much more difficult than ITI. I know any major is not easy and you must put in the hard work, blah blah blah. But lets be realistic here, for one who just learned HTML/CSS this year unlike students who have been programming for years, majoring in CS would be much more difficult for me and spike up the risk of graduating with a lower GPA. From what I heard, the quite a handful of ITI classes are mostly fluffed. Of course there are difficult classes, but an okay amount of them are not nearly as serious as upper-level CS courses and even some CS requisites. It may sound like I’m scared or lazy to confront the numerous amount of challenges CS will bring, but at the end of the day if I am able to go down the ITI path and still end up at the career I want, why would I risk graduating with a low GPA? Why would I put myself through the stress and countless hours of workload when I had the chance to use that time to work on myself, side projects and skills that’ll allow me to demonstrate to future internships &amp; employers that I managed to maintain a 3.4 GPA (example only) and still indeed managed to find the time to work on projects that indicate I am actually able to apply lessons learned in college, to the real world. After all, aren't employers looking for future employees with a degree and real world experience behind that degree?

Directionless after high school, I chose to go to a state school and major in I.T. This degree was pretty ""soft"" as far as far as technical ability is concerned. It was a type of degree that made you okay at everything but a master of none. I noticed this after my sophomore year was up but decided I should stick through it as I could gain experience at an entry level job and I would most likely be better off with a four year degree than without one. And enjoyed working with computers. To add to this my ability to do complex Math is sub par, so computer science seamed like a bad choice. This major seamed like my best option. 

During the summer I got a web development/design job for a local company. At the tail end of that summer I developed a severe anxiety/depression issue as I started my senior year. I battled through my final courses while getting my mental health under control. I then graduated. Knowing I need more experience I started looking for jobs and of course, things haven't been working out. I've had a few interviews for basic networking, working with databases (Using SQL server and T-SQL). I'm glad I got the interviews but I have been coming up short. I'm mediocre and it shows. 

I would like to point out that I don't think I will really be happy in the I.T. field for the long haul, I chose it because I thought I could make good living and I like working with computers. I'm a creative person, I love writing, philosophy, working with my hands, cars, comedy. I'm good with people, no one seams to hate me. I have good ideas floating around my mind all day, but I can't seam to get any of them in motion. Mostly because of money issues.

I've been working on bettering myself and my anxiety/depression is in a much better place. However, Im almost 23 and I'm watching my life turn upside down. I'm tormented everyday that I'll be at a shitty job forever, and I do nothing besides apply for entry level jobs that I probably cant get. I did well in school and loved learning and I miss it. I have tons of hobbys and ideas for things but they lead to nothing. I need to be making a lot more money than I am now (25k). 

My questions are as follows...

I can work on getting my ccna and get into networking. This would be a hard skill that businesses want. Hopefully I can get an internship when i do this and have an in with a company. 

I can go back to school for business, get further in debt and be out by 25, and be more employable. 

I can really polish my resume maybe get into some database work, gain experience, move up from there and maybe go to school on the side. 

Scrap the whole thing an just say IT work isn't for me. Go into a trade and better myself as I go. 

I realize I'm right where I should be in life. No where. I let life happen to me and it's my fault, no one elses. I'm looking for ideas, clues, maybe personal experiences. I'm ready to grab life by the horns and work my ass of. I'm just not sure what to do. 


sorry for the long post.

I've been a long time lurker and right off the bat, I just wanted to say thank you for being such a great resource. 

About me:
* 2.9 GPA at a non-target state school. 
* Luckily I got 2 internships and from those experiences, my biggest takeaway in terms of technical skills was learning SQL, and Java.
* I have a couple of projects on my resume but nothing impressive.

My situation:
I have the option of graduating this May or delaying my graduation to Fall 2016. I've been applying to full-time positions but haven't received the kind of traction/results I wanted. Although I do have offers from both companies that I interned at, I rejected the first because:
* The amount of technical debt and bad practices they're dealing with is crippling the organization IMO.
* High turnover (Example: They've been trying to hire a senior developer to be the ""technical voice"" in the organization and help with their tech debt has been filled 3 different times in 1 year. Also, my manager when I was intern there who was an exceptional guy has left as well.)
* When I was an intern there, they didn't let me get involved with other teams/projects, and when I spoke to them about the full-time offer, it seems the same will occur. 

Now as for the offer from the second company I interned at, I'm still holding off since I'm still interviewing with other companies. Although I think I will learn a lot and grow well working for this second company, I was hoping to get better offers. So, I was thinking if I give myself more time to get ready for tech interviews, and build more complex projects that I've been wanting to work on, I'll get more and better offers. So far I feel like my job hunt has been a failure and the offer I'll end up accepting is an offer I got just because I interned at that company already. Should I delay my graduation or is that just being greedy?"
4c7o54,2,2016-03-27,Mom booking stay for her son.,dusk2k2,AirBnB,https://www.reddit.com/r/AirBnB/comments/4c7o54/mom_booking_stay_for_her_son/,"I had a mom book a stay for her son, who needs a place to stay for part of the summer due to an internship.  I looked up the guest and don't really have too many concerns.  Goes to a good school, seems to come from a good family, and overall, seems like a nice kid.

My question is, are there any potential issues for having the mother of the guest book the stay, rather than the actual guest?  In other words, the mom booked the stay using her account, but her son (who is in college) is the actual guest.  

Looking at the terms of service, I see the term ""Responsible Guest"" means ""the Guest who booked your Covered Accommodation for the period during which you incurred the Covered Losses for which you request payment under these Airbnb Host Guarantee Terms."" 

""Covered losses"" means ""direct physical loss or physical damage incurred by a Host to Covered Property of such Host located at a Covered Accommodation caused by the Responsible Guest or an Invitee of the Responsible Guest while staying at such Covered Accommodation booked by such Responsible Guest through the Services. Covered Losses do not include any losses or damage described under Excluded Losses below.""

My interpretation would have the son who is staying in our home be considered an ""invitee"" of the responsible guest, but just wondering if others see it differently.""

UPDATE: Thanks everyone for the additional info.  It looks like third party bookings are not permitted.  Another follow up question is, I don't have a particularly bad feeling about this guest, and since I live in the home, I'm not too fearful of other issues like wild parties, etc (kid goes to Ivy league school, engineering major, otherwise seems like a classy kid).  It looks like if I accept this booking however, I'm not getting any help from AirBnb and could potentially be banned.  The question is, with a long term tenant, is there any use in simply treating this like a regular rental situation.  (Have guest sign a two month lease, any issues arise, I'm forced to file suit in state court, etc?)."

The thing is what I really like about computer science is creating ,codes , ""worlds "", softwares , where  I let my creativity and my intelligence free (but I always keep the objective in mind ) ,where I make the rules and understands whats going on and where I am able to add,change , evoluate my creations .

I know for sure than coding is my thing , I really love it and I can do it for the rest of my life as a job . 

But ....but networking seems really cool as well and unfortuantely so far the few classes I had about it were lame classes but I don't want to misjudge it  I know it could be interresting .

It's just that I don't want to focus my self and my career on coding and then have regrets like ""Oh I wonder what it would have been if  Iwas into networks "" . 

Both of the interships are paid the same ,with the same amounts of hours per week , that's not what interrest me anyways . The point of this intership is my self-developpement .


Edit : I forgot to tell , my prime factors are money , evolution (in terms of career/jobs)  and the job itself (I would prefer working on stuff that interrest me ) . Which brings me a question, won't Big Data/networking jobs pay more (if they don't already ) than coding jobs in the next 5-20 years?


After that 2 year undergraduate degree I plan on doing  a master Degree of Software engineer and I will specialised my self depending the outcome of the internship.

In 2015, Carson is claimed as a dependent on his parent's tax return. His parents' ordinary income marginal tax rate is 28 percent. Carson's parents provided most of his support.

Carson is 23 years old at year-end. He is a full-time student and earned $12,200 from his summer internship and part-time job. He also received $4,200 of qualified dividend income. What is his tax liability? 

What I did was (12200 + 4200) = 16400

Then subtract the standard deduction (16400 - 6300) = 10100

Since his taxable income is 10100, I take the 4200 and subtract 2100. This gives me 2100 which is the excess that will be taxed at his parent's preferential tax rate (15%) = 315

Since the child's tax rate is 15%, that would mean he wouldn't pay any taxes on the dividends since his preferential rate is 0%. 

This just leaves his earned income of 12200, and using the tax schedules, would come out to 1368.75.

Thus his tax liability is (1368.75 + 315). I figure this isn't right so I wanna see what I am doing wrong. "

I did 3 internships when I was in school, but I have a hard time finding a full time position. 1.5 years ago, I accept a part time, on call position in an analytical laboratory. I was promised that it would eventually turn into a full time position after 6 months, but due to budgetary reason they were unable to offer me a full time position. I was allowed to continue my part time position while I continue to look for a full time work elsewhere. Since then, I had several interviews, but nothing has come to fruition. 

I’m not sure if it matters, but I live in the west coast in Canada. There doesn’t seem like a lot of openings around where I live. I have been scouring the net for job positions. Maybe there is a secret network for scientists, but I don’t see openings that much for laboratory positions. I am open to relocating for work, but not sure how to apply for work outside my province. 

Based on my experiences, I think I would be very suitable in an analytical laboratory and a research technician. I have very hands on experience in sample preparation and instrumentation usage ( which may help or hurt my chance in analytical labs?) and research in analytical and organometallic chemistry. No papers published thought =_=

It’s really tiring and I am debating whether I should continue pursuing a career with a BSc or return to school. From what I gather, it doesn’t seem worth it unless I do a pHD if I decided to pursue graduate studies in chemistry and though I did a undergraduate thesis, I don’t think I am cut out for that. If I do return to school, it would be to obtain a 2nd bachelor in another field (was thinking either computer science or chemical engineering) or pursue an advance degree in a complementary field. It would be great help if someone can offer some advice what kind of complementary degree would go along great with a BSc. I’m thinking computer science could be useful as a degree by itself and incase I want to purse in a career in instrumentation and computational chemistry.

I'm graduating college in 2 months and will be taking home $90k/yr after taxes (Edit: This total compensation, including stocks, and in California). Fortunately, I can pay off my student loans with my signing bonus and prior internship savings, so I will graduate with no debt and a small emergency fund. My anticipated annual expenses are:

* $24k rent (high cost of living area)
* $12k food/living expenses (hopefully less, but lets be conservative for the sake of discussion)
* $5.5k Roth IRA
* $8k 401k for maximum employer match (less than 8k since 401k contributions are tax-deferred, right?)
* $10k Family

I come from a low income family and would like to give some of my income back to my parents. I would like to spend up to $10k/year on this - either for rent or family vacations since my family rarely take vacations. (Is it financially irresponsible to allocate so much money for vacations?)

This will leave me with $30.5k/yr, and hopefully a bit more if I can reduce my rent and living expenses. What should I do with the remainder of my income? Two things that come to mind are contributing up to $18k to my 401k or starting a taxable account on Vanguard, but I'm very open to hearing your suggestions.

-- Keep in mind I have already committed to side objectives for the remaining 2 years of undergrad aside from school work &amp; classes:

* learn new languages (Java, ruby, sql, etc.) &amp; master current ones (HTML/CSS)
* read books about web design, languages, ux design &amp; whatever else comes across my path
* side projects: personal website &amp; create an app (idk yet) &amp; few others yet to think of.

-- IMO, from personal experience and friends, CS is much more difficult than ITI. I know any major is not easy and you must put in the hard work, blah blah blah. But lets be realistic here, for one who just learned HTML/CSS this year unlike students who have been programming for years, majoring in CS would be much more difficult for me and spike up the risk of graduating with a lower GPA. From what I heard, quite a handful of ITI classes are mostly fluffed. Of course there are difficult classes, but an okay amount of them are not nearly as serious as upper-level CS courses and even some CS requisites. It may sound like I’m scared or lazy to confront the numerous amount of challenges CS will bring, but at the end of the day if I am able to go down the ITI path and still end up at this career I want, why would I risk graduating with a low GPA? Why would I put myself through the stress and countless hours of workload when I had the chance to use that time to work on myself, side projects and skills that’ll allow me to demonstrate to future internships &amp; employers that I managed to maintain a 3.4 GPA (example only) and still indeed managed to find the time to work on projects that indicate I am actually able to apply lessons learned in college, to the real world. After all, aren't employers looking for future employees with a degree and real world experience behind that degree?

4c8dpc,2,2016-03-27,F4A - Dark Journey To Fame,Undisclosed_Desires7,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/4c8dpc/f4a_dark_journey_to_fame/,"Katheyn or what she preferred to be called Katy was the new intern at the company. A big industry in downtown Los Angeles that dealt with many movie, tv and rock stars. Basically, offering rich and famous people services to handle their careers while also giving fresh faced wannabes the opportunities.

Katy was one of them, a young girl that wasn't even 21 yet dreams of making it in music, becoming a world known star. She had tried numerous times and had many meetings with companies to try and get her talent across to no avail. Eventually the money she saved up from her part time job while she was in school dried up and she had to pick up a job in L.A she she thought why not a business in a similar field to her dreams.

Katy remembered when she walked into the office for the first time, people couldn't believe what she looked like and you think they would be accustomed to seeing gorgeous people all the time. She had worn a pair of red 6 inch stilettos and a tiny pencil skirt that would of been the shortest a woman could wear. Thigh high stockings that hugged tight to her legs that were held up by clasps attached to a garter belt. The tight blouse she wore strained her rather biggest assets, her double DD breasts that were pushed up in her black bra. They bounced around as she worked around the office, attracting the attention of many guys. The man Katy worked for was always delighted to see her, his eyes filling up with lust as he looked her body over before leading her into his office and shutting the door.

Katy regularly wore clothes that brung her attention, it was always another pair of 6 inch heels, short skirts and stockings accompanied by a tight low cut blouse. Guys around the office started to talk about Katy, about how they would love to ram her as she bent over their desk. Many guys often tried to get with her but she always refused. Soon Katy developed a reputation for being a strong feminist supporter. She thought that all men were pigs for treating women as nothing more than a pair of tits and ass with a pretty face. That's how Katy felt in meetings, guys would get sidetracked around her and just stare at her boobs or ass. They wouldn't take her seriously and thought that she was just a slut. She thought that guys only chatted to her because they wanted to fuck her and weren't even calling her by name around the office, she overheard them calling her by her big tits.

Though what Katy did, didn't always match up with what she said. She would scold men for staring at her body when she wore revealing clothing everyday. She would also find every excuse to bend over to give everyone a good look at her, regularly dropping things on the ground. She would get angry at guys all the time for flirting with her as they obviously wanted to fuck her but she would flirt with guys all the time brushing her hand near their groin and giving them a sexy, sultry look as she walked away.

One day the CEO came to the office and went to a meeting room with about 30 other businessmen. They were all aged between 50-80 years old. After about an hour, Katy was called into the meeting room. Jason, a fellow coworker had a desk right in front of the room, he watched her strut in their, clad in her tight clothes. She closed the door behind her. It must of been 4 hours until the doors opened again, with the old guys walking out with satisfied looks on their faces. They talked about how great that was and how they must do it again soon. Out Katy stepped as they finally all left. Her hair was disheveled while she was fixing her rumpled blouse and rolling down her skirt while carrying her stilettos. As she walked she pulled out a curly hair from her mouth and wiped away a bit of stickiness from her lips. Going to her desk and continuing work like nothing happened.

------------------

I want this role play to involve scenarios following the womens career such as trying to break into the industry (a lot of time spent as the secretary), dealing with the sudden fame, hook ups with celebrities, sex tapes, paparazzi, fans, relationships, becoming addicted to drugs and alcohol and turning into a nymphomaniac.

Or it could just be an office type rp.

I want to play the males the celeb will encounter. I want someone to play the main lead which will be the young female starlet. I would love for the young starlet to be Katy Perry or Kylie Jenner but I like a lot of other celebs as well such as Taylor Swift, Iggy Azalea, Ariana Grande, Scarlett Johansson and Jessica Alba.

I prefer to roleplay on Google Docs and use messengers to chat and set things up such as K , skype, yahoo msger and google chat/hangouts. Want this to be a long term rp. If you are interested and wish to talk about this further send me a message. Please make your message to me detailed and include any character/ scenario ideas, which celebrities you like and what platforms you use.

P.S I'm also looking to do a Game Of Thrones, The Walking Dead and a Witcher rp so check my post history for those ideas if they interest you.

But I still fail my tests, I tucked up staffing people and looked like an ass in front of all my employees and bosses.  No matter how hard I try I'm just not good enough.
And to top it all off I've never been on a second date.  Apparently I've never been good enough on the first to be worthy of the second.  3 of the last girls I had dates with had a boyfriend less than 3 weeks after I went out with them.

I just can't handle it anymore.  I want to be happy so that I can make other people happy but it physically hurts to get through the day anymore.  I hate myself more and more everyday and now I know that I'll probably never be the person me or my family want me to be.  I'm lost and just don't know what to do anymore.  "

So it could be R, SAS, SQL, etc. Nothing specific.

They did, however, mention doing data analysis and something about databases. And also doing a presentation to a senior leader at the end. So my best guess right now is to review/up my skills/learn the basics of at least Excel, VBA &amp; Macros, PowerPoint, and SAS. I'll have a full month after finals before the internship begins.

This summer, I'll be interning and making (what I consider to be) some decent money. I was looking for some advice on how best to handle it.

The Internship Breakdown (all pre tax):

 - $3,475 paid biweekly for 11.5 weeks
 - $10,000 signing bonus paid within 1 month of joining
 - $3,000 stipend for housing

The internship is based in the Bay Area, so I do expect housing to at the very least consume all of the $3k, if not more.

My current position:

 - 5 credit cards with a total of $4,400 CL, all paid in full every month, no debt
 - Yearly college expenditure amounting to $60k including housing, tuition, food, etc. I am an international student. My parents help me pay for college, so I thus far have not had to take any loans.
 - Additional expenditure of +/- $2,000 on flights to go home over long breaks.
 -  I make about $2,500 (with some state and fed tax witheld already) from on-campus work during each of my semesters over and above the internship during the summer.
 - No auto insurance payments, but I do plan on buying a car once I reach the Bay Area.
 - No health insurance payments (I'm covered under my parents' plan)
 - No student loans as of now.
 - About $1,000 in savings.

I would ideally like to save as much of this money as possible, while also investing in a reliable car that I can use for the remainder of my college years at the very least. I've been told Hondas and Toyotas are relatively reliable and cheaper to maintain than European cars, and am leaning towards a Civic.

Some questions:

 1. What would be the best way to manage my income? I feel like I'm in a fairly good place to start, with no debt, though my savings are somewhat minimal at the moment.
 2. Should I buy a car through financing, or pay in cash outright? My credit score is decent (~720 on Credit Karma), but the length is limited as I only came to this country last August.
 3. Should I be doing something additional to all this to maximise my savings?
 4. Should I be investing the money I get, or just stick it in a savings account? I am not eligible for my company's Roth IRA or 401k due to being &lt;21 + international."

I got to see his cock in his boxers and heard &amp; saw him jerk off. 

Some guys on here suggested we get drunk and see what happened …soooo ... last night I thought I’d give it a shot. Why wait, right? I was feeling better from my cold, I was drinking one of those hot water/whisky/lemon juice deals. The two of us were just hanging out so I said he should have some whisky too. It was casual, just catching up, getting buzzed. 

I said he should try on a shirt of mine for his interviews, it’s tailored and would show off his V better. Since he’s done all that work in the gym might as well show it off some, right? He said ok, and tried on  the shirt. It fits me good but on him it looks fucking amazing. I adjusted it on him and was feeling his shoulders, complimenting him on it but keeping it pretty jokey. He was deflecting it all but I could tell he was liking the attention. 

I said the real test is how it looks with the suit pants, so he put those on. I just went ahead and started tucking it in for him, kind of acting like he was at a suit fitting or something. Pretty much it was just an excuse to shove my hands down his pants. ;) 

I kept making a joke out of it, like sort of grabbing his ass when I was tucking it in back. Then when I was tucking it in the front I kind of accidentally on purpose got a handful of cock. He jumped a little and I just said, oh wow. Because it definitely felt incredible.

Some more compliments on how the shirt looked on him, I said he could have it. He didn’t want to take it, because it’s an expensive shirt. I said he could pay me back if he lands a job.

He got back in his t shirt and boxers and we drank some more and talked about random shit. Then he went to the bathroom and when he came back he was stretching before he sat back down. I just wanted to go for it and said, yeah you definitely have gotten bigger, that’s for sure.

He said something about his workout routine and I said, no I didn’t mean THAT, I meant (and kind of flicked the front of his boxers.)

He turned really red. I said maybe all that testosterone was giving you a boost or something because, damn.

He said he always remembered me being bigger. I said well that was a while ago and I guess you’ve done some growing. He was laughing kind of a nervous laugh like, I can’t believe we’re talking about my dick. He said, yeah he had a growth spurt there too.

One thing about Alex is he’s laid back but is still kind of stubborn and competitive, at least he always was with me. I guess it comes from being the younger brother and always feeling compared to your older bro.

I was drunk enough to not give a shit so I said, so you’re saying you’re bigger than me now? He had that nervous laugh again but said, yeah I guess. 

I just pulled my sweat pants down and showed him my dick. I was getting hard but it was still soft enough to pretend like I wasn’t really fucking turned on.

He laughed and said OK and stood up and pulled down his boxers. He is definitely a shower. He’s gotten thick. I flicked it and said, damn bro. Nice.

He was pulling up his boxers and I said but I’m a grower so…

He just sat back down with his boxers around his ankles. I stopped concentrating on keeping my dick from getting hard and I got hard in about three seconds.

Then his dick like lifted up off his leg and fuck, he is a shower AND a grower. He was sort of turning red and he was breathing kind of hard like he was nervous. I said FUCK. 

Again, too drunk to give a shit so I just reached out to feel it. It’s really fucking thick. I only just barely touched it, to see how thick it was, and he jumped like he got an electric shock. He was biting his lip and then he just started cumming, it was sort of pouring out. Lots of it.

He was apologizing right away, saying its been a long time since he came (uh I heard you jerking off last night so can’t use that excuse! I didn’t say that though.) There was a lot of cum on the couch, he started trying to mop it up. I played it like a big joke, said there’s already a ton of cum on that couch already. I got it cleaned up and told him don’t worry about it.

The minute I got in bed I was jerking like crazy and came twice in a row. I wouldve maybe jacked in front of him but don’t think he was as horny once he came like that.

I saw him get dressed in the morning and it didn’t seem like he was acting any different. He was going back and forth in his towel, and was naked a couple times walking in and out of the bathroom.

Should be a really fucking interesting week while he’s here.

I'm coming out of my sophomore year of college and have landed an internship at a software company for the summer. Some of my duties will be running errands around the downtown area (having ""biking"" as a hobby was actually a plus, interestingly enough).
The office dress code is urban and semi-casual (they don't like flip flops/band shirts/wrinkled old shirts, but nice sneakers/shorts/clean t-shirts/etc. are OK).
I'm going to be outside enough that wearing short-sleeve shirts (polos/tees/button downs) and shorts will become a necessity in the July/August. 

My legs are fine in shorts because of my biking/running habits. My arms are a different story.

I've always stayed away from short-sleeve button downs (SSBDs) because my arms are long and mostly thin, and, in my experience, SSBDs often have sleeves with extra room because the fabric does not stretch to fit like it can on a polo.


Do you have any suggestions or know of any places that sell slim-fitting SSBDs where the sleeves are not quite so big? 
Patterns are not really an issue - as long as they don't look like they were found in a beach thrift store. :)
Would tailoring the sleeves on SSBDs be an option? I've never heard of anyone doing that before.

I'm going to be trying to hit the gym more once this semester is over, but I still don't put on mass very easily. I think I'd still need to stick with slimmer sleeves on shirts.

I'll go over my education, work experience and what I do day-to-day.

Education
I graduated May 2013  from Texas Tech with a Geosciences B.S., a 2.9 overall GPA and a 3.1 major GPA. I was pretty involved in the Geo-clubs on campus and study sessions, but really just an average student. I did my senior research in the Rocky Mountains and field camp in Big Bend NP. I had a paid internship in Houston one summer with a mid major company where I correlated logs and created isopachs. 

Professional Experience
Coming out of college I was pretty tired of school and wanted to make all that cash I heard geologists were supposed to make... but couldn't get a job. The company I interned with was getting bought out and the only thing I could find was surveying for an HDD pipeline company in DFW. They basically drill holes under roads, highways, railroads, rivers and lakes then pull the pipe through (pipe sizes ranged from 4"" to 4'). Working there I was able to use GIS skills I learned in school and I advised the company what bits to use based on what we were drilling through, which was almost anything you can think of, soft sands near the coast, granite intrusions in Oklahoma and Diorite in North Carolina. All in all I learned a lot, made some decent money but really wanted to get into Exploration sooner rather then later. 

While I was surveying I was applying for any geology job I could for about a year until I got a hit with a Geosteering company down in Houston. When I came on as a trainee in December 14' there were 8 of us geosteering at a command center in an office, each monitoring 1-3 wells. Since then oil prices fell off a cliff and you know the rest... Now we're down to one day guy (me) and one night guy. We moved out of the office a few months ago and took a pay cut to keep the company operating. 

Day to Day of what I do
There is a bit of set up at the beginning of the well were I input the location, contact list, offset log etc. into our program. After that its hurry up and wait.
There are two major sections of a horizontal well, the curve and the lateral. In the curve the rig will drill 30' increasing their inclination a bit each time and send me a survey, in it I extract the LAS file containing the most recent gamma piece. I import it into the program, fault it up or down to match the offset log (the offset log is a known pilot well with trusted gamma signature) make sure everything looks good and send out a steer to the rig which I usually get it out in about 2-5 minutes. In the report, I'll give the driller a 'dogleg'. A dogleg is just a change in angle over a set distance. I usually only worry about the inclination, while the driller worries about the azimuth (the L/R of the drill path). This will continue until we land at our target formation. From there we try to stay in zone (which is usually a 20-40' thick area they want to stay in for the lateral). The lateral is a little more tricky as the pieces of gamma that we interpolate do become more skewed as you get farther out (longest lateral I've done is 3 miles). I've drilled about 75 wells the past year in the Upper and Lower Eagleford and Wolfcamp in Texas and the Woodford and Meramec in Oklahoma. 

Going forward
I just got accepted to Grad school out in West Texas where I'll pursue a Masters in Geology. I figure now is as good as anytime to go back to school and my employer said he'd work with me so I can go to class and Remote Geosteer from there.

I hope I explained everything well, if you need me to go into more detail I can and am hoping to do so! Also sorry if there are any typos or grammatical errors, it is Reddit after all. I'll try to answer any all questions but I cannot at this time help with a job."

I recently just finished up an internship at a big four accounting firm, and I absolutely hated it. I hated the work, the hours, the atmosphere, and the pay (what I'd earn for the work later).

Now I get it, I understand that it's about putting the time in and getting into a better spot in industry or whatever. However, I hated the corporate life, I couldn't stand being in an office all day. 

I understand now that it's not for me. I despised being there, and couldn't see myself putting up with it.
I researched accounting before taking my internship and everyone said do big 4, and I'm actually very sad that I hated it so much. Trust me, if I could I would just complete it and work in it. I had the opportunity. 

I'm already finishing up my fourth year in school, and I'm really not sure what to do now. I don't think I fit in to the corporate world. I don't know if I should finish up accounting, even though I'm so deep in. I sill have one year left, and I will be CPA eligible by the time I graduate.

I'm not even sure what I like anymore. I don't know if I just don't like the corporate life, because I didn't fit in. 

Has anyone been through anything similar, what options do I really have?"

I started college off as a political science major because of a strange set up for starting in the spring semester and what was available for classes. After about a year and a half I had to take a year off for health reasons and took some classes at a community college. I decided to try some computer science classes and finished my math requirements in classes that would transfer, fell in love and when I reapplied for admission to my university for this summer my advisor convinced me to double major, and I'll be finishing up an internship for my Poli Sci degree this semester. I love coding and have decided to pursue Computer Science as my desired major, it just makes sense to also graduate with a political science degree since it will only take another semester. I'm registering for classes and differential equations is an option but it's not required. Some of my friends in CS say to take it and some don't.

I've been out of college for almost two years now and I've been working in enterprise computer hardware manufacturing as a full-time Production Engineer for the last 16 months and the pay is fine, but the career prospects are nil unless my boss retires/kicks the bucket, and in general I really don't like the company as a whole. The work environment is taking a toll on my mental health and everyone I've talked to pretty much agrees with me on jumping ship. 

**Currently:**

I've been trying to get into IT support/Desktop Support roles for the last couple months and fortunately I have an in-person interview for an internship position on Friday (though the actual job is contracted through Milestone), but the internship is only for four months (not surprised since it's an internship). I've spoken to the hiring manager in a phone interview and asked if there was a way that this could translate into a full-time position and was flat-out told no, though it could be a recurring contract position with the contracting company.

If they decide to go with me would it be wise to quit my full-time position for this opportunity or should I just keep searching for full-time work? I've found it hard to translate from being a Production Engineer to Desktop Support/IT Support when asked. I don't really have many expenses/college debt to pay off and part of me thinks this would be a good opportunity to get my foot in the door, but at the same time the uncertainty of the four-month contract and not having the possibility of it translating to a full-time position is giving me cold feet.

Any thoughts? Sorry if this is all over the place."

4cc495,1,2016-03-28,Focus on college or keep splitting attention with temp job?,JT1989,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/4cc495/focus_on_college_or_keep_splitting_attention_with/,"So I'm a vet and currently using my G.I. bill to go to school. For those unfamiliar, it pays tuition, some of books, as well as a monthly stipend to help with cost of living. Initially I used it to go to a technical school and I got what I was hoping would be a promising internship from that. 

I got the paid internship last January while I was still in school. For the next 10 months I went to class in the morning and worked at night. The pay was decent and in conjunction with GI bill, I was living comfortably. When I finished school I was told I would be working 40 hour weeks. I like the job a lot, very independent, boss looks out for his people, once I take over for the guy who is retiring my worth goes up. Plus experience in a prestigious field. But because I'm still considered a temp so I make the same amount as when my skills we very rudimentary and I don't receive benefits or paid time off. My temp pay was just barely paying the bills if not putting me slightly behind every month. 

So in January I decided to go back to school to get the GI bill money again. To get the most use out of the time I need to take 12 credits, so I'm taking 2 night classes and 2 online. I'm definitely burning myself out, and going full time on both is going to cause my GPA to suffer. The sadder part is I make take home more from the GI bill than I do from my full time job. I've asked multiple times since I finished my finished my technical certification if I would be brought on full time. And I get told to be patient and that it is in the works, and that things like this move slowly because the company is getting bigger. 

Now if I stay on the grind I'm on I can make enough to put a down payment on a new car (I need it badly), but I feel I won't get as much out of my classes, and not get as high of a GPA as I want. If I leave the job and get a part time job somewhere easy, my GPA will go up and I think I will actually retain what I'm being taught, but I will lose the opportunity where I'm at, and make less money than currently. I think I might as my boss about switching back to part time while I focus on school and they figure out if they really want me or not. I feel like I'm being friend zoned by my job, but then again it could just be a slow process that will pay off later."

I face a dilemma of choices. I don't know what sort of future I want to lead. Working in Engineering right out of college? Entering finance? Going to grad school?

I am an electrical engineering sophomore. I was offered a fairly competitive co-op internship. I will work until December, don't know when I start.

However, it will cut deeply into my Junior year. I am heavily involved in my school's extra curriculars, board member for more than one club. Between a Junior year load and working 20 hours, I fear I will have no time to focus on my ECs. I think my ECs are important for future job opportunities that involve leadership (like in aerospace for example).

One of my extra curricular activities is working with the school investment club, going on competitions with them, this may lead to a job in finance. It seems very promising. But I'm not sure if it fits me. Not sure if engineering fits me either.

I've also learned about the merits of grad school, getting masters in EE (I originally chose engineering because I didn't want to go to grad). Grad school requires excellent grades. In this case, I should just ignore the co-op during the semester and focus on grades, then research.

Very conflicted.

So in summary, I need to choose between a co-op that would cut into my leadership experiences, my extra-curricular activities in finance and eventually choosing finance as a career, and grad school.

How can I do a cost-benefit analysis? What should I consider?"

I've groomed myself to perfection. Look at me. I look like the Taj Mahal back when it wasn't full of terrorists. Sure my hair has a few speckled bits of gray, but those grandma primary voters eat that shit up when I come walking at their 4th of July parade.

It looks like a fat cat with a mouse. ""And... I don't know if you knew this, but I am really, really good at fucking now. Just look at how hard I've fucked the American people. Just imagine how good I am now with all that practice.""

I push my chair back achingly slowly. The silence is palpable now. ""But we have to do a trial run first, Jenna. I have a meeting in ten minutes, and my desk has room for you underneath it.

I recently got with a guy I had been hanging out with for over six months, but there are certain things that are starting to get on my nerves and I don't know how I am supposed to deal with him.

First, a bit of background: we met through common friends last summer and immediately felt something for each other. I was dating somebody else and our common friends broke up shortly after, so we kinda lost contacts after two gatherings.

I kept him in my mind, though, and secretely hoped to meet him again.

We reconnected in October, through an association. We started hanging out together, always in group. Things haven't always been easy between us: i come from an awful ""relationship"" with somebody much older than me, he is pretty unexperienced, we are both very insecure and socially akward.... however, we made friends quickly and soon it became something more.

We started off with friendly hugs to say goodbye, then longer hugs, then tigher, pecks on the cheeks... until we kissed (I initiated the kiss) on March 12th. 

Since then, we are together, or at least we are supposed to be together. He is very cute, respectf and I feel like he is really into me: he doesn't pressure me into having sex, he respects my boundaries and actually asks for permission, he doesn't touch me inappropriately, nor hit on me while I'm drunk, he makes sure I get home safely, we do lots of things together aside from making out, like discussing politics, literature and hanging out with his (now also mine) friends. He is so sweet: he kisses me all the time, and everywhere, hugs me, holds my hand, lays his head on my shoulder, lifts me up... he also told me amazing things, like he said I was so beautiful, smart, he told everyone we were together, he is looking forward to meeting my young siblings, he asks for my opinion on his appearence, he told me i'm the best thing that ever happened to me.he is so reserved, but recently he has opened up to me: he told me he feels pressured by his overbearing and demanding family, he doesn't feel comfortable at school and with his peers, he has anxiety issues...

Seems perfect, right? 

However, there are things about him that i don't get. First, we hardly see each other. In the last month we saw each other for like, four times? Once a week, when I'm lucky. I get that he is young, he cannot do whatever he wants, he lives pretty far, has school and internships to do... however, I can't stand to meet him once a week.

Second, there is noticeable lack of communication. Again, I do get that none of us is really talkative &amp; he probably doesn't want to bother me, but I can't go for days without getting at least a text from him. He is usually the first one to whatsapp me, but not every day and our conversations don't last for long.
As I said, we became friends in October, yet I just found out when his birthday was. Do you think it's normal? Do you think it's normal that he didn't tell me he was going to the mountains on Easter?

I mean, all I am asking for is basic communication.

Third, the impression I got from him (and from his behavior) is that he is not a really caring person. He IS sensitive but doesn't consider other people's feelings. This Saturday we planned on going out with his friends. It was them who invited me. He told me we were going to meet up with them, but he was the only one who didn't show up. Turns out that he had to pack because he was going to the mountains. Not only this, he didn't even have the nerve to text me, it was his friend who told us. We haven't talked since then and honestly i don't know what I am supposed to do. 

   
**tl;dr**: I got with a guy, I like him a lot but he is starting to get on my nerves."

I've just recently decided to accept an offer for an internship in NYC and thus I'm kinda late to the housing game. NYU and New School are all sold out AFAIK (except for housing with required meal plans).
My hopeful budget is 1600$ for a single bedroom or 2250$ ea for a 2-bed apt.

Additionally, my dates are kinda unusual for an internship: June 13th/20th ( I can do whatever for that week) until September 2nd. Therefore, even though Columbia seems to have space, it would end up costing 1600$/mo for a double 100 blocks north.

AirBnB on the other hand doesn't have many options for my dates by now?

Distance preference: I was really hoping to bike this summer (Citi bike or my own) so I was planning to keep my distance at around a 20mn bike-ride? But in general I would prefer 20mn by subway ?

I haven't considered Hoboken as I really wanted to stay in Manhattan especially with an up-to-2250$ budget :/

As for subleases, I have absolutely no idea how to go about that and Craigslist is too scary to me (almost got scammed 2 years ago).

Any general tips?"

** TL:DR; Started a job 7 months ago. It was going great up until January when my boss and I had a falling out due to miscommunication. She said I was lying. Tried to repair the relationship since then, but was let go today ""Terminated without prejudice."" This is despite the fact that I was continually told that my attitude was an issue. The department has a high turn around rate (no one on the team has been there over 9 months, except the director who is 15 months in). How do I position this in interviews for new work? **

*

Apologies for the long story. I'll jump right in. If you want to skim past what I think was the final straw, the last few paragraphs should suffice as everything else is what led to the straw breaking incident.

*

Ok, well I just got home after being terminated without cause. First time in my working career this has happened and I am a bit surprised. I guess the best way of explaining the situation and while trying to give an partial account of what happened would be to start from the top.

7 months ago I started a new job. I was hired by the director of the department. My manager was then brought on board at the same time and started 2 days before I did. We were tasked with launching a new method of communication for the company; we developed the strategy together and worked well with one another. Flash forward 2 months and we are launching the new method of comms. This is when things start to get a bit turbulent.

We both came from different career backgrounds, but found success in each of our areas of expertise. When it came to the execution; I was, according to the director, in charge of that. However, my manager, being new to managing people (she had mentioned that she only ever managed interns before hand, and not senior level employees) was insistent on micromanaging to ensure that I knew ""how to do my work"" (her words). I politely indicated that I don't do well in that type of environment but would do so for now. She confirmed that this would only be temporary if she saw that my work was deemed acceptable. 

Fast forward to January (1 month later) and my work has been deemed acceptable but not great, but moving in the right direction. 

The next monday, I'm pulled into a boardroom where I am given a stern warning by my manager that I started packing up my belongings at 4:55pm on friday. I'm told that the work day ends at 5. She also mentions that she noticed that I take my lunch every day (incorrect, I take it 4 out of the 5 days, even though I should be taking it every day). At this point I'm highly irritated as I've never had my time managed like this. I point out that I actually left at 5:10pm, after the workday had ended. I also pointed out all the overtime I was doing (at that point it was about 35 unpaid hours in the last 6 weeks), which she was aware of. So if I were to leave 5 minutes early on a friday, I shouldn't be approached this way. Especially that the 35 hours doesn't include all the PM monitoring I am doing from 5pm-11pm daily to ensure that things are running smooth. I'm told that all those extra hours don't count because it's part of the job. I disagreed but in the end, took my lumps as technically she isn't wrong.

Later that week, I pass my probation, and with that I meet with the director for a touch base to see how I am faring and to get my feedback. At this point I am told that I am doing well and to keep up the great work. I am then asked about how I view my relationship with my manager. I'm encouraged to speak freely (I was told before hand by a co-worker that the director is open to hearing about any issues); I take the opportunity to say that there are a few  minor hiccups, such as the micromanaging and time watching. I'm quite upbeat that we can still move past this, and that these are things that should be ironed out with more time. I'm told that the door is always open and if I need to talk about anything, to come see the director.

2 weeks later, I get brought into a board room again and am told that previous meeting. I have been notably more aggressive towards my manager. At this point I'm floored. And I tell her that I am surprised that she is saying this. I apologize to her, stating that I never had that intention. I ask her if she can bring up a point in time when I made her feel this way, so that I can see what did or said that caused her to feel this way. She says that she can't pinpoint on moment. Again, I say that I am taken off guard by the observation; I tell her that this is the first time I've received this feedback from anyone. She quickly says ""That's because no one has ever had the guts to tell you."" I tell her that I want to work with her to work past this miscommunication. She again, says that it's all me and that I am making her feel uncomfortable. I apologize, and she says that my talk is cheap. At this point it doesn't seem to be getting better so I say that we'll work together to get back to how it was before hand.

At this point we had another instance where there was a miscommunication. End of day, she asked me to do something out of office. I asked her if the next morning before work would suffice. She said yes. I show up at 915 as planned. And she pulls me aside saying that the work day starts at 9. I reminded her that she asked me to do something and she said that she didn't remember and that I should be reminding her in those cases.

A few weeks go by and the only real notable instances are during our weekly touch bases where I am torn apart stating that my work isn't good and that I need to improve. I ask my manager if we can sit down together and review my work so that we can see where it needs to improve to meet her standards. Her reply is ""I'm not doing your job for you. Figure it out.""

At this point, I go see my director (March 10) because there isn't anything constructive that is being addressed and the relationship is toxic. The director states that I'm the only one that has brought this up, and because of this she won't do anything about it. I do know that the other team members have an issue with the manager's managing style but haven't brought it up yet, even though they planned to. I don't mention this because it really isn't my place to do so. She continues by saying that the problem must be me. The director goes on vacation. She comes back last monday.

On Thursday, I get an email from the VP, with my boss CC'ed on the email, asking me to pull down some content he saw on social media (my responsibility) because there was an error on the image. Note: This image was provided to me by his department that he manages.I reply to the email with ""Ok, the image has been removed."" I then walk over to his office to apologize and explain the situation; but he had taken the day off since friday was a holiday. So I walk back to my desk and I see that I have an email sitting there from my boss which states that ""my response was insufficient and that this is yet another time where I show that I can't accept criticism. I've emailed *VP Name* to apologize for your mistake and to ensure that it'll never happen again. This is about accepting your mistake and not hurting the department's reputation."" I reply with ""I went to go see *VP Name* at his office to explain the situation and apologize for the mix up. I felt that it was important to let everyone on the CC know that the content was removed, before apologizing. Also, could you please let me know which other incident you are referring to?"" Moments later she lets out a loud sigh while sitting at her desk. The day ends and nothing more is said. I send an email to my HR rep, asking to meet with her on Monday as I feel the situation has deteriorated beyond repair. And without the support of my director, I feel that I need to go on record with what I feel is a toxic work environment.

I come in to work today and do what I need to do in the morning. As I come back from lunch, I'm brought into the board room by my manager where the HR rep I emailed is sitting there. My manager says: We're letting you go because it just isn't working. I'll let *HR name* take over and she leaves the room. The HR person and I go over the details and she notes that this is termination without cause (her verbatim). I get home and look at the papers and see that it is indeed termination without prejudice. I assume these terms are interchangeable? At any rate. I find this odd because it seems that my boss had a problem with my personality and the way I responded to her.

At any rate, how do I handle this in interviews going forward? I don't really know what the exact reason for firing me was as none was given. I can surmise that my response on thursday, or meeting my director before she left on vacation were the determining factors.


Thanks for reading.

4cchie,3,2016-03-28,[Looking For] Best housing options for summer internship in West Village: General Tips for NYC short-term housing?,GGMU1,NYCapartments,https://www.reddit.com/r/NYCapartments/comments/4cchie/looking_for_best_housing_options_for_summer/,"Hi,

I've just recently decided to accept an offer for an internship in NYC and thus I'm kinda late to the housing game. NYU and New School are all sold out AFAIK (except for housing with required meal plans). My hopeful budget is 1600$ for a single bedroom or 2250$ ea for a 2-bed apt.

Additionally, my dates are kinda unusual for an internship: June 13th/20th ( I can do whatever for that week) until September 2nd. Therefore, even though Columbia seems to have space, it would end up costing 1600$/mo for a double 100 blocks north.

AirBnB on the other hand doesn't have many options for my dates by now?

Distance preference: I was really hoping to bike this summer (Citi bike or my own) so I was planning to keep my distance at around a 20mn bike-ride? But in general I would prefer 20mn by subway ?

I haven't considered Hoboken as I really wanted to stay in Manhattan especially with an up-to-2250$ budget :/

As for subleases, I have absolutely no idea how to go about that and Craigslist is too scary to me (almost got scammed 2 years ago).

Any general tips?

A bit about me.  I have been using drugs since age 13.  I got good grades in high school and went to a normal college majoring in CS (I was already big into development during my teen years).  I got addicted to heroin my sophomore year.  It took me about 7 years to get my bachelors in CS because I kept relapsing, going to rehab, etc.  I did a software dev internship which I didn't do well at (drugs), but still have good reference.  Then I got clean and worked as a sysadmin for a year.  Relapsed, went to rehab for a year, now I've been working as a Java dev for a legitimate company (20+ developers for about a year, I'm on suboxone).

I was wondering if anyone else has a story like mine?  It seems like all the devs I meet either 1) dont do drugs, or 2) use recreationally.  Don't know if I've met a dev in ""recovery"".  How has it effected your career?  Are you open about it to co workers?  How do you explain gaps in employment?

We work together.,throwawayworkbreakup,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4ccopt/broke_up_with_my_22f_boyfriend_28m_we_work/,"Hi y'all! Throwaway because I don't know if my ex Reddits or not, so better safe than sorry I guess...

I started dating this guy in my office about three months ago... I was a part-time intern last semester and didn't think I was returning for the Spring, so we kind of began dating thinking nothing of it. Then I got offered a part-time job with pay. I definitely need the money and having this company on my resume is pretty great in my field. Boyfriend and I didn't see any problems with this because we do not work together at ALL (technically, because I work for the nonprofit sector of this company, we're not even legally coworkers, we just share HR and office space). We never told anybody in the company. I do run into him in the hallways, though, and I can hear him from my desk frequently.

We became official the day before Valentine's Day, so very recently. Boyfriend was honestly the most wonderful person I've ever been monogamous with, and he made me so happy. Still, I found myself wishing I hadn't gotten into a relationship so soon before graduating. Most jobs I'm applying to are in this city, but I've also found great opportunities in others across the US and even overseas. Quite frankly, it was getting harder to truly feel like my life was wide-open with many options when I was limiting myself to what was here. Time I spent with him could've been spent on applying for jobs, seeing my friends more often, and working on myself. And let's face it, Boyfriend is in a different place than me. My next life move is getting a job. His is buying a home.

All in all, I'm not ready to undertake a serious relationship, regardless of how I feel about him. For those reasons, I broke up with him three days ago. I cried the whole time, and while he took it well, he didn't seem to be very sympathetic or caring. Understood, we were never in love. Still, I felt somewhat invalidated. He sort of chalked it up to me being inexperienced with major life changes. Regardless, there was no yelling or getting mad at each other.

I feel awful and wish I could change my situation--if I had a job lined up, for instance, I feel like I could've stayed with him and worked something out. The wound is still very fresh. But I know better than to ask for him back or drunk dial him.

I went to work today. I knew things would be hard, but I was doing fine until this afternoon when I heard him talking to someone else from the hallway. I didn't see him, but I just lost it. I started silently crying at my desk (no one saw me) and just felt terrible. I'm sure he hates me, and if he doesn't, he probably doesn't want to see me or talk to me. It's a lot to worry about while I'm trying to be a professional.

Yes, I see a counselor (yay anxiety), and yes, I know things get better with time. Still, I'm wondering if anyone has tips on how to handle an office breakup while the pain is still fresh. Are there ways you distract yourself from crying even when the person is ten feet away? Does anyone have suggestions on what to do if I run into him at the printer? Any and all suggestions would be great. I'm trying to work really hard on bettering myself, so anything I can do to not cry in front of my boss would be awesome lol. Thanks guys.

tl;dr: Anybody have tips on immediate solutions for breaking up with a coworker?"

In undergrad I was positive that I wanted to work as an I/O Consultant, and I will admit that I had a bit of a negative view of HR. I'm currently working on my M.A., and the more I study the two areas, the more intertwined I'm realizing they are. 

I ask about the differences (and pros/cons) of a career in either field because this summer I have an internship as an HR Generalist. I'm excited for this experience because it's at a large fantastic company. However I'll be graduating without any real expereince seeing what it's like to be an I/O consultant. I knew this would likely be the case as internships in the area are so difficult to come by, but that's why I'm curious how the two ""job areas"" differ.

I'm just attempting to make the most informed decision as possible when I graduate. Thanks!"
4ccqyk,0,2016-03-28,27M4F Be a bad girl tonight.,redditbadboy,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/4ccqyk/27m4f_be_a_bad_girl_tonight/,"OK, so I'm looking for some really naughty girls to RP with. I'm open to a variety of different situations/prompts, and if you've got an idea, I'd love to hear it. If you'd like a few ideas of mine, they're below, as is my kinks/dislikes list!

1) I'm a mid-level office employee and you're a newly-hired intern. We don't deal with one another much aside from short, polite acknowledgements. However, I do some video editing work for a few clients, and a shady one turns out to be an employee at a local chain of strip clubs.

In editing a video, I notice a VERY familiar face giving a lap dance and even sexually pleasing a customer. It's you, and I wait until we're alone in the office to let you know that I know about your dirty little secret.

2) I've just moved to a new neighborhood. I know absolutely nothing about the area, and you notice me moving boxes and spending more and more time in the area. Your backstory can vary; maybe I've moved in next to a college sorority house, maybe you're a MILF with a cougar's sex drive, maybe you're a cheating wife whose husband is never home. Alternatively, maybe it's YOU moving into a new place. The ideas are endless; either way, it ends with us having had multiple orgasms and with you covered in cum!

3) One of us is in town for business on a VERY short trip for work. We can figure out specifics on who does what; maybe you're a cheerleader/dancer for a visiting sports team, for instance. Either way, we wind up in the same spot, and the situation escalates quickly from there, since we're both looking for one night of naughty fun.

4) I've married older and into an open relationship. My new wife has a college-aged daughter, and you're her best friend. You come over somehow on a night where nobody else is home (my wife is getting fucked by at least one other guy, my step-daughter is elsewhere), and ultimately we wind up in a situation where one of us seduces the other. Why are you at my house? How do we get to that point? Let's figure it out together!

5) Any kind of party prompt you can imagine; nightclub, pool, bachelor/bachelorette, etc.

6) Any prompt you've submitted in the past that hasn't gotten the interest you'd hoped for; as long as it doesn't go against my ""dislikes"" list, I'm game!

My kinks: Dirty talk (an absolute must), bad girls (seriously, the raunchier the better), partying/drinking/smoking (also open to drug use), oral sex, group sex, cumplay, cheating, mild age play if it fits the story (nothing illegal, but anything from ages 18-40something is in play).

My dislikes: Animals, bathroom stuff, blood/gore, BDSM, FUTA, incest, intense dom/sub situations, noncon, orgasm control.

Hope to hear from you today!"
4ccreu,0,2016-03-28,Extra semester for Computer Engineering over CS?,aychtooessohfore,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/4ccreu/extra_semester_for_computer_engineering_over_cs/,"Hi everyone,


I'm currently a computer science student at a state university. I have 4 semesters left and started talking with an adviser and looking into embedded programming since I've started playing with arduinos in my free time and love it. Since then, I've really started to regret studying CS and wish I would have studied Computer Engineering. Also, the few companies I've interned at have talked to me about how they think it would be good to switch given my interests. 


I was lucky enough to win a full scholarship for 8 semesters when I started which will cover 4 more semesters, but I will need 5 semesters in order to complete the Computer Engineering major (If I don't want to take 18 hours of EE/CS classes every semester. It is technically doable in 4 though..). Making it 5 semesters would allow me to take only 12-14 hours per semester. 


Because I'm an out of state student, this last semester would probably cost about 15-18k for everything. Luckily my school offers automatic scholarships that would knock off 2k and I have about 5k in a college savings plan which means I'll probably only owe about 10k out of pocket. I'll make $23/hr at my internship this summer and imagine I'll be able to get similar pay for the next 2 summers, so that 10k really shouldn't be an issue. I also plan on applying to competitive scholarships since I have a 4.0 GPA, work, research and volunteer experience. If I graduated with the CS degree I'd be able to have a lot more money in the bank though at graduation it seems. 


I am very interested in software, but primarily in the embedded domain (although I also enjoy web development). Some other people I've talked to have said that it isn't worth it to do the extra semester since whatever job I get in embedded I could have gotten with a CS degree anyway. And if I do end up in web, it will be kind of worthless. But honestly I feel like this would be missing out on a lot of the hardware side of things that I'm also very interested in!


So, what do you think? Any advice? Is it worth doing that last semester to get the engineering degree? And yes, I understand this sub is probably biased... maybe that's why I decided to ask here and not at /r/cscareerquestions :)



TLDR: 15k or so for one semester to get Computer Engineering vs Computer Science degree worth it? Would have enough money from internships and savings so I wouldn't need any loans. Had a full scholarship cover every other semester."

My boss has always hinted pretty heavily that he would hire me for his open position when I graduate. This was my plan until a company wide hiring freeze was instituted, which is easy to confirm as we see all the new hires through computer/phone requests. 

Normally I would be comfortable waiting something like this out but I've heard talk in a few different places that it may last quite a long time.

Basically my question is how long should I reasonably wait? I'll be done with my AAS in Network Administration this May and it isn't looking like a position would be open until the Fall

My boss is a good enough guy that he would never expect or request that I work at minimum wage until that point, and he has said he will see what he can do by talking to his boss.

The only reasons I would consider waiting is because I like the environment, but also because there aren't many other options for work where I live and I can only think of one other place that may be hiring, let alone a guaranteed job.

I really don't want to move, I have considered work at home jobs but those really aren't going to happen at entry level IT"

It's sort of long and ramble-y.


Basically I gave my ex a chance to think about what he wanted after a small disagreement that escalated. He came to the decision, that he would stay with me, and went back to reassuring we had a future and he would marry me. I had recently started on medication for GAD and depression I've had for eight years against his wishes, and it made a HUGE difference with all the work I had done for myself. I had kind of relied on him last semester because I was depressed and anxious almost daily, and I understand that it wasn't healthy for either of us, but after the semester ended I had made progress after getting out of the stressful situations I was in. I had FINALLY gotten to a great place after last semester, and felt great, and then during spring break, he told me he didn't actually think about what he wanted. He said he could never love me in the way I loved him permanently, although he had felt it multiple times. He also said we were not equal, and he felt like my caretaker and the relationship only started to make me happy after his ex broke up with him, which HE could have said no to.

Now, yes I take full responsibility for relying on him for emotional support, but now that we are broken up, everything I had suppressed came back. In the beginning, he told me I should get a boob job, I could be thinner, and would not stop talking about his ex for about a year and into the relationship. It's understandable that he was hurting, but I told him to stop because it made me feel insecure and that he was still into her, but he didn't. He also admitted he used me mostly for sex for the first two months. There were lots of times before he told me this where the sex was not consensual and I was afraid to say no because he would get upset and it made him feel bad and he just wanted to make me feel good. He also manipulated me into doing sexual things with him before we were together. He claims to always try and makes others happy, but he has said a lot of things, like I could be thinner, that were mean and shallow. When I would explain that these things upset me, he would get defensive and say he didn't know that and didn't mean to hurt me. He suppresses his emotions, he has gotten a lot of things handed into him in life, like an internship at his dream job, and he has never had a low opinion of himself. Since he wouldn't stop talking about fond memories of his ex who broke his heart, which he also got defensive about and said they were ""good memories and he likes remembering them"" after I told him how I felt, I became incredibly insecure with my existing GAD and depression. He is also incredibly sure of himself because he's very intelligent, and the complete opposite of humble.

Today, I saw him at school with one of his friends who's a girl. I got so angry that I scratched my arm until it was raw (I called a hotline and I am stable). I had been doing so well the last week, and then I saw him. I have been suicidal, but I have my friends and therapist, but I am also SICK of feeling like this after I had got to such a great place and my ex told me everything was fine and he would marry me, something I've always wanted. 

Anyway... I need help moving on. I'm trying to keep myself busy, but it's an uphill battle, especially for someone like me. I want to be his friend, but I have cut him out of my life completely. I'm so heart broken because of everything I repressed has made me scared that the relationship was abusive and I don't know; but when everything was good, it was great and we loved each other. It seems like I fought through those things to love him for nothing. I know I'll be okay, but I can't help but think pessimistically right now and not leave it alone because of my obsessive thoughts.

   
**tl;dr**: Ex broke up with me after I gave him a chance to think about himself, turns out he did not and this was his real decision. Lots of bad things surfaced in my mind from the past in the relationship, like his immaturity, scared that the relationship was abusive. Don't know if I can be whole again."

You're a champ for reading this, champ ;).

I graduated from college a couple years ago and recently applied for graduate school (Human Factors PhD programs). I did not get accepted anywhere and now I would like to improve my chances at getting in next time if there is a next time.

How can I get research or work experience?

I went to school for Philosophy with psychology minor. I tried to get involved with some psychology research, but all the psychology professors I had retired. The remaining professors will not let me get involved with their research. Other local universities had told me they will not take any outsiders either.

Is it possible to get an internship even though I'm not currently going to college or seeking a degree in Human Factors psychology?

I've looked online at some internships and their requirements  were to be in college or grad school.

I could become a better writer so my letter of intent stands out more. Do you have any suggestions as to where and how to become a better writer?

Lastly since I'm already out of college how I can gain some better letters of recommendations?"

First, I want to tell how the interview went. I was the first person to interview for the position. I actually live 3 hours away from the location, so I drove Monday morning for the interview. Because I lived far away, they had me do three back-to-back interviews in one day. The questions were situational behavior-based so I was well-prepared to answer drawing from experiences. The only challenge I thought was my experience. I'm currently working as an associate in retail but I do have administrative experience through my internship. Most of the answers from the questions asked came from my retail and internship experience. Despite my lack of experience, I felt I was qualified for the job. On reflection, I stumbled on only two questions but I answered them to the best I can. I also asked questions about the position. 

My recruiter told me he would keep in touch. He had other interviews last week, so he wanted to go through all the candidates and meet with the other recruiters to decide. I also asked my references to put in good word for me. About 4 out of the 5 I sent out replied back. 

It's been one week later and I sent out a follow-up email to express that I am still interested. He replied back just thanking me for my patience. He told me that this week a candidate will be picked. 

I'm being patient but I'm also worried about my lack of experience. Should I be worried over this?

The idea being that during the first year of my PhD program I was going to work my ass off to support us both and after she finishes her internship (its only 9 months to about a year) she would get a job and be able to contribute. 

Now she claims she is feeling burned out and that she wants to take a year off while I am still going to continue on our plan. She keeps telling me she will work during her year off and that this will benefit her, but I can't help but think that starting a year later will hurt her.

Just recently decided I'd like to apply for the Fall 2016 semester and am starting to out together all the required documents and everything. I want to make sure that I put together the absolute best application I can as I really find that this program is a great fit for me. You can see my resume at:  
http://imgur.com/xC81XKN  
App highlights are the following:  
- B.S. in Computer Science from UT-Austin, 3.16 G.P.A.  
- Currently working as data science analyst at large consulting firm  
- Internships at Halliburton and high-frequency trading firm during university  
- Rec letter from chair of CS department. 

Unfortunately, I didn't get to know most of my professors very well and so getting three strong letters of rec is proving challenging. I feel moderately confident that my statistics professor may be able to write one, which will bring me to two. Most other professors of classes I even did well in I didn't get to know well enough to feel really good about asking for a letter. However, I've only been at my current job for eight months and so is it a good idea to ask a manager instead? Would really like input here. Anything else you think I should stress or emphasize generally speaking?  
I appreciate any and all help!"

I have posted this twice before in this sub, and again, it has worked for me this year.


Most of the big companies that use external hiring websites (indeed.com, monster, etc.) at this point probably have their interns / co-op positions filled. Continue applying, but broaden your search. I suggest trying this ***one weird trick that companies don't want you to know about*** or whatever... you get the idea.

So basically, go to this website and look at past awardees: http://www.sbir.gov/

These are companies that you want to target at this point. They're small, they have money, and they're often off the radar of other potential interns.
Identify a few (or a lot) of companies that interest you and research them. The company for which I am interning this summer was publishing technical papers on really cool stuff, so I took the time to read the papers and then reached out to the company to ask informed questions about their research. Whatever the company does, ask about their research, products, services, or whatever they do. Make the connection first. Be genuinely interested in what they do, then bring up a possible internship. By demonstrating interest, you have already presented yourself as a great potential intern.

Just for some perspective, ***a day after I made contact with the company I'm interning with they offered me a job***.

Don't give up!"

I was premed so I have taken many science and math classes, which have helped me think quantitatively. Currently in my job search many employers naturally prefer a BS in CS, which makes me wonder if I should pursue a master's in CS since I just graduated with a BA in anthropology a few months ago. Or if I should start over with a BS in CS. I don't mind going back to school if the field might become more competitive in the future and have better chances down the line. But of course I would like to start working soon in the field. Doing an internship now and might be starting new work next week as a programmer after a recent interview. I am still anxious about my lack of proper credentials."
4cdqgh,1,2016-03-28,My (24F) girlfriend ended our long distance relationship prematurely. I want to win her back.,Rabubbles,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/4cdqgh/my_24f_girlfriend_ended_our_long_distance/,"

**TL;DR  Had a great relationship with a girl. She moved away to pursue her career. She ended it last week because she needed to focus on herself. We didn't even talk about the problem before it happened.   I'm not ready for it to end. Any Advise?**




We started dating on my 26th birthday last year. We had been friends for a couple years before we decided to start dating.  I'm going to try my best to explain this the best I can.  We will call her Rose and I'll be Jerry. My ex will be known as X. I guess I'll start at the beginning.  


I had been dating X for over 5 years when I started developing feelings for Rose. I just hadn't been invested in my current relationship for sometime. I do not like creating conflict but I knew I would regret not trying to pursue Rose. I could tell Rose had similar feelings so I decided on December 1st, that I would end it with X. Rose didn't want me to do it for her,  but for myself since I wasn't happy.  Rose and I hung out 3 times the week I broke up with X. We hung out as friends, nothing more.  



On the night of the third hang out,  Rose told me that she didn't want to start a relationship because she was moving away in a few months.  I told her I didn't mind,  but she was firm with her stance.  I was pretty bummed.  So I was stuck living with my ex for a few weeks and I was trying my best to prove to Rose that we could make it work.  I eventually got my own place and things with Rose were up and down.  I got a little clingy.  I always do that.  Something I'm working on. 

So after Rose and I had not hung out in a couple weeks. Valentine's day came.  I asked her if she wanted to hang out and she said yes. We had Chinese and watched a movie and it was great.  After that,  things got better and better.  My Birthday came up and she took me out.  We then went back to her place to play video games.  I should have mentioned we are both gamers.  


After a bit of drinking and games, we ended up playing a trivia game on my phone.  We then began to flirt a bit and then boom,  I kissed her.  We made out and did like that and we talked about how we would keep it to ourselves for now.  Wow I forgot to mention that we worked together at a pet hotel.  So we decide to be friends with benefits until we decided it was more.  We were together all the time after that.  And after a couple months realized love was developing.  We told our friends and we had a great 5 months together.  We never fought,  we were honest,  it was the best.  But like I said,  she was moving.  She moved to Chicago at the end of August.  It was hard to say goodbye,  but I promised, I would visit and I thought our love was unstoppable. 


I visited 4 times in the last 6 months for about a week at a time.  It was great every time, except the last,  which was 3 weeks ago. The last 2 months have been difficult.  Her dog passed away,  her dad has a new girlfriend,  she has made new friends at her internship and they are leaving when it's done [this week], etc. Needless to say, rose has a lot on her mind.  All of this while I'm a couple states away.  


While this is all happening,  I'm here in Minnesota,  trying to get out of debt and save to move.  I haven't been working as hard as I should to do this and I took this whole thing for granted.  


Anyways,  2 days after my birthday and our anniversary,  she told me she needs a break.  She wants to focus on her career because when this internship ends, she doesn't know where she will go and work.  She said that she felt that we were growing apart and that she still loves me.  She told me I did nothing wrong and that I was a good boyfriend.  This of course crushed me.  I love her more than anything.  I admit, I'm not perfect,  but I know we can make it work. She even said that someday when she figures things out,  that it's possible we could try again.  She just said she felt bad that I was working so hard and putting in the effort to make it work,  when she couldn't.  


Basically,  I worked very hard to make this work and there was a time when we both were madly in love.  And I think that we could have that again someday. I just need some advise on how to give her  space and make it work.  I plan on getting my butt in gear and getting out of debt.  I'm also going to work on my insecurities and confidence.  I really don't know what else to say.  I just don't have many people to talk to. 


Also,  I was pretty insecure and whiny when she went out with friends.  Something I have been/need to work on.  She said it didn't bother her,  but I know it may have,  at least a little bit. 



This is probably a jumbled mess. Thank you for reading. Also was sent her by relationships moderator who felt it was more appropriate for r/offmychest"

I'm so sorry if this is long, and if there is a better place for it, please let me know.

My entire life, I've been the girl who has it all together. Good grades, awesome friends, great internships throughout college, a clear career path, volunteered all the time, etc. My parents have always been so proud of me, and people always tell me they feel like I have it all together. I graduated from college, got a great job in a new city I wanted to live in, and it seemed like I should be on top of the world. 

But my entire life, it's felt like a complete and total sham. I have always felt like, at some point, everyone was going to realize that I'm not that great, I'm actually pretty average. My grades were just okay, I felt like a complete and total failure at my internship, I honestly have no idea what I want to do with my life. I feel like I got into the college of my choice on a fluke, and never thought I measured up to all of the smart, talented people who surrounded me. When I graduated college, for the first time since I was little, I had no direction and no purpose. Moving to a new city away from my family and friends almost broke me, and working a job I wasn't sure I was passionate about or even good at has put me in a hole I don't know how to get out of.

Lately, everything seems to be coming to a point where I just don't know how much more I can take. I feel like I'm failing at my job, and am constantly on edge and filled with anxiety about all of the things I'm either doing or not doing. I wake up with a pit in my stomach every morning, and find myself waking up throughout the night stressed about things I have to do in the morning. I want to find a new job, but I have no idea what I'm even qualified for, let alone what I want to do. I moved in with my best friend in the city and another girl, and the two of them have become attached at the hip and no longer want me around, to the point where I'm looking for places to move before my lease is even up. Not only do I feel like a shitty roommate, I've lost the only person I could talk to in this city. I don't feel like I have real friends here (hell, I'm turning to reddit for advice because I don't know who else to talk to), I feel like I'm bad at connecting to people, and the boy I dated for 6 months and was starting to get serious about ghosted me with absolutely no warning. Everyone else seems so happy and fulfilled and successful, and I feel like all I'm doing is putting up a shitty facade that's going to get torn down any day now, and expose the absolute failure that is behind it. I was able to keep it up in high school and college, but now that I've been thrown into the real world, I feel like it's only a matter of time before I completely self destruct.

I know there is something wrong, I know I need to fix it, but how do you fix something that's been present your entire life? How do I even begin to try to fix myself, when I feel like my head is barely above the water? I've never had serious thoughts about harming myself, but the ""wouldn't life be so much easier if I just didn't wake up tomorrow"" thought has absolutely crossed my mind. This is no way to live. I can't do it anymore.

I don't even know what I'm looking for here, reddit. Maybe I just needed someone to know what I'm thinking. Maybe I need advice on where to go from here. Maybe I just need to know that I'm not the only person who feels this way, because right now it certainly feels like I am."

- Firstly, I want to ask, regarding the co-op schedule, DO I have to stick with it? I have heard a lot of good things about the Co-op here, saying it's one of the best, maybe the best in Canada.
- Are internships that easily accessible to the people studying at Waterloo? Can i get an internship/job the 2nd semester right after? 
- If so,Can i risk going to Canada with only 20-30k CAD(aside from the tuition fees for the semester), and pay that off along with the future income that i get from internships/jobs? 
-Is it really hard to work and study at the same time? Especially since Waterloo's course contents look heavy.
-Overall, will my salary outweigh the future tuition fees? 
- In total : How much do you realistically say (an average spender)
will need to study and live in Canada? (Rent:1 bedroom apt)
- If all else fails, What co-op program (while having good course contents and cheaper) in other universities do you recommend?
Thank you."

we were in a relationship, and we had a pretty big argument. I found women's face wash and facial creams in his cabinet (totally wasn't snooping) and was paranoid he was seeing other people, so I walked out on him and got a hotel 


I was staying at his place for the weekend, we were long distance relationship 3 hours apart from eachother. He always wanted to come to Boston and hinted it, but I always pushed him away by saying my sister was over which wasnt true, but I went to parties in Greenich close to NYC and I would tell him, and again he hinted for me to go to NYC to see him, but wasnt direct so I didnt.
I was always afraid he was seeing other poeple, because hes really into sex and I was a virgin when I met him so not used to it. 

Basically he did a lot for me and was patient with me and paranoid I was seeing other guys but i wasnt. 
his texting was super horrible and boring but i got a good morning, how are you and good night every day for 7 months. Then after the fight, I put in the effort trying to be sorry about it, because he said those products belonged to his mother. (she does go to his place a lot) and that we would talk about the rest later. I called him though and sent him an immature email to which he had no response, but he did always respond to my texts. and when I called, it was me just bitching, becasue I was upset. our communication definately changed, it was now 50- 50 effort in text, and i hate texting so I made an effort to stay in touch, but so was he. then came XMAS and nye, and he always said we would do stuff together for xmas, but I otld him I had chairty events in Toronto, and he never asked to make plans, but again I felt he would hint it. so I got pissed he didnt even call for xmas, but he did text me xmas and nye in teh morning and asked me what i got, but he did nothing for me.. I dont care though I just wished he would call, because it means something so much different. So, I ghosted him for 6 weeks, and he would still text like 4 days in to the ghosting, and then he stopped. Until, I texted him first in whch case he was like ya u didnt respond to my messages for 3 months. 
and, I asked him to an event and he said he would go if someone special went like me, but otherwise why would he go. I was in california during this event and wanted to go but couldnt so he sent out an intern to take notes for me and record it. we never discussed where we stood in the relationship, and we are bith passive agressive i guess. now, i'm going to NYC in 2 weeks, and I asked him what he was doing on the 9th, he said working from home, and you? and i told him going to a talk or something, and then he changed the subject.

Has he moved on, is there still a chance? or is it over, or is he pissed, did i push him away? should i be more direct and ask him like i miss you and want to see you? and he brought up the xmas and nye thing so I know he's upsset i ghosted him. thanks!"

I understand that the below listings are varied in specialization, but does anyone have tips for getting into government contracted internships?


As for my current credentials:

- 6 months of independent contract work
- 6 months unpaid Sysadmin internship
- Current paid InfoSys internship for City Government

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;*Note: This is a position I work part-time and can hold indefinitely for the next 4 years should I choose.*

- Freshman attending Community College for transfer to Cal Long Beach for IS

I understand that many of these positions want juniors, so I do not mind waiting to apply, but in the mean time **how can I make myself more appealable?**

 Do they expect these interns to already have certifications?

I study at least an hour every day for IT outside of classes and am working through the following (*Note: I haven't chosen a specialization):*

- CCNA Udemy Course
- CBT Nuggets MCSA 2012 R2 
- Python Automation Course
- [VA_Network_List](https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/472ncz/advice_for_a_future_in_it/d09occ8)

- Information Systems is a business major

- My interview skills need practice. Scared of my employer finding me practicing with other companies.

[What is the absolute worst experience you have had with a guest?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4cdg0p/iaman_employee_at_the_wizarding_world_of_harry/d1hbkpo?context=5)|I've been thrown up on before, but that wasn't really the guests fault. One of the worst ones was when we had a party of about 45 people come through the single riders line. When we asked them to split up, they flat out refused and started cursing at us and calling us really offensive slurs. We knew for a fact they had been told they'd have to split up at the entrance of the attraction and it didn't help that most of them only spoke Portuguese and the ones that spoke both english and Portuguese chose to selectively understand us. We ended up having to get supervisors involved to split them up.
 |Just remember, theme park team members are people too. We have compassion for people who are having a rough time. We can make your day if you are nice to us (i.e. letting you skip a 2+ hour line, get your whole party to the front of our most popular rides, free merch, food and beverages), but if you insult us or treat us badly, we are much less likely to help you. I'm 1000x more likely to help the guest that comes up to me and explains their problem(s) calmly than the one that comes up screaming.
[Thanks for doing this AMA! I have only been to the Wizarding World in Orlando once a few years ago, but, when I was there, I was awestruck by the sheer number of people packed into such a small space. At the time I couldn't help but feel that, if there was some sort of need to quickly evacuate all those people due to emergency, we would almost certainly be screwed. Do you feel the same way? Or does Universal have emergency procedures that would effectively deal with that many people all at once?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4cdg0p/iaman_employee_at_the_wizarding_world_of_harry/d1h6wc7?context=5)|As far as the original Harry Potter Land (Hogsmeade) they have plenty of ways guests can leave the land quickly (i.e. by leaving through Jurassic Park or the Lost Continent). But Diagon Alley is very different, due to the fact that, as you said, the land is a large area but only has 2 very small exits. By law Universal has to include Fire Lanes in all of its lands to allow for emergency crews to get into the area if needed. Universal has cleverly hidden 2 GIANT fire lane access doors in Diagon that can be opened quickly if an evacuation is needed or a fire truck/ambulance needs to get into the land. These doors also allow us to move food carts/set pieces in and out of the land. The doors are closed right before we open in the morning and opened after the land is cleared for the night.  Here is a picture of one of the doors: [Link to img.buzzfeed.com](https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2014-06/23/13/enhanced/webdr05/enhanced-buzz-wide-21958-1403545852-14.jpg?no-aut) (It's on the left hand side, right behind the black director chairs) The other is under the Incendio spell windows to the left of Gringotts.
 |Tl;dr Hogsmeade has large entrance pathways on purpose, Diagon Alley has large Fire Lane doors built into the facades.
 |Hope that answers your question!
[Favorite foods at Universal? Favorite foods in the Wizarding World area? Is it worth the price?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4cdg0p/iaman_employee_at_the_wizarding_world_of_harry/d1h7alj?context=5)|1) Definitely the Mythos restaurant in Islands of Adventure. The restaurant is consistently ranked one of the best theme park restaurants in the world. Wait times can reach 2+ hours on busy days and it's on the pricier side, but quite good. In the WW the Bangers and Mash at the Leaky Cauldron is my personal favorite.
[Favorite Wizarding World ride? Least favorite ride?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4cdg0p/iaman_employee_at_the_wizarding_world_of_harry/d1h7alj?context=5)|2) Favorite is Escape from Gringotts. I like the story better and I love the beginning of the ride (hint hint). Least favorite is Dragon Challenge, because it can make me quite nauseous haha.
[Butter beer--is it better slushy or room temp?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4cdg0p/iaman_employee_at_the_wizarding_world_of_harry/d1h7alj?context=5)|3) I prefer it frozen/slushy, don't forget to ask for extra cream on top!
[Highlight of your experience working there?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4cdg0p/iaman_employee_at_the_wizarding_world_of_harry/d1h7alj?context=5)|4) The incredible people I meet while working. I see people from all over the world, from Russia to Nairobi and its awesome to talk to them learn a little bit about them. I have met some guests I'll never forget in my life.
[Do you own any wands?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4cdg0p/iaman_employee_at_the_wizarding_world_of_harry/d1h7alj?context=5)|5) Lol, yeah, like 10. I have my birthday wand, harry's, hermione's, 2 of dumbledore's (one broke), Sirius', voldy's, ron's, snape's and Lucius Malfoy's.
[Favorite Harry Potter character? ](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4cdg0p/iaman_employee_at_the_wizarding_world_of_harry/d1h7alj?context=5)|6) Snape without a doubt 
[I'm fascinated by the technology behind the Forbidden Journey ride. Have you ever gotten to walk around the building where it's housed after hours/check it out with the lights on? If so, what was the experience like? (And how many times have you ridden it? :D\)](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4cdg0p/iaman_employee_at_the_wizarding_world_of_harry/d1h7ybh?context=5)|I have seen it with the lights on just a few times, but it's incredible to see how everything works and how they hide areas of the ride they don't want you to see by tilting you away from that area at just the right time. FUN FACT: Each ride vehicle costs over $1 million!  If you really want to see what it looks like with the lights on, here is a video (WARNING: This video will ruin the magic behind the ride so SPOILER WARNING) [Link to www.youtube.com](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbYvrxhbZ-o)
 |[Link to www.amazon.com](http://www.amazon.com/Secrets-Forbidden-Journey-Unofficial-Attraction-ebook/dp/B00KH0G2I2/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1459221635&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=Secrets+of+the+Forbidden+Journey%3A+Unofficial+Guide+to+the+Ultimate+Theme+Park+Attraction+Kindle+Edition)
[That's not really how the ride works, it's in some sort of safety-mode where it just parks in a neutral position.](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4cdg0p/iaman_employee_at_the_wizarding_world_of_harry/d1hb61q?context=5)|You are correct, Forbidden Journey has 3 different ride profile modes that it can operate in. The 1st is the normal ride profile that it runs through during normal operation.
[The actual ride leans forward, focuses on a prop element as the cart moves under it, then moves quickly forward to the next.  It's a wildly different experience than the video shows.](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4cdg0p/iaman_employee_at_the_wizarding_world_of_harry/d1hb61q?context=5)|The 2nd is a ride reset profile. In this video the ride must have stopped for a long enough period of time for the managers to determine that everyone on the ride needs to get a re-ride, so you can see that the ride is not moving like it normally does and is keeping the riders facing straight ahead.
[Still neat to see how weird the lift-arm looks though.  And it's so freaking tall!](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4cdg0p/iaman_employee_at_the_wizarding_world_of_harry/d1hb61q?context=5)|The last profile is the Evacuation profile. This will turn the riders so they are facing the nearest evac platform, once all ride vehicles reach their designated evac spot, the ride will stop and evac procedures will begin. Gringotts ride vehicles operate in a similar fashion.
[I'll be there this Saturday! Are there generally times of the day when wait times are shortest?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4cdg0p/iaman_employee_at_the_wizarding_world_of_harry/d1hay4a?context=5)|First thing in the morning and right before the park closes. The rides wth the longest waits include Despicable Me, Rip Ride Rocket, Gringotts, Forbidden Journey and Spiderman. I'd recommend getting to Gringotts first thing, then going to Despicable me and Rip Ride, then do the rest of Universal Studios. After that get on the train, do the other park and save FJ and Spiderman until the end of the night. If you have time, don't forget about the Cinematic Spectacular at the end of your day!
[How do the rides work?  How good does your butter beer taste?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4cdg0p/iaman_employee_at_the_wizarding_world_of_harry/d1h7b9a?context=5)|Both are marvels of engineering, so many moving parts moving in perfect harmony is amazing to see. Both flagship rides (forbidden journey and Gringotts) are incredibly complex machines with hundreds of motors and hundreds of thousands of moving parts. I try to learn as much about the rides from our Technicians that work on them, but even after 2 year, I've barely scratched the surface of how they work.
 |And butter beer tastes like liquid gold.
[My SO and I went a few years ago before the Diagon Alley expansion, and our main goal out of the whole park was to buy our own wands at the wand shop. We were disappointed at the quality of the wands; they seemed to be just press board that had been spray painted.  (Not to be a negative Nancy here; we *loved* the park otherwise\), but has the wand quality gotten any better?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4cdg0p/iaman_employee_at_the_wizarding_world_of_harry/d1hbpih?context=5)|They are about the same as before, except that we now have interactive wands that look a bit different. When I first got my wand I felt similar, but I remembered that this was something that I bought at a theme park. They wands are quite detailed in my opinion and each one has a complex back story to them. I know Universal wanted to go with more authentic wands (i.e. real wood with metal details, some hand carved), but they were worried they would break too easily in a typical day at the parks, especially in the hands of an excited kid.
[Have you heard anything about the Ministry of Magic expansion?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4cdg0p/iaman_employee_at_the_wizarding_world_of_harry/d1h6ohs?context=5)|Nothing official yet, but we have definitely heard it's in the pipeline for 2019-2020. There are already support roads/future guest pathways paved towards what is currently the Fear Factor Live stage. Also, we are pretty sure it's just going to be a Diagon alley expansion, not a whole new land like Hogsmeade/Diagon Alley is.
[Hey! As a Florida resident I frequently visit universal and Disney parks. What exactly do you do in your job? Do you work in one of the shops, sell butter beer, or are you a ride attendant? Also does universal have anything similar to the Disney college program that you know of?  ](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4cdg0p/iaman_employee_at_the_wizarding_world_of_harry/d1hagfc?context=5)|I've been both a shop attendant and a ride attendant in the past. Can't say what I currently do because there aren't a lot of people doing my job. Universal doesn't really have anything like the college program, the closest we have are the internships for college students (i.e. universal creative internships, food and beverage internships, hospitality internships, etc...)
[What's your favourite ride? Also what is the most overpriced thing? and most undervalued thing there?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4cdg0p/iaman_employee_at_the_wizarding_world_of_harry/d1h7w8i?context=5)|1) Escape from Gringotts because of the tech and the story 2) The house robes are cool, but I'd never pay $130+ for it, thank god for our employee discount lol. 3) For just under $50 the interactive wands can make a child truly believe in magic, it's an amazing thing to watch.
[Can you expand on the interactive wands? Like can I do magic with one?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4cdg0p/iaman_employee_at_the_wizarding_world_of_harry/d1hc4ek?context=5)|Yep! We have ~20 spells through out Diagon Alley and Hogsmeade. They are marked with a medallion embedded in the ground. The medallion tells you what motion to make and what to say. Then you stand on the medallion, do the motion and say the spell. If you do it correctly, magic will happen in front of you, like making a quill levitate, assembling a suit of armor, making a bird sing or turning on this beautiful window of glass chandeliers.

I started having doubts and my plan now is to do my senior year and then a fifth year here for a terminal masters (it's one of those early masters programs). The problem is that I'm already signed up to work with a professor here over summer and do robotics research. I have housing set up already and generally feel uncomfortable flaking out at this point to do an internship. I had my change of heart after I already accepted. 

 ... but last summer I also did research and the summer before that I didn't do anything. I want to do something cool the summer after this one (between senior year and my fifth year but i don't know what).

My interests are pretty undeveloped so my tentative plan is to set a project for myself alongside the research that I can show employers. The prof I'm working with over summer is pretty confident we can publish something and I'd be head author but I doubt that's worth much to industry. I've been a teaching assistant for two semesters but ditto on the ""no one cares.""

A) Am I boned?
B) What are internship prospects like for an advanced undergrad with no prior internship experience?
C) What else do I need to start doing to set myself up to succeed?

I'm going to career services for advice on Wednesday to ask basically the same questions. My advisor said I'd be okay but she didn't know I wasn't interning this summer ._.

Halp!"
4ceg6f,2,2016-03-29,Fashion Internship for Your Dream Job: 10 Ways to Get That Summer Gig,PursueAsia1,internships,https://www.reddit.com/r/internships/comments/4ceg6f/fashion_internship_for_your_dream_job_10_ways_to/,"Has it been your dream job to work in fashion? Then you should know that the best way to get ahead is to land an internship. Internships give you invaluable experience. That same experience gives you the edge. However, fashion internships are not easy to land and they're quite competitive. Ask anyone who's ever interned in a fashion company and they'll tell you that it's one of the most competitive industries, and everyone is gunning for the same spot. You don't want to just send off your resume into the ether and hope for the best. Which is why the tips below can give you a head start at landing a summer fashion internship?

Summer fashion internships can be exhausting, work-intensive and demanding but if this will land your dream job, then it should be worth the experience.

1. Start Early - Don't start right before summer. Start searching several months in advance. Make sure to pay attention to deadlines.

2. Nail Your Cover Letter - Approach your campus career office to help you perfect and proof your cover letter. Make sure it's not generic and it should be unique. It should have something that isn't on your resume. The guide suggests that you should include specific details about the company and why you'd like to work for them.

3. Perfect your Resume - If you're looking for an intern job then you don't have enough experience. Avoid lengthy resumes. Keep it to one page and break it down by category like ""Fashion Experience"" which is an extreme must but don't forget to add another category like ""Journalism Experience"" if you're looking at a magazine company. Flying Saucer suggests that if you haven't had any relevant experience, you can always indicate extracurricular activities that you've taken to prepare for such an internship.

4. Subscribe To The Right Sources - Most internships are acquired through school or personal connections but there are many postings online as well. Check out Pursueasia Pvt Ltd and see if you'd like to subscribe there. Don't forget to follow companies through Twitter and keep up to date with trends and announcements.

5. Reach Out - When an online internship opens up, you can be sure that the company will be flooded with applications. According to Bustle, if there's a certain company that interests, don't wait for them to post. Instead, send your resume and cover letter off to the appropriate person. Specify you're interested in a summer internship.

6. Pay Attention To Requirements - Make sure you follow the guidelines and requirements. If they need three copies, send only three. Not following instructions can foil your chances. Companies like to be organized and these guidelines are a must-to follow.

7. Apply to More than One - It's good to be hopeful but it's better to have a second choice. Or a third. Or even a fourth.

8. Censor Your Social Media Presence - Companies do their research well and that includes checking social media networks. Make sure nothing inappropriate can get out there or just not post anything inappropriate at all.

9. Consider The Brand's Aesthetic - Paste Magazine says you should consider the brand when dressing up. Understanding the brand is important.

10. Stay In Touch - If you didn't get that internship, it's important to stay in touch. They might remember you for the following year. Don't send an email every week but maybe every few months instead. Even if you've already accepted an internship, don't turn this one down and cross it off the list. Keep your options open because networking is essential in the fashion industry.

Strap yourselves in, because if you stick around through this, I assure you it's gonna be a bumpy ride.

As the title stated, I've been in a relationship for about 2 years now.  Our anniversary is approaching pretty soon, but that's kind of an aside.  Let me first state the issue regarding my relationship, and then I'll elaborate on the backstory.  In short, before I was dating my now girlfriend, I slept with two other girls, one of whom I was not dating and it was a one-night stand.  Our morals were held to different standards before our relationship, but I've done my best to adopt her ideals, but the fact that I used to smoke weed, drink, and had sex completely opposes her fundamental morals.  My current girlfriend has been saving her virginity for the person who she wants to spend her life with, and the fact that I have already lost mine, in addition to other details of my past, causes tension between us.

Now for the backstory.

She and I have known each other for many many years now.  We met online via a silly chat forum around 8 years or so, and have been chatting ever since.  It was high school when we met, and we were both fairly depressed and awkward.  Initially, we talked exclusively through the chat forums, and eventually exchanged facebooks.  We talked regularly for around two years, and it was wonderful talking with her, almost every day.  More often than not, it was nothing more than whimsical chatter about the usual things a middleschooler encounters: difficulties with parents, struggles academically, that one asshole in class who never shuts up, the norm.  Even though things are fairly pleasant and casual, I get the feeling that I like her, however I wasn't really sure about an internet relationship.  She is also 2 years younger than me, and being in 8th grade and her in 6th, it seemed like weird timing.  Anyhow, I get my first ever girlfriend near the end of middle school, and I lose contact with my current girlfriend (for the sake of consistency, I shall refer to her as ABC, as other people are going to get involved later on).  I'm gonna keep things brief with regards to the other people in my life, but I have sex with my first girlfriend and it's both our first times.  My first girlfriend and I break up after about 6-7 months.  I talk again with ABC, now via facebook instead of the chat forums, and we begin to discuss more of our lives.  Awkwardly enough, we kind of refer to each other as brother and sister.  We did it mostly as a joke, given we both kind of look similar, however eventually it just kinda stuck.

Time skipping a bit to hurry things along.  4 years of high school passes, and I kind of lose contact again with ABC.  Over that course of time, I proceed to have 2 more girlfriends, all via the internet.  I never actually met any of them, and each relationship lasted less than a year.  I started smoking weed and drinking with friends somewhat regularly, but I never get in trouble or get hurt as a result of it.

College time.  My freshman year, I awkwardly start life as a college student.  New an unused to how things sort of go, I meet another girl (let's call her XYZ).  I hit it off with XYZ, to a certain degree, and we end up hanging out pretty often.  (I haven't talked to ABC for a few years now, just for reference)  I end up having sex with XYZ after knowing her for a while, but we never actually get together in a legit relationship.  Pretty soon afterwards, XYZ meets a friend of mine and they fall for each other hard and fast.  Sophomore year rolls around, and I end up living in a dormitory with XYZ's now boyfriend in addition to our other mutual friend.  Things are awkward as fuck, in that regard, but all the same, I get another girlfriend, long distance via the internet, and that relationship lasts about half a year.

This is where the majority of the story comes into play.  I told ya it'd be a wall of text, so if you've made it this far, I want to thank you again for reading this.  I'll try to make this as quick as I can while still hitting on all the major points.

I'm just breaking up with my then girlfriend when suddenly ABC suddenly messages me via facebook out of thin air.  Almost literally, as I'm breaking up with my girlfriend at the time, ABC pops in to see how things are going and to catch up.  She helps me a ton with the post-break up situation, and helps straighten me out.  At this point, I'm working a job at a fast food place, smoking week almost every single night, falling way behind in classes, and struggling to pull myself together.  I don't tell ABC any of this, because she still remembers me from before high school when I was all chipper, hitting top marks in school, and whatnot.  We end up spending entire nights talking to each other.  Way into the early hours of the morning, we just end up facebook chatting together.  Things then take a turn to skype, when I ask if she wants to actually chat in person, and she agrees.  These chats that take up the whole night end up occurring every single night, reaching the point where our conversation devolves into ""You go to sleep"" met by ""No, you go to sleep.""  Eventually, after probably more hinting than I should need, she says that she likes me.  I say that I like her too, but this is only a couple weeks after my break up, so she respectfully tells me to give it more time so I can work things out.  Unfortunately, I fell for her so hard and so fast, that I couldn't help but ask her out a week and a half after she admits to me.

Initially, we're overjoyed to be together.  More nights are spent where we just lay in bed talking back and forth for hours on end without ever tiring or ever getting bored.  Things are doing great.  It doesn't stay great, however, as she learns more and more about me.  I tell her about my past relationships, that I'd had sex, that I'd been smoking weed and that I'd drank before (to be fair, I didn't ever really have more than a few drinks at a time, as I'm not one for blacking out for fun), and all the other things in my past.  There's other things I'm glossing over, but the main points that stick out are that I've smoked weed, drank, and especially had sex.

I told her these things somewhere around 2 or 3 months into our relationship.  She didn't tell me that hearing these things upset her, but I did notice that she seemed a bit cold toward me.  When I confronted her about why, she told me that she held herself to never drink, smoke, have lucrative sex, or do anything of that nature, and that she was ashamed of me for being so low.  Naturally, I was somewhat taken aback.  I didn't see anything wrong with what I did, and when I tried to tell her that I hadn't done anything wrong, she refused to accept what I said for an answer.  After our first ever fight, she explained to me why she held herself to these standards.  Her family had a history of sexual abuse, domestic violence, alcohol addition, and drug abuse.  From a very early age, she vowed never to engage in such a thing so that she could be perfect for whomever she decided to spend her life with.  Still somewhat unconvinced, I tried to tell her that I wouldn't repeat any of the atrocities she or her family experienced, but the mere fact that I had done those things in the past were a mark against my name.

We continue with our relationship, under the pretense that I swear never to drink, smoke, or do anything provocative ever again.  I agree, and even as I type this, I have maintained those promises.  Things become more difficult with time, as the stresses of her college career approach.  Her parents are abusive toward her, and I always try to help her cope with things along those lines, but again, this is a long distance relationship, so I can't really physically do much besides comfort her with my words.  Every now and then, she tells me that she can't get the idea of me having sex with other girls off her mind, and she tells me (against my will) to tell her every single detail of how I had sex with the other two girls.  Again, I told her I didn't want to, but she insisted, so I obliged her.  This, as I anticipated, made things worse.  Ever since, she has what she calls ""bad pictures"" where she mentally imagines me having sex with the other two girls, just as I had described it.  Initially, things are fairly mild, escalating every now and then, but as she enters college, things take a hard turn for the worse.

ABC is in college now.  It's her freshman year, and she's exposed to the college environment of drinking, partying, casual sex, and a whole host of other things.  Naturally, she develops triggers to these ""bad pictures"" whenever something reminds her that I've had sex with other girls.  At first, it starts with things regarding sex, but eventually develops further.  Anything sexual whatsoever - information on safe sex practices, condoms, AIDs and STI information posters, pregnancy symptom posters, and so forth - immediately trigger these ""bad pictures"".  Every time it comes up, I tell her that I've changed my views to adopt hers and am working on improving myself.  I tell her every single day that she is beautiful and sexy and that I love her with all my heart, but with each passing day and each time she gets triggered, my comforting methods become less and less effective.

It's now the second semester of ABC's freshman year, and the triggers have gotten so bad, that almost anything will trigger these bad pictures.  Anyone who even remotely looks like the two girls I've had sex with (she told me to tell her what they looked like, and then proceeded to look them up via facebook for an exact image), she becomes triggered by.  Even if it's something akin to a girl who has her cleavage exposed, she associates that with being hypersexual, and subsequently is triggered by my past of having casual sex.  As this is college, and the subjects of sex take form in a variety of different things, most involving the assigned readings for classes she's taking, these triggers occur every single day.  I always try to comfort her, however it seems that now whenever I try, things only get worse.  Each day brings another fight.  Over the course of these fights, she's called me disgusting, a manwhore, a degenerate, told me that I'm disgraceful and shameful and the worst boyfriend in the world.  She's told me that she'd rather die than date me, and that if she knew all these things before we were dating, she wouldn't have said yes.  Each and every day, she tells me that she's being triggered, and yet try as I might, I can't seem to console her.  I've told her that I've changed my ways and my beliefs.  I've told her that I regret that I slept with the two girls and that if I could, I'd go back and change my entire life so as to match her standards.  I've told her, in detail (literal pages of text) that I think she's beautiful, and sexy, and attractive, and better than the other two girls.  I've told her that we can have a happy future together if we can overcome this issue.  But none of this seems to comfort her.  She tells me I need to be more compassionate and affectionate and to comfort her better, but I always find myself at my wit's end trying to think of how to comfort her.

As these fights have progressed, I've had to make more and more promises to her.  I used to get incredibly frustrated and angry, and I'd yell back at her, but she made me promise never to yell or snap at her.  There was a time when I'd hang out with my friends and stay out later than I said I would, and so I had to promise her never to keep her waiting.  Once, I got so frustrated that I punched a hole in a wall, and she got scared that I might hit her, so I had to promise never to strike her or anything.  Over the course of the last summer, she told me that she was worried about how we'd live together and be financially stable.  With that in mind, if I didn't find a paying internship, she told me she might leave me.  I did find a paying internship, and thusly she did stay with me.  During one of our fights very early on, she said she was going to kill herself and hung up the phone.  I was so terrified I spent 5 minutes endlessly calling her cell phone, home phone, and her skype.  She answered and I demanded that she tell me if she did anything, and she told me that she cut herself with a knife.  Throughout the entire call, I had the number of her local suicide emergency hotline at my fingertips, and I made her promise me that she never hurt herself ever again.  Recently, when I got frustrated for how these triggers came up every single day, we fought again.  She made me promise never to hold her triggers against her.  I made this promise under the condition that she promised never to lose her temper at me, seeing as I had already made the same promise.  She told me that (and I quote) ""That's more difficult for me to do since my temper is harder to control"" and later reluctantly agreed.

Now, if you're still with me, I wanna thank you one last time before I wrap this story up.  If you made it this far, I can promise you that I'm almost done, so stick with it for just a bit longer.  Please and thanks :)

I'm sure you're wondering, by this point, why we're still together.  What the heck is the point if us being together is so shitty?  Well, here's the thing.  During our happiest moments, it truly feels like bliss.  We've become so attached together, and we'd spend every single hour of every single day together, if we could.  Most hours of the day, we'd literally just lay in bed watching cartoons, playing games, reading books (we'd open up an online text and read to each other) or just talking the day away.  I'd call her on skype and we'd cook breakfast, lunch, and dinner together.  The most joyous moments of my life were spent with her, and I can still look back on them with the brightest smile.  I'll be completely honest here and say that when I met her, she really saved my life.  I was reaching a point of complacency in my life, and I'd been failing out of almost everything with a ""fuck it"" attitude.  Even though I knew I was throwing my life away, succumbing to laziness, I simply didn't care enough to change it.  But when ABC came along, I found a reason to care.  I fought against everything I had let pile up in my life, cleaned my self up, stayed clean throughout my entire relationship, and got my ass working hard.  I'm now going to graduate with a bachelors degree in economics on the dean's list of my college, I've lost a ton of weight, and I'm aiming to land my first real job, thanks to her support.  I couldn't have done it without her, and I've made sure to tell her so.

But...things between she and I haven't gotten better.  In fact, things have gotten even worse.  Every day, she comes home crying, and me trying to talk to her just makes her cry worse.  We had another fight only hours before I'm typing this now, and I don't know what to do.  We've had so many fights now, that it feels like our relationship is falling apart.  The difficult thing is, I love her still, and she says she loves me too.  We want that happiness, but things have devolved so far that ABC has started to lose sleep over this issue.  She's been taking Unisom, Tylenol PM, melatonin supplements, and Calms Forte all in varying amounts to get to sleep.  I forced her to stop taking unisom and Tylenol PM, but she's still using melatonin and Calms Forte.  I'm okay with these two, since they're mostly naturally occurring chemicals, however it's gotten to the point where she's taking almost 5 pills a day just to sleep.  I don't want to endanger her health, but it seems like there's nothing I can do to resolve my past.  I've tried to argue that she should change her stance on casual sex so that she can forgive my past, but she is adamant in her opinion and stated that she will not ever change her view on this subject.

We've come within inches of breaking up, but we always end up staying together because we still love each other.  But I'm killing her, almost literally.  She's been losing sleep, missing meals, and taking more and more medication each night.  I don't know what to do any more.  If you've read this far, thank you so much for taking the time to read this.  If you have any advice to spare, you can post it below or send me a message.  I need help with this, because I seriously don't know what to do anymore and things cannot continue as they are.

Thanks again,

I grew up in a household that alternated between being extremely controlling and extremely negligent. My parents (as they often repeated throughout my childhood) chose a neighborhood where there weren't any other children because they thought children were stupid and could be a bad influence, anyways. My mother always parroted that she was a ""stay-at-home mom"" and an endless number of platitudes from Dr. Laura about how she was defending me from immoral influences. Despite this, I was almost always alone as a child, left to my own devices. This pattern continued through middle school and high school- we always lived in neighborhoods that were predominantly for retirement and I always was alone. I don't recall ever really having friends growing up and I didn't have my first date until I was 21. I didn't really learn to have relationships with other people or any of a number of life skills- for example, I literally just learned to use an oven LAST WEEK (ie this year, at 27.) I asked people for years to teach me and no one bothered. 

I didn't own a functional car (I had an old lemon that smoked when I drove for a while) until last year. I rode the train 50+ miles round trip to college then grad school because it was what my mother suggested. I didn't really have much of a choice because I couldn't find a job that was more than a few hours a week. To this day, my parents insist that I should be thankful they paid for that- instead of noticing the obvious, that I was forced to waste about 4-6 hours a day on what could have been a couple hours max roundtrip commute. They dictated that because I chose psyc as a freshman in community college, I had to finish that degree as quick as possible, even though I wanted to switch to business pretty early on. They said they were paying for it, they set the rules. (I later found out they weren't paying for it at all- because we were low income, the State of California paid for the vast majority of it.) Because I couldn't get anywhere else, I completed my undergrad ""internship"" at a nursing home on my bus route, doing activities with people with Alzheimer's. I would later get a minimum wage job at the place, doing the same thing. I'm still doing the same thing years later- albeit for $15/hr- with a Master's (most people who do this type of job have HS diploma or GED) because it's the only type of work I've ever done. I btw, was pressured by mother to get a Master's when I really just wanted to get a vocational degree after my BA because she thought it would sound more impressive. It is useless as dirt, as I always thought it would be.

About 2 years ago, I found out what I always suspected- that there's something VERY wrong with my parents. I found out my elderly father- who previously claimed to be a virgin until his 50s- actually was previously married and divorced. He had 3 kids and one of them reached out to me on Facebook. He essentially abandoned his children when they were in elementary school and ran off with my mother, his secretary. I confronted them about this and it didn't bother either of them. My father told me coldly that they weren't his children, he didn't raise them, and that they made out with plenty of money from their mother. My mother told me if I gave that much of a shit about it, I should go somewhere else and starve.

So this is the embittering setup of the last couple years. After I found out about how thoroughly my parents had lied to me, I began drinking pretty heavily. This ironically helped get me on a better path because I started doing things that felt like a huge risk- like randomly messaging girls through online dating services, going out and meeting new people, risking rejection in a lot of settings. I now have a steady gf who I'd like to marry if I can ever get an ok-ish job and I started going to a synagogue. (My family has kind of Jewish roots but they were always downplayed because my father became a born again Christian early in life. This was a HUGE  risk for me because my father is more or less an anti-semite- the LAST thing you're allowed to call him is a Jew- even though his family background makes it very obvious he IS one- because to him Jews are wealthy, ugly bankers, a total Other. But I went out there, converted anyways and now have a totally different peer group.)

Three months ago, my mother started a huge fight with me because I didn't celebrate Christmas. We NEVER celebrated Christmas after I reached middle school or so because my parents thought it was a waste of time. I quickly realized she was drunk out of her mind. I later found out my father had received a cancer diagnosis days earlier and he told my mother that day.

Since then, he's lost nearly 80 lbs. He has a late stage gastrointestinal cancer. He is slowly dying behind me right now- I can hear his food tube cranking away a few times a minute. 

My mother has been getting crazier than I've ever seen her in my life (and she's prone to wild, angry outbursts.) She tried to tell me I should give her money, so she could take out a life insurance policy on herself and I'll have an ""investment."" I'm not going to do this. She now dominates the living room constantly, where she's calling people and talking about how fucked she is. She expects me to do the majority of his care if things get worse because ""he doesn't have anyone else."" This ignores, of course, that he would have other people, if he hadn't been such a lowlife or if they had tried a little harder to have plans in place.

I just want to fly away from this mess, whenever my father passes (and really, before that, if I can.) To tell the truth, I feel little to no empathy for these controlling, bizarre people, who've kept me from having a normal life and now want me to pamper them as their beloved son. I've saved every cent I could from working- literally well over a year's wages- knowing my whole life I've wanted a ton of cash i case I needed to bail.

I'm just scared. My family moved to Orange County, CA for my Dad's retirement (yes, you read that correctly- we moved to one of the most expensive markets in the world, as renters, so my Dad could have a nice RETIREMENT.) I can't afford rent in this area. I think I need to go back to school to get real skills. I feel like I have no social skills- I've spent months networking now and I still feel like I don't know anyone. I want to move out with my gf but I distrust women instinctively. My mother is a very nasty, sarcastic woman and I always think I see hints of those traits in the women I date. I've had a few times when I thought I saw the same traits in my gf but it was based on misunderstandings. But I would hate myself if I trusted her and she took advantage of me."
4cfb5i,2,2016-03-29,Advice from those who have overcome multiple injuries?,lgoasklucyl,running,https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/4cfb5i/advice_from_those_who_have_overcome_multiple/,"Good morning!

Once again, as spring blooms, I find my feet yearning to pound some pavement. This year, however, I want to do things right. Over the last five or so years, I have suffered some degree of ""season"" ending injury rendering me unable to continue my training - achilles, knee, ITB, etc... issues, at least two which resulting in physical therapy lasting 4+ months.

My question to you, /r/running (those who have had similar experiences, if you're out there!), is: what did you change that finally helped you get over the hurdle of pervasive injuries?

About me/my history:
Feet are flat as all holy hell. I've seen doctors/specialist running shops about this. After a less than adequate insert did little to help, I ended up running with the Superfeet Black, which I now wear all day long, which seemed to provide the best support.

I've been fitted at a running store multiple times (video/gait analysis, whole nine yards). The first pair of shoes didn't work so hot, but I ended up in a pair which seemed to result in minimal discomfort. I was willing to drop the extra money on a pair that may finally resolve the injury issues - these seemed to work best.

I was training mostly for 5ks. My avg time was pretty awful for my age, coming in around 27 minutes for a 24-27 yo male. My longest run ever was around 8 miles, completely on accident, due to a GPS mishap. My longest average runs (I could do consistently, at a slow pace, and feel not dead) were around 4 miles. I always try to run less/slower when training, but my competitive nature tends to result in me feeling worse about running slow than not running - resulting in me quickening my pace (undoubtedly something I need to work on). I suppose running without RunKeeper constantly blabbering about my pace may be useful, but then how could I ever prove to myself that I actually ran the distance?! (kidding, sort of).

Physical specs: 6' even, ~165-170 lb depending on the week. Not super active lately, due to grad school + internship + work, but am graduating in May - opening up a bunch more time to train.

Any advice would be incredibly appreciated. Cross-training ideas, strength building ideas, anything that worked for anyone in finally overcoming the repeated training inhibiting/ending injuries. Thanks in advance!!!"

(Particularly, in the field of AI development, Integrated Circuits, Automation, etc) Ohio State is such a good research university, so I want to take advantage of that while I can. I also really want to branch out into new fields, and see what interest me and what doesn't. My internships have leaned more towards software engineering, and not towards computer engineering work.

* Does anyone have experience doing undergraduate research here? 

* I've read a bit into it, but what exactly is the process?  

* Any experience with the CSE/ECE fields I've listed? 

* Do professors typically only take students with higher GPAs, or would my internship experience be an acceptable substitute? 

* Do the credit hours for research courses apply towards my directed electives? 

* And do you need to be in Honors to graduate with Research distinction?

* Any experience with doing research over Maymester? Is that too short of a time span, or is that for students who want to continue research into the summer?

4cfmwn,44,2016-03-29,A hard truth for career-minded INFP's: Networking is everything.,mookie8,infp,https://www.reddit.com/r/infp/comments/4cfmwn/a_hard_truth_for_careerminded_infps_networking_is/,"Networking.

It isn't just knowing a friend of friend, and waiting six months for a get-together where you may or may not hand over a business card depending how the rapport goes. It is consistently and clearly making your credentials (or your desire to gain credentials) heard and remembered.

Here's some tips.

* **Building a web of experience in whatever field you're interested in:**
Volunteer. I cannot stress this enough. Volunteering for an organization or company related to your interests gives you automatic connections to people actively working in the field. It gives you a sense of what is desirable in a worker, and it gives you an idea of what works and doesn't work in your field. In the future, if you do get employed, you can clean up a lot of existing work-problems knowing what you know and impressing your colleagues. It gives you a nice boost on the resume, and surely everybody knows somebody.

* **Advice:**
Ask for advice, regularly. I know they taught this shit in high school, but we didn't take it seriously. Yes you can talk to counselors and employment officers and they do have wonderful resources, but they can't sell your credentials for you. You have to meet people, and if their career strikes a chord with yours, ask them about it. Ask how you can get into that field. Most people are very open to these questions. Now lets say you're an introvert with no friends, no social circle, and paralyzed with anxiety at the thoughts of meeting new people. Look up some contacts in the careers you're interested in, even if it's on the company website and they're a total stranger, and shoot them an email. (I have some example emails if anybody is interested, just PM me). Instead of framing it as ""I wanna be you, plz hire me"", make it more of a two-way exchange. ""If possible, would you be able to forward me a contact that I can refer to in order to learn more about this field and... blah blah"". People want to help, most people have had to look for a job at some point. They can relate. 

* **Shadowing:**
This is related to the advice one above. If you're able to shadow someone in your field (consensually of course, haha) that is a GREAT boost! You're in! People know your name, know that you're interested, and may keep you in mind for internships and future employment. And it actually works. I used to work in an HR office at a large university, this kid came in to the front desk and asked if he could speak to someone about job-shadowing or unpaid internships. The receptionist called out one of our managers, they met, and the next day I saw the kid doing some work in her office. Brave steps like that can take you far. (Although fyi, I find that most people prefer email requests over in-person and over the phone. Yet when you email you run the risk of them forgetting to reply to you).

* **LinkedIN:**
It works. Even if your experience is purely volunteer based, it will make you a viable person of interest and connect you to the people actively working in that field. You can really elaborate beyond the limits of a two page resume, and it's really here you can sell yourself to your standards. And if you put a picture up, my god make sure it's a professional one. Not some selfie you'd put up on OKcupid. 

* **Business Cards:**
Honestly they're not that expensive, and I know a lot of professional jobless people who hand out business cards. They don't all need job titles. 

* **Social Media:**
Networking on social media is a thing, and of course works. I can't elaborate much more on that because I'm still social media shy. But most importantly- CLEAN UP YOUR SOCIAL MEDIA! Make sure your settings are on friends only, and remove any immature photos or posts, etc.

* **Consistency:**
If you're able to build an exchange with someone, remind them consistently but not overwhelmingly with your existence. Don't harass them, but every now and then send a signal. Also, networking should NOT be something you do every six months. It should be activated regularly. It might take us out of our comfort zones, but talking to people regularly might very well create our career track. 

* **Talk to people. Talk to people. Talk to people**

For example:

My best friend got her MA in gender studies, and dreams of working with immigrant/emigrant women and refugees. She has the communication and language skills to actually be able to do this. She is most definitely NOT an INFP. She's extroverted but serious, business-type and professional to the point of being anal-retentive. And she's passionate. It was hard and bewildering for her to see me, an artsy flake, flounder in my career opportunities. Being friends with her is the reason I'm so passionate about the idea of networking. It's just so hard for INFP's to do. So she had her MA in gender studies, but no experience beyond some field work for her thesis. She started volunteering at immigration centres, and started visiting conferences throughout the city regarding women's issues. She embedded herself in the community, and people knew who she was. During the summer she went to Egypt and volunteered for an NGO. Her day job was a janitor, but all her extracurricular time was going into her field of interest. She job shadowed an employee at a refugee centre. Eventually she was being invited to other conferences. She emailed people in various agencies for advice, and not only did they give her advice, they gave her other connections and even some interviews. She volunteered at women's shelters. And today she's leaving for a new job in Europe, to help manage an organization working with refugees.

Networking is so important. And INFP's can be so withdrawn and selective as to who they open up to. All I'm saying is that career-wise, you may need to throw caution to the wind and be brave. So many INFP's don't know where to go, what to do, in their careers. Many of us don't even know what we want! The job of our dreams isn't going to land on our laps. Networking doesn't necessarily mean we must be extroverted and gregarious, it is about building up your credentials through various means other than education, and sharing them with as many people as possible. 

INFP's may not be able to adequately sell ourselves, but we are able to ask for guidance. People want to be teachers, let us reach out to them.

I was told Iowa Lakes is a good solution but I don't see anything about whether or not their exams are proctored.   This is my last calc class (my last ""weed out"" class too), I have a full-time offer from my place of internship pending me not being a total jerk over the summer, and I really just want an easy C that I can transfer into ISU so I don't have to worry about going an extra semester and ruining my very probable full-time position offer.

I need to to be able to connect an old hard drive that has all his data on it, yes, I told him to back up everything before I took apart his old one but apparently there is some stuff that's missing.  Can I just simply plug in this hard drive or is there another step to it, I have the OS installed on a different drive but I'm somewhat nervous because in the past when I've tried to hook up old drives to pull data from them I've always been told by the computer I have to reformat them, any way around the reformatting?"

I graduate in May, and am moving across the country (NJ/NY to CA) in June to start working my dream job. I'm extremely excited about it, but I'm also pretty nervous. See, all my friends are pretty much going to Boston at this point, or at least staying on the east coast. And they're not the best at reaching out or anything. But even regardless of that, I need to make friends in Cali also.

When you first go to college, everybody's looking for friends. Then after that, there are clubs and friends of friends and you hang out with your friends and do homework and whatnot all the time. It's easy. But going to a new city where plenty of people are already settled and happy? Of course, I can make work friends. I know many people already, since I was an intern last year. But at 22, I'm much younger than many of the people I work with. There are the other new grads, a few of whom I know already, and of course I have my roommate whom I'm friends with. I don't think I see a problem with making friends at work, but what about beyond that? All your friends can't be work friends, right? I guess I can make more friends through them, but even so. I just can't figure out the concept of how to make new friends. 

I'm shy at first with people I don't know when there aren't lots of people I'm comfortable around, but I can work through it. I could go out and try to like... go to things that go on? I'm just not really sure what to do and would really like some advice from people who have gone through this before."

[Aside from what they're accused of, what are the defendants like as people?  What do they think about the trial - do they participate, do they think there's a chance they could win and get released?  What do they think about you and military members representing them, given that you all work for the US government?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4cfixn/i_am_james_connell_defense_attorney_in_the/d1hqvzw?context=5)|Because they are people, they all have different opinions and different personalities.  Al Baluchi would not meet with me at all for two years, until I got an order from the military judge to meet him in [Camp 7](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-23771851).  I am still the only lawyer to ever meet a prisoner in Camp 7.  After that time, he has become a full partner in his defense, which he sees as important even if the USG will not release him if acquitted.
 |Al Baluchi, who I know best, speaks excellent English, understands American legal and pop culture, and is humorous.  In the arraignment, when the judge asked if al Baluchi understood that the trial could go on without him if he escaped, he said that he would be sure to leave a note.  But he also suffers a great deal from the effects of his torture, and his #1 goal is to get torture rehabilitation.
[If you were to direct a journalist to a good, undiscovered discussion about Gitmo, what would it be?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4cfixn/i_am_james_connell_defense_attorney_in_the/d1hqgqa?context=5)|One item that has received no real attention is the classification of the memories of detainees.  The USG maintains that the prisoners' own memories of where they were and who interrogated them is classified.  How can the USG classify the thoughts of a person who has not signed an NDA?  I would love to see a journalist ask relevant players to explain that one.
 |As a starting place, this issue came up at the Committee Against Torture review of the United States in November 2014, but the US dodged the question.  That says to me that some international torture experts are thinking about the problem.
[What advice would have for a high school student who wants to go into law (specifically International Law\)? ](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4cfixn/i_am_james_connell_defense_attorney_in_the/d1hsukr?context=5)|Right now, go check out your school's debate team.  Among other things, my eight years of debate gave me ""argument sense,"" a deep understanding of how arguments work and don't work.
 |Also right now, take French.  French and English are the languages of international law.
 |Longer term, look for internships that involve international law.  The international NGOs depend on interns for a lot of their work, and offer a lot of opportunities.  To eventually get a job in the field, you will need to demonstrate a commitment to international law, and internships are a great way to do that.
[How did you wind up practicing law at Gueneonomo Bay? ](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4cfixn/i_am_james_connell_defense_attorney_in_the/d1hsplj?context=5)|I was a death penalty attorney based in Virginia.  In 2008, I had a minor involvement in the first iteration of the military commissions, all in the background.  But when the law changed in 2009 to require death penalty attorneys for a death penalty case, they remembered and asked me to take the case.  I refused at first, but was eventually swayed by the promise of spending full time on one case, which I had always wanted to do.  I have worked full-time on the one Guantanamo case since 2011.
[Why exactly is the case taking so long, and is there anything you think could be done to fix that?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4cfixn/i_am_james_connell_defense_attorney_in_the/d1hpgir?context=5)|Main factor on time so far has been government intrusions into the defense camp in such a way that the judge has to respond.  We have spent a lot of time, and cancelled hearings, dealing with FBI investigations of the defense counsel, listening devices, etc.
[Are military commissions just fundamentally unfair to the defendants in your view, or is there anything you think could be done to fix that?  For that matter, is there any reason to have them at all in your opinion?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4cfixn/i_am_james_connell_defense_attorney_in_the/d1hpgir?context=5)|I don't think there is much of a reason to have military commissions.  The US has a perfectly good court-martial system which can try war crimes if federal courts are not available for some reason.  The military commissions are a hybrid of federal courts and courts-martial specially designed to convict in this trial.
[What do you think the best way to rehabilitate ex-Guantanamo bay detainees is?  How do you think countries around the globe should go about preventing radicalisation?  How long do you think it will be before Guantanamo closes?  Thank you for doing this AMA, it's incredibly interesting!](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4cfixn/i_am_james_connell_defense_attorney_in_the/d1hp3t4?context=5)|For rehabilitation, you need a multipronged approach, including trauma treatment, family reunification, medical treatment, language skills, and some initial financial support.  I was lucky enough to visit the Kuwait rehabilitation facility, and though it was a good effort. Radicalization is such a huge question I barely feel qualified.  One overlooked aspect however is the idea of engrenage, in which countries play into terrorists hands by adopting repressive/militaristic solutions which radicalize additional population. No idea on GTMO closure.
[What happened to the other released detainees? Where were they sent?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4cfixn/i_am_james_connell_defense_attorney_in_the/d1hnjlw?context=5)|There are 91 men still held at Guantanamo; most have been released by either the Bush or Obama Administrations.  Most were sent to their home countries, but some were sent to third countries, including Bermuda, Uruguay, and Bosnia.
 |The Miami Herald has a [map](http://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation-world/world/americas/guantanamo/article54641060.html) of third countries which have accepted detainees.
[You are working at Guantanamo Bay, it was a fairly heavy day: what do you do for the night to relax?  What is the personal life like while working there?  Ever have people see you as the opposition?  Does that make it hard to socialize?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4cfixn/i_am_james_connell_defense_attorney_in_the/d1hoor9?context=5)|The traditional military/diplomatic choices are hunk, chunk, and drunk.  There is not much to do, so you can work out, eat, or drink. They do have free outdoor movies (not for prisoners) at Guantanamo.  I like to run to the movie, watch it, then run back.
 |There is one bar at Guantanamo, and in my experience, people don't tend to discuss their jobs with strangers.  My office, which consists mostly of military, but some civilians, socializes a lot together at Guantanamo.
[Thank you for the AMA. What's the hardest part about representing such a highly known and despised person? What's it like having a client portrayed through such a known movie?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4cfixn/i_am_james_connell_defense_attorney_in_the/d1hs9cr?context=5)|The hardest part, full stop, is being away from my family with all the constant travel.  I can't say that my client is highly known or despised, as most people have never heard of him.  Like I did in the title, I usually try to introduce him through the connection to ZD30, which is well-known at least in the US.  So I find the movie connection generally helpful to give people some sense of who he is.
[In your opinion should the trials be transferred to a civilian court in the United States?  While highly unlikely that the detention facility at Guantanamo closes during the remainder of Obamas Presidency, do you think it will close under the next administration? ](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4cfixn/i_am_james_connell_defense_attorney_in_the/d1ho8gi?context=5)|There is currently no plan to try anyone from Guantanamo in a civilian trial.  The President's current proposal is to transfer them to the US for trial in a military commission.  As you say, this seems politically unlikely.
 |What will happen under the next Administration is anyone's guess.  I have sometimes entertained a theory that only a Republican can closed Guantanamo, sort of like only Nixon could go to China.  But we will see.
[How did you wind up on this case ?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4cfixn/i_am_james_connell_defense_attorney_in_the/d1hntnu?context=5)|From 2003 on, I was a death penalty attorney in Virginia.  In 2008, NGOs were looking for civilian attorneys to work in President Bush's military commissions, and I had a minor, behind-the-scenes role.  In 2011, after President Obama restarted the military commissions, they were looking for full-time attorneys and remembered me from Round 1.
[What are the risks associated with processing people in a civilian or military system? I could see secret evidence being a problem in the civilian context, as the military would need to protect its sources.](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4cfixn/i_am_james_connell_defense_attorney_in_the/d1hs1d1?context=5)|Both civilian and military systems have protections for classified evidence: the Classified Information Procedure Act for federal court, Military Rule of Evidence 505 in courts-martial, and Military Commission Rule of Evidence 505 in the military commissions.  It is a balancing between national security and the right to defend oneself.  It is easier for my office than some others because we all have security clearances.
[Hi, what were you given to eat for a daily base? Were you able to cook your own meals? Any grocery stores?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4cfixn/i_am_james_connell_defense_attorney_in_the/d1hpmmp?context=5)|Guantanamo has a Navy Exchange, which is a combination of a grocery store and a department store.  I am usually lucky enough to be in a room with a kitchenette, so I can cook.  People who are not so lucky go to one of the galleys (Navy for cafeteria) or fast food/restaurant.

But there is the possibility of strategic intelligence (""what is your perspective on this?""), which can only come from rapport-building and trust.

4cg66l,3,2016-03-29,Huge under-the-hood update coming,gubatron,FrostWire,https://www.reddit.com/r/FrostWire/comments/4cg66l/huge_underthehood_update_coming/,"**To all FrostWire+P2P Geeks and Coders who want to join us**

We've been working hard this past month on bringing up to speed our jlibtorrent bittorrent library, this should help make the library work even better across more android devices and desktop computers. Lots of issues were solved by the libtorrent team, and many other issues were found by java developers outside FrostWire who are already using jlibtorrent in production.

If you are an app developer, and you think your users could benefit from some behind-the-scenes bittorrent based p2p networking we strongly suggest you take a look at JLibTorrent, it's open source, it's free, and it's battle tested on millions of devices. The more computers we can get to join the DHT, the more we all gain. 

As time passes and the libtorrent contributors keep working we are closer to having the largest and robust DHT network of the internet be IPv6 compatible and we're super excited about the possibilities for peer to peer computing this will bring, perhaps we'll be able to say good bye to those annoying NAT issues and take advantage of the DHT network in ways we've dreamed of the last half a decade.

**Insanely Fast Audio Demuxing**

Android users downloading large audio files from videos in YouTube will have a much much pleasant experience towards the ends of their downloads.

When YouTube sourced mp4  videos are downloaded for the purposes of audio by your FrostWire client, FrostWire extracts the audio portions of the file to create a new .m4a file (which is way better than an mp3), this process is called ""demuxing""

We noticed this process was taking too long and also using more memory than necessary. Our awesome @aldenml senior developer took the time to ditch the mp4 library we were using for demuxing and rewrote the demuxing code from scratch with efficiency in mind and the results are amazing. What once could've taken over 5 minutes in the case of large videos, now takes just a few seconds. We have not yet done proper benchmarking, but it's several orders of magnitude faster and now memory usage is capped to a non-blocking buffer of memory.

**Improved/Easier to Maintain Music Player**

Since February I've been working on a very challenging refactor branch that deals with eliminating a ton of repeated code on the audio player. In the process I've lost count of how many bugs were fixed with the audio player user experience.
You should now see consistent menus and actions across the UI,  less crashes, and since there's less code from all this work our installer should be even smaller now. Less is more.

We are now expecting to move faster when it comes to fixing issues on the player now that I'm more familiar with the codebase, and now making a fix will be a lot easier as the abstractions used allow us to reuse code and make changes in a single place not in 10 places.

**Song/File selection dialog**

If you were ever so curious to past a SoundCloud Playlist URL, of a playlist that has tracks marked as ""Downloadable"" by content creators, you probably saw a dialog that showed you all the tracks FrostWire was about to download.

We had an intern (@votaguz) do some work on this dialog and now it supports checkboxes and radiobuttons, so now you will be able to pick and chose what songs will be downloaded from a soundcloud playlist.

I'm in the process of integrating this powerful dialog with BitTorrent downloads so that you can pick and chose what files from a .torrent you want to download once FrostWire has fetched a .torrent file from a server or from the DHT.

**Search architecture revamp**

We've simplified, optimized and enhanced our search code so that we can finally offer you things like filtering, grouping and sorting of search results, expect a much improved search experience and not getting lost in many results with innovative tools we're currently experimenting in further releases.

**Want to work with FrostWire?**

We are looking for smart developers not afraid to code in different programming languages and tackle tough challenges. If you're looking for impact in the number of users your code will be running on, you'll probably have more impact on FrostWire than on a big company like Facebook or Google if you join us, we're a smaller team and your contributions will be more significant.

We work with: Java, Python, C/C++, bash, Ubuntu, MacOSX, Windows 10, Android, AWS, Git, Github, gradle, reddit, slack.

We don't care where you are, we just want you to breathe and love coding and understanding how operating systems, programming languages, garbage collectors, memory management, networks, compilers and runtimes work. If you have a passion for freedom of speech, no censorship and making the world a better place you will love working with us. And did we mention we don't have formal schedules? We're a worldwide team of coders, testers, writers, graphic designers, marketers trying to make the internet a more distributed network that empowers content creators and consumers worldwide.

We don't want your resume, we want you to start sending pull requests to see if you have what it takes, we don't want your Pull requests for free, we pay for them in Bitcoin. If you're interested [join us on github](http://github.com/frostwire/frostwire/issues) and try to tackle one of those, try our apps on desktop or android, find something you don't like and fix it, code speaks louder than fancy resumes."

I did get a few useful comments which made me think that perhaps, you guys had been ideas of how to deal with my current problems.

So, here is my original post:

----------------------------
Here is how I think:

- I like being objectified by men, so that when men look at me with desire, I don't feel disgusted and instead, I enjoy the attention
- I am able to make a difference between short-term relationships (like one night stands) and long-term ones (like my husband), so that going to a swingers club isn't a problem with me.
- Because we are unstable emotionally and we are mostly incapable of expressing ourselves clearly compared to men, I feel like we are somewhat inferior to them
- I also feel like men shouldn't be restrained, that what is interesting to me in a man is his manliness, and as such, I do not ask my husband to be monogamous with me. I feel like an Alpha male is what is attractive to me.
- Because of all of those thoughts, I feel like I can only thrive being a submissive to my husband

As a result, I have adjusted my behavior and tried to be more direct, less manipulative. I read the book ""The Surrendered Wife"" and it helped me a lot. I feel a lot more at peace in my couple.

And yet, most women I know feel like women are superior to men, but they are usually incapable of even telling their husband what they want and instead, imply it, manipulate, etc... 

Worse, they seem to think that being manipulative and to imply things are defining feminine characteristics, that it defines who they are as a person.

I am surrounded by staunch feminists who bash men without clear reasons. They also seem to look or date only beta males who they boss around.

In conclusion, I know that other women are different from me in those beliefs and behaviors, but my question is: Is this a question of education? Is this something hormonal or hereditary?

Just because of those differences, I am unable to talk to other women. I feel like just saying 1% of my thinking will get me lapidated.

A therapist I consulted implied I was being abused by my husband... and yet, these thoughts are often resisted by him! They came from my observation of men and women in relation to each other.

How can I strike a balance of being myself, and feeling safe around other people, especially after a therapist wanted to almost intern me for thinking like that."

(Incoming potato english, native french speaker. Forgive my mistakes)

Hi,

First of all, I want to say a major congratulations to everyone here who have started losing weight, or are thinking of starting.

So, I wanted to write this because I know weight loss can be terrifying, stressful and, let's face it, long. Sharing my own journey is also, according to my therapist, a good way of exorcising my demons.

**Prologue**

For the longest time in my life, I've been fat. As a child, I was lonely and had not many friends, so I wasn't active and eating was, like many of you I'm sure, a good coping mechanism. I kept gaining, and gaining, and gaining. 

I finally weighed myself at 22 or 23, when I first got a gym membership : 335 pounds. The brain is a weird thing : back when I was fat, I never thought I was THAT fat. I tried to rationalize it a lot, probably as a defence mechanism. ""Oh, at least I can run. Oh, I'm big but I'm strong"", and so on. 

One of my major hobby in life is fashion. I love it. But I was too fat to indulge in it. I was the kind of guy who cried in the fitting rooms while trying size 48 jeans. 

So, I kept getting sadder and sadder. I hated myself. I hated the way I was, the way I looked. I hated every single cell in my body. I felt trapped in a prison made of flesh. And fat. So, last year, in March 2015, after I came back home from an internship in Washington DC, I decided it was enough. I downed 16 oz of Jack Daniels with a handful of pills, feeling it was my salvation, my only way out. I woke up in the hospital, with my stomach purged. My landlord had found me, when she came to fix something in my apartment.

**The Journey** 

When I got out of the hospital, I knew what was the root of my unhappiness : my fat ass. And if I couldn't die to solve the problem, might as well work on it. That's when I joined /r/loseit. Without you guys, I know I wouldn't have made it.

So I downloaded MFP, I bought a pair of running shoes, and I started to do something about it.

First, I worked on my diet. I wasn't eating bad per se, but I was eating wayyyyy to much. Through trial and error, I figured out what worked for me : a complete and draconian overhaul of my diet, no cheating allowed. For the first few months, I was eating chicken, brown rice and broccoli every single day, 2 meals a day. I'd have 2 eggs and a dry piece of toast for breakfast.

Then I started running in my neighbourhood. I started my doing a 2 kilometers loop around my apartment. I was hard; my lungs were full of fire and my whole body wanted to give up. But I persevered. Every single day, I'd run. Then I made it to 3 kilometers a day.

And the pounds were falling off. Fast. I could lose about 7 pounds a week at this time. In June, so 2 months after the beginning of my weight loss, I was assessing my goals, what I wanted to be. My body is genetically engineered to be strong. I have thick bones, broad shoulders and a big back. I decided I didn't want to be small, or skinny. I wanted to be strong.

So I got back to the gym. Got myself a trainer and I grinded. Six days a week, 90 minutes per training. 

**The Aftermath**

Overall, it took me 10 months to shed 135 pounds. I reached my goal in Feburary 2016. Sure, it wasn't always easy, but I made it through. Then, I realized something. Even if I lost the weight, I wasn't happy. People would comment on my weight loss, congratulating me, telling me what an amazing feat it was. 

I refused to believe them. Even if I can wear size 34 Levi's 511s, or medium shirts, I couldn't see the results, as if the image of fat me was burned inside my head, like a static image gets burned in a plasma TV. I said earlier that the brain was a funny thing : it didn't allow me to see me as I was now. Even in public, I was still fat. On the bus, I'd try to take as little space as possible, even if I don't take much space anymore. 

And there's the dreaded excess skin. This loose, striped, soft flesh that hangs from my belly, my thighs and makes my butt look like ruffled chips. A reminder of what I used to be. 

Even if you try to run away from what you were, you'll be constantly reminded of the stuff you hated about you : pictures, old habits, comments from friends and acquaintances, and so on.

So, I took the advice I was given on this sub and I started going to a therapist. It helps me regaining control over my body and my image. I may not be happier right now, but I try to be. When I started running, I was running away from something. I was running away from my self loathing, I was running away from the urge to take my own life. 

Now, I'm not running away anymore. I feel that I'm running towards something. And when I lift, I'm not simply lifting weights. I'm lifting myself above the pain and the sadness. 

It was my birthday on Sunday. I realized, as I was turning 29, that I'd been unhappy my entire life. It's hard to realize you've never been happy, even as a fit, muscular person. But this new body of mine is like a blank canvas. I can use it to build something better. I can use it to rebuild myself. To take away every single drop of sadness inside of me, and to be what I've always wanted to be : one happy motherfucker.

I promise that one day, I will be happy.

People doubted me and made me feel worthless. Didn't give up and landed a job.**

I never thought I would get a chance to write this. I started to believe you all and I'm glad that I didn't give into your negativity. For the past year I've been working so hard to save money and look for work in my field. They said trying to find work as an undergrad would be hard, but I never thought it would mean going to countless interviews (15 to be exact) only to be turned down for ""being too young"" even though the age requirement was for 18 and above and ""perfect for undergraduates studying x"". The best excuse was ""Well, you have everything we are looking for but are deciding to hire someone whos a couple years older than you"". 

Anyway, when I wasn't on dead end interviews, I was working at a department store. Man is that hell on your self esteem. Countless weekends I come home ready to give up because customers are ruthless and self-centered. 

**""What do you mean you don't have my size? You're lying, I want to speak to an older associate/manager""**

**""You're working here because you plan on being a college drop out right?""**

**""People of your age and color don't deserve to be making as much as others if you work like this""**

 Sorry I cant magically make product appear on the shelves for you, I would if I could because it means you would leave the store faster. Sorry that college actually costs money and I am working my ass of to pay my tuition. Sorry that I'm not old enough for you to trust me that we don't have a size in the backroom.

I was at my wits end was starting to accept that I wasn't going to amount to anything. My classmates were getting recognized for amazing research they've done, accepted to top programs, while I struggled to get by and couldn't find anything. My parents started to doubt me and said that I need to consider saving up money to move out. My friends suggested I would be better off in another major. 

But to me, I wanted something more. I didn't want to work retail forever, I didn't want to constantly be seen as a number and color. So I applied one last time, doing something I never thought I would wanna do. I get a call for an interview thanks to a friend who believed in me and put her name on the line for me just to get an interview. I aced the interview and my friend called me so excited to tell me that I got the job. 

I was speechless, and all I thought of was all the people who said I couldn't do it, that I should give up. I finally did it, I proved I could achieve something if I worked hard enough. I proved that if I put my mind to it, I could get through anything. Now I cant wait to go into work tonight and put my two weeks. I cant wait to tell everyone who said it wasn't possible that it is possible. To my friend who believed in me and put herself on the line for me, you're a true friend and I hope your life is filled with happiness and success. Reddit, I did it.

With this being the case, what are some things I can do to in the next year?
I'll continue to work a full time job so I'll have double the PCE. I'm on the fence about retaking classes since CASPA will count the original and repeated anyways, but I'm up for the challenge if it's worth it.

At the same time, I don't want to abandon the career because it interests me very much. There's a few things I'd like to know, both for reassurance and to better gear myself towards knowing exactly whether I am prepared or not.

1. For your first job on the field, how did you manage to get it? 
2. Was there a learning curve you needed to follow, and did your work environment help you go through that learning process?
3. What kind of education did you have when you started working on the field? Did you have to go back to school later on?
4. Today, what does a regular work day sound like? Is the workload constant, or is it more of a thing where work drifts in occasionally?
5. What skills should I be refining as I continue studying languages? Should I adopt a main language while practicing my other languages?
6. If i were to apply for your position, what kind of projects should I work on my free time to work on a portfolio?
7. What kind of entry level work or internships do you suggest to do that'll make me shine on paper despite being young without experience in the field?
8. Did you ever feel like you didn't belong as a programmer among other programmers? How did you overcome that feeling?

I appreciate any and all feedback. If you can answer just one of these questions it'd be a great help. 

EDIT: Just read through these responses, thanks a lot to everyone who answered my questions. I will definitely be taking each person's input into account."
4chhzr,2,2016-03-29,"Ex [23F] of almost 1.5years, broke up with me [24M] in first relation, saying she stopped loving me.",Cbxu,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4chhzr/ex_23f_of_almost_15years_broke_up_with_me_24m_in/,"I met my ex when she came on exchange. She had a boyfriend and I knew about it, and wanted to stay friends. 2 months after meeting, suddenly we both felt like we needed to be together; she broke up with him choosing for me (I know, red flag). This being my first relation [24M] and her [23F] I felt that she was ""the one"".

Before she went home we dated for 7 months, before I found an internship and went to Japan to do this internship. one month into the internship she came back to Japan, and so we were together there for 4 months.

After those 4 months I went back to my country for university, and after that; things started to go downhill. My school didn't help anything in progress and I kind of got down myself. Knowing she had a depression I tried to stay cheerful; but I might have been trying to hard to be cheerful, getting dragged down by her. Ever since I got back, she changed back to her old/new habits as well; and slowly but surely she changed, I noticed it but thought I could've been temporarily. It wasn't, which I now finally understand. 

Fast forward: In February she came over for a whole month, and I thought she had the time of her life with me. wrong again. she didn't want to have any sexual contact, no hugs, no kisses, laying in bed unless I said we were going somewhere, not trying to be attractive.... yet because of my love for her I told her I love her right like this. and somehow I offended her and I apologized for whatever I said wrong. basically she emotionally shut herself off of me. I happened to see her scrolling in her photos and there were a few pictures of an unknown guy which she scrolled back and forth whenever I wasn't watching; yet I do not believe she was cheating on me..... at least not physically (maybe emotionally) at that time. and before she went home, I suddenly realized that I was being a doormat, she ordered me to do things and I did exactly as she said.

End of February, she went back to Japan, and ignored me for almost 2 weeks only to break up with me through skype. She said ""I don't love you anymore, I want to go back to being friends"" it was a major shock, and I'm still analyzing things (I should stop that), yet it might be what I thought it was and left me because she connected emotionally to someone else. However the Japanese are very closed about relationships, so I probably will never know. 

At first I said I didn't want to break up, but confirming that she probably wouldn't get back those feelings I accepted the break up, and said goodbye ""For now"" and went NC on her ever since (2 weeks), but it hurts because I still love her and seeing all lines of communication are open so she could contact me any time. Yet, I am slowly stopping to hope, and I'm healing myself too; so it might be for the better) I'm also not looking on her social media channels / blog just to make sure I'm not influenced on my healing process. 
I also wrote a letter, just to avoid contacting her, because I do actually keep wanting to contact her.

I must seem desperate, but I start to gain back my own dignity as well. I am sure she will regret it someday, because I know that not many men try to stay with someone depressed who hides the fact until after they reeled them in.

TL;DR I met this Japanese girl, were friends, unintentionally stole from her ex-boyfriend because felt like ""the one"" being first relationship, found out she suffered from depression yet dated for 1.5 years, broke up after visiting me again. 

Do you think she left me for someone else like she did before &amp; am I stupid to feel like I still have some (false) hope left to get her back?"

For those unfamiliar with Turing, it is an honors CS program that admits roughly 40-50 students per year.  The classes are small and it provides great access to research and lucrative internship opportunities.  While Rice's learning enviroment and residential colleges would be awesome, I am finding it hard to justify paying almost $60K per year to attend.  With all my AP credit, I can graduate in 3 years and my total costs for attending would be equivalent to the cost of one year at Rice.  I am looking for opinions on whether Rice is worth its additional cost in terms of jobs, opportunities, etc. in comparison to the opportunities available to Turing Scholars at UT."
4chno8,3,2016-03-29,Internship advice please!!!,sagha94,actuary,https://www.reddit.com/r/actuary/comments/4chno8/internship_advice_please/,"I'm am struggling between which to offers to take. I was hoping some professionals would be able to help me figure out the pros and cons of each job. 

Background on myself: pursuing actuarial career, majoring in Risk Management, have yet to take an exam, but planning to take FM in August.

I received an internship offer for the summer with a Risk Management software company. The office is pretty small with only 15 people in there, but extremely laid back and friendly. No real dress code and the employees go for happy hour all the time. I was told I will get to go on a business trip. It wouldn't take longer than an hour to get there or back home everyday in traffic. Also, the pay is on the upper end of college internships. Because they were waiting on a prompt acceptance, I went ahead and accepted the offer.

I also have a pending offer from Mercer for an actuarial internship, however I'd be driving in the inner city (traffic in my city might take 2 hours on some days), working in a more rigid, bureaucratic environment, I'd have to pay for a parking pass and more on gas. Hell, I might even have to buy another suit to wear. Pay would be about the same as the other internship. I've heard Mercer is awesome for actuaries, because they are one of the best in giving employees study time.

Now in trying to decide, the actuarial one would definitely put my foot in the door to a securing an actuarial job for after graduation, but I'd be pocketing less net money with the added costs of travel. I also run into the moral problem of retracting my offer after the company has invested in me.

Weighing all these factors in, what advice do actuarial professionals have in choosing which to follow?"

I felt so great about my progress, and was planning on losing 5 more pounds in order to reach my goal weight. However, after accepting an internship that took me away from my college town for a semester, I went from 125 lbs to 136 lbs from all the times I let myself get carried away with free lunches and drinks. 

I have been trying so hard to get back to where I was so I could continue my weight loss journey, but I've come to a point where losing those 10 pounds I had gained so easily is the hardest thing for me to do. 

I work out intensely for at least 6/7 days of the week-- run for 20 minutes, use a stairmaster for another 20 minutes, and then another 30 minutes of weight training (switching between the leg region and arm region depending on the day). The only problem I have been having is the diet part--and we all know that this is what mainly sets weight loss into action. 

I feel like I can't do this alone--I want to be able to have someone I can talk to and share my struggles with whenever I feel like binge eating or just quitting my diet entirely. 

Please, someone be my buddy!"
4chtyj,3,2016-03-29,She had a pathetic affair. What's the thinking on respecting myself and rebuilding respect for her?,NondonFrontonte,askMRP,https://www.reddit.com/r/askMRP/comments/4chtyj/she_had_a_pathetic_affair_whats_the_thinking_on/,"Asking for insight

Married 17 years. I got hitched up because I wanted to. She was attractive, energetic, excited as hell about me and eager to have my babies. She grew up with a narcissist father, and she’s not entirely not crazy herself. But we seemed to want the same things.

Three of the four kids later, she lost her steam. I was fat and depressed and not enjoying my life and she went looking for another way. Byebye stay-at-home mom, hello strident career-minded independent woman.

Another kid, grad school for her (I was a professor at the college so it was free for her), and then comes an internship. At a police station.

It only took me a few weeks of seeing how that place affected her to say fuck no and drag her out. She left kicking and screaming but she left. Or so I thought.

Things got worse, we separated. And I mostly got my shit together. Lost 60 pounds, didn’t care if she stayed or not, was not going to go back down the hole of trying to mend all her emotional problems and keep her happy. Got more friends, outside activities, tripled my income. We always had a lot of sex, but it’s been every night (but for period sex that I don’t love) for the past five years. She’s always eager to please me and thankful for the opportunity.

That seemed to work. But it didn’t. A couple weeks ago I discovered her affair. A piece of shit cop. One even the cops disapprove of. She kept his number from when she was at the station. I realized later I even met the dirtbag. Ugly, mean, pathetic. Human cancer in a baggy uniform. I think you guys call his sort the dark triad type. It worked on her. Five years of dirty and/or controlling texts, four meet-ups for a few seconds of rough sex, his demanding and her sending naked pictures. He called her “cunt” as her title and she responded. She had the loser of all affairs, if that’s what it was. All the while, completely devoted to me sexually.

I found out two weeks ago. What the fuck?

To see her now, she’s so thankful I saved her from the hell she created for herself. I have seen and believe the relief she has to be on the other side of this stuff. She called her parents and my parents, all her friends and her boss. She took her cell phone to At&amp;t to trade it out, telling the clerk she needed to swap it because she had been unfaithful to her husband with it and it brought her pain. She’s on her way over from her office to mine right now because she “gets uncomfortable after a couple hours” of not being around me. The damage and repercussions of her association with this dirt bag have shocked and terrified her. I believe that.

But what now?

I could certainly lean up. I am pretty built for a 45-year old, but I don’t lift. I play soccer and work cattle. I make a good living at an unusual but prestigious job. I love my wife’s company and having her in my bed, but I’m no longer a validation addict.

There probably was a defense against the dark triad douche, but I missed it. Today is today and I have to live with it. I don’t really want to get rid of my wife. She said she’d leave if I made her, but she’d buy the house next door so she could come over and clean and put out for me whenever I’d let her. I think she’s a keeper.

But, askMRP, this leaves a lot on my shoulders. Whatever she feels, I have to have respect for myself. I have to look myself in the mirror and say “You get to have what’s left after she did this to herself.” I had a lot before, during, and so far after, but she defiled herself and lied to me for five years.

What’s the thinking on taking back a wife after something like this?"
4ci2xk,2,2016-03-29,Job Advice,Eaglefan928,academiceconomics,https://www.reddit.com/r/academiceconomics/comments/4ci2xk/job_advice/,"Hey, Everyone! 

If this is not the right subreddit to post this, I apologize, and I would appreciate it if someone could direct me somewhere else. I am looking for some advice in regards to my search, specifically, I am hoping for some suggestions on where to apply. 

So far I have applied for internships/ entry levels at the Fed, BLS, BEA, IRS, and the Bureau of the Census. In addition to these, I have applied to an economic consulting firm. So far, I have had any of these companies contact me. 




Here is so of my information:

I am in the third year of a 3-year degree program at a small University in the US with an Economics Major (GPA 3.85).

I have taken a handful of math classes including Calc I-III, Linear Algebra, Intro stats, and Econometrics. I participated in the Fed Challenge team 3 years in a row as well. I also have OK skills in STATA, Python, and Excel. Finally, I was heavily involved with clubs. 

My experience is where I am really lacking since I have spent my summers taking classes to be able to graduate early. However, I was able to work at a small business last summer (health care - I  mostly did intern stuff, with a little data analyst/ accounting). During School  I worked as a tutor and had a work study at the athletic department.

Based off this info, if anyone could provide any input regarding what direction I should go, I would really appreciate it"
4ci36r,2,2016-03-29,Something inside me is blocking me from achieving my potential. How can I figure out what it is?,soulsearchme,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/4ci36r/something_inside_me_is_blocking_me_from_achieving/,"TL:DR - I've always been told I have a lot of potential, but can't seem to make anything of it. I'm looking for an effective way to soul-search and overcome the internal obstacles that are preventing me from progressing with my life.

Long story: I'm typing this out in the hopes that knowing my history will give clarity on who I am and what the issues may be. I'm the son of parents who have lived the American dream - immigrated to the US from a third world country in the 80s, attended Northwestern University and worked their way up. The standard, 2/3 jobs to pay through college/masters type situation. My first clothes were handmade and my first toys a cardboard box and packaging, not for convenience, but because they couldn't afford anything else. 

I have lived in 4 states, moved because of my parents' jobs. I moved to Socal 12 years ago when I was 14 - I am now 26. I don't have any friends remaining from before SoCal. I skipped 3rd grade when I moved from Missouri to Maryland, because I was able to test out of it. From that point forward, I went from a straight A student to a mix of As, Bs, and Cs. 

I attended 2 middle schools and 3 high schools. I moved in the middle of my freshman year to SoCal, and to another school again at the beginning of my junior year. I attended private middle schools and 1 private high schools. In my senior year, I failed AP Chem, and had a smattering of As, mostly Bs, some Cs. I test well and did well on my SATs, but was rejected to all 14 schools I applied to.

Side note; during high school, I was really into remote control cars and discovered that I could sell them on Youtube and on forums  as well. I started doing some custom builds and had a small business running. This was what started the entrepreneurial vibe in me, which runs until today. I never incorporated it or anything, it was just a way to make money off of my favorite hobby. I was feeling good about this, so good that I told some of my parent's friends in the community that I would have my dream car by the time I was 21 (Audi R8). Of course, this was an unrealistic goal but I had no idea at the time.

Anyway, being rejected to all schools affected me greatly, and I attended a number of different JCs to be able to transfer to UCLA within 1 year. My mom was planning on the same thing, as her overseas degree didn't transfer. In fact, we took some classes together. She always pushed me through high school and college as well - the fact that I didn't get into a University was hidden from everyone, and I lived a lie by saying that I attended a local university when in reality, I just took some extension courses there in conjunction with my JC courses. I was admired within my religious community, and often used as a model child. Everyone thought I was smart and hardworking. I had 2 paid internships that came through my parents' connections and networking in general. 

With her pushing and my efforts, I was accepted into UCLA as a transfer student in a highly impacted major. I had a contract that I had to maintain a certain GPA and everything was done. I didn't maintain that GPA and can think back to one assignment in one music course that I didn't want to do that made me get a C instead of a B in that course. If I had done that assignment, maybe my GPA would have stayed where it needed to. However, it didn't and as a result, my admission into my dream school was rescinded. 

This was possibly the biggest disappointment of my life. I was fairly religious then, and that all went out the window as well. I had no idea what to do, and my mom pushed me to attend UCI, which I ended up graduating from. I was accepted there as a spring transfer. Looking back, I don't regret not going to UCLA, as if I had gone, me and my younger sister wouldn't be as close. She's my best friend and I wouldn't trade our relationship for the world. That being said, it still hurt like hell and still stings looking back on it. It ranks among my biggest failures. 

If you've come this far, I'd just like to take a minute to thank you sincerely for reading and caring enough to read. It does mean a lot to me that random strangers on the internet are giving and selfless enough to take interest in something that may never benefit them. 

I never really liked UCI as I felt it was settling, and it was only 3 miles from my house so I commuted there. I had a hard time making friends and broke down one night and cried because I felt so alone. My parents suggested transferring to UCLA in the next year but I said no - I believe out of a mix of anger and frustration. Looking back, I could have done so, but I didn't want to fall behind my peers either (friends from the religious community). 

I bounced around a few majors at UCI before settling into Psychology. My first summer there, I did a study abroad program, which still ranks as one of my life highlights. I made friends, I was able to get away from my ex who I had been dating for 9 months, I started dating this girl I met there after the program ended. Things started looking up. I had an apartment on the beach that I told my parents I would pay for, but I got let go from my job halfway through the year and they had to cover the rest of the year for me. I still owe them from that. 

The rest of my college career was decent - I graduated with a 3.4, degree in Psychology, and a minor in Business. This made sense to me as I have always been the person people come to for advice, for a shoulder to lean on and for someone to listen to. However, I never really considered it as a profession as I thought the business world had much more to offer me. 

Out of college, I got my dream job working for Ferrari (as a huge car guy, this was mega for me). I was hoping to do marketing for them, but ended up just being a paper-pusher - I didn't do well with pushing papers, and was let go within 3 months. 

I found another job a few months later at another automotive firm, where I was going to be doing sales and marketing. However, I wasn't comfortable driving the cars - driving a 550 horsepower car that weighs 2400 pounds is daunting, especially if you don't know how to drive stick, which I didn't at the time. I also don't like being a pushy salesman, I prefer the more chill vibe. I lasted 3 months there as well. 

I found another job a few months later at another automotive firm. I was part-time there, and lasted a bit longer - 6-7 months, but they ran out of need/use for me and were short on $ so I was first on the chopping block. 

I had a few other small jobs as well, but nothing worked out. All but 1 of my jobs have been through networking or cold-calling my way into places, so I know the power of networking. My next job was a very well-paid job at my dads company in his department. He wasn't my direct boss, but further up the food chain. I had that job for awhile, then they ran out of use for me as well. After that, I worked at another automotive firm doing 100% commission sales - I made $1k in 3 months there. 

My last job was 100% commission as well, I worked for a really good friend of mine at a marketing agency. I was there for about a year and made $3500. I did some small jobs here and there and was able to support myself, but ended the year around $8k. I live at home still, but I have $14k in debt and these 100% commission things have drained my savings so currently I'm at about $25 to my name, with $650 in bills coming up this month. I recently quit my last job because I wasn't making enough and it was emotionally draining. 

Over the past 2-3 years, I've tried to work on a few different business here and there and listened to a few audiobooks and business books and get a burst of motivation, but it always fades. Nothing has quite stuck no matter how hard I try. I've read pretty much every single motivational quote, written my goals daily, planned things out to the week for business ideas and nothing moves forward. I journal and meditate weekly, if not a few times a week, and there's just a mental block. I also lament my past mistakes sometimes, like saying I'd get an R8 by 21 and I'm nowhere close to that at 26.

My gf (not the one from the study abroad, another one - been together for 3 years now) and her very traditional family need me to have a stable income to be able to support her. My family, while asset-rich, is cash poor and supporting me isn't really an option for them right now. Also, my mom has pushed me enough and I want to do something on my own. 

I've got 2 business ideas I would love to pursue and was hoping to go on unempoyment for a few weeks and do so, but I'm not eligible for unemployment because all my jobs in the past 2 years have been 1099. 

I know the tone of this has been a little somber, but I am (or at least, I try to be) grateful of who I am. I know I have marketing skills, a creative and inventive mind, bounds of potential. I have had the opportunity (or made the opportunity) to travel every year, and have had the fortune of visiting 30+ countries. I've had some incredible life experiences that make pretty much everyone who meets me say something positive. I don't really talk about them, because I don't want/need to brag. 

To put it simply, I'm very happy with who I am, but not happy with **where** I am in my life. 

If you've made it to the end, thanks again for taking the time - I know this was an essay. 

So, does anyone have any advice or words of wisdom they can share? "

4ci8r0,1,2016-03-29,"Botched technical interviews – Should I work on coding, on interviewing, or on finding the right jobs?",butyeahso,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4ci8r0/botched_technical_interviews_should_i_work_on/,"Hi reddit,

I could use your collective experience now. I’ve just screwed up two technical interviews, and I’m trying to figure out how I can get better. Assuming time is limited, and my goal is finding a job, what do you think is the best approach?

As I see it  there are a few explanations for my screw-ups (I’m open to other interpretations, and would appreciate your help diagnosing my problem).

a. ) I am a terrible programmer. Not against this idea, but where to begin? I’ve only got four months until graduation. My degree is more in data analysis, and I’ve done well in my classes, but I realized (at my interview), I’ve never actually gotten much feedback on my code per se. I love coding, but I don’t know if I’m any good.

b.) I suck at technical interviews: My first interview involved some O-notation problems. The other one I had to explain my own code sample (which apparently, was pretty bad). This is the most obvious place to begin, but I’m feeling pretty overwhelmed with the sample questions, and wondering if I’m even pursuing the right career right now.

c.) I’m applying to the wrong jobs: I had a technical job last spring that I found easy but boring, and I did a summer internship where I was pleasantly engaged, but not overwhelmed by the work. I might have lucked into those, and I’m not sure how to find that sweet spot again. 

Thanks in advance for any advice."
4cidtg,3,2016-03-29,Double major in CS and Psychology? (Cognitive Science?),The_Real_Tupac,AskAcademia,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/4cidtg/double_major_in_cs_and_psychology_cognitive/,"-Is it worth majoring in Psych and CS?

-Grad school a good option?

-Any advice for the cognitive science path

I am a sophomore who started as a psychology major but switched into CS. If I keep my psych major I can still graduate at the same time. I really enjoy psychology and would like to purse something that involves both that and CS. I have read that cognitive science is a good route to take for that. My school does not have a cognitive science major but we do have a few classes relating specifically to that which I plan on taking. I would be open to suggestions for good grad schools for cognitive science too. 

I am really just looking for advice on if I am setting myself up to do well. My school has a very good and well known CS program so I know there will be opportunities with that, but I really do enjoy psychology and I want to incorporate that if possible.

I have heard that getting lab experience is important. I am working on that but I also have 2 jobs and a computer science internship so its hard to find time for anything at this point.

Thank you for reading.

Edit: by CS I mean Computer Science"

Was actually having an affair and trying to accuse me of domestic violence. I'm jaded and confused from 10 years of crazy. 3rd party intervenes to protect our daughter from what she's exposing her to. 5 months and $4,000 deep in court. Wife becomes even crazier. I discover the truth about her. I'm still entertaining the idea that ""not all women are like that"" mainly due to my limited exposure to the dating world, but the signals are there all around me. Stopped taking TBP. Haven't taken TRP. Identify more with MGTOW but still desire companionship. Recognize that I'm in denial.

---

5 months into separation, divorce isn't finalized yet. Married 4 years, together 10. When things started out they were great, we used to go to the gym together every day, training kickboxing, watch movies every night, fuck twice a day, not a care in the world. No drugs or drinking, just real good times. That was 2 years. Then we had a child and overnight she went crazy.

Quit my fun job at the movie store, went to work at the factory, survived the recession, went into graphic design, went back to school. Shit was hard but I did everything I could to be a good dad and a good husband. All the while her mental/emotional situation getting worse and worse, all problems being blamed on me. I believed her. I thought that her problems were caused by me. I worked too little, I worked too much, I was never around, I never left the house, always being blamed of one extreme or the other, always having to cross a never-ending series of lines in the sand.

At our worst we were unemployed, in school, living in section 8 affordable housing. I got accepted to an extremely demanding university (because I made deans list every semester and was in PTK) that had a mandatory paid internship and a lot of connections in the tech world (Google, Microsoft, Facebook, Apple, etc.) My plan was to plow through and get an internship and do everything I could to land a job.

I did. I did my 6 month internship as a software developer and then landed a nice career nearby. 3 months in we actually were evicted from section 8 because we were making too much money. I dropped out of my degree program and had a ton of debt, but I was providing a good life for my family.

But things kept getting worse.

She was gone every night. Out with friends. Staying the night at ""friends houses"". Going to the bar to ""play darts and pool"" even though she claims to be 10 years sober. Meanwhile I feel like it's because I'm not successful enough, I need to make more money, need life insurance, 401k, IRA, started going to the gym regularly again, cooking dinners, what else can I do? What the fuck?

I hit my breaking point and began applying for jobs abroad. I knew our marriage was failing and I was beginning to realize it wasn't my fault. I talked to her about it one night, suggested we think about separating and what we'll tell our daughter, she cried and went to the bar ""for support from friends.""

The next night we talk, we attempt to fix our marriage, we talk about ways we can improve, I agree to pressure my employer to offer me health insurance. I do. She dodges me for 3 days and comes home late again after being ""out with friends."" I cave and tell her I'm finding a roommate and moving out. She says she's going to go get ice cream with our daughter.

She didn't come back. At this point I realize she's not getting ice cream. I didn't bother calling her, I knew.

She comes back at midnight with a friend and some guy I've never seen before, grabs a bunch of clothes, and says we need to separate, that it's ""for the best for our marriage"" and that we need marriage counseling. I was stunned but ultimately agreed (since, uh... I was already planning on that). I immediately set up an appointment with a marriage counselor.

I also called an attorney because at this point 10 red flags are going off.

The next day I felt hung over. I woke up with this sense of detoxification. The apartment was silent. There was no stomping, screaming, or drawers slamming. The cat was purring next to me.

I went about my day like normal, came home, ate dinner, went to bed at a reasonable time for the first time in months. Woke up the next day feeling... even better.

Then later in the day I text her a link to information about legal separation. I tell her this is what we need to do. She says ""well I think I may have been too hasty. Can I come over and do laundry later?"" I say she can do laundry while I'm not home but I reinforce that I agree with her -- that the separation is best for our marriage. 

At this point I realize that the separation really is for the best. I'm feeling better than I have in my entire adult life.

Two hours later I get a call from the county courthouse. My parents have temporary custody of my daughter. I won't go into details. The situation she had our daughter in was so bad, it seems, that her principal had to urge my mother to file for TCO when she was at the school helping with a Halloween party.

I knew nothing about any of it. As far as I was concerned, good. My daughter is safe for now while this mess gets figured out.

Wife comes home that night completely nuts. Her mind is racing and she was singing like a bird. 

Oh, she was singing.

Turns out she was having an affair. It started months ago. Turns out she didn't leave that night because she wanted to work on our marriage. She left that night to apply for a rent subsidy... at a battered woman's shelter. She openly admitted she was trying to accuse me of domestic violence.

She tried to get me to go hang out on the couch and watch netflix. She tried to make plans for us to shop for health insurance the following monday.

I told her to sleep in our daughter's room. I locked myself in my bedroom. The next day when she was gone I gathered up all my legal documentation (birth certificates, statement of paternity, gift bonds, etc.), clothes, etc., and went to my parents' house.

4 days later she files for divorce and serves me with a ""family offense"" petition. I didn't even read the divorce papers before I took my ring off. I knew. Good.

I learned more about my wife by speaking with my landlord, my daughter's teachers, and my parents, than I did when I was slaving night and day for her for the past 10 years. There are facets to her that I did not even know existed. Her insanity was more extreme than I had ever imagined.

Fast forward to today, 5 months later. My parents still have temporary custody, I'm still living with them but have a fully furnished apartment just sitting there waiting for when the judge grants me physical custody. Wife has 8 hours a week supervised visitation. I even have the cat.

I poke on Tinder every day. I don't know what I'm looking for. I definitely don't want another marriage. I don't even want a fling. I don't even want to date. I just want someone to talk to and live my life with. Someone to share the good times with. Someone to cook, watch movies, plan vacations, and hit the gym with. I'm also acutely aware of the affect a relationship will have on my daughter and I have to be extremely precautious to protect her from the fallout of a potential disaster.

I doubt I'll find that on tinder.

90% of girls on tinder look like catalog models or have pictures of them bungee jumping off the Vatican, hiking the pyramids, drinking rainbow colored fluids at the bar, have PhDs, are grad students. About 25% of them blatantly say ""be over 6 feet, have a beard, have a dog, have a pickup truck.""

Less than 10 of them have seemed like genuine, domestic, good-hearted people who are just looking for companionship.

Now, I'm realistic. I'm a 30-something who's technically living with his parents. I'm not an ""alpha"", but I'm successful, active, attractive, and good-natured. I don't expect (nor really want) girls to be climbing through my window at night, but so far the only two people who've chatted with me were (1) a fat nurse who lives 60 miles away, and (2) a triathlete mom who texts way too fucking fast and obviously has a rotation of 50 matches that she texts with throughout the day.

The 18-22 range are just... no... 22-25 year-old range are obsessed with drinking and traveling, the 25-32 year-old range look like models, have graduate degrees, are looking for Chads, or have multiple children, the 32-40 year-old range actually looks like they are 40+ and almost all have multiple children.

Of course, this is tinder. Tinder is probably the most rotten subset of an already rotten subset of a vile demographic in this day and age.

The single woman.

I'm still in denial. Mainly because I feel rejected and alone. Help me overcome."
4ciw0l,8,2016-03-29,I [20F] am extremely confused with my feelings for my ex [21M] after finding out I have herpes,throwaway08571,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4ciw0l/i_20f_am_extremely_confused_with_my_feelings_for/,"This one is gonna be a doozy. Pre-warning because this is long and at this point in time, my life is like a soap opera :'-) 

**Background:** Ben [21M] and I [20F] dated for three years, starting at the end of our senior year of high school and ending a month and a half ago, the day after Valentine's Day. I'm in one of the best nursing schools in my state, so my life has been hectic for the past year. We moved in together last August, and he broke up with me recently by leaving a note on the counter while I was in class, and moving all of his shit out. I returned home to an empty house/a note saying he was leaving me. 

**Break-up:** Ben said I didn't respect him, which I can automatically tell you isn't true. He said I didn't respect his major (history), which I actually fully 100% supported so I don't really know where he got that one from. He said I didn't make time for him, which is true. A month prior to our breakup, he started acting weird and snapping at me for no reason at all. The day before Valentine's Day, I asked him what was up and he kinda blew me off. I told him I would start to make more time for him and that I really truly did respect him. 

On Valentine's Day, he did not do a single thing for me. No homemade card, no flowers, no reservations. I even gave him prior warning several days before, telling him that I had a small gift for him and that I didn't need anything expensive etc. He ended up leaving me alone that night as he went to Starbucks for several hours. 

The next morning when I woke up, I was still hurt. I had to leave for class pretty early and I didn't have the time to bicker about what had happened the night before. So I left without telling him goodbye or I loved him. When I got home from class, I was hit with a note telling me he was leaving me. He said that because I didn't say goodbye or that I loved him, it was the straw that broke the camel's back. I was and still am hurt beyond words with the way things ended. You leave a note for someone who cheats on you, or someone who beats you. Not someone you have minor communication issues with. 

**Current situation:** After being single for about a month and a half, Ben contacts me and begs for me back. I was honestly doing pretty damn well, but I decided I would give him the courtesy of telling him in person that I didn't want to pursue a relationship with him. I know he didn't deserve as much from me, but I just know in my heart that I needed to continue on with this breakup process with forgiveness instead of anger. The conversation went well, and it ended on pretty good terms. 

However, I have definitely been second guessing myself a lot lately, because he recognized every single problem he had. He is going to therapy 2 times a week, he addressed our communication issues, and he genuinely seems remorseful. Even with how awesome he's doing and how self aware he's become, I told him the earliest I would even consider a relationship with him would be after a summer internship I have planned (just to give myself some time to be on my own and to not make decisions based purely on emotions).

**Sudden twist???:** All of this leads up to several days ago. In the shower, I noticed a weird looking vesicle, for lack of a better word, on my genitals. I've had ingrown hairs and small pimples, and I knew that what I was looking at wasn't anything like what I've had before. I contacted him right away and for everyone who's wondering: he did not cheat on me. 

We went to a walk-in clinic and I found out I have genital herpes. The NP told me that I most likely contracted it when we were together, and my stress has triggered an exacerbation. I honestly probably got it via cold sore on his mouth. Or maybe cold sore on my behalf, which may have been given to him and I'm sure y'all catch the drift. 

And now here I am. Ben has been extremely supportive through this whole process. He went with me to the clinic, he really made me feel at ease about this diagnosis, and I told him I would go with him to get him checked out too. Logically, I know herpes is not the end of the world. But I've only ever been with 2 people, and now I have herpes. So that sucks. 

But now my feelings for Ben are everywhere. It's getting so confusing. Some of my friends say a situation like this could definitely be a game changer that brings the two of us together. Others say ""fuck him!"" and say I shouldn't even go with him to the clinic for him to get checked. I do still love him, but right now I'm so scared.

I have a therapist I see regularly, but I don't have an appt until next Thursday. I guess what I'm looking for is advice about Ben, advice about herpes, words of encouragement, a kick in the ass, who knows? If you actually read this far, you are amazing and you have no idea how much I appreciate you! Also, I can try and answer any questions anyone might have to clear things up, because I'm honestly a hot mess right now.

   
**tl;dr**: Ex broke up with me, I found out I have herpes, emotions running rampant, what the fuck is going on, what do I do?

Edit: I'm going to bed, but I'll read any comments in the morning. Thanks in advance. :-)"
4cj0vq,2,2016-03-29,What should I expect from this junior android developer internship interview?,TH3BUDDHA,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4cj0vq/what_should_i_expect_from_this_junior_android/,"I passed the phone interview and am going to be scheduled to come in for a tech interview.  It is for a startup company and is offering $20/hr.  The posting on my engineering career page listed the qualifications as:


*Must have a good understanding of core object-oriented programming principles

*Some experience with Android, iOS, .NET, or Javascript/HTML/CSS


The interviewer emailed me back and said that they will be giving me a little programming challenge using the Android SDK.  I was wondering if there is any advice I could get.  How in depth would something like this get for an internship?  Do you think they would just give me a simple app to make?"
4cj6qt,1,2016-03-29,I [25f] can't stop feeling pissed off at my roommate/bf's little sister [23f],[deleted],relationships_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships_advice/comments/4cj6qt/i_25f_cant_stop_feeling_pissed_off_at_my/,"So I desperately need some perspective.

I can't stop thinking really negatively about my bf's little sister/roommate (RM). To give you a background, I'm in my Master's degree program full time, a 16 hour internship, work 16 hours a week, and completing a thesis. She is in her bachelor's in science and works around 24 hours a week--all are time consuming and difficult. She and I are really different in terms of our experiences and how we communicate. She has had an extremely sheltered life, the baby of the family, and very protected by others. She has always had a safety net and has always been told she is great (and it continues to happen). Although, her/my bf's mother is really hard on her sometimes and can be outright brutal (e.g. mom will promise to pay for RM's schooling and then spitefully say she won't pay for it because RM wanted to take more time to learn school material, which made mom angry), which in my opinion, has played in the way she interacts with other women (me, for example) who are really direct and confrontational--but not necessarily in a negative or positive manner.

My personality is much more independent. I've led a fairly privileged life in terms of being the baby of the family (albeit siblings are are 8+ years older) but have experienced a lot of trauma, broken family experiences, serious mental illnesses in the family, and homelessness. But my family also valued having many skills and valued high education, so I've always had that to fall back on, and I've always done well in school. But I have a feeling it has created some issues that I might not necessarily be seeing that may be interfering with RM's and mine's relationship.

So RM has lived with us for a couple years now. Before she had a boyfriend, she was pretty good about cleaning up after herself, contributing with food, and simply being a decent roommate. But within the past year or so, something changed and she has made me feel much more challenging to live with.

She started leaving stuff out and forgetting it for days until someone else had to clean it up. And I try to be very environmentally conscious and ask people in my household to not turn on the dishwasher unless it's full--but she ignored. my bf and I would request she help us with the washer by putting things in a certain way so it cleans better and doesn't waste the cycle, and just so we can save water. So I would ask her, ""Hey, do you think you could clean this up?"" or ask her to do something a certain way. It wasn't aggressive, but it was really calm and it was just asking. She would say ""okay"" very positively so I honestly thought it was okay. Same with electricity. We would ask if we could set it at a temperature and she said she would be okay with it but then change it without telling us. She keeps ignoring our requests and doing all these things that cost me money and that I don't appreciate because she says ""okay"" but then doesn't follow through.

At one point I got really annoyed when she left coffee grinds on the counter for a couple days--which stained the counter. So I said (admittedly, kind of aggressively), ""Hey, can you not leave coffee grinds on the counter cause it stains it and it was there for like 3 days."" And she didn't respond at all and just went to her room. I could tell she was upset and so I went to talk to her and she was crying and saying she was under a lot of pressure. I apologized for being aggressive and asked her ""please tell me if I'm being demanding or mean because sometimes I don't realize it."" she said to me, ""you're not mean--it's okay, etcetc"" saying she was under pressure and stuff. but after that, she was really resentful after that and taking EVERYTHING I said personally.

For example, bf and I were talking about weird internet stuff he had on my computer. Earlier that day, I allowed RM to use my computer for hw and it wasn't a big deal. But when I said to bf ""I don't want that shit on my computer"" RM was like ""what stuff?"" as if she thought I was talking about her, which I wasn't. And so I explained it was pictures bf showed me and she was like ""oh."" and then just left and went to her room.
Another instance was she put one of my vegetables I placed exposed in the fridge into a bag and wrote ""decomposition of vegetables causes mold."" I was like... soo.... what does that mean? Is she suggesting I place my vegetables in containers? So I went to clarify and asked, ""did you mean to say you want us to put vegetables in containers?"" and she was like ""yeah, cause it causes mold."" and I was like ""oh! okay. Well you could have just said that instead of this roundabout way."" Which I thought I said in a calm way but she came over later and said ""I wasn't trying to be passive aggressive."" and I said, ""I didn't figure so, it was just really indirect so I wanted to clarify what you meant."" But she was obviously upset by it because her eyes were watery. I said, ""sorry if I sounded aggressive at all, it was just a really direct question. I wasn't being mean, just simply asking for clarity."" Which she agreed she understood but had tears in her eyes before our conversation ended.

Eventually the tension was too much after these little things kept happening over and over and I asked her to arrange a time to talk. I framed it as ""I just want to share with you my feelings. It's nothing crazy, but I want to be open and honest and want to give you the opportunity to share too."" She agreed but after a week of no proper response, I had to remind her. It made me feel extremely unimportant and made me resent her a little. I was extremely upset and she told me she forgot.

Eventually we talked openly and she was upset because she didn't like that I was telling her what to do when I also cause messes. I said that's fine and it's true, I cause messes but she isn't honest with me about how she actually feels and it's frustrating because if she has a problem, she should tell me. I told her ""I can't really read minds very well so I need you to tell me what you're really thinking so we don't get to this point. I'm not always self-aware."" And she said, ""yeah, no one can read minds."" and that she will try to communicate better and I agreed I would lay off her back a bit. I told her it made me feel really unimportant when I would try to be open with her but she wouldn't respond. She said about the coffee grinds incident that she ""wanted to move out"" and I was shocked because she was telling me at the time ""it was okay."" I apologized because I didn't really know how to respond to that but regret not saying how contradictory that was and how I had no idea. The conversation was actually really positive though and it resolved a lot of the tension between us and for a moment there I thought everything would be fine.

During this process, our whole house developed a schedule chore list (which we didn't need until this past year). Really easy because we live in a tiny condo. The 3 chores that we alternate are:
1. take out trash/recycling and vacuum living room.
2. sweep bathroom floor and wipe down tub.
3. clean kitchen counter and sweep floor.
We have labeled magnets on our fridge and change it when we're done with our task of the week.

So. Simple. And we all agreed it was fair.

But she was still paranoid. She was eavesdropping on me and bf in the kitchen. I was venting about how I need to remember that because I think something is right, doesn't make it right and how I need to remind myself that even if it makes me mad. I was talking about my internship. Bf was agreeing. But RM thought we were talking crap about her saying the kitchen wasn't clean enough (it was her chore and she didn't sweep) and bf said ""she's really busy."" Which... I literally didn't use any of those words and he didn't say anything remotely relevant to that. I told her I appreciated her asking me and glad she did but told her we weren't talking about anything relevant to that."" She said she was relieved and I gave her ice cream. Lol.

But I STILL have to be on her back about chore unfortunately because she won't do it in a timely matter. We all agreed to do it by the Sunday but she has delayed the first week so I had to text her to ask her to do it so that we don't double the work when I have to do it Sunday (it was already Tuesday by this time--a week and 2 days late). And then this past week she vacuumed but didn't take out the trash but moved her magnet anyway (in the wrong rotation spot for that matter). I was super pissed but approached it calmly. I texted her (cause it was late at night) and said, ""hey! Your magnet was in [insert bf's name] spot for this week so I moved it to this past weeks chore! I wasn't sure if you were done with your chore yet so I figured you could just move it to the appropriate spot whenever :)"" And she always tries to give me all these excuses about how she forgot one day, planned to do it another day, and etcetc when I don't ask her it (she's always trying to explain herself--I don't care for explanations). I just responded with, ""cool. Yeah, I just wasn't sure so I figured you know you best. Thanks!""

But I can't help but feel super fucking annoyed and pissed off at her. Like. We are literally asking to her do a chore that she AGREED to do. It just makes me so mad. I also support a lot in the house--for example I pay for the majority of bills, I buy the majority of the groceries, and I do a lot of side work to maintain the home. I agreed to do these things and I'm not trying to throw it in anyone's face, but it's like--I'd appreciate if she would just follow this ONE thing. ONE THING. Like--what the fuck is wrong with her?  She always complains about how people think she is spoiled and I used to not think that. Now I see what they mean. I have to extend my neck and back to talk to her carefully so she doesn't get upset (she gets SO EASILY upset) and always have to take that extra step to make sure the house is in order. I'm sick of it. She's an adult, she needs to grow up and be accountable to what she agrees to do/her shit. If she doesn't like it, she can say it (which I told her I would ensure I would never get upset if she is honest with me--only upset when she isn't.). She never tells me honestly what she thinks and she communicates SO passively, it drives me nuts. I never know what she actually means.

Please help me change my perspective. I want to like her. I don't want to feel micro-managey anymore but don't know how else to address this issue. Am I wrong? What can I do to not feel so resentful toward her?

TLDR; Me &amp; bf &amp; RM all mutually agree to do things a certain way in household. But I will directly notice and tell her when she falls significantly behind. Even after having a conflict resolution, she is back to her not adhering to basic chores which makes me feel like I hate her. Help me change my perspective--am I in the wrong?"

My GPA is a 2.95(Around there, very close to 3.0). I would say I am above average when it comes down to coding for assignments compared to my classmates. They come to me for help and bounce off ideas for assignments. Some of my class mates are getting internships at local companies at my college. So I have been looking at these internship opportunities for a few weeks now and I am just discouraged for a few things.

1. I am just generally a shy person when I just meet you for the first couple times. I was required to go to the career fair at my college and talk to a couple companies. I just did not feel comfortable at all.
2. If and when I get an interview, I feel like I will be ill prepared. I don't want to be asked a question I cannot answer correctly. I don't want myself to look stupid in front of this company.
3. My GPA. All of my CS required classes that involve something to do with computer science I haven't got anything lower than a B. Generals is what really lowers that down because I just don't have any interest in them whatsoever. I just hope that companies will look mainly at my CS classes compared to my general classes.
4. Some of these companies use different languages than what I am taught. I look at the requirements at the internship, and I try to learn on my own the language that the company uses and just get discouraged because I don't know how to complete something. When I get the job, I feel like I will be thrown in the deep-end and get no help.
5. My portfolio. My portfolio is non-existent. I don't have any ideas for side projects that I am interested in. I like to make desktop applications, because I am taught C++ at my college so naturally it seems desktop applications would be nice to know. In my final year as a CS student I will be working with a team of my classmates and we will work with a company and make something for them. Would that be a good thing to put in a resume even though its required course work?

That's what I have for now, I just feel discouraged mainly."

So RM has lived with us for a couple years now. Before she had a boyfriend, she was pretty good about cleaning up after herself, contributing with food, and simply being a decent roommate. But within the past year or so, something changed and she has made me feel much more challenging to live with.

She started leaving stuff out and forgetting it for days until someone else had to clean it up. And I try to be very environmentally conscious and ask people in my household to not turn on the dishwasher unless it's full--but she ignored. my bf and I would request she help us with the washer by putting things in a certain way so it cleans better and doesn't waste the cycle, and just so we can save water. So I would ask her, ""Hey, do you think you could clean this up?"" or ask her to do something a certain way. It wasn't aggressive, but it was really calm and it was just asking. She would say ""okay"" very positively so I honestly thought it was okay. Same with electricity. We would ask if we could set it at a temperature and she said she would be okay with it but then change it without telling us. She keeps ignoring our requests and doing all these things that cost me money and that I don't appreciate because she says ""okay"" but then doesn't follow through.

At one point I got really annoyed when she left coffee grinds on the counter for a couple days--which stained the counter. So I said (admittedly, kind of aggressively), ""Hey, can you not leave coffee grinds on the counter cause it stains it and it was there for like 3 days."" And she didn't respond at all and just went to her room. I could tell she was upset and so I went to talk to her and she was crying and saying she was under a lot of pressure. I apologized for being aggressive and asked her ""please tell me if I'm being demanding or mean because sometimes I don't realize it."" she said to me, ""you're not mean--it's okay, etcetc"" saying she was under pressure and stuff. but after that, she was really resentful after that and taking EVERYTHING I said personally.

For example, bf and I were talking about weird internet stuff he had on my computer. Earlier that day, I allowed RM to use my computer for hw and it wasn't a big deal. But when I said to bf ""I don't want that shit on my computer"" RM was like ""what stuff?"" as if she thought I was talking about her, which I wasn't. And so I explained it was pictures bf showed me and she was like ""oh."" and then just left and went to her room. Another instance was she put one of my vegetables I placed exposed in the fridge into a bag and wrote ""decomposition of vegetables causes mold."" I was like... soo.... what does that mean? Is she suggesting I place my vegetables in containers? So I went to clarify and asked, ""did you mean to say you want us to put vegetables in containers?"" and she was like ""yeah, cause it causes mold."" and I was like ""oh! okay. Well you could have just said that instead of this roundabout way."" Which I thought I said in a calm way but she came over later and said ""I wasn't trying to be passive aggressive."" and I said, ""I didn't figure so, it was just really indirect so I wanted to clarify what you meant."" But she was obviously upset by it because her eyes were watery. I said, ""sorry if I sounded aggressive at all, it was just a really direct question. I wasn't being mean, just simply asking for clarity."" Which she agreed she understood but had tears in her eyes before our conversation ended.

Eventually the tension was too much after these little things kept happening over and over and I asked her to arrange a time to talk. I framed it as ""I just want to share with you my feelings. It's nothing crazy, but I want to be open and honest and want to give you the opportunity to share too."" She agreed but after a week of no proper response, I had to remind her. It made me feel extremely unimportant and made me resent her a little. I was extremely upset and she told me she forgot.

Eventually we talked openly and she was upset because she didn't like that I was telling her what to do when I also cause messes. I said that's fine and it's true, I cause messes but she isn't honest with me about how she actually feels and it's frustrating because if she has a problem, she should tell me. I told her ""I can't really read minds very well so I need you to tell me what you're really thinking so we don't get to this point. I'm not always self-aware."" And she said, ""yeah, no one can read minds."" and that she will try to communicate better and I agreed I would lay off her back a bit. I told her it made me feel really unimportant when I would try to be open with her but she wouldn't respond. She said about the coffee grinds incident that she ""wanted to move out"" and I was shocked because she was telling me at the time ""it was okay."" I apologized because I didn't really know how to respond to that but regret not saying how contradictory that was and how I had no idea. The conversation was actually really positive though and it resolved a lot of the tension between us and for a moment there I thought everything would be fine.

During this process, our whole house developed a schedule chore list (which we didn't need until this past year). Really easy because we live in a tiny condo. The 3 chores that we alternate are: 1. take out trash/recycling and vacuum living room. 2. sweep bathroom floor and wipe down tub. 3. clean kitchen counter and sweep floor. We have labeled magnets on our fridge and change it when we're done with our task of the week.

So. Simple. And we all agreed it was fair.

But she was still paranoid. She was eavesdropping on me and bf in the kitchen. I was venting about how I need to remember that because I think something is right, doesn't make it right and how I need to remind myself that even if it makes me mad. I was talking about my internship. Bf was agreeing. But RM thought we were talking crap about her saying the kitchen wasn't clean enough (it was her chore and she didn't sweep) and bf said ""she's really busy."" Which... I literally didn't use any of those words and he didn't say anything remotely relevant to that. I told her I appreciated her asking me and glad she did but told her we weren't talking about anything relevant to that."" She said she was relieved and I gave her ice cream. Lol.

But I STILL have to be on her back about chore unfortunately because she won't do it in a timely matter. We all agreed to do it by the Sunday but she has delayed the first week so I had to text her to ask her to do it so that we don't double the work when I have to do it Sunday (it was already Tuesday by this time--a week and 2 days late). And then this past week she vacuumed but didn't take out the trash but moved her magnet anyway (in the wrong rotation spot for that matter). I was super pissed but approached it calmly. I texted her (cause it was late at night) and said, ""hey! Your magnet was in [insert bf's name] spot for this week so I moved it to this past weeks chore! I wasn't sure if you were done with your chore yet so I figured you could just move it to the appropriate spot whenever :)"" And she always tries to give me all these excuses about how she forgot one day, planned to do it another day, and etcetc when I don't ask her it (she's always trying to explain herself--I don't care for explanations). I just responded with, ""cool. Yeah, I just wasn't sure so I figured you know you best. Thanks!""

But I can't help but feel super fucking annoyed and pissed off at her. Like. We are literally asking to her do a chore that she AGREED to do. It just makes me so mad. I also support a lot in the house--for example I pay for the majority of bills, I buy the majority of the groceries, and I do a lot of side work to maintain the home. I agreed to do these things and I'm not trying to throw it in anyone's face, but it's like--I'd appreciate if she would just follow this ONE thing. ONE THING. Like--what the fuck is wrong with her? She always complains about how people think she is spoiled and I used to not think that. Now I see what they mean. I have to extend my neck and back to talk to her carefully so she doesn't get upset (she gets SO EASILY upset) and always have to take that extra step to make sure the house is in order. I'm sick of it. She's an adult, she needs to grow up and be accountable to what she agrees to do/her shit. If she doesn't like it, she can say it (which I told her I would ensure I would never get upset if she is honest with me--only upset when she isn't.). She never tells me honestly what she thinks and she communicates SO passively, it drives me nuts. I never know what she actually means.

Please help me change my perspective. I want to like her. I don't want to feel micro-managey anymore but don't know how else to address this issue. Am I wrong? What can I do to not feel so resentful toward her?

TLDR; Me &amp; bf &amp; RM all mutually agree to do things a certain way in household. But I will directly notice and tell her when she falls significantly behind. Even after having a conflict resolution, she is back to her not adhering to basic chores which makes me feel like I hate her. Help me change my perspective--am I in the wrong? What do I do?"

If you can show me on Google maps that I can somehow get to that corner within 20ish minutes using any method but a car (ie. Walking, bus, bike) I would love to rent a room from you. I would like to pay around $700 a month, so let me know if you're anywhere near that price range. If you're willing to let a pair of interns (myself and another intern) share a room in your place we would each be willing to pay $500 a month. I'll also pay $300 a month to crash on your couch/living room for the summer. I really don't care about comfort as much as I do about cost. I only need a place from the end of May to the middle of August. I'll be arriving in Boston with two suitcases full of clothes and whatever I'm wearing. That's all the space I'll need.

4cjbpa,0,2016-03-30,[Profile Review] show me what you got,ageramp,MBA,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/4cjbpa/profile_review_show_me_what_you_got/,"Shoutout to Rick&amp;Morty. 

I graduated from the highest ranked state college late 2014, have been working at Big 4 as tech advisory since then. Interested to hear whether I am a dime a dozen candidate, and what I can to do differentiate myself. I probably will apply in 3-4 years

•**Work experience**: 2nd year associate at Big 4 , Management/Tech Consulting (not an accountant). Also did an internship with same company at same position.

•Extra curriculars: Involved in campus recruiting, and volunteer at local church in free time. I definitely think this could be improved.

•**Undergrad school/major**: Top Ranked State College Bs in Business Admin (Concentrated Information Systems)

•**Other education/coursework**: Taking a coding class in my free time and have done a lot of training with ERP systems since starting at Big 4.

•Race/nationality: Indian

•Sex: Male

Stats

•**GMAT Score**: I took the GMAT 2 years ago and scored a 630 with the verbal score being much higher than the quant. Very unbalanced. I recently took the GRE however (thinking about doing a masters in data analytics), and scored a 165 Q (90 percentile) 165 V (95 percentile) and Essay was a 5/6 (93 percentile). Do I need to take the GMAT again or will my very balanced/not low GRE score be sufficient?

•Undergrad GPA: 3.81(honors, magna cum laude)

**MBA Info**

•Goal of MBA: With my tech consulting background, I work primarily with tech teams and the higher ups on the business side. In my short time working, I've seen how the tech side almost always gets the short end of the stick and has to try to always please the business side. I think getting an MBA would help me transition to the business side and allow me to gain a better focus of how business and tech can better collaborate to achieve a company's vision.

•Target schools:
Top 15 b-schools, also wouldn't say no to USC.

I think I'm doing decent, but I feel like I may not be considered an ""exciting"" candidate at the moment. I also don't know how the GMAT/GRE situation affects me, will schools be able to tell I took the GMAT if I only report my GRE? Is the fact I got my Bs in Business and did the GRE a red flag?

Let me know what you think, how I can improve, or really feel free to tear me a new one. Any different perspective is welcome, thanks.

Given my grades so far I think I have a good shot at getting in. By this summer I will be done with everything I can that will transfer so I am thinking of how to spend the rest of the year.

&amp;nbsp;

My two goals after getting accepted are to get an internship at a Big 4 and eventually get employed at a Big 4 and I know it is early, but I am wondering what classes I can take to help me on my path that goal since I have free time.

&amp;nbsp;

I work full time and basically will have time for 1 class per quarter at CC [fall, winter spring]

My intro series was in java. I am looking at taking 3 of the following :

-linux/unix intro class

-python class [used in lower divs where I hope to go]

-c++ class [used in a lot of upper divs where I am trying to go and their intro c++ is supposed to be hard]

-sedgewick algorithims 1 coursera class

-sedgewick algorithims 2 coursera class

-DS and Algorithims class

&amp;nbsp;

I am thinking DS and algorithims so the two sedgewick classes and the one DS and algo class but I am not sure.  What would be best to focus on given my eventual Big 4 goals?

4cjpv1,0,2016-03-30,I (26/m) feel that the relationship with her (25/f) is already over.,throwwayeast,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/4cjpv1/i_26m_feel_that_the_relationship_with_her_25f_is/,"Throwaway because my friends have my reddit username. I apologize, but this post may be a little long.

My gf and I have been dating a month short of 3 years.  During this time, I have been trying to figure out if she is the one I want to marry.  We have been through a lot together, and she is my closest friend.  But even after 3 years, she makes no attempts to go have dinner with some of my friends, or go out and try something new.  She has social anxiety stemming from sexual abuse in college, and I can understand that that would affect her going to parties and crowded places.  But I want to do things like swing dance lessons &amp; kayaking, but she does not want to.

We have not had sex in a year and a half.  This is something I have brought up on multiple occasions.  She has begun to gain weight, and even though I tell her that it doesn't matter to me (it really doesn't), she does not have the confidence in her own body to have sex with me.  She wont even let me touch her.  I will not cheat on her, and I don't want sex daily, but I still have some libido that I feel is being crushed.

Recently, I have had a few events, both at work and with my friends, that have made me a much happier person, and want to pursue a more active lifestyle.  This is the exact opposite f my normal personality (gamer living in a basement).  I started exercising daily a few weeks ago, and am looking into doing a bunch of things that normally couples would do.  Dancing, paddleboarding, traveling to visit friends out of state, etc.  But I realize I'd be happier if I brought one of my close female friends over my gf.  I talked to her last week, and let her know that I am not happy with how things are going.  Her attitude has changed since then, and it has distanced us further.

She will be getting an internship out of state for the summer, where she will be gone for 2-3 months.  I found this to be the perfect opportunity to talk to her before hand, and let her know that I want her to figure out what makes her happy.  We have been living together for 2 years now, and I know she depends on me like she depends on her father.  Her father and I are the reason she can afford to stay in my city.  Because she's in school, she wont be able to afford to live down here alone. I feel bad because she depends on me financially, but I cannot handle the way things are going.  I also feel ashamed for wanting to have this kind of talk so close to her leaving, because she may feel uncomfortable, and move out sooner, with no place to go.  I still care for her deeply, and want her to be happy, but I am deciding if I can just be her friend, and still be able to help her (not financially, but psychologically).

Is it selfish of me to think that I'd be happier doing activities with my other female friends over her?  Should I stay together with her, and let her complete her internship, coming back with new experiences and a possible sound mind?  Or am I already checked out, and my denial is so stubbornly strong, I think I can save this?"

At this early stage I feel this one thing holding me back. There seems like so many different languages, concepts,  things you need to do to get the internships, things to do to get the right jobs, and so many people that are so far ahead(although I know that it isn't a race, but still adds on to it) and although I don't like to admit it, it get's fairly discouraging at times. I feel very confident when I'm actually learning material(have a fairly high average in my cs course, and just learning stuff on my own), and I feel like i'm putting in a lot of hard work. So it's kinda back and forth of feeling very confident to feeling very behind. 

I really want to be able to get a paid internship in january and will have all summer to learn on my own... There are just so many different pathways I could take it's hard to dive into 1. However, I know that when I am on a path I will be able to work as hard as I need to to get to the end of it.

Sorry for the half rant half question it helps writing all this stuff down though, and hopefully get some insight as well. "

[What is your overall opinion of valve as a company after all of this? What inspired you to do this in the first place?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4ch42q/i_am_the_guy_that_uploaded_watch_paint_dry_to/d1i5hkv?context=5)|Inspiration was the social engineering attempt for the steamworks account working.
 |My opinion of Valve has gone down but given how they handle stuff like this it's not unexpected. They did not offer a bounty, did not initially respond and have let me keep my Steamworks account and told me their ""hall of fame"" (acknowledgements) is for people who consistently submit bug reports. Now I don't want to sound salty but I kinda take that as ""Thanks for the bug, but you're gonna have to work harder than that if you want an actual acknowledgement. Keep your Steamworks account and keep doing our security teams purpose for free.""
 |To be fair it worked though, I have found more since and reported them (unrelated and sort of less severe?)
[I'm sure that if this big of an issue was looked over in the Web page source, there has to be a lot of other potential risks elsewhere that could enable someone to do some pretty nasty stuff. I wonder if some of this is being done and we just don't know.](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4ch42q/i_am_the_guy_that_uploaded_watch_paint_dry_to/d1i6bum?context=5)|Based on the social engineering attempt, I believe apart from Valve employees I'm the only person with a Steamworks account that doesn't have plans to legitimately release a game. I'm not trying to big myself up or anything, but a lot of it was timing, there were a lot of factors in to play here. I always find security holes look way more obvious when they're explained anyway. I doubt this is being done and Valve don't know about it.
[Why didn't you name your fake game ""Half Life 3?""](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4ch42q/i_am_the_guy_that_uploaded_watch_paint_dry_to/d1i3zpr?context=5)|I was very tempted to and it would've definitely gotten a much bigger response but I wanted to remain responsible and not piss Valve off too much. I think Watch paint dry was so close to being a real Steam game in line with some of the other joke Greenlight games that a lot of people thought it was genuine! :p.
[Reading your bio, you left school at 14 to go to uni - why? and how?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4ch42q/i_am_the_guy_that_uploaded_watch_paint_dry_to/d1i75fo?context=5)|Didn't like school. Been going to online college since I was like 10, thought I'd step up to the real thing. Sort of cheaper too. I had to sell a lot of my stuff as my family couldn't afford to pay for my tuition fees. With ""real"" university, I get my tuition paid by the government on a loan.

I was ahead in school but my high school was reluctant to let me sit my GCSEs early so I just did them privately. I integrated really well into my university with the people here and I'm 101% sure I'm having a much better time that I would be in high school! I've met a lot of cool people, travelled to Croatia for a summer school and got myself an internship with a major games studio doing InfoSec :)

[How was Valve's response to your vulnerability report (once you finally got through to them\). I don't believe they have a bug bounty program, so was it hard to get ahold of someone who would actually take you seriously?  In your blog post it sounds like you didn't get through to them until after you published the game. Once you got ahold of someone, were they actually good about following up with you, finding out what you did and fixing it and such?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4ch42q/i_am_the_guy_that_uploaded_watch_paint_dry_to/d1i4qqo?context=5)|They fixed it same day. Didn't acknowledge me on the hall of fame as that's ""reserved for reporters that provide several high quality reports over time"". No bug bounty was offered. A bit disappointed to be honest, for a company of Valve's size. I don't expect one now and never did, money isn't the biggest motivating factor for me, but if this was Google, Facebook, or another big internet company, they'd be paying out. Even smaller ones thanks to HackerOne!

4ckd2z,5,2016-03-30,"22, UK, coming out of charity sector feeling unfulfilled by an office job",Kaael,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/4ckd2z/22_uk_coming_out_of_charity_sector_feeling/,"Bit of background on myself - graduated just over a year ago now with a 2:1 Politics degree from a pretty well regarded university in the UK. 

My interests are politics, particularly international. I've done a fair amount of internships and voluntary work with NGOs, specifically in regards to North Korean Human Rights - this is the 'path' I'd ultimately like to go down, but there's simply no long term paid work in this very specific field in the UK, and even internationally opportunities are rare.

Did a bit of bar work straight out of uni which was okay to be fair, but it was very local and I live in the middle of nowhere so wanted out - very much want to work in a city.

For approx the past year I've been working for a pretty big national charity in an office role as an 'Assistant Programme Manager' - my role is to set up and deliver a summer programme for youths. 

The actual delivery (2-3 months of the year) and running of the programme is quite fun and rewarding, but the setup (9-10 months of the year) is a very gruelling and corporate, target-based environment. I'm leaving in the next week or so due to no longer having faith in their direction and the office environment really getting me down. 

On paper, this job looks amazing with all sorts of logistical knowhow, communication/relationship building, management, events/programme planning, and has developed all sorts of skills which looks great on my CV and I interview quite well so I'm not particularly worried about finding work so to speak.

What I AM worried about is finding work I find fulfilling. I've had a couple of office jobs now and they just drain me, I find the thought of spending 8+ hours a day for the next 40-50 years of my life in an office absolutely abhorrent. My work ethic goes to absolute shit when I stop caring about the purpose or cause of the work, and in an office environment I just find my motivation goes out the window unless something absolutely NEEDS to get done.

So I'm exploring my options and seeing whats on the table for me at this stage. I recognise I'm young, have a good education and employment background so stand in fairly good stead but I simply don't know what I want to do.

A few ideas/options to explore, in no particular order:

- I'm an amateur DJ, I absolutely *adore* DJing, been doing it just over a year now and racked up a few gigs. I've been toying with the idea of branching out and seeing if I can get small bar/club gigs around London and go from there. Me and my friend would love to host our own club night, but we have no idea where to start. It's a hugely saturated market, and is starting to become a little gentrified (particularly in London) but i'm sure there's ways of getting started and making a name for myself. Huge follower of the electronic music scene in the UK and would love to participate more actively in this culture.

- I'd love to go back to my roots of North Korean Human Rights advocacy, but it's damn hard to make a career out of it. Plus I don't speak Korean (or any languages) which is a HUGE barrier to entry in any sort of of international refugee work. I've tried self-teaching via the internet but lacked the discipline to stick at it.

- I'd like to go into some sort of international politics/international development/NGO work. In a previous job I ended up going to the UNHQ in Geneva for the UN Human Rights Council, which was an incredible experience and something I'd love to do more of, but so much international political work requires a Masters, which I've also considered. 

- I really want to work abroad in some capacity - I'm really not too fussy on the where or how. Obviously working in a bar on the beach in some tropical paradise is the stereotypical dream and I definitely wouldn't be opposed to that. Also looked into TEFL which could be interesting but I'm not too interested in teaching, at least kids. I really, really regret not spending a year abroad while at Uni - instead I did a month long exchange programme to China which I totally loved and really wish I'd done more non-holiday trips abroad. 

- I'd like to get into some sort of political journalism but don't really have any writing background other than uni essays and the like. I'm sure I could start some sort of blog and send out opinion pieces to various publications (already working on a few assorted articles) but everyone and their dog has a blog these days, and I'm not sure if it's something I'd want a career in. Plus I hear journalism is very cutthroat and extremely hard to break into without contacts/large doses of luck.

Just a few points on my expectations/requirements:

- I'm not really looking to make huge amounts of money - I realise in my areas of interest - particularly the NGO/political side of things - there isn't much money to be made. I don't have hugely expensive hobbies so as long as I can get by, I'm happy. I value job satisfaction over money any day.

- I don't really have anything tying me down to one place, other than family and friends so upping sticks completely is very much doable, and becoming an increasingly more persuading option. 

- Obviously every job has office/admin elements to it so I'm aware that with my particular background and goals, avoiding an office entirely is impractical and counter-productive, so I'm happy to settle for an office job in one of the fields i'm interested in, as long as it is varied enough so that I'm not there day in day out. 

Any perspective, advice or help would be very much appreciated. I know it's a lot to get through - it was pretty therapeutic to type out where I'm at in life and examining my options. 

tl;dr - Bored of office environments, feeling unfulfilled in charity sector that doesn't interest me, where to go from here? Ideal career path isn't 'career-worthy'.

4ckmub,2,2016-03-30,College Grad - I want to know how to ask for a signing bonus/salary increase.,SEthrowawway,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4ckmub/college_grad_i_want_to_know_how_to_ask_for_a/,"I'm going to be graduating soon from a top 10 uni, with a major in Computer Engineering. I have gotten an offer letter for 65k/benefits in the DC area to be a software engineer. I am very happy with the offer. I still want to negotiate the offer, but as I haven't worked yet, I have no experience with this, and I'm worried about turning them off or making them change their minds.

How can I ask for a signing bonus and/or salary increase, if I've only gotten an offer letter, and haven't gotten to the actual contract yet? When asked about salary before the offer was made, I said simply that I wanted something competitive for the SE field in the DC area. This makes me think that they already have an impression that I take an active interest in my compensation, so asking might not be bad.

However, my GPA is about 3.0, I have zero work or internship experience, and most of my project experience has been for my classes. I know I will be able to be a good employee, but I don't want to give the impression that I am pushing it given that on paper I am not that oustanding, especially since I actually want the job. 

Huge thanks for anybody willing to help me out with this. I'd be more than happy to take the offer as is, so I just want to not lose it.

UPDATE: This was difficult because I felt very hesitant to miss out on the opportunity for more money, but I really want this to be my first job and to do well at it. After much thinking (today was the last of several), I have decided to not negotiate based on the following reasons:

1. Banjoplayer said I need something to negotiate with. I have no job, no other offers, and a set of skills that is specific but not well demonstrated yet (since I only have school experience so far)
2. yuki_zawa said if I ""gave some sort of acceptance...that might make it unfeasible."" Although I didn't flat out say ""That is more than enough,"" I did basically say the amount was sufficient, and [further reading online](https://www.themuse.com/advice/4-times-to-negotiate-your-salary-and-3-times-not-to) suggests that changing my mind will give a bad impression. I actually am very excited for the job, and with graduation looming, don't want to risk having a job that wouldn't be as great of an opportunity as this one, let alone not be able to find a job at all.
3. The amount actually is more than enough lol. My initial goal was 60k, which I raised to 65k when I saw my friends getting jobs for that much, and this offer has surpassed even that (I have not given the exact amount for privacy). I want to start off my career with a great start to my first job, and do not feel comfortable taking the risk of tarnishing the great impression I have managed to make so far.

I will learn from this experience to be more reserved and contain my excitement when receiving information. I had the presence of mind to say only ""I'm looking at something competitive for the field and the area"" and that ""I've been continuing the process of looking for a good opportunity"" when asked about desired salary, but I was so excited to get a job offer that I just couldn't stay cool. Huge thanks to /u/Banjoplayer and /u/yuki_zawa for giving unbiased advice that helped me come to a conclusion I feel comfortable with on my own."
4cksxv,6,2016-03-30,College Student Career Advise,NeverWearsClothes,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/4cksxv/college_student_career_advise/,"I am currently a first-year student at the University of North Carolina. I am currently in their BSIS/MSIS program for Information Science.

I currently do IT at one of the graduate schools and had a couple questions regarding my potential careers. Note that most of these questions I've asked both my career counselor and my academic advisors and haven't really been able to get straight answers - so I figured I'd come straight to the professionals.

1.) Do I need a degree in Computer Science? For a career I want to be in a technical position but I don't want to just be blasting away at code as a career - I don't enjoy coding that much. (Note that I do have a minor.)

2.) Should I be going after certifications during summers and such? I wasn't able to land an internship this summer but should I take some time this summer and go after some certifications that would make me more competitive for internships next summer? I've been teaching myself Python using books I've checked out from the library and resources on the internet.

Any other helpful information would be great, I am naturally really nervous about the future and want to make sure I'm going to be able to land a job - the Information Science program has a 94% job placement rate but I just want to be double-sure.

I'm currently a junior in college majoring in microbiology with a minor in computer science. I recently decided to turn the CS minor in to a major and make it a double major because I'm almost done with the microbio major and I endured enough through ochem and biochem that I won't just give that up for a minor. So it will take me an additional year (so 5 total years) to complete the Computer science major. 

I thought I had no choice but to do the Bachelor's in science in CS but I recently learned I could also do the Bachelor of arts. I need to take an intro physics course to apply to the BS CS...but I already qualify for the BA CS because physics is not a prereq for it. Since I'm a junior, and Computer science majors get first priority when it comes to scheduling I applied to get into the BA at least for scheduling since CS courses are all I have left really. 

I do not have much room in my schedule to fit in physics as a class nor do I want to. It's 5 credit hours I just do not want to take or stress out over, and I would be better off taking a math/microbio/CS elective I believe. I could self-study it, and I will try to this summer, but I am already taking two CS courses so physics isn't a #1 priority. if I test out, then I can switch to the BS. If I choose not to, I can still do the BA and graduate on time in the 5 years and all. 

The BA has obviously less math requirements, but I was already planning on taking the same schedule a BS in CompSci would take. The only course I would NOT be able to do is an intro to ECE class b/c physics is the prereq for it. Otherwise the coursework is practically the same, and I can easily add a math class or two that would make the coursework identical

I know when you put BA on a resume it indicates a less...rigorous schedule possibly since less math/science is required for a BA. Again, I was looking at adding a math minor to round everything out because calc 3, linear algebra, diffeq, discrete math, etc are already in my plan to take because I've seen those courses are often required/desired for grad schools at the least and 2 more classes for a minor isn't a bad choice at all. Since I'm also in the honors program, I have to do an honors math minor if I choose to continue with the minor and meet those requirements. I feel like doing a BS CS and the math minor may stress me out a bit more...and there may even be a chance where I cannot pull through with the minor and be a class or two away from it. 

Does having a BA in CS vs a BS in CS limit my options for grad school or work? I haven't decided yet what I really want to do mostly because my gpa atm is ~3.2 and I'm working on boosting it. So I wanted to do a masters in CS...but I need at least a 3.5 or higher prob to be even slightly qualified. And I was worried that if that didn't happen I could maybe look for internships. I know personal projects and other factors are involved, but I'm always worried that just having Bachelor of Arts in Computer Science would just not look good. Am I at a huge disadvantage if I choose the BA CIS route?"

Thank god for my career advisers at school. Seriously, I don't know how helpful they are at every college, but mine pushed me and it paid off big time.   

I am studying informatics with a computer science minor. This basically taught me to be a jack of all trades in the development world, including web dev, software dev, project management, database creation, and design and research.  

I always thought I would go into web development. I like coding and problem solving, and I like the internet; I thought it was a perfect match. However, after learning that most web dev jobs for fresh-outs with no experience are usually just css/Wordpress jobs (at least the ones I was getting contacted for in my city), I was super depressed. I thought I had sold myself short and wouldn't be able to do anything challenging or make a decent wage.  

I also began reconsidering other tech jobs. I've worked in IT for several years, maybe networking would be easy to get into? What about system administration?  

Anyways, long story short- my first career adviser asked me why I was considering networking/ IT/ system administration even though I have been excited about programming this whole time, and asked me to continue looking for web dev internships. The next career adviser I met with told me not to settle on a css/Wordpress (unpaid) internship and to keep looking.  

I got an email from a CS adviser advertising a job at a *software engineering firm* and I applied on a whim, with my new-found confidence and motivation. I was shocked that I got a phone interview, and I honestly thought I bombed it. There was one question about my familiarity with data structures and algorithms and I panicked. At that point I hadn't really studied these things on their own and assumed I was missing out on this knowledge because of my generalized education. I told him they'd been touched on in my classes and I tried to learn them but I wasn't totally familiar with it... The rest of my interview must have went great because I still got called in for on-site!!!  

They took me out to lunch, gave me a tour of the facility, and then had me solve problems on a blackboard. At this point I'd been studying common algorithms and data structures, and I actually did pretty well! And actually, as it turns out, I think I could have done well just with my experience from programming. I think learning algorithms formally helped me identify the problem, but I didn't use any kind of advanced technique to come up with the solution.  

Today I found an offer for an internship from them in my inbox. I've interviewed at several other places, but this software engineering firm was by far my favorite and had the best mentoring environment, it seemed.   

I feel so fortunate that I'm actually able to say I'm going to use my degree to do something I'm excited about. I have so many friends who graduated and didn't really get to do what they wanted. I'm super excited and really want everyone to know that you might be capable of more than you think!!!!!! Go for it!!!!!!!!!"

Help!,Questiontime7,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/4cls59/20f_my_boss_26m_told_me_he_fancies_me_but_is_now/,"Hi guys - majorly need some advice here! A few months ago, I started work experience at a company and the guy I have to answer to (not exactly my boss, but similar) has always crossed over the professional boundaries. Because we're similar in age and get on really well, even a few days into my internship he was ringing me when he got drunk and asking for advice about his girlfriend (whom he has since broken up with.) Whilst I've tried not to fall for him, he's opened up to me so many times about his struggles and we can chat for hours, so I can't help but like him! He always listens and remembers what I have to say, and we're definitely closer than we should be. One time he rang me and he said that he fancied me and agreed that we had sexual tension, but hadn't made a move because he respected me at work and was still very confused about his ex. He also used to invite me over to his whilst still in a relationship, but said he just wanted to hang with me and to ""excuse the mushiness"" if he talked about his girlfriend! And THEN I'd see him in the office and he'd complain about how badly their relationship was going! Talk about confusing.

Unfortunately I think he's still in love with her (they still talk a bit), and has been using me as some kind of therapist for a few months - I feel like I've been emotionally in a relationship with him, but not physically. I ended up back at his flat the other week with another coworker, but in the five minutes that we had alone together before I left he didn't make a move, so I was left wondering what the hell he wants from me. I just have so many questions - why would a guy invite a girl over late at night if all he wanted was to chat about his girlfriend? Does he like me at all, or just as a friend (seeing as he's told me stuff he wouldn't tell other people)? I know it's so toxic, and I hate myself for being so available to him. I just don't know what he wants, and haven't had the chance to ask him properly for a while. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!"

Additionally, this is a throwaway since I'm usually pretty active in other subs. 

Background: I've been married to by husband, we'll call him Ethan, for about 5 years now. We've had the usual relationship ups and downs, but our ups have always outweighed our downs. He works as a graphic designer from home. 6 months ago we had our first baby girl, we'll call her Celia, and things have gone down hill ever since.

Any time Ethan offers to help with something he quits after a week. He said he would help with night feedings when she came home, but after a week he moved into his home office at night so she wouldn't wake him up. Even when I moved her into her room he stayed in there so me getting up and down 4-8 times a night wouldn't disturb him. The few times he tried to help at night he would lose his temper and bring her to me. I haven't slept more than 5 hours a night since she was born, the longest stretch being barely 3.

He said he would practice giving her a bottle so I could get a break every once in a while. Again he quit after a few tries because she didn't take to it immediately. When that happened he said he would feed her when she started solids. That also lasted about a week before he stopped entirely.

When I had to make the decision to go back to work or stay home he said he would watch her for an hour or two in the afternoon so she wouldn't have to go to daycare all day. That was the only reason I agreed to go back. He will only pick her up if I'm already on my way home. He never gets her ready to go, never drops her off.

It's the same story for bath time, bed time, story time. He started to help, and then stopped.

He will play with her for a few minutes here or there, but he is quickly annoyed if she cries and most of the time he asks me when she will start being fun. 

When we brought her home he started finding reasons to leave the house more and more. At first I encouraged it since he works from home most of the time, but now he's gone at least 80% of time Celia is home and awake. He joined a gym that he goes to 5 mornings a week. Joined the company soft ball team which plays two nights a week. He plays pick-up soccer with the interns twice a week now too! 

I had to drop my book club and my gym membership because he kept harassing me about when I'd be home because the baby had woken up and all of a sudden he was too much work to do to be bothered with her.

The good news is, when he's done with his busy schedule he still has time to say the house should be cleaner than it is, please keep the baby quiet while he's working, play Civ 5, encourage me to make dinner, and then bitch at me when I'm too tired for sex.

I've told him repeatedly that I'm exhausted all the time. I've asked for help with the house, I've asked him to do more with her, and I've said he has to put more time into us if he expects me to put out more. I don't know what else to do!

He's wasn't a bad husband before Celia was born,  and he isn't a bad father when he actively tries to be around. I don't know if this is indicative of something else or how I can fix the issues.
  
**tl;dr**: My husband has turned into an asshole since our baby was born and I'm sick of his shit. What to do!?"

Back in October there was a huge career fair and I talked to a few companies. One told me to apply online for internship opportunities. I applied and was called in for an interview that went super well and was subsequently offered a summer internship. 

They soon sent me a letter telling me I was accepted as an intern in an IT department position that wrote code for the back end of their website. Cool.

Cut to today I'm sent an email by the recruiter I had been dealing with throughout the process telling me I would now be put in their ""IT document automation team."" I have the suspicion that I'll be doing little coding or really anything having to do with the career path I want to pursue after college. 

Anyone know what ""document automation team"" means, exactly? I don't want to assume anything but it sounds like a team that takes physical documents and types them into a digital medium of some kind. Not the kind of experience I was hoping to gain as an intern.

Well, as fast as a girl can crawl with the ankles and wrists chained up. And of course, she hadn't heard the name 'Arianna' in some time now. She tended to go by Hucow 0021 for the most part.  
  
""Of course, Hucow 0021 was a rather special for us to acquire here,"" Olivia informed Emily, the new intern. ""She was handpicked up our CEO, Scarlett Williams as a personal Hucow. She worked unknowingly with us under the guise of a Secretary whilst we secretly fed her a concoction of lactation-inducing foods. One day, she complained of milk dampening her blouse, we hooked her up to the milkers, assuring her that the procedure would not take long. And that is when we chained her gagged her, and well; you can see the rest"" Olivia beamed as Emily kneeled down to stroke the blushing Arianna / Hucow 0021. Arianna of course remembered the day vividly, however many months ago it was. She would have uttered a complaint, if she were not ballgagged.  
  
The days since working in The Facility blurred into one, however. ""She is usually strapped to the metal apparatus we found her in. A tube in her mouth to feed, a tube at her nipples to milk, and a tube up her bottom to... Urm... Cleanse, enemas, that part isn't quite my speciality."" Olivia trailed off as Emily nodded.  
  
Arianna's blush deepened in shade. The enemas were the worst part of the day, of course.  
  
""And because this little Hucow is just so beautiful, some of the girls come in to her own room during their breaks to play with her; plait her hair, give her a spank, train her how to moo, whatever they see fit! Oh, as long as Mistress Williams approves. Arianna... I mean, Hucow 0021 is her personal calf, after all.""  
  
""So what about the other hucows? Were they all tricked here?"" Emily asked inquisitively.  
  
""Of course they were, silly!"" Olivia admonished back. ""Why do you think we keep them gagged? We offer ripe girls jobs as secretaries, administration, whatever anonymous jobs. After some weeks of controlled feeding, we deem them necessary to Hucowify... And yes; that is a verb."" Emily laughed in response.  
   
""And if they misbehave?""  
  
""Oh, you needn't worry. There is not period they are not tightly bound. But there are some punishments; caning, electrocuting, public humiliation, whatever incentivises them to keep producing. We keep our girls healthy for longevity, so you will notice their breasts do not grow beyond a D-cup at the absolute limit.""  
  
Emily scribbled note in her handbook.  
  
""But what about the boys you capture?"" Emily asked as they approached a double doorway at the end of the corridor. The hair's on Arianna's body stood up as she trailed behind on her leash and collar.  
  
""Watch and learn"" Olivia grinned as she opened the doors to reveal a warehouse with 50 men, all bound to chairs, with identical tubes running through their gags, and into their bottoms for waste. ""We can be a little rough, farming semen,"" Olivia explained. ""Mistress Maisenbacher, our German farm expert specialises on discipline on both Boys and Hucows, but she finds a natural concoction of vitamins appropriate for Cows, and viagra and no visual-stimulus for boys a necessary procedure"".   
  
Upon closer inspection, Emily gasped as she noticed the intense expression of anguish on the Men's faces as they were milked, tubes stimulating and sucking the semen straight from their raging cocks. It was collected through transparent pipework to a tank in the ceiling.   
  
""Marvellous, isn't it?"" Olivia smiled to herself. ""So, where do you fit into all this, Emily?""

I'm in my second year currently, so I don't have any in-field experience yet.

My goal is to get an internship next summer at a highly regarded facility that I fortunately have an employee reference to. When I graduate, I want to either: a) Get into a high-skill job such as one at big tech company in California or Seattle (I've had Google on my mind). b) Get a job at a video game company such as Riot Games or Blizzard Entertainment. or c) Go to graduate school, and then I don't know.

I want a job that will allow me to work my ass off, and in return I'll be compensated with quicker promotions. I've had this idea in my head that when I enter the field I want to get ahead of my peers and put myself in a good position for my age. After a few years of working like this I would like to slow down and relax a bit more once I got my career into a good position.

I hear bad things about the video game industry, but I think I would enjoy making them and being in that atmosphere. I have  no idea how the hierarchy would work at a place like that, or if it would allow me to work a normal 40hr week after working there awhile.

The big tech companies seem to have amazing facilities to work in, with better pay than a video game company. They have brilliant people working there and I'd love to be among them.

Going to graduate school sounds like an overall advantage, but I'm honestly not sure how much it would benefit me. There are also other career options than the ones I listed that I don't know as much about.

This is much longer than I expected, but I'll still post this I guess. Thanks for reading!

4cm7td,1,2016-03-30,DAE compare themselves to their ex...?,abluejacket,DAE,https://www.reddit.com/r/DAE/comments/4cm7td/dae_compare_themselves_to_their_ex/,"Hey, 


this might be a little weird topic, because when I googled this topic (to kind of help myself) I’d rather find it from the perspective from a woman comparing her life to the life of her ex. So this is the other way around. 


About three to four years ago I broke up with my ex. Reason was, I was abroad, she wasn’t honest with me, I found out = a lot of fights, trust issues -&gt; she came to visit me, it didn’t work out (not at all!!!), I ended things. 
After that everything went pretty good. I had great success in university got offered and did a couple of internships and found a new girlfriend, graduated a couple of months ago and immediately got offered a really nice job by a big and famous company and additionally I do some voluntary work for human rights at the same time - and I couldn’t be any happier. But sadly I am not…apparently. 


The problem with me is, that I am for a man a quite sensitive person. With sensitive I mean that I am usually worried about the smallest things, but also that I am very caring for example in my relationship. But I am completely ok with that. I don’t need to be as „manly“ as other men. 


During the last year I started comparing myself to my ex….for which reason ever. This kind of comparison got stronger in the last couple of months. We have contact once in a while, but it’s always her initiating the contact while I keep a certain distance when replying (e.g. I don’t really want her to know what is going on in my life, no matter if it’s good or bad). Additionally „our mutual friends“ completely cancelled contact to me or even deleted me on social media etc. as soon as I broke up with her. So I think that kind of was something which did hurt my „ego“ a little (remember, I mentioned being sensitive - yup, you guessed it, that’s apparently one of the things I am worried about).


Every time she texts me, she explained how she’s going to graduate school now (I am saving up for that now in my job, but I am not even quite sure if I really wanna go or if I might even need to go) or the countries she’s visiting with her friends (some of them are my old friends) at the same time she keeps uploading pictures from her adventures abroad (yes, I blocked her already in my news feed etc. etc. but you can’t really help it if one of her friends is uploading something), while I am usually traveling between three to four countries (depending where my girlfriend is working at currently). So basically I feel like she is having a much better life than I do. But than again I wonder, does she really? Do I really have to compare myself to her? And while I am asking myself such questions, I figure out that this shouldn’t be even something I should be thinking about, because it’s just distracting me. And yes for Christ’s sake I tried so many damn times to stop but apparently I am not f****** able to do so. 


It’s been almost four years now, why is such an unnecessary feeling coming up right now? Now that I am building something up completely on my own? (Her parents are kinda wealthy so money doesn’t seem to be a problem for her - but it kinda gives me the feeling that she’s looking down on me, having just a bachelor’s degree and such).  


Is it „normal“ to feel this way and if so how did those who experienced something similar to this deal with it in the end?


Thanks for any helpful advice! I really appreciate it.


Cheers!

TLDR: in high school, dated a girl, broke up during university, she wasn't honest with me while I was abroad, keeps texting me how good her life is, asking myself if her life is better than mine, and if should even be worried about that

What about THC?,fakenewb,keto,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/4cmac4/will_keto_help_me_clean_my_body_of_toxins_what/,"So far I've been on keto for about 10 days and I'm down 6 pounds (yay!) but I have been wondering about keto as an aide for a little bit of a predicament that I have. 

I am in line to get a really nice internship this summer as long as I nail my last interview coming up. It begins in the second week of May I believe. Before Keto, I was a daily marijuana smoker. Of course, I already read up and saw that this doesn't really have a detrimental effect on my ketosis, but can keto help me to get clean a little bit faster? This internship is with a health insurance company so I am 99% certain I will be drug tested. Odd question I know, but I'm sure someone could help out.

For those who don't know, THC metabolites seem to attach themselves to our fat cells, making it a little slower of a cleansing/detox process for someone with a high weight/BF %. Your average daily marijuana smoker would probably pass a drug test in about 2 weeks to a month.

So will keto and 6 days a week in the gym accelerate this process at all? Even if you aren't **sure**, please tell me what you think.

4cmesb,31,2016-03-30,Email sent to the CMU Community about the recent deaths,jayjaywalker3,cmu,https://www.reddit.com/r/cmu/comments/4cmesb/email_sent_to_the_cmu_community_about_the_recent/,"Dear Members of the Carnegie Mellon University Community,

We are deeply saddened to inform you of the unrelated deaths of two students, both of which we learned about last night.

Yesterday Dean of Student Affairs Gina Casalegno wrote to the campus community about Elliott Glasgow, a first-year undergraduate in engineering, who had been missing. Elliott was discovered last night in an isolated space in his residence hall. Elliott, who came to us from New York City, was a vital member of his residential community and a brother of Phi Delta Theta, known by his many friends for his wit and sense of humor.

Rajat Patra, a student in the Heinz College Master of Information Systems Management program, died in his off-campus apartment. Rajat came from his home in Bangalore to Carnegie Mellon last August to undertake his studies. He was a passionate student who had earned a prestigious internship for the summer and was planning to create his own IT consultancy after graduation. He was also an avid guitar player and proud member of the Heinz community.

We have no reason to believe that these deaths are connected, and want to reassure you that there is no threat to other members of our community. As we share in your sorrow, we want to acknowledge how deeply upsetting these losses are to those who knew Elliott and Rajat, and to the entire Carnegie Mellon community. The team of housefellows, college liaisons, advisors, and others are always available for student support. We would urge any member of our community to engage our Counseling and Psychological Services, either for yourself or as a point of referral for a friend. You may reach a counselor at any time, day or night, at 412-268-2922. Finally, members of the Carnegie Mellon community have a history of looking out for one another. Let us all commit to being especially vigilant and caring for one another at this difficult time.

We will invite members of our campus community to gather this week for mutual support and reflection — we will share details about that soon. Out of respect for this loss, and to focus our efforts on those affected by these deaths, we have decided to postpone the president’s Annual Update that had been scheduled for tomorrow.

The health and welfare of our students is our highest shared commitment, for us personally, for the entire leadership team, and for the whole university community. This has been an area of particular focus and remains among the highest priorities across campus, at all levels. The loss of two young lives — gifted students and valued members of the Carnegie Mellon community — underscores the urgency of our task.

Our hearts go out to all of you, and especially to the families and friends of Elliott and Rajat.

Sincerely,

Subra Suresh, President

Fire destroys building, 7 injured

By: Mason Lucas

Staff Writer

Seven people were injured around 3 a.m. Thursday when the Richardson Apartment Complex at 32nd and Jefferson caught fire.

According to the Parkview Fire Department, the fire started in one of the first-floor apartments and then spread to the rest of the building.

“I couldn’t believe what was happening,” said Gene Wilson, 39, a survivor of the blaze. “I was asleep, and all of the sudden, I smelled smoke. I woke my wife and kids and we rushed outside.”

Wilson lived on the second floor of the complex, and he and his family were able to get out of the building before the fire spread to the remaining three floors.

He said life would be difficult now because most of the family’s belongings were incinerated by the blaze.

“Everything we own is gone,” he said. “We have friends we can stay with, but it’s going to be tough trying to reconstruct our lives.”

Wilson said he and his family were lucky because they were able to get out of the burning building without being hurt, but seven people were injured in the fire.

The names of those who were injured have not yet been released, but according to Fire Chief Don Ritz, all seven are receiving treatment at Parkview Community Hospital.

Ritz said arson has not been ruled out as a possible cause of the fire, and the Parkview Fire Department is currently investigating the matter.

“Things like this are very uncommon around here,” he said. “It could be arson, or just some terrible accident that caused the fire. We really can’t say until we look into the situation more.”

According to Ritz, the Rutherford County branch of the Red Cross will be accepting donations for the surviving victims and their family members.

Donations can be made directly to the Red Cross office at 205 W. Walnut or call 555-6987.

I was born to be a reporter. I knew that was my future career from the time I was in grade school. My parents still talk about how I used to interview my aunts and uncles at our family reunions. I had always written stories, from my childhood on up through high school, where I first got newspaper experience. I covered mostly basketball and football games, but it was a great place to start. 	

That was 12 years ago. Now I’m a news reporter with the Parkview Gazette, and I’ve been working here since I graduated from college six years ago. I mostly cover hard news now, though I started out on the sports desk when I first hired in.

The following Monday after the fire story ran, I was on my way back to the office after interviewing the fire chief who gave us the tip about the fire. He suspected it was arson, and so I went to interview him and get his reasons for such an opinion.

I turned the radio on to WLYN-FM, Parkview’s 80s rock station and had just turned left onto Walnut Street when my cell phone rang. It was Trevor, the radio personality of Parkview, known better as “the biggest jerk this side of radio.” He and I were roommates in college, and had been friends ever since.

“Are we still gonna get together for a beer tonight?” he asked. “And turn your freakin’ radio down.” I turned down the volume so the music was nearly inaudible.

“Sure. Same time, same place as usual, right?” We met every Monday night at Julian’s, the most popular bar in Parkview for a couple of beers, but mostly to catch up on what went on the week before. With both of us being involved in media, we had lots of fun sharing stories about co-workers and tyrant bosses. We had been doing this every Monday since we started college together, and after we both went out into the work world, we continued the tradition.

Trevor laughed. “Yeah, hopefully I can get out of here at a decent time. I have to help the newbie Adrian Freeman track the overnight slot. Whatta green horn! Hang on a second. I gotta talk.”

Trevor put me on hold so I could still hear the radio. “This is 92.7 WLYN, the 80s station that rocks the house here in Parkview. I’m Trevor Adams, the biggest jerk this side of radio. Let’s take a call.”

Before I realized what was happening, I was on the air. That putz.

“Go ahead, caller.”

I smiled as I thought of some clever way to make Trevor look like a jerk. “Yeah, I just had a quick question for you, Trevor. Isn’t it true that you’re a mama’s boy?”

Trevor laughed, but tried to pretend like this was all planned. “No, as you know from listening to me, I am the biggest jerk, and no one especially my mom tells me what to do.”

I knew that wasn’t really true. Any time Trevor needed his tail kicked for reckless behavior she always made sure he knew exactly what she thought.

Trevor laughed again. “Thank you, caller for that special piece of wisdom. We’ll be right back after some stupid commercials with some more of your favorite 80s hair bands.”

Trevor got back on the phone. “You jerk.”

""What in the world is this crap! Rewrite this."" 	

Roger Dexter was our managing editor at the Gazette, though most of us referred to him as ""The Intimidator,” a short, stocky man in his 50s who made the female interns cry. I swear, he had a voice so loud people in advertising could hear him yell, and that office is three doors down the hall. He was also prone to throwing an occasional chair or phone book if a reporter didn’t have a story in on time. Half of the staff writers hated him, especially minutes before deadline. I didn't mind him, though. Dexter was my mentor in a way. He showed me the importance of good copyediting, and even though he was a hard-nose, Dexter got the job done.

""What's wrong with this?"" asked Stephanie Reynolds. She was the intern we hired for the fall semester. She was majoring in journalism and had written for her high school and college newspapers. Stephanie was a decent writer, but still incredibly green as a reporter. At 21, she thought she knew it all, and she frequently gave Dexter crap.

""Your lead is weak, there are tons of style errors in here, your quotes are absolutely grotesque..."" I watched the veins in his large, bald head throb as he spoke.

I stood back and watched Dexter let her have it. Stephanie stood with her arms crossed over her chest, a defiant sneer on her face. She had dark hair, brown eyes, but a complete witch. She always wore short skirts to show off her body, but that was part of her problem. I’d caught her checking herself out in the mirror in Dexter’s office before, but she didn’t know I saw her. Stephanie Reynolds could win a contest for “most vain” in the newsroom. 

Something Dexter said caught my attention. ""Who taught you how to write anyway? What did you do, take your J-school courses by mail?"" Stephanie's face turned a bright shade of red. I turned my head to hide the smirk I had on my face. 

""Fine, I'll rewrite it. I'll rewrite the whole thing. Or better yet, why don't you just put another reporter on this story?"" Stephanie thrust her copy in Dexter's hands and stomped back to her desk. Apparently she thought she was God's gift to reporting in high school and college. 	

Dexter shook his head and groaned. ""She should've been a theater major,"" he said, and I went back to my desk. 

""Any messages for me?"" I asked Stephanie.

""Just one. Don Ritz called you. He wants to do a follow-up interview on that Richardson thing."" How odd a source would call me after I just did the interview, but maybe he was willing to give me more than just the general information on the fire. I made a mental note to call him back as soon as I got a few free minutes.

""Thanks, Stephanie,"" I said and turned to leave.

""Where are you going?""

""Oh, I have to go and pick up Lillian.""

Lillian was my 6-year-old daughter, who I had adopted four years ago after her mother, an ex-girlfriend of mine, died in a car accident. Monica had been driving on ice and had slid into the other lane, hitting another car head-on. 	

I found out when we were dating she had cheated on me and gotten pregnant. I knew there was no way the child could be mine, but I had tests done anyway. Sure enough, Lillian wasn’t my child. 

I broke up with Monica soon after that, but I wanted to remain friends with her, even though she had hurt me deeply. It took a year or so for me to forgive her, but we became very close after that. I was even there at the hospital the day Lillian was born. I couldn’t get over how much that baby looked like her mother, and from that day on, I loved her as if she was my own daughter. 

""So what are you guys gonna do tonight?""

""If you'd interrogate your sources as well as you interrogate me, you'd get some really good information."" I walked out of the newsroom without waiting for her to say anything back.

***

""Mason!""

Lillian came running toward me with open arms. I had just pulled into the driveway at Jill Howard's house. She was the 38-year-old woman who babysat for Lillian after school while I was at work. Jill wasn't married and had no children of her own, so she ran a day care center out of her house. On Monday nights she stayed at my house with Lillian until I got home. Now that Lillian was older, I occasionally let her come to work with me if I knew I was going to be working late.

I scooped Lillian up and swung her around, something she always asked me to do. I couldn't get over how much more she was starting to look like Monica—the same hazel eyes, the same blonde hair.

""Hi, angel."" I put her back down on the ground.

""Look at the picture I drew today at school,"" she said and handed me a large piece of white construction paper. I looked at the drawing and smiled. She had drawn a man with brown hair and blue eyes who was sitting at a desk. He had a pen in one hand and a phone in the other. At the top of the picture, written in red crayon, were the words ""I luv u, Mason."" I giggled because she had written the “s” in my name backwards.

""Who is this?"" I asked. I thought I'd tease her a little.

Lillian dramatically put her hands on her hips and sighed loudly. ""It's you, silly!""

I re-examined the picture and then said, ""Oh, yes. Now I see the resemblance. Thank you, sweetie. This is going right over my desk at work."" I reached down and gave her a kiss on the cheek.

""Can we have burgers and fries tonight, Mason?"" Lillian called me by my first name, not ""dad."" When I had first adopted her, she called me dad, but right before her fourth birthday, I sat her down and told her I wasn't really her father, and her mother wanted me to take care of her if something bad would happen. I remember her looking up at me with wide, curious eyes, and she asked me where her real father was. I wasn't sure how to answer her, so I opted to tell her the truth. From then on, she called me Mason, but continued to love me as if I were her biological father.

""Can we eat out tonight?"" she asked again.

""Sure,"" I said. ""We might even get some ice cream.""

After 20 minutes we were sitting at the kitchen table at home.

""Chicken nuggets this time, eh?"" Lillian usually got a cheeseburger and fries, but she switched on me. I got a couple of cheeseburgers and a large batch of fries.

""Yeah, I wanted to be different."" She tore the top of her straw paper, then blew the paper at me.

""Hey, watch it.""

She giggled, and then tossed a fry at me. ""Is Uncle Trevor coming over tonight?""

""He might. I'm gonna visit with him for a while, but I'll tell him you want him to come over."" Lillian loved Trevor. She considered him a buddy. He once took her on a tour of the radio station, and sometimes he came over and played cards with us.

""What else did you do at school today?""

""I learned two more letter people,"" she said. ""Mr. H and Mr. R. Did you meet any famous people today?""

I laughed. Lillian thought I met celebrities all the time because I was a reporter, which wasn’t true at all. ""Not today.""

Just as I finished my second sandwich, there was a knock at the door. It was Jill.

""I'll get it!"" Lillian jumped up and ran toward the front door. She and Jill began to set up the Monopoly board in the living room. I guess Jill was teaching her how to play.

""I should be gone about an hour,"" I said as I kissed Lillian and walked outside.

***

While I waited for Trevor at Julian’s, I ordered a beer, but decided I was only going to have one tonight. I didn’t like to drink when I had a lot on my mind. Plus, now that I had a daughter, the whole concept of getting drunk seemed juvenile.

Trevor walked in with a smug smile on his face. He certainly did look like an ex-high school football star, a tall, husky guy with dark, curly hair. It’s too bad he always sat the bench in college.

“Well, if it isn’t Trevor Adams, the mama’s boy!”

“In the flesh,” he said as he plopped down at our table. “So, what’s up, loser? Anything come of that fire story?”

“Interesting you would ask,” I said. “Ritz called me again today. I don’t know, but I have this weird feeling there’s something he isn’t telling me about the investigation. Just call it a hunch.”

“You know how those guys are, Mason. There’s always some conspiracy going on.” Trevor laughed as the waitress brought him a beer. She was cute, but more Trevor’s taste than mine. She was tall, blonde and thin.

“Can I get you guys anything? Some hot wings?” she asked.

Trevor peered at her over his dark-framed glasses. “How about your phone number.”

I rolled my eyes. The man didn’t know when to quit. “Nice going,” I said.

The girl laughed and started to walk away, but Trevor must have needed his revenge for the on-air thing. “Hey, come here, sweetheart,” he said. “My friend hasn’t had a date in years, any friends of yours desperate enough to go out with such a loser?”

That putz.

She only ignored him. “I’ll check on you guys later,” she said and walked back behind the bar.

“You are such a jerk, Trev.”

“Just paying you back,” he said and took another swig of his beer. 		

We talked for a little while longer, but I wasn’t in the mood to socialize. Something was bugging me about the apartment fire, though I couldn’t pinpoint it exactly.

A few minutes before 8, I stood up to leave. I waved to Trevor as I left the bar.

***

I went to the office around 9 the next morning and called Don Ritz. He answered the phone with a little edge in his voice. I sat back in my chair, wondering why he was so frantic over one apartment fire that might or might not be arson.

“I have some more information for you, Mason, and I need to talk to you right away. I don’t want to do this on the phone,” he said quickly. That was fine by me. I preferred doing interviews in person anyway.	

“I’ll meet you at Julian’s Bar at noon.”

I remember thinking how strange this whole thing seemed to me at the time. I tapped my pen on the desk and waited for an answer from Don.

***

When I got to Julian’s at 11:50, Don was already there. He was an older man in his late 50s, but for some reason he looked much older than he did yesterday. His wrinkles were more defined and he had dark circles under his eyes.

“We stopped the arson investigation,” he said before I even sat down.

“What?” I got out my pen to take this down.

“The investigation is on hold due to lack of concrete evidence. It looks more like faulty wiring than arson anyway, but we haven’t checked for sure.”

I leaned forward in my chair. “You mean nobody’s checked for sure? What specifically is the reason for that?” I asked.

“It was an old building, built in the 1920s. We attributed the cause of the fire to the apartment building’s age and saw no reason to investigate farther.”

This didn’t make any sense. Surely they’d make sure for insurance purposes, especially for those living there. “Is the fire department in a habit of dropping these kind of investigations?”

Don shifted uncomfortably in his seat and fidgeted nervously. “The rest of what I tell you is off the record.”

Just my luck, I thought. I sat my pen down on the table and leaned back in my chair.

“We haven't completely ruled out the possibility that this could be arson. It might even look like Thompson is somehow involved.”

I stood up without realizing how much attention I might draw to myself. “What?”

“Mayor Thompson has had plans to build a new mall on the south end of town for years, but the Richardson Apartment Complex was in the way. Now that the building’s been destroyed, there's nothing keeping the mall project from taking off. Don't you think this could be more than just a coincidence?”

“Don, why are you telling me this if it’s off…”

“Just listen,” he said. “We're not sure of any of this. That's why we don't want it to go public yet. This is merely speculation, and if word got out about the investigation, it would cause some serious embarrassment for the mayor.”

It all seemed so strange to me at the time. I knew Mayor Thompson because I'd interviewed him several times, and I wasn't sure he would do something to that apartment building just to put up a mall.

“Don, you know I can’t do anything about this if we’re off the record. At least go deep background with me. Maybe someone would come forward with some more information if we ran the story.” I picked up my pen, hoping he would give in. Deep background would at least allow me to get the word out, even if source attribution was vague.

“I can’t.”

“Then why are you telling me any of this to begin with?”

“I like Thompson. He's a good guy, and I don't really believe he could be involved with something like this. I want you to look into this, Mason, but I can’t come forward and go on the record with you. I’m sorry.”

Don stood up and left the bar, leaving me sitting alone.

***

I sat at home that night perplexed, my head still spinning by what I had been told that afternoon, knowing I couldn’t do a thing about it. Was there really a possibility Thompson had something to do with the fire? I let out a sigh and wondered why Ritz had to go off the record, when he knew I couldn’t use the information if he did.

“Whatcha doing?” Lillian walked into my room as she held on to her cup full of water with both hands.

“Just thinking.”

“’Bout what?”

“Just stuff.”

She put down her cup on my nightstand and climbed up next to me on my bed. She looked up at me and softly asked, “Can I help?”

I loved that little girl so much. I began to feel guilty that I didn’t have more time to spend with her. “No, this is complicated, angel. This is adult stuff.”

“Will you read me a story then?”

“Sure. Go pick me out a good book.” Lillian ran to her bedroom and came back with a “Curious George” book. She sat quietly on my lap as I read, and before I even got to the end, we both fell asleep.

Wednesday, Sept. 29, 1999-The Parkview Gazette

Richardson fire investigation pending

From staff reports

According to the Parkview Fire Department, the arson investigation into the fire at Richardson Apartment Complex is temporarily on hold due to lack of concrete evidence.

Fire Chief Don Ritz said the cause of the fire might be due to bad wiring and run-down conditions in the building.

""It looks more like faulty wiring than arson anyway,"" he said.

Age of the building is another factor the fire department is considering.

""It was an old building, built in the 1920s,"" Ritz said, ""We attributed the cause of the fire to the apartment building's age and saw no reason to investigate farther.""

***

It was just after 2 in the afternoon, but it felt much later. I thought about going home because I knew I couldn’t get any work done because of this whole thing about the fire and now the investigation being on hold. I had been making calls to various political officials and police officers in the area, but no one was giving me any facts. Most of the people I talked to just flat out refused to comment. I even tried to phone Thompson, who was not available, of course. After probably the 10th “no comment,” I had given up, slamming my phone down on its base.

“What is this crap?” I heard Dexter yell from his office. 
“Reynolds, get over here! This is not how you write a freakin’ obituary,” he roared, and the two were at it again. 

“Get off my butt, Dexter!” 

“Don’t you have any sense of vocabulary, or did you learn English as a second language?”

Sometimes he came up with some great one-liners. Stephanie threw her hands up in the air and started to walk away.

“Here, let me introduce you to a friend of mine,” Dexter said as he picked up the nearest dictionary he could find. “His name—Random House Dictionary!” Dexter launched that thing at her as if he were Zeus throwing his lightning bolts. Stephanie dodged the book and then spit out a few colorful expletives even I wouldn’t use. I became so engrossed in their argument that I jumped when my phone rang. It was only Trevor.

“Hey, sissy boy,” I said, but Trevor didn’t laugh.

“Be serious. I just got a call about you. Sounded a lot like a threat to me.”

“Did you record it?”

Trevor sighed loudly. “No, I just sat here and peed myself while the guy talked to me…of course I recorded it!”

“Let’s hear it.”

After some fumbling and a couple of four-letter words, Trevor played the call. 

“WLYN…”

“Yeah, Trevor. You need to tell your reporter friend to lay off the fire story, or he’s gonna end up in a lot of trouble.”

CLICK.

I sat in my chair and immediately went numb. I wondered who in the world would make a call like that.

“I’d watch out if I were you, man,” Trevor said. “I think whoever called me knows who started the fire.”

""Come on, Trevor. We don't know if it was arson. A fine journalist you'd make jumping to conclusions like that.""
I hung up the phone and immediately thought of Lillian. This call had to be some stupid prank, but just in case, I wanted her here with me. 

I got up to leave the office around 2:30.

***

“Lillian!”

“Roger!” Lillian ran up to Dexter and wrapped her arms around him. She was the only person I knew who called Dexter by his first name. Everyone loved it when I brought her to the office. That meant Dexter wouldn’t swear or throw furniture.

“How are you, sweetheart?”

“I’m fine.”

“Are you here to learn to be a reporter like your daddy when you grow up?” Dexter sat down and bounced Lillian on his knee.

“No. I wanna be a cheerleader!” She jumped off of Dexter's lap and began jumping up and down.

“You have that look in your eyes, Mason,” he said.

I stared him down to let him know this was important, that I needed to talk to him alone. He immediately picked up the hint.

“Hey, Lillian, I have a really important job for you. Do you know what it is?”

She stared up at Dexter and smiled. “No.”

“I want you to go in my office and be my secretary. If the phone rings, you answer and write down who calls. Get their phone numbers, too. Can you do that for me?”

“Sure,” Lillian said as she ran to Dexter’s office and slammed the door.

“And no playing with the white-out like you did last time!” His voice would have ranked high in decibels just then. 

“OK!”

Once we were alone, I told him about everything Don had told me off the record. Dexter sat back, a look of concentration on his face, as he tried to figure out how to handle this.

""This is big,” he said. “We have to get to the mayor.”

“I’ve tried all day. He won’t return my calls. I even went by his office earlier today, and his secretary said he was out.”

“Keep trying!”

“I seriously doubt he’s gonna talk to any reporter right now with everything that’s been going on,” I said. Then, I thought of something I hadn’t before, something that might work, someone who could get an interview with Thompson and somehow get him to talk—Stephanie.

Dexter shot me down immediately. “You really think I’m gonna let some green college intern do this story? I want a professional!”

“He doesn’t know her. For all he knows, she’s just a college student doing a profile for class or something.”

“Forget it!”

“Forget what?” Stephanie walked up to us and put her hands on her hips. “You don’t think I can interview the mayor, Dexter?”

“It’s not that. It’s just that…”

“Look,” she said, “He has no idea who I am. All I’ve been doing here for the most part is writing obits. He doesn’t know I work here. I can get him to talk to me. Maybe he had nothing to do with it, but is afraid to deny it because it might make him look bad.”

“I still don’t like this.”

“She wants to do this, Dexter. You’d better let her.” At least she was on my side. Maybe she could find something out the rest of us couldn’t. ""We have to find out about this somehow.""

“Fine,” he said and waved her off with his hand. 

***

That evening I called my parents and asked if Lillian could stay with them for a few days. If Stephanie could get through to the mayor, we'd all be pulling some long hours, and Jill couldn't watch her the whole time. Mom said it was fine, and after we hung up, I tried to break the news to Lillian without upsetting her. She hated when I had to spend long hours at the office.

“Grandma and Grandpa Lucas want you to come stay with them for a few days.”

“How come?”

“They miss you.”

Lillian wasn’t buying it. She looked at me the same way I looked at Trevor whenever he said something stupid. “Don’t lie to me, Mason.”

I sat down on the couch and she climbed up on my lap. I stroked her blonde curls. “Honey, the truth is I’m involved in a really big story right now, so I'll be spending lots of time at work.""

She frowned. ""Can't I go to work with you?"" 

""No, you can't. Dexter and the rest of us are going to be really busy. Just trust me on this one, angel.”

***

Thursday morning I dropped Lillian off at my parents’ house and then drove to work. Stephanie had an interview with Mayor Thompson that morning, and I wanted to be in the office when she came back. She and I had gone over a list of questions the night before on the phone. 

Dexter met me at the door with a worried look of terror. “She’s not back yet.”

“Maybe it’s going well.”

“She probably went to the mall to get her nails done,” he said sarcastically.

I rolled my eyes. “Gimme a break. You’re always such a jerk to her. I don’t get it.”

“The kid has talent,” he said. “I pick on her because I want her to be good. In a way, she kinda reminds me of you when you started out.”

“Gee thanks. I had no idea I was that vain.”

“Cut the crap and get to work,” he said and then chuckled. I went to my desk.

A few minutes later, Stephanie marched into the office, a huge grin on her face. She slammed her notebook down on my desk and screamed “eureka.”

“What are you so happy about?” Dexter said as he came out of his office.

“I got him,” she said. 

“What did he tell you?” Dexter and I asked simultaneously.

“Well, I asked him about what he does, what kind a projects he has planned for the city, general stuff like that. Then he mentioned the mall on Jefferson he wants to build. So I asked him what kinds of procedures had to be done to put up a mall of that size in a residential area. He told me you had to get rid of the houses and apartments in the area and then get it re-zoned for commercial use.”

“So what?” Dexter said. “That doesn’t tell us anything.”

“You didn’t let me finish,” Stephanie continued. “After that he made a comment about how he could begin construction now that the Richardson Complex was gone. Then he got really quiet.”

I swear, Dexter looked like a little kid who just found out he could open his Christmas presents early. “Did you nail him?”

“Actually, what he told me was kind of interesting. He said he had nothing at all to do with that fire, and this was just a freak coincidence. He also said he’s gonna do something to straighten this whole thing out, but still keep the mall project on tap.”

“Good work!” Dexter said. “We might actually have a story now.”

We ran a story on Friday about Mayor Thompson’s plans to build a new mall on Jefferson and the coincidence between the new mall site and where the apartment complex used to be, and Stephanie got her first byline with our paper. I guess she just needed to find that one story so she could prove herself to Dexter, but it only turned out to make her more arrogant than before.

I was just about to leave the office when she walked up to me. “Hey, Mason.”

“Yes?”

“I know this might be weird because we work together, but do you wanna go out for coffee or dinner tonight?”

“I don’t think so. I don’t date people I work with,” I said. “And anyway, I have plans with someone else this evening—my daughter.”

Thompson resigns from office

By: Mason Lucas

Staff Writer

In a press conference given yesterday in City Hall, Mayor Sam Thompson announced he would resign his position as mayor.

“I feel I can no longer support the city as your mayor, so I am going to step down and let someone else take office,” he said in his address.

He also announced that all plans for the new mall on Jefferson Street, just south of town would be cancelled.

“I feel that Parkview needs more expansion in the way of retail,” he said. “But because of the strange coincidence between the fire and this project, I don’t feel I’m the man to initiate this expansion.”

Fire Chief Don Ritz said he was not surprised about Thompson’s resignation.

“We are getting ready to drop the investigation about the Richardson fire and Thompson’s involvement,” he said. “The fire department has concluded it was faulty wiring in the building that caused the blaze.”

Even with the cause being known, Ritz said he felt bad for the former mayor. 

“We feel this is something that needs to be put to rest,” Ritz said, “for the families of those injured and for those who are without homes. Plus, the situation has been humiliating enough for Thompson.”

Just before I left the office on Friday, Trevor called me with a confession. Apparently he and that Freeman guy he works with thought it would be really funny to record a mock-threat call against me to rile me up last week.

That putz. Prank calls really are immature. Sometimes I wonder if that guy will ever grow up. I was so mad at him I skipped our usual drinks and rap session at Julian’s that next week. The thick-skinned retard didn’t seem to mind.

Friday afternoon, I picked up Lillian after school, but something was different this time. I found myself hugging her a little tighter and a little longer than usual.

Two days after the resignation story ran, we found out about a press conference to announce plans to build a new apartment complex where Richardson used to be.

Of course, I’ll probably end up covering the press conference. It's not really hard, breaking news not like what I had just dealt with in the last week or so, but as I said in the beginning, I was born to be a reporter.

4cmqsi,2,2016-03-30,Cornell ILR from Community College,Defeaterr,chanceme,https://www.reddit.com/r/chanceme/comments/4cmqsi/cornell_ilr_from_community_college/,"So hear me out on this.

Back in September I got a big packet in the mail from Cornell's ILR school saying I look like an excellent prospective transfer. I am a sophomore at community college and didn't really do well in High School. My GPA at the time of the letter was about a 3.65. The way they reached out to me is because I am the Vice President of Phi Theta Kappa at my school. Some other extra curriculars include: 

-Vice President of the Business club
-Member of students for global citizenship 
-Volunteer english &amp; public speaking tutor 
-Currently training to be an EMT
-Internship with international stationary sales team for a company called Weveel LLC
-Traveled to places like Hong Kong and Ningbo China with the company to meet with buyers and discuss with the Chinese sales team.

So I spoke to the admissions director Ian at the school and he said that all my stuff looked great and that the international travel was a great thing to have on my resume. I was able to greatly use this in the essay for Cornell that asks what prior work experience makes me interested in the ILR school. After finishing my Essays I spoke with Ian again and he said all the points I touched on were perfect. He said High School and SAT scores aren't going to matter at all, but I am still very nervous. 

Can someone chance me and just give me an idea? This is my biggest goal right now and I can't imagine going to any other school.

The position is great, I get to tweak items on the menu, create new dishes, and  along with the owners of the restaurant I will help create our new menu for the spring/summer. 

While being a chef is a lot of responsibility I think am handling it well, the food at the restaurant is not high end by any means, its still tasty though.

The problem is that I have only been working in the industry for 2 years. I finished cooking school a year and half ago, did my internship at a high end  French restaurant and worked in another high end place right after that. 

Because I am still unexperienced  I feel like I have a lot to learn before moving to a position of responsibility. I am not sure being a chef is the best option at the moment, given the fact that I am not learning a lot in terms of technique. I feel like I would learn more working as a commis or cook in a restaurant where I can learn more on a daily basis.

Any thoughts?

My two goals after getting accepted are to get an internship at a Big 4 and eventually get employed at a Big 4 and I know it is early, but I am wondering what classes I can take to help me on my path that goal since I have free time.

 

I work full time and basically will have time for 1 class per quarter at CC [fall, winter spring]

My intro series was in java. I am looking at taking 3 of the following :

-linux/unix intro class

-python class [used in lower divs where I hope to go]

-c++ class [used in a lot of upper divs where I am trying to go and their intro c++ is supposed to be hard]

-sedgewick algorithims 1 coursera class

-sedgewick algorithims 2 coursera class

-DS and Algorithims class

 

I am thinking DS and algorithims so the two sedgewick classes and the one DS and algo class but I am not sure. What would be best to focus on given my eventual Big 4 goals?

4cn5xc,43,2016-03-30,Super discouraged by a review one month into my internship.,csthrowaway_sad,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4cn5xc/super_discouraged_by_a_review_one_month_into_my/,"Hi all. I'm approaching a mid-term review at my current internship. It's at a company that is known for pushing employees, even interns really hard. That being said, the reviews during the first 3 and a half weeks were pretty positive. Now, after a month, I was told that I need to work on a deep understanding of all the technical stuff I'm working on. It's not enough to just slap code together, which I agree with, but they want to see a deeper knowledge of the tech stack I'm working with.

Not only that, but apparently someone on my team (maybe more than one person, not sure) got the impression that the way that I ask questions is sometimes arrogant. That's the complete opposite impression that I want to give, and it made me very sad to think that someone felt that way about my way of asking questions.

Idk, I'm just really down now. I realize an internship is about growing, and that internships at certain companies are very grueling affairs...but I'm discouraged by the fact that there's so much to learn and not enough time, and super discouraged by the fact that a coworker was rubbed the wrong way. I'm discouraged by the idea that I presented myself poorly and gave the wrong impression.

I'm also super discouraged by one of my coworkers who I work closely with - she has a long memory. For example, I made a mistake a few weeks ago and after looking into stuff more closely, I told her that she's right. But she keeps bringing that up whenever my managers and mentors are in earshot or when she meets with them. I'm starting to think she doesn't like me? That's pretty discouraging too, because I have been taking steps to avoid asking her questions that I can figure out on my own but she still brings up the small handful of times when I asked her to explain something that I could've figured out on my own.

I don't know, I just want to throw in the towel and take a fucking vacation. Idk, what should I do? Grow a thick skin and just focus on improving? Not take shit personal? Explain to my coworker that I've been taking steps to avoid repeated aggravations and that I'd appreciate if she stops bringing up past mistakes at the worst time as if they're still being repeated? I love this place and I've learned a lot, but how do you remain motivated when you accidentally give off the wrong impression when you ask questions? How do you fix things if you gave a bad first impression to a coworker who might also just be looking for someone to put down?

:( My strategy so far has been to just accept that I'm wrong and to just focus on learning and growing, and to assume that all my coworkers are good natured and want the best for me, but I'm still saddened by the review and my performance. Idk. "

I'm sorry. I feel so weird doing this, like I have to apologise for it, but today has been a really hard day. I’m just feeling crushed by some things that have been weighing on me for a long time and I had to get them off. I don’t know if I even really want anyone to read this, or if I just wanted to write it down for my sake, to know that I could. Either way, this is my story. It’s not very exciting or powerful, and I’m not going to go into detail about a lot of big things because I don’t really feel like sharing that right now (sorry), but it is very long and thorough (again, sorry).

I’ve struggled with depression in some form for as long as I can remember. I was a weird kid who didn’t really fit in, so I got bullied and ostracised a lot. Even the few people I did consider my friends basically just kept me around to make fun of me, or would be nice to me when we were alone, but deny being my friend when others were around. I was very lonely, so I spent a lot of time retreating into fantasy – books, TV, video games etc. The characters in these stories were the friends I never had, I felt close to them. I would often watch or read the same things over and over again, because it made me feel safe; watching a movie I loved that I’d seen 100 times already, it felt like coming home. I have no brothers or sisters, only my parents, who I used to be desperate to impress because they were the only people I had in my life, but they would fight a lot, which upset me, so I would retreat even further into my fantasies. As I grew older, my home environment became more and more toxic and it became clearer to me how manipulative my parents could be and how dependent I was on their attention and approval. I also realised how sad and lonely I was most of the time, but wasn’t really mature enough to really grasp the seriousness of my situation.

In my teenage years, I went through the typical problems – mood swings, rebellion, worries about fitting in and my future etc. etc. but this was exacerbated by my earlier struggles and it suddenly became apparent to me just how much sadness and pain I’d been bottling up and ignoring. I was a very bitter and angry teenager; I resented everyone around me for isolating me, making fun of me and generally making me feel like I was worthless. The one thing I have always had, however, is my intelligence, and so, desperately low in self-esteem, I turned to arrogance as a defence mechanism. I convinced myself that everyone else was an idiot and because I was smart, I was better than them; I didn’t need their attention or their friendship, I was better off without it. Slowly, I amassed a group of similarly cynical friends who I kept under my thumb; we thought we were better than “normal” people and constantly cut each other down and kept ourselves in line if we felt any of us were ever being too “phony”. Of course, this was pathetic, and I knew it was pathetic, which only made me hate myself more. I truly loathed everything about who I was – my looks, my personality, my anxieties, the fact that I wanted the respect and attention of the people who rejected me.  I felt completely worthless and that I had no future or opportunity to be successful in life, I was just angry all the time.

Around the age of 17 I hit my lowest point and began to realise that I may very well be genuinely, seriously depressed, which terrified me. I basically didn’t leave my bed for a week because I was so miserable and scared of facing the truth. Having this realisation, however, helped me in the long run. Desperate not to confront the seriousness of my issues and unsure of what else to do to make the pain go away, I made an effort to be more positive, more friendly, to act like nothing was wrong and I could fit in with everyone else. And while at first this started off as an act to convince others (and most importantly, myself) that I wasn’t sick, it slowly started to have an effect on me. I realised that being nice and positive felt really good, that giving other people a chance and being open to new experiences and friendships could be very interesting, and that acting confident actually made me feel more confident. So, I took on a new persona and though I was worried that going to University and leaving my friends behind would be very difficult for me, (considering my previous difficulties with making friends and general social anxiety) this reinvention of myself ended up serving me very well. I suddenly found making new friends very easy, new experiences came often and were usually a lot of fun and I felt more confident and comfortable with myself than ever before. I had a new sense of independence and finally had the confidence to admit to myself what I had always been afraid to acknowledge – I wanted to make movies. Or write. Or whatever. I just wanted to be creative in some way, it had been my dream for as long as I could remember, but my low self-esteem, lack of support from my parents and fears that it’s just not practical had always held me back; I always assumed I would never be able to do it. But now, I felt like I could do anything and so finally, I could see a future for myself. A life I wanted to lead. Now that all the hate and negativity had been washed away, I realised how great my group of friends were and how much I valued them for sticking by me when I had been so nasty and self-absorbed; we had some great times together and really knew how to make each other laugh. For a while, everything was great.

But when I left University, things took a turn for the worse. Things had steadily been getting worse as my time there went on, anyway, as it became more apparent how difficult it would be to follow my ambitions as the realities of employment and rent and bills and responsibilities began to loom overhead, but overall, I felt okay about it. I was worried, sure, and I knew things wouldn’t be easy, but I was willing to work hard to get where I wanted to go. A year out of University, however, I still didn’t have a job, despite my best efforts. Okay, so maybe I hadn’t tried as hard as I could have, but I was finding it really hard to find any way into what I wanted to do and it was frustrating. So, I decided to settle for something only tangentially related to my goals for now and work my way forward. I still couldn’t find anything. As desperation built, I turned to jobs that had nothing to do with my aims or skills and still had no success. It was at this point that those negative feelings began to return. I started to lose confidence in myself, that bright future I saw in front of me began to fade away, I felt like I was making no progress in my life and was desperate to get out of the slump I was in before I fell back into what I had now accepted was very likely a state of depression. All I wanted was to start making steps towards starting a real adult life, but I found myself shoved down at every attempt. I was feeling very dejected and lonely, as my friends were having more success than me and it felt like they were moving on and leaving me behind. But no matter how bad things were getting, I convinced myself that I wasn’t depressed, I couldn’t be. After all, things were nowhere near as bad as they were at my lowest point, and I got past that, didn’t I? So I could get past this, I just had to keep at it until I found my opportunity. Then, things might be tough for a while, but I would know I was working towards something. I would get my happy ending eventually.

Eventually, I got an internship. It was at a small company and not exactly what I wanted to do, but they were right where I wanted to be, had connections with all sorts of companies that did the stuff I did want to do and the work seemed well-suited to my skills. It wasn’t perfect and took some getting used to, but I liked it. The people were very nice and I made some friends and had some good times, and at times, the work could even be enjoyable. It felt like at last, I was making some progress. But as the internship went on and I was fed the same level of work over and over, I realised that I had hit a wall; there was nothing more I could get out of it and nowhere further to go. The idea of going back to the drawing board and searching for jobs all over again made my stomach turn; it was so awful the first time. But nearly a year had passed and I was still nowhere closer to doing what I want to do and with no clearer idea on how to get there. As the internship drew to an end, I managed to secure a paid job with another company doing the same kind of work. I wasn’t sure whether to feel relieved, or trapped.

Anyway – and this is the important part – in the month transition period between my internship and this new job, I had time to think again, and it’s like I had a horrible moment of clarity. I could no longer use the excuse of “well I’m not as bad as when I was at my lowest, so I can’t be depressed.” I felt much worse now than I ever did back then. It was like my world completely shattered in an instant, as a tidal wave of pain, regret, loneliness, frustration and despondence came flooding out all at once. I realised that I’ll never be a filmmaker, or any sort of creator – I am so wracked with depression and anxiety and self-loathing  that I can almost never motivate myself to even attempt to start writing something, let alone finish it or show it to anybody, and I have no idea where I would take it or what I’d do with it even if I did. The idea of being independent and financially responsible terrifies me. I have no idea how to budget properly, thinking about  regular payment or bills or anything like that makes me feel like I’m going to have a panic attack and I often lay awake at night sweating as I worry about my financial situation and how long it can last. The idea of doing any job (except what I really want to do, which seems impossibly unattainable to me now) makes me feel even more sick. I hate it. I hate being trapped somewhere for hours on hours doing work that bores me, knowing that I can’t leave and knowing that I’ll have to be back again tomorrow, with only brief moments of reprieve. Maybe I’m just lazy, I don’t know, but it feels like something more than that, to me; it feels like I just can’t function in this system and that if I try to, I’ll die. I’ve been at this new job for about a month now and honestly, every morning I wake up and go into work it feels like I die a little more, but I don’t know what else to do. I can’t see a future for myself anymore; it feels like I’ll never be happy. Nothing fulfils me, I never have any energy, I can’t stop worrying, things that used to bring me joy either don’t work nearly as well as they used to or I’m taken out of the moment when I realise this is only a fleeting moment of happiness and I’ll soon be back doing things that make me miserable or thinking about things that make me feel physically ill with worry.

I try to put things in perspective, to tell myself that it’s not so bad and I still have good things in my life – I still love my friends very much and I have a wonderful, supportive girlfriend who I adore. However, my friends now feel like they’ve almost completely moved on with their lives; most of them have moved away for work and the very few that are left are usually so busy that we barely have time to see each other. I feel safe and happy with my girlfriend, but she lives half-way around the world from me and I don’t know how we’re going to make it work on a long-term basis. I used to be able to focus on the good things in my life, to look forward to stuff and think “Okay, things aren’t great now, but in a week I’ve got my friend’s birthday and that’s going to be a lot of fun.” Then I would be able to push my negative thoughts aside and work towards that, effectively ignoring the fact that I have a problem. But now that I’ve truly accepted that I’m depressed, it’s like the veil has been lifted and I can see I was only tricking myself; these methods don’t work anymore and in fact, the experiences I looked forward to which used to recharge me now barely give me any enjoyment or emotional response whatsoever. I just feel numb, and exhausted. I don’t want to do anything, and I no longer have any idea how I’m going to get better; it feels like I never will. I’ve talked to my doctor and have set up counselling, but I worry that they aren’t going to tell me anything I don’t already know and that they really won’t be able to help. Maybe I’m jumping the gun on that, I know, but I can’t think rationally right now. Even when I try to tell myself something using logic, I can’t help how I feel. And I just feel lousy. Honestly, I feel like I’ve died and now I’m just wandering around like a zombie, going through the motions as if I’m still living. People smile at me, they ask how I’m doing, they act like I’m still alive, but I’m not. My life is over. I know it sounds over-dramatic, but that’s honestly how it feels to me, I don’t know how else to explain it.

And now I feel like an idiot for writing all this for some strangers on the internet. And I’m sure some very kind people are going to tell me that I’m not an idiot, that I’m brave for doing this, that there is help and hope out there and that things do get better, but I’m sorry, I just don’t think I have the energy to believe in that anymore. I really don’t possibly see how things could get any better. I just don’t know what to do... all I know is I couldn’t keep it to myself anymore. I’m sorry to waste your time, and I feel sick with myself for begging for your attention like this when I don’t even know you. I just need someone to tell me that I’m still here.

4cnbmb,2,2016-03-30,Should I get a second degree or an internship this summer?,SmokeLeagueEveryday,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/4cnbmb/should_i_get_a_second_degree_or_an_internship/,"
Okay, so sorry if this is in the wrong place, I've never used reddit before but didn't know where else to post this question.

I am currently a junior in college, and am in the computer science engineering program at UConn (fuck 'Cuse, i hope they lose). I came in as Economics and took courses related to that major for my first year, and spend the last two summers taking classes catching up for engineering. I have continued to take courses to complete an economics minor, and after this semester only need one more to finish off the 15 required major credits. I was bored doing homework one day and decided to look into how much extra work getting an econ major would be rather than just a minor, and to my surprise the 24 credits of related courses are all covered by my upper level engineering classes--so basically there's this loophole that by virtue of me being an engineering student, I can get an Economics major just by taking the core classes and the Gen Ed requirements. This works out to be 4 extra classes for me. 

The thing is, I already have a full senior year schedule and an internship semi-lined up. The only way I'd be able to take on a second degree would be to either go more than 4 years, or not work full time this summer. For the sake of simplicity let's just assume that I still intend on graduating in 4 years. This brings me to my question: do you guys think spending my last summer getting a second degree is a smarter choice than getting experience? These are from separate schools by the way, not to be confused with a double major within the same school. Engineering is it’s own school and Economics is in liberal arts and sciences. My friends are trying to scare me into doing an internship with the “in 2016 you NEED experience” argument, but I can’t help to think that after a first job having a second degree would look better on the resume. What do you guys think?

As such, I am preparing for next year as if I do not get admitted. I think the best course of action is to attend community college for 1 semester to get my GPA up and get my required classes, allowing me a better chance at admittance.

I'm wondering if I would be better off taking retaking a couple classes at community college over the summer, as 2 classes (Calc 2 and Differential Equations) really have brought down my GPA. Alternatively, I may try for an internship. Which would be more beneficial for increasing my chances of admission?

Also, if anyone would be willing to read my essay, let me know and I'll pm you. 

Thanks!"

I'm currently a computer science student though I plan on transferring into computer engineering sometime during this next semester. 


The last time I was at college was the Spring of 2015. I won't be returning until the Fall of 2016. During this time, I was extremely fortunate and had the awesome opportunity to do research for my university and intern at NASA twice. I will also have another internship this summer at a large company. 


I'm incredibly glad I took the two internships. They changed my life. I was originally a chemical engineering major when I took the first one. The internship was basically entirely programming and I came to find that I really love it. My second internship was even more programming but also had me working on a bunch of electrical hardware like arduinos. 


Altogether it was an amazing experience and I changed my major to CS, although I plan on speaking with an adviser about changing to CompE once I return to school since I think I would like it better.


Anyway, this is the concern I have now... I will have been away from school for 15 months once I go back this Fall. I'm honestly kind of anxious about getting back into courses and everything! Does anyone have any experience with this? I'm really excited about my new major now that I know what kind of things I could be working on, but at the same time I haven't taken exams or used much calculus or physics in a long time! Do you think doing some basic review would be helpful? I'll only be taking a few programming classes, a couple electives and a circuits class this Fall.

I graduated at the top of my class from my university, all of my classmates said I was the person they didn't want to be compared to because I was so good. I had wonderful recommendations from my professors and mentors from internships and was really excited to get into the world of teaching. Got my job at a Title 1 school and knew I would face a lot of challenging kids even though I teach 3rd grade. But over the last two years, I feel like I've gotten worse and worse at teaching. One of my mentors said that my classroom management was so good, that I was the only intern she had ever felt comfortable leaving her class with. This year my assistant principal said that my classroom management and procedures just weren't there. I used to have great rapport with my students, now I feel like I spend my time yelling and bending over backwards to get them to listen at all. I work really hard at my job, and I've always felt that this is what I'm meant to do, but now I'm just not sure. My school is definitely challenging, and I haven't gotten any support from my grade level team this year, but I can't help feel that I'm the real problem. Has anyone else ever felt like this?"

Before starting school, my major was CS. A few days before classes started, I changed my major to Finance, because I was worried that I would not be able to do the math that comes with a CS degree. However, I found out over the course of this school year, that if I actually apply myself, math isn't so hard. Anyway, I changed my major to CS and will begin taking classes next semester.

My question is this: What can I do now (possibly this summer, when I have nothing to do), to best prepare myself to land an internship at a big tech company next summer (2017). My GPA in school right now is ~3.5 (this is taking business courses), and the only language I have a decent amount of experience with is Python. I intend to start learning Java soon, and potentially C/C++ (or any language) sometime later.
What can I do to learn more, and show companies that I am passionate about CS, even though I am starting a year late?

Thank you!

I'm a senior in college, studying culinary arts. A couple years ago I started working in a kitchen in addition and it began to eat up all my time: weekends and nights especially. The relationship I was in became hard to maintain and it ended when I went abroad for an internship. It picked back up when I returned, but i was having the same problems. It ended again, that was about 6 months ago. 

I don't know if I'm depressed or just lonely. I'm pretty insecure and shy and it hinders my motivation to try to go out and find something. I've let friendships fall by the wayside as well. It would be so easy to reach out and rekindle them, but for some reason I just put it off. I just miss the comfort of someone to come home to. I want to feel loved. In talks about it with my ex (I still consider her a great friend) she actually hit on a feeling I didn't know I was feeling. Maybe part of the reason I want someone else is that I want to know that our relationship wasn't a fluke. 

Anyway, I really wanted to put some of those feelings out there. Any advice/ encouragement would be welcome. Anyone in/ been in similar situations? "

A few days ago, I got an email from the company saying: ""You have been invited to attend the challenge Copywriter 2016 Intern. You can take this challenge any time. The duration of the challenge will be 60 mins from the time you start."" This is a 60-minute programming/coding test.

I have a corner in my room of loads of shit she got for me and made for me but since I am really trying to get into the television industry, I am doing as many internships as I can and doing extra work outside of my degree as I can. She just doesn't understand why I do all this extra work.

I'm young and I want to explore places, do things, build experiences that I will hold with me forever. I don't feel like me and my girlfriend are on the same wave length, sure, she says she wants to travel the world but she is too lazy to put in the work to make it a reality. It fucks me off.

This will be my first ""real job"" so I have zero experience with this process. Both offers are for roles in R&amp;D focused on machine learning/NLP at large companies. Company A is well known in the USA/globally, Company B is well known mostly in East Asia but they have R&amp;D in the USA.

Some backstory: I want to stay in the NYC/Boston area because that's where my friends/family live. It's also where Company B is based. I interned at Company A in their NYC/Boston group but originally, Company A wanted me to move to the Denver area. When I told them I was leaning toward Company B because of location, Company A countered by agreeing to let me work in NYC/Boston and travel to Denver once a month.

The biggest factors in my decision are:

How interesting is the job? &gt; How will the job advance my career goals? &gt; Location, Salary &gt; Culture &gt; Company Brand/Pedigree &gt; Employee Perks/Office

 where my career goals are: (a) get a Ph.D and (b) found a startup (not necessarily in that order).

Anyway, here's a table:

   | Company A | Company B
---|---|----
Company Size | Global brand | Big in East Asia
Experience with Company | Summer internship. Had a good experience, I like everyone and everyone seems to like me. My mentor has been very helpful over the last year (and recommended me for this job) | No experience other than on-site interview.
Company Culture | Everyone is older than me and has kids, but they do play video games at work a lot. | Somewhat younger crowd, people seemed to like each other but it's difficult to gauge culture from an on-site. They seemed nice/sane.
Company Growth | Stable? It's a big, fairly old software company. | They're already big (e-commerce and other areas) but they're trying to expand into the USA with somewhat halting success.
Company Office | Meh. | Cool.
Company Location | Suburban office park. 30 min commute by car. 25% travel between East Coast and Midwest (the Midwest office is very cool though) | Awesome location in the middle of a major city. 30 min commute via subway.
Employee Perks | Free drinks/snacks | Free drinks, catered lunches, I don't remember what else (maybe massages?)
Work Hours | flexible | flexible
Base Salary | &gt;?90k | $90k
Yearly Bonus | ???, but $15k signing bonus | 10%
Health Benefits | Yes | Yes
401k | ??? | Matching up to 3%
Stock | $1000 | $50k
Personal Career Growth | Nice mix of research/product work. The Midwest group is a product group with lots of room for implementing ML/NLP solutions. I have a pretty good idea of what I'd be working on for the first couple years. | Also nice mix of product/research, though I don't know what projects I'd get to work on, precisely. Might be more room for me to explore/do my own thing.
Long-Term | Not sure, most of the people I've met have been with the company for a long time so I'm not sure how much room there is for promotion. | I'd be getting in early on a small but growing team.

There are lots of ""???""'s in the Company A column because they haven't given me an actual offer yet, just promises. Meanwhile, my deadline for Company B's offer is Friday.

In general, I'm very happy with my prospects w.r.t. salary. The actual jobs are quite similar (at least on the surface), in terms of the subject matter and the tech I'd learn. I'm pretty 50/50 on this, which is why I'd appreciate any and all advice.

I am going to be graduating this May with a CS degree from a local state school with a GPA of about 3.1. It is not a very prestigious CS degree program and is definitely not in the top 25 of good CS schools. In addition I have had 2 summer internships focusing more on JavaScript and web development.

My current problem is that I am losing hope in trying to find a job in a small town coming right out of school.

My girlfriend ""Jacky"" is pretty damn impressive.  She graduated high school with an associates degree, has been working while earning his bachelors in marketing, and is a very hardworking and caring person who would die for those she loves.  In the past year she has gained a ton of terrific work experience in internships, both locally and internationally.  Her most recent job is the source of her current drama.

""Jacky"" started work at a small time marketing firm in a large midwestern city in our state.  It's a small operation--about 5-10 people.  She was taken on as a paid intern with the possibility of moving up into a Director of Marketing position if things panned out since the firm is so small.  Initially she felt underutilized, but with time she began to grab more responsibility and in the past month has grown close to the team.  Even though she is the first woman in the office, she's pushed past some initial obliviousness that sheltered white males are accustomed to and has gone a long way toward making her mark and has had some good chances to really impress the CEO.

The VP?  Not so much.

Let's call the VP ""Randy.""  ""Randy"" came to the company 9 months before ""Jacky"" did.  Beforehand he was a small business owner who ran his business into the ground, but was able to sell it off onto some poor guy and can therefore claim he was a successful business owner.  ""Randy"" is like an unfunny version of Michael Scott from the office.  He micromanages the shit out of the office, he pulls seniority over BS reasons, and he makes unethical business decisions.  But most of all, meetings.

Someone behind on a project?  Have a meeting.

Did Randy hire a really terrible data analyst who is essentially manipulating data to lie to clients?  Have a meeting... then deny responsibility.

Is the new girl named ""Jacky"" taking on too much responsibility and possibly threatening his ability to interfere with literally every fucking department?  Have a meeting about it.

More recently, ""Jacky"" and ""Randy"" have been butting heads over the philosophy of how they will market their product.  ""Randy"" wants to essentially lie to the customers--who are LAWYERS by the way, so they will cut through BS like a knife--and deliver a shitty product that is incomplete and full of bugs.  ""Jacky"" wants to market the product as a beta stage and lower the price so that, in return, the customers will provide feedback about bugs, what could be better etc.  As a result of these disagreements, ""Randy"" has been pulling seniority EVEN MORE than he usually does.  He has also been making fun of ""Jacky's"" education.  When the only toilet in the office overflowed he just stared at ""Jacky"" as she mopped up the floor.  When ""Jacky"" and the one other lady in the office were discussing what curtains to buy for the office--a practical, non-stylish issue since the sun is blinding in the afternoon--""Randy"" yelled at them and said they were wasting time on feminine bullshit, despite the fact they were both on their lunch breaks.  When ""Jacky"" has had an idea, he's ignored it until a male proposes the same idea.  When ""Jacky"" disagrees with a particularly aggressive or misguided marketing strategy--which he shouldn't even be making--he calls her a coward but then is too passive aggressive to admit it to anyone else.

To give you an idea of how much of a gentleman this douche is, his wife broke her foot and he specifically left her at the house to avoid ""her whining"" after visiting the doctor.  She also still has to take care of their three kids.

When ""Randy"" the VP went on vacation for two weeks ""Jacky"" and the team were able to make monumental progress.  The CEO was really impressed by all that she was doing and started really discussing her transition from a paid internship to the Director of Marketing.  They discussed the exact role of her job and all the changes that would have to be made... including reducing the amount that ""Randy"" can just jump in and interfere.

That caused a huge problem when the dude returned from vacation.  He ambushed her with the CEO and pretty much said that she hasn't been a good employee and made it sound like she would never become director of marketing unless she does exactly what he says and doesn't disagree.  The bastard didn't even have the guts to admit what he was doing; he kept saying bullshit like ""I'm not saying you backstabbed me, but if I were this is what I would say...""

Clearly the CEO is remaining neutral or oblivious.  So how does someone navigate such a monumental douche like this in such a small company?  Is it a total loss or is there anything she can do?

Thanks!"

So...progress! \o/

------------------------

Hi /r/hillaryclinton! Warning, long post incoming! I started as a Hillary fan, have flipflopped between her and Bernie throughout this primary season and am currently not a Hillary fan. However, I'm increasingly being faced with the prospect of not even liking to vote for her, and I don't like that. Therefore, I thought I'd come to you and see if you can rationally convince me of a reason that isn't ""wasting my vote/#NeverTrump"" (not that those aren't legitimate reasons, I'd just prefer to vote for a candidate rather than against another) to vote for her if (and I think probably when) Bernie loses the primary. I could have posted to the Bernie sub but that would have been entirely useless; I want a rational conversation with the people actually supporting who I think will be the nominee. I'm definitely not one that feels the bern so hard I'm blinded to the other side or not one that stands with her so hard that I can't see Sanders as anything but naive and foolish. It's ridiculous to ever be opposed to new information.

A little bit about me before we get into the meat of the issues for where I started and where I am. If you don't care about me just skip this paragraph. ;) I'm what you would generally consider a likely Republican candidate. My parents are a classic from the ground to the top story, they started as immigrants with almost no money and through frugality and careful fiscal decisions they are now in the high upper middle class. I don't have any student loans and am currently attending Harvard. I grew up in an extremely conservative state. The idea of the American Dream and being careful with your money and no ""free stuff"" are all important to me. My dad works as a programmer for a defense contractor, my mother is a nurse at the VA (she went back to school even though she was over 40 after working minimum-wage jobs) and I worked as a biomedical intern at a company funded by DARPA. I have lots of ties to defense spending. You can see where I would be inclined to throw my weight behind a typical establishment conservative/moderate, right? However, I am rather liberal, partly because I'm part of the LGBTQ community, and partly because I believe that the fundamental American Dream extends beyond conservatism into a fundamental equality of all and I just don't see that in the American Right. There's, to me, a distinction between ""free stuff"" and pragmatism/equality. If I'm paying for something with my taxes, I want it to go to what I'm paying for. I think that the Republican Party is happy to take my taxes and give breaks to the wealthy. I was also raised learning about the Clintons and have looked up to Hillary my entire life. Anyways, enough about me. Let's get to the meat of the issue.

I've been subbed for a loooooong time (only lurker though, never posted here!) and yesterday's post about young people who started out supporting Hillary made me think because I started out as a strong Hillary fan. I am one of the ""younger generation"" but I've always had a passion for politics and was initially a Clinton supporter in '08. I flipped to Obama not because of his policies but because of how I feel like Clinton's campaign degenerated towards the end. I didn't appreciate the insinuations that were coming from her camp regarding Obama being a Muslim because I, too, have faced profiling as a Muslim when I definitely am not. However, to my mind, it was simply poor campaign strategy on her part, and I felt confident that she can and would change to be a stronger candidate in the future. I felt that she would see Obama's success and incorporate them, because she is above all else, an intelligent woman. I honestly believed that she would see that his style resonated with voters and she would pull that out and it would succeed. My beliefs were cemented when Obama brought her into his camp as SoS and when she continued to be actively involved in reaching out for liberal issues (she did a lot of outreach after she finished her term as SoS). I think that, as an intelligent woman, she would learn and grow, which is why I was a lot more tolerant with her ""flip-flopping."" Hilllary may have been wrong on a LOT of things (such as gay marriage) but she follows the polls and follows the changing times. Bernie may have been always right so far, but what happens when he's wrong? Will he also evolve like Hillary? I think its perfectly legitimate for a candidate to evolve. I remember thinking the Benghazi nonsense was just that, nonsense, and actually vigorously defending her about the whole email BS. I thought exactly what everyone said, let the investigation take its time and do its thing. I think its very likely she did things that weren't technically right in hosting the server, but to me it was an intelligent, almost necessary move to be made. People knew she had ambitions and would be on her nonstop and I don't think that she could afford that nonstop stress of ""who will ask for my emails tomorrow and am I wording them all perfectly"" if she wanted to be an effective SoS. It blew up in her face but I didn't blame her for it.

On to the primary. Here comes Bernie Sanders, he's supporting a lot of great liberal ideas, but so is Hillary! What do? My gut says stick with the person in the spotlight because she has more connections. I looked at their differing policy proposal, attended rallies for both, and came to a conclusion that I probably like Sanders' ideology better but that I support Hillary more for two main reasons:

* American Corporations are American Power. I feel that Bernie unfairly demonizes corporations and banks. yes, they probably don't pay their fair share of taxes. Yes, the banks definitely did shady things. However, they are still one of the most effective ""bargaining chips"" America has. The American economy is still one of the biggest profit generators, innovation generators, and influence generators. Our banks and our companies literally control so much power on an international level, just look at how favorable the terms of the TPP are to them. Other countries are falling over themselves trying to make life easier for American corporations. Yes, coupling investment banks to commercial banks allows risky moves, but I'm not sure if they should be treated as an existential threat for existing. Regulation and accountability of the bankers not necessarily just the banks is key. Hillary would, I think, not go after the company but be happy to go after the executives.

* Hillary plays the system. Say what you will, many call this a negative too. Many say Bernie's record as ""amendment king"" means he can play the system as well. I'll buy that but there's no way he can play it as well as Hillary can. Some people say Hillary's so called ""list"" of people who have crossed her is negative. I think it's fine. I think that being able to know who has worked with you and against you and having a clear picture of who to attack and when and how far you can trust somebody is great. I think that Hillary can get the party in line. Bernie may appeal to people's better parts but Hillary can keep the party together when she needs to act for reform. Obama's greatest failing with healthcare reform was he caved to the other Democrats and it gutted Obamacare. I think Hillary will create great downticket unity that will allow her to make inroads in Congress that I don't know if Bernie can manage. Bernie shies away from attacking Hillary, and tbh, I fault him for that. If you think you are doing what's best for the American people, you shouldn't let your ego on how a campaign ""should"" be run get in the way, you should pull out all the stops and attack your opponent on all substantive issues in order to ensure you're in office to make that change possible.

Given these strong points in favor of Hilary, why did I flipflop? As I said, I'm very passionate about keeping an open mind. I kept myself interested in the Sanders campaign and still acknowledged that I probably identified more with his policies, such as college and healthcare. In fact that healthcare point was what first pulled me over to his side. Hillary came out saying she thought single-payer will ""never, ever happen."" and then later on saying she supported single-payer. Then she was spreading untruths about Sanders' campaign's stance on healthcare, and I found it, honestly, very offputting. Healthcare is important to me because I will likely be working in the healthcare field in the future, as a caregiver, as a businessman, as a lawyer, or as a researcher (all options I'm currently considering). I didn't appreciate her making healthcare into an attack when her liberal stance on it was something I appreciated deeply.

I swapped back to Hillary after the sweeping in the South. I didn't swap because she's winning (should be clear I don't back the winner b/c I'm currently backing Bernie even though I think he'll lose) but I swapped because of her success with the African American vote. I'm not African American, but I think that racial justice is very important, and if the African American vote is going to throw their weight behind Clinton, I think it's a good thing to support the candidate with their support because she'll be likely to help them out. Even if Bernie's racial justice program is probably just as strong, the community made its choice. I'd be happy to compromise on my own ideals to support a candidate who is supported by a key bloc.

What happened over the debates was disappointing to me (Hillary constantly told what appeared to me lies about Bernie's campaign) but it did not shake my faith in her. The back and forth is part of politics and Bernie's supporters did it as well (though it is a bit different when the candidate is doing it.) I could overlook her not releasing the transcripts that would probably be damaging (a politician must know when to pander and I don't blame her for pandering to Wall St.). I could overlook her ties to Kissinger, who has not only been extremely derogatory to people of my nationality but also arguably a war criminal. An intelligent person can learn and foster relationships with someone they don't agree with on most issues.

What moved me over back to the Sanders camp was actually very minor to a lot of people, but was a key turning point for me. It was the moment when she tweeted talking about how the Reagans started a ""national conversation"" about HIV. That was a moment when I believe she should have known better and was extremely offensive to people who are part of the LGBTQ community that the Reagans laughed about dying and to HIV researchers (I hit both checkboxes). I also didn't think her saying she ""misspoke"" was good enough either. If she wants to be an advocate for a community she once opposed giving rights to, she should have stopped and taken the time to highlight why she made the mistake and the steps going forward to show that this type of mistake will never occur again. The cavalier nature in which she passed it off made me unhappy and drove me back to the other camp.

The point that made me consider actually not voting for the woman for whom I've been a fan for basically all my political awareness' duration came these last few days: her claim that she doesn't want to debate Sanders until he changes his tone. Yes it came from a spokesperson but that was a clearly pointed out and doubled down upon campaign move, and I'm sure the justification was run by her. Also, at a certain point, the campaign spokesperson has to stop taking all the heat and blame for decisions made by the campaign (same issue from 2008). I feel that fine, it's not a politically great move to be debating Bernie, so decline it. I did not like allegations that Bernie's campaign was negative, though, because even as a Hillary fan I felt that Bernie was staying true to his message of not going after Hillary personally and only making differences policy-wise clear. And, I wanted a candidate who was tough and willing to take on opponents and not shy away because Bernie was supposedly being negative. If Bernie hadn't promised to not run attack ads would we have heard this? He probably shouldn't be holding himself to such a high standard, but it doesn't make him the lowest of the low if he isn't continuously talking about how great of a candidate Sec. Clinton is! I felt like this directly contradicted point #2 for my support for her and made me very reticent to vote for her.

Given this long/rambling post, I wanted to ask you, /r/hillaryclinton: why should I vote for Sec. Clinton when she wins the nomination? I sincerely want to be convinced, as a longtime fan of hers, but while I'm not hardcore feeling the bern I definitely am finding it very hard to stand with her when Bernie is looking like a very acceptable candidate.

I have struck out on pretty much all summer paying internships and i'm left with an unpaid offer from a small startup. I have plans to bust *** on Android apps this summer and have a few published on play store; something I want to do as my personal project.
However I do not want to miss out on an opportunity for an ""internship""

I know unpaid internships are technically ""illegal"", but I was wondering is it worth a shot to intern as a software engineer? 

I have heard horror stories about companies looking for internship experience on your resume and if it is not there, then adios. 

Whats your take?"

We started dating when I was 17 and she was 15, and now she is 18 and I am 20 and it has ended. 

When we first started dating it was like a normal few months that we had fun, we were scared and had butterflies. I left for Europe to see my family just two months after dating and everyone thought we were done but to best everyone's expectations, we became stronger. I told her I loved her when I got back because, I am a believer of signs and when I was in Europe I looked into my favorite tree and right in front of me was a leaf that was a perfect shape of a heart and I knew from that day I loved her. Becusse we were separated so early, she decided that she wanted to be with my every single day since then. That's exactly what we did for the next 3 years. I moved to college about an hour away but she insisted I come home every weekend, which I did. Sometimes I would visit in the middle of the week too. That was perfect and we were in love like crazy. She told me that she didn't want to have sex until she was married and I respected that. But eventually a year ago we started getting close and closer, eventually she wanted to have sex and we did. We did it all the time and most of the time it was her initiating it. There was never a lose of romance becusse I would give her flowers, I gave her a promise ring and everything she needed and she gave me everything I needed. We were so happy and so in love until 2 months ago. At the beginning of 2015 I had to go to a school 3 hours away but still I made it my way home every weekend to be with her because she would cry if she didn't see me. She insisted we were together almost 24/7 and I kinda liked it, she never got tired of me. She would tell me not to hang out with friends cause that wasted time, she would get mad at me if I wasted time watching YouTube videos instead of calling her. But for some reason I liked that, someone being clingy to me kind of made me happy in a way, I do t know why. Eventually I accepted an internship for 3 months in a city that was 6 hours away from home. Before I left she planned out every weekend that we would be together and was so upset that I was leaving. Eventually it started and we would meet halfway to see each other in the weekends. Sometimes we could t becusse her parents didn't want her to and I would get upset and she would get upset but I told her I didn't want to her to hate her parents, I just want her to stand up for herself when it came to those things. We fought about it and I think I made a mistake but we all make mistakes. Eventually she became close to a new German exchange student girl that got very attached to my girlfriend. They were hanging out all the time and the German girl was being a bad influence on her. Suddenly out of nowhere she was going to parties and doing things she never did before. I felt like she was trying to impress her but also I felt like I was being replaced by this new person in her life. One night she wanted to go to a party at s boys house and I told her that I didn't really feel comfortable her going to it and that I would rather have her go when I was home jic or if I went with her. I think that made her mad and she ended up staying over at the house but she told me she was with her friends. This is where it all changed. That weekend we met up and she as all over me but this time it was in front of her friend. I know my girl and she is NEVER that affectionate in front of a friend. I looked at her and she kept telling me to stop looking at her like that but I told her it's only if you feel guilty. Eventually she left and it seemed fine but the following week she wants space/ a break. I was devastated but we met up anyways. We slept together, kissed, she told me she loved me and it felt so normal all weekend but she still wanted 'space' to 'figure herself out'. I didn't know what that meant but I said okay you can have space. The first week of it she is the one calling me and telling me she loved me, even kissed me goodnight but she didn't text me the same. Eventually it's the first weekend I won't be with her and she is with her new friend. After the weekend she stops wanting to call me, I asked her why and she said it doesn't give space and I said well I didn't ask you to do that, you decided to do that in your own how can you change your mind? She didn't explain. Anyways second weekend passes that I didn't see her, we are kind of texting but not really. I'm alone for two weeks and she stopped texting me one night and I didn't text her or talk to her for a whole week because she said she wanted space. It's Easter and I go home but don't tell her. I decided that I need to go to her house for answers Saturday night but she isn't there. It's her mom (I am very close to her family) she comes up and hugs me. Before I even say anything, her mom and her siblings say that they hate her new German friend and that she's changing and lying and not being who she is. I tell them that I need to leave becusse this is too much for me and I start crying, her mom comes and hugs me and starts crying too because she says that they are as hurt as I am that she is doing this to me. Her mom tells me that she is 18 and wants to do something and never had friends (not my fault) and now she does so it's something new. I told her that I said it's okay to hangout with friends I don't care I still love her but it didn't get through. Her mom told me that she might have been texting a boy about a party and when confronted she said that her German friend likes a boy (German girl has a boyfriend back home). So she is just a bad influence all together. I'm pissed becusse she was my love for 3 years so I am flying to go to mcdonalds cause that's where she was but I didn't see her car so I just stop and then I peek out again just driving fast cause I was so mad and had so much adrenaline. She texts her mom and says did you tell him where I was and she said no maybe it was a sign. I text her and she doesn't want to meet, I tell her okay she will just have to. I pull into her driveway, her mom tells me to come in and sit down, her whole family is acting normal but my girl comes down and is furious that I came. She leaves for an hour and then comes back. We go to her pool deck and we are talking. She tells me 'I am finally doing what I always wanted to do in highschoolc, I am hanging out with all my friends and having fun' and she also says 'what if there is someone out there better for me' I died a little inside at that moment and she says she thinks we should break up cause it's not working. She cries a lot and I don't even shed one tear. I don't ahve the heart to tell her why it's not working. I leave and I feel fine, I go back to the city 6 hours later and I look on Instagram, she already changed her profile pic of me and her, to her and the German girl. I cried and cried becusse it hit me. It's been 3 days and I feel like she has died, I am grieving so much because it feels like it came out of nowhere. It's been a Month since she asked for a break/space and now she finally ended it. I have been in hell for a whole month and now I am even deeper hell because I had hope before but now all that hope is gone. 

Maybe it was my fault? Maybe she cheated on me the night of the party? Maybe she got bored of me? 

I don't knwl what happened but all I know is that my girlfriend is gone.."
4copd2,11,2016-03-31,[Opinion] My response to Mike Futter's GameInformer article about Alison Rapp,Tormunch_Giantlabe,KotakuInAction,https://www.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/4copd2/opinion_my_response_to_mike_futters_gameinformer/,"**Edit:** Futter replied to me in the comments section. I'll put it at the bottom of this post. I offered a rebuttal, but if you want to read that, go following along there. 

*Original Post*

For context, here is the (archived) [article in question](http://archive.is/s05Z2).

As you can see, only one side of the story is given. While Futter doesn't *personally* attribute any of this to GamerGate, he does not challenge Rapp's claim that it is, and he goes on to endorse the narrative that Rapp was harassed in the ""Our Take"" mini-editorial at the end of the piece. 

Props to him for disclosing that Rapp was once an intern at GI, but that doesn't excuse how he wrote the article, nor his irresponsible editorial that followed. So I took him to task for it. 

My involvement obviously isn't newsworthy, but I seemed to be one of the very few to challenge the narrative, and I took the time to write a somewhat long-winded response, so I thought I'd share with you guys. 


&gt;So we're blaming GamerGate for this? 

&gt;Not the founder of the Wayne Foundation, Jaime Walton, who brought Rapp's college thesis to Nintendo's attention? That doesn't even get a mention in your article, Mike? I thought you were better than that. 

&gt;Also, your summary of her paper is nowhere close to accurate. I just read it, and it does not discuss ""teen sexualization."" It discusses the international pressure on Japan to strengthen its child pornography laws by putting the history of such laws in the west, Japan, and elsewhere into context. She argues against such pressure through three lenses: Cultural Imperialism, or how moral relativism is better than moral universalism (also, as a corollary, the idea of legislating child pornography based on the alleged immorality of it rather than the need to protect the children); Free expression, and how anti-possession laws are tantamount to thought crime, citing SCOTUS case history, as well as the Supreme Court of Japan, both of which have ruled against overly-broad anti-child pornography laws because of free speech considerations; and what she calls the ""sketchy relationship between consumption of child pornography and actual sexual assault of children."" 

&gt;I know that's too much for a summary, but yours wasn't even close. It would have been better to say her paper argued against the criminalization of possession of child pornography; the taboo-ness of teenage sexualization specifically wasn't discussed, so you phrasing it that way appears to be an attempt to make her views seem less inflammatory. You're not her PR rep, Mike. That's not your job. 

&gt;Also, your decision to not only tell one side of the story, but then to add a rejoinder in the ""Our Take"" section, is sketchy itself. I do not consider myself a member of GamerGate, but I do frequent the subreddit (I have the downvotes to prove it) and found that while there were people who unironically believed she should be fired for her beliefs, there was no consensus, as plenty of people--myself included--argued that not only were her beliefs about ""CP"" misrepresented, but that even if they weren't, having an opinion on something isn't any reason to fire them. To say that this was GamerGate is unfounded. 

&gt;I'd also question the use of the word ""harassment."" Alison Rapp is no shrinking violet; she was very outspoken and spoke ill of both people and ideas on her Twitter feed. Isn't it expected that she would hear from people who disagreed as vehemently as she believed? Why is that harassment? Because she's a woman, or because she says so? I really don't understand how people, especially ones who are so polarizing, are treated like victims when they get their own vitriol thrown back at them. Ironically, it appears to be because she believes in the moral absolutism of her beliefs, so that anyone who disagrees must be not only objectively wrong, but objectively immoral. And by presenting the story in this fashion, you're endorsing that. 

&gt;(Let's also not forget that Rapp was something like public relations for Treehouse. Who else would get flack for an unpopular decision but one of the consumer-facing employees? I don't get the shock and outrage at a PR person catching heat from, duh, the public.)

&gt;Finally, let's discuss the ridiculous Tweets you included. Why not editorializing on those? You have Mike Laidlaw saying that he doesn't have context for the story but is mad anyway. Then MidBoss says they're actually halting production on a game because ""women in gaming."" Are you serious? They say they fired her for moonlighting (which she did as an alias, knowing that it wasn't allowed) so how is this a ""women in gaming"" issue? Every time a woman gets fired, we revolt? Then, just for icing on the crappy cake, Frank Cifaldi calls...well, presumably GamerGate...""Neo-Nazis."" Because that level of ignorant hyperbole is productive, right? 

&gt;But you're silent on this. Why? How is this any better than the people who wanted her fired?

Futter is usually good about responding to direct questions/challenges, so I halfway expect him to say *something*, but as of yet there has been nothing. I'll update if he does respond. 

*Edit:* And here's his response:

&gt;I'll address your points:

&gt;1) If you look at the language we used, we are very careful to say that Alison connects the group harassing her to Gamergate. 

&gt;2) While I am aware of Ms. Walton, specifically calling her out by name amidst a sea of others also contacting Nintendo puts a lot of weight on one person. That's not something we can verify. We don't know how communications were dealt with and putting another specific individual in the crosshairs doesn't feel right. 

&gt;3) I'm sorry you don't like how we characterized a 30,000-foot summary of a complex academic paper. I appreciate you going in depth. And yes, I read it and tried to summarize as best I could to get the gist across without bogging down the story. 

&gt;4) regardless of whether someone is outspoken, an orchestrated campaign to attack that person is harassment 

&gt;5) The thesis of this story is that there is a great deal of outrage over her firing. The tweets support that there is outrage. We make no claim about how informed those comments are. We put them forward to show a sample of prominent people that are reacting to the decision. 

&gt;We were extremely careful about our choice of language here. You've lept over that and created a straw man. 

&gt;The only opinions I offered in this whole thing is that Nintendo remained silent while she took blame for localization decisions that were not hers and that no one deserves that kind of harassment."
4cp1la,24,2016-03-31,Doing what you love versus doing what pays,vjour,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4cp1la/doing_what_you_love_versus_doing_what_pays/,"Tomorrow I have a final, onsite interview with a company I will refer to as Small Company (50 - 200 employees, new) for their internship program over summer. Their headquarters are in the U.S., but this program will be abroad in their office in a third-world country. I've always wanted to study abroad somewhere where I can truly get a culture shock but since there aren't really good CS universities at these countries and since studying abroad is so expensive, I gave up on those dreams until I came across this program which will pay for flights, housing, and living expenses (albeit this country is a pretty cheap place to go/live at) AND I will get to apply my computer science skills. In the future, my ultimate dream was to work for a couple years as a software engineer and then go back to a different 3rd world country of my heritage and use my CS background to help those there in some way. I always believed that I would do that in the future but I have the chance to do that now, as this company truly values giving those in less fortunate areas the same opportunities we have here in the United States. Now the kicker: this company won't be paying me.

On Monday I got an internship offer from a well-established, large (5000-10000 employees), well-known company I will refer to as Large Company, will be paid hourly, will get relocation bonus, among other perks. But the work I will be doing isn't exactly what would motivate me to wake up in the morning though this company does care about my professional growth as well. Also, it's located in Silicon Valley and I am sorry, I've been there and based on my experiences and my friends' experiences it is somewhere I do not want to live. And yes, it's only for the summer. But since my uncle died at a young age recently, I've developed a philosophy that living in the present moment is just as important as preparing for the future. I just imagine I'd have a boring, uneventful time there and I'm afraid I will fall into a depression as I've seen my other friends who live in Silicon Valley do too even though I would try to make the most of it (seizing the day and all that). To be fair, I may hate the 3rd-world country of the Small Company as well. Who knows. 

I have to give my answer by next Monday. If my onsite with the Small Company doesn't go well tomorrow, then I am definitely going with the Large Company and I honestly think it's a great opportunity and won't be that bad. But if the onsite does go well then I will have a choice to make and I just wanted all of your input if I did have to make that choice. I'm truly afraid I will regret the decision I make, whether it's at the Large Company and during work I daydream of the experiences I could have had in the 3rd-world country or in the future if I have trouble finding work because I worked at this Small Company, especially for no pay. But I've stalked the people who have interned at this Small Company before and they're in places like Google and Apple and Snapchat right now, so even though I don't have much interest working for places like The Big 4, it's nice knowing that they're still doing fine.

I can truly see myself working full-time at this Small Company after I graduate, and I have asked them if they hire past interns full-time and they do, but unless I have an amazing experience at the Large Company I simply cannot see myself working there after graduation though they do want to hire their past interns as full-time as well. Both companies offer great mentorship.

I guess my main question is, would going for the Small Company hurt my chances in the future? Keep in mind, I have no previous internship experience so this will be the biggest thing on my resume. I will be doing CS-related, software stuff though at the Small Company so I can definitely fill up my resume with actual projects I would do. Or should I plan for the future instead and go with the secure, Large Company? I went to a tech talk once and the speaker mentioned how he admired people who took risks. That keeps replaying in my mind. Also, I am afraid of living a linear life, especially the rat race of the U.S., and going into the corporate world of the Large Company feels like a step into that direction, though it's a step I can fake my way in. 

I looked up on google already the title to this post and was overwhelmingly met with ""definitely do what pays"". But since I am graduating from one of the top 10 universities with a CS degree, maybe I will still be okay in the future if I do what I love now. Also, when I tell some of my peers about the Small Company some have looked down on me for wanting something that won't get me paid. Again, my uncle's death also taught me the value of money and how we would trade all the money we have for the person we love to stay alive, and as long as I can live comfortably in the future with extra money so I don't have to worry, being super rich is not an interest of mine. The experiences I have and the people I connect to in life is of greater importance. But maybe I am at a point in my life (junior in university) where I can't say things like that because of how young and inexperienced I am. 

This was pretty lengthy so thanks for reading! "

To keep it short, I was sexually assaulted by a girl who didn't take no for an answer. She forces herself on me and I pushed her away, she starts crying and I was blamed by the bystanders (who thought I was sexually assaulting her). Boom. Friends gone. Entire social circle in college gone. I'm a pariah.

I got hurt deadlifting right after the assault. Herniated disk, couldn't even walk without pain for months.

Fast forward a year, my girlfriend and I break up because she's been ungrateful and selfish. Still reeling from the lack of friends thing, I've spent a year doing nothing but the gym and classes. Absolute rock bottom. Tried committing suicide twice.

Job prospects are looking bleak. A lot of other people in my classes have internships - I have nothing.

So I'm at rock bottom, and I decide to visit my cousin who's the same age as me for spring break. We do blow. It's my first time, and it's a lot of fucking blow. 5 nights out of the 7 that I'm at her place, we do it with her and her friends.

And now... I don't know how to explain it - but part of me just knows that it's going to be ok. It's been almost a week since the last time I did blow. Like some of that confidence remained. I got a bit sad today, thinking about the friends I lost, but it's not as bad as it once was.

Anyone else stay confident after?"

Most recent one was QA (python automation) and first one was Software Engineering (backend web but I didn't learn much). I shouldn't of taken the QA role imo, but I had no offers last Spring. This semester I again have no offers. I go to a top ten school so I'm assuming the problem is me and not anything else.

Over time I've been dicking around with Unity, machine learning, and C++. Just things that really interest me. I always hated web and mobile development. Now I realize that my hate for those are what is ruining my job opportunity. So right now I'm trying to learn Django and I guess Javascript is a must too. 

Do you guys have any recommendations on what should I learn or what has good prospects for the future? I was thinking of doing trying to get into backend development, but I have no idea what I should be trying to pick up before Fall recruiting. I decided to stop applying for internship roles, and just use the summer to level up my skills. Is it too late for me to make myself worthy of a decent Software Engineering role? I always get e-mails about QA roles. I just really found QA to be the most boring thing on the planet during my internship, and I can't go back.

TL;DR What should I try to pick up in 6 months that can land me a kush job in backend development if I'm currently learning Django and Javascript. I have used Java, Python, and C++ in the past."

I feel like I am at my wits end when it comes to engineering. I am currently studying industrial engineering (in my fourth semester) which is incredibly interesting to me, but I cannot seem to do well in classes. I really have no idea what is causing this, but every engineering course I have taken I have done poorly in. In high school and early college I found math and science very fun and I did well in those courses. When it came to engineering physics and other specifically engineering courses I did awful. I mean, I passed, but my GPA has suffered. Recently, at an advising appointment, my advisor mentioned that I should try to get my GPA up if I want to be considered for internships. That fucking hurt.

I keep asking friends and family for advice and they say things like ""keep at it"" and ""it will become easier"", but it has not and, at this point, I am only feeling discouraged. 

I guess I am reaching out because I wanted some unbiased feedback based on my situation. 

Or maybe if you all want to tell me what to do with my life, that would be fabulous. I am never opposed to that.

I'd like to write down in dot-points some of the electronics skills I have but I'm having a little difficulty translating things I learn in class, to 'skills' that would be applicable in industry. I've just been trying to sum up entire subjects in a couple of words and I feel like they're out of context and anyone looking at it would think I have no idea wtf is going on (which might be partly true.) It's kind of a ""woods from the trees"" issue. Just wondering whether I could get some advice on it.

This is what I have so far: 
&gt;**Electronics Skills:**

&gt;- Strong soldering skills
- Circuit analysis techniques
- Fourier Analysis
- Control systems design using pole-zero-gain plots and Bode diagrams
- Transmission Line theory
- Passive filter network design
- Understanding of Maxwell’s equations and fundamental electromagnetics

&gt;**Software &amp; Programming Languages:**

&gt;- C/C++
- MATLAB, Control System Toolbox &amp; Robotics Toolbox
- LTspice
- Altium PCB Designer
- Microsoft Office Word, Excel, PowerPoint
- Familiarity with Linux Mint, Mac OS X, and a variety of Windows’ OSs
- Lego Mindstorm NXT kit

I included the software/languages section just for completeness plus if anyone wants to give me tips on the whole thing I won't turn them down.

Also I'm pretty new to reddit so if I commit any faux pas pls be gentle :)"

You must be a student to live here, but you don't have so be at student at OSU you can be a student at any college. So if you're a college student doing an internship in Columbus that's fine.

The rent is per bedroom, and utilities are not included but are only on average $20-30.

To make matters worse, this is the week right after spring break so obviously I was not studying the week before (I know, I know, I should have).

I kept hitting mental blocks while studying for the first exam, ultimately, it didn't go well for most people in the class, myself included.  However, I actually felt extremely confident for my second exam (Calculus III).  I was focused while I was studying, I felt that I understood the material, and woke up this morning ready and eager to take it.

I felt extremely confident in about 70% of the exam, and the other 30% I could not finish in time. The professor gives answer sheets to the problems on the test after you take it, and it crushed me.

I made senseless errors on several parts that is probably going to bring my grade down exponentially. I'm going to fail this class if I don't get at least a 70, and it's the second time I am taking the class already. 

I'm so upset, I truthfully and honestly worked very hard and felt like I understood the material.  The worst part is, this happens on every test I take in that class.  It doesn't matter how long, or how hard I study or how much I feel like I know it, I always end up with poor grades on tests and it's killing my GPA.  I'm struggling to get an internship this summer because I'm on academic probation. 

In high school, I was a very good student.  What happened? I feel like I study all day and all night and it doesn't reflect in my grades.  It's so infuriating. It makes me feel ridiculously unintelligent.  

I'm doing everything right. I have a tutor, I do the homework, I take notes in class, I study... what more can I possibly do? I don't even go out on the weekends because I'm studying or doing homework.

What is the point in working this hard if I'm just going to continuously fail? I feel like my grade would have been exactly the same if I didn't study at all.

Obligatory Fuck the Avs. 

A little background: I'm a Minnesotan, born and raised in the twin cities. I left home to go to Michigan Tech for college, and I fell in love with your state and your teams. I always root for the Wings unless they're playing the Wild, and I watch as many Wings games as I can. I'm currently working an Engineering internship on the west side of the mitten, and I knew that I had to get down to the Joe at least once before you guys move. I'm excited to see the arena and experience all the history and tradition there. So, I'm heading to Detroit tomorrow night with some coworkers to catch the game. 

Mind telling me the best way to take in a game at the Joe? Any traditions that might not be obvious to someone who's only seen Wings games on TV? I'm not planning on making an ass of myself or getting blackout-drunk. Any bars or restaurants that are must-go places?

I wish both of our teams were in a different spot in the standings right now. If the Wild beat the Sens tonight, we could clinch with a win over you guys tomorrow. But, we're in a slightly better spot, so I wouldn't mind seeing the Wings win at all. All I ask is that we take it to OT, so both teams get points. Fuck Philly, Boston, and the Isles. The playoffs just aren't the playoffs without Detroit.

4cr5vh,2,2016-03-31,Failing last sem of university. Going to talk with professor. What should I say? help,krkc,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/4cr5vh/failing_last_sem_of_university_going_to_talk_with/,"**This is the issue in a nutshell: I skipped a lot of class and am mucking up my major-related classes. Finally going to talk with professor but not sure if I should tell him everything because this is a huge messy problem I have been struggling with since the beginning of university. I am especially worried about telling him I have hated my major for four years and it's one of the reasons I just want to give up completely.**

* Some context: I study product design. It's my last semester here. I've started skipping class a lot because I am too afraid to go in on presentation days without real progress or a good presentation. While I'm outside of class I can't put work into my final project. After four years of trudging through a major I actively dislike (and only stayed in at my parent's urging) I feel like I can't do this anymore, even though I am so close to graduating. Have been borderline failing my major-related class every single year now but managed to convince myself things will be different. Every time I think about this major or going to class, it saps my energy. The only times I can get work done outside of class is if I am in a group project because I feel beholden to other people. If it's just me, I don't care. I've even been tempted to deliberately definitively fuck everything up and seal my fate for the worst for good. At least then I'd know what to expect and can start getting used to it. Being anxious about failing my classes every semester for the past four years has taken a toll on me. I've been having nightmares for the past few weeks related to graduation. I don't feel this for any non-studio classes, but at this rate am fucking them up as well because I am paralyzed by fear. 


* Earlier this semester, I was offered to do a make-up project by another professor to try to pass a class I had failed. With such a big responsibility I freaked out in the middle of it and stopped making progress for two weeks. I then felt enormously guilty for disappearing on a professor who was willing to give me one last chance. I had blown it again. Motivation this semester plummeted after that and I started skipping other classes to try to catch up or even just to retreat from everything and stay home because I felt too shameful to go to class anymore. 


* After deciding to skip my major-related class again this morning, I sent my current professor an email letting him know what was going on. I thought I owed him the courtesy of an explanation at the least. I told him I am struggling with keeping things together but will try to show him progress next week. He replied asking me if we could meet before class next week. I'm going to do it. But I don't know what to tell him. Should I be honest about what I've been going through all these four years, culminating in this breakdown? Because this isn't a one time incident of time mismanagement. It's an ongoing four year snowball of stress, depression, upset expectations, and anxiety. The further I fall, the more I want to convince people I can recover. I want them to be proud of me. But the more I want to convince them, the more pressure I feel, and the less I am able to actually act. With internship, post-grad job searching, and this final project on top of everything--I feel like I am juggling too many things at once. I wish I could forget literally everything and just focus on ONE single project with realistic expectations. 


* I am also reluctant to tell my professor how I don't want to work on a project related to my major anymore. I'm already so far behind. There is a ton of work to do. I am drawing a blank. And I do not have the energy to force myself to even begin breaking it down into pieces. I don't think he will be understanding of this or want to hear it, but it's the truth. For my sanity I need to tell the whole truth to someone for once in my college career. But if he knows I've given up on my major, won't he completely give up on me as well? If you were a professor, would you want your student to be honest with you if it meant hearing they have lost all passion in the courses you teach? "

First, I feel like the actual program isn't teaching me as much as it should. It's hard, since I've never been to another university and I don't really have any standard to compare it to, but I'm seven weeks into Harvard's free CS50 course, and I feel like I've learned  more in those seven weeks than in the last three programming classes I've taken here.

And second, I worry that the schools's negative reputation will hurt my chances of getting jobs and internships.

Am I just worrying over nothing? Or is it possible/likely that this school will really hurt my career?"

I would be getting paid very little and it would be for three months. At the end of the training that is when people would be converted to full time developer making a decent amount. However not everyone makes it and from my research its about 60-70% of people. 

The other company I've been interviewing with looks like I'll be getting a job offer from them in the future. I would not have any kind of trial period like with the company but this position is for QA they said that they convert people from QA to Dev a lot of the time. I told them I wouldn't want to be doing QA for more than about a year and that seemed fine to them. So this has me feeling slightly better. Also this company would be paying me slightly less than if I had got the full time gig with the other company but this city is much cheaper to live in so my take home would actually be more than the previous company. 

So basically do I risk doing the trial from the first company because its better for my career? or do I go with the more stable offer and can lead me into a development job down the line? Another thing to consider is I need to pay off my student loans so if the first gig doesnt work out for whatever reason I am suddenly looking for a job again and having to pay my student loans."

I'm wondering how much getting an MBA will really help me, especially without work experience first.

At some point in my career I'd like to go into management, but I want to spend a while being a software engineer first. Would staying an extra year (and paying around $20-30k) be worth it to get an MBA from a top 50ish school? One of my main concerns is that I have to take a full course load over Junior and Senior summers, meaning that getting an internship would be difficult. If anyone here studied C.S. and got an MBA right after undergrad please let me know your experience.

If I don't get the 5th year MBA I may try to get into a top ranking MBA program after 5-7 years of work experience. Should I just stay and get the MBA now or work in the field and maybe go back for an MBA later? Let me know what you think.

I was waiting until April to follow up with my one solid prospect in a QA position, at the recruiter's request. I am in a QA elective right now and it seems like a good fit.

However, I received an unexpected email the other day. A company that had initially responded to let me know that they didn't really have anything that would be a good fit sent over an offer for a software engineering internship. It is out of town and they offered to put me up in an apartment for the duration of the internship.

There are two main reasons that I am hesitant to go for it. The first is that I already have an apartment lined up locally once my current lease ends; the other is that it requires a few languages with which I am not very knowledgable (C++ and some other variants). I know Java fairly well but that's just about it, since I am IT and have not had most of my coding courses yet.

I'm fairly certain I'd choke and gag and fail (and choke and gag) but I wanted to see what you more experienced guys thought.

Basically, whenever I logged my food I lost, whenever I didn't for a period of time I gained again.
I was 113 kg (248.6lbs) at my lowest, pretty much a year ago. Then, during an internship, I injured my knee (some time in March '15). Fast forward a few months and I finally found an able orthopedist who prescribed me shoe inlays (I had a build up of fluid around my knee cap, but mercifully the joint itself is alright!). Most of the pain has left since then, although a bit of the fluid remains, but I can finally walk longer distances again without a problem.

Unfortunately, due to the lack of exercise, stress and general bummed-outness during this time, I have gained 20 kg (44lbs) from March to December. I am currently heavier than I was when my weightloss journey began, but I've been back on track with logging for the past three weeks now and have lost 6 kg so far.

Anyway, that's been the story. Now to the important part of this post:

--------------

**I pledge to**

- keep logging
- continue to save at least an average of 7000 kcal per week
- weigh myself at least once a week
- finally pick up running again, as soon as I'm below 110kg/242 lb.
- fit [this](http://i.imgur.com/ofLuTPv.jpg?1) wicked shirt (XXL) I bought a year ago by late summer at the latest

---------------------------

I have made great experiences with a lower carb, highish protein diet. My only problem with it is constipation, as I find it very hard to get enough fiber while avoiding carbs as best as I can (I try to stay below 150 g/carbs a day). I would be very grateful for any advice in this matter since the last two weeks have literally been a hard time :(

I'd be willing to get supplements for fiber from the pharmacy, but only as a last resort.

---------------------------

On a final note I'd like to thank you for all the inspirational and helpful posts and comments you guys deliver on a continuous basis :) /r/loseit is probably the nicest place on the Internet that I know of!

I am going to keep the name of the company private, but let's call it Engico. Anyway, I received an email today saying I got the internship. Here is my dilemma:

I know it shouldn't always be a factor, especially for an internship, but it is. There is no pay. It is full time for 6 weeks over summer. Basically, a team of interns at Engico will come up with an idea, design and develop a prototype, market the prototype to attract investors, and use the money raised to actually send it into production. 
I think I'd like to accept, but having no pay will make it pretty rough for me this summer. 

But my counter dilemma is that I am a senior. Graduating in December of this year. I feel as though this is my last opportunity at an internship. I mean, it technically is. Unless I get an internship after graduation, but that really isn't part of anyone's plan, at least not anyone I know. 

What do you think? Do I take the knternship? Do I even have a choice if I want an internship this summer for experience before graduation?

4csrru,6,2016-03-31,Results from 12 schools!,ewoktalia14,collegeresults,https://www.reddit.com/r/collegeresults/comments/4csrru/results_from_12_schools/,"Schools: NC State (EA, Accepted, finalist for a full-ride scholarship), Case Western (EA, Accepted), Caltech (EA, Deferred then waitlisted), UC Berkeley (RD, Rejected), Vanderbilt (RD, Waitlisted), Georgia Tech (RD, Accepted), WashU St. Louis (RD, Accepted), Columbia (RD, Rejected), Cornell (RD, Waitlisted), UNC Chapel Hill (RD, Accepted), Carnegie Mellon (RD, Priority waitlisted), Duke (RD, Accepted).

Intended Major: Computer Science

ACT: 36 (35R/36E/36S/36M &amp; 11 on essay)

Awards: A bunch of Science Olympiad stuff (medals, regional and state champs, etc.), National French Exam, National Honor Society, Junior Marshall, Certified in SAS Base 9, Presidential Scholar Nominee, I have a display in &amp; was interviewed by my state's science museum for research that I'm doing.

EC's: I'll keep this short, but if you would like more EC's or better descriptions then I am happy to provide more info. Founder and president of my school's robotics club, president of my school's math club/competitive team, co-leader of a multi-state youth group organization, intern at SAS Institute (big tech company, kinda like a Google/IBM combo but not quite as big lol), mentor and tutor for blind students, lead researcher &amp; data analyst for aforementioned research project, internship at an educational STEM company, National Alliance on Mental Illness volunteer &amp; I've partnered with a local university for a community-wide awareness/fundraising event, violin/violist &amp; I play at my church and community events.

Rec Letters &amp; Essays: Honestly I think my rec letters were pretty good, teachers tend to know me very well. My essays...ehh. I'm definitely not the best writer, but I also started a good bit ahead of time and got feedback from English teachers and did a lot of editing, so they might have been decent.

The UC Berkeley rejection kind of stung, but other than that I'm pretty happy with my results. As of now I'm deciding between Duke, UNC, Georgia Tech, and NC State, but if I get the full-ride scholarship then I'm almost certainly going to State (student loans scare me lol). "
