The Day Everything Changed
 Richard Humphries

It wasn’t good news, that’s for sure, when my big jolly Irish nurse came back to the hospital room. With an unwanted Intern. A dour and intense, dark-eyed Intern who sat on the foot of my bed while the now un-jolly nurse turned down the volume on the television. She had tears in her eyes. Shit.
“Well, it doesn’t look like good news,” I tried.
His words in reply were fast and breathy.
“It isn’t good news, Mister Humphries. It isn’t good at all.” He said it as if he was angry but we three knew it was pretense. “The tests came back and the pathology report says the growth on your pancreas is a carcinoma.”
“That means cancer, doesn’t it?”
“Yes. Cancer.”
“I have pancreatic cancer?”
“Yes, you do.”
“Fuck.”
“You have pancreatic cancer.” He needed the practice of saying these things to patients.
“Sorry, Nurse, about the swearing.”
“That’s okay. Really. Really.”
My vision narrowed to a tight tunnel while my mind insisted I was watching a movie, or in some horrible joke, or the victim of a mistake in the lab. The wrong slide with some other guy’s name that sounded like mine. It couldn’t be. It just could not be. Not me. I had things to do. Plans. At least one great novel to write.
“Isn’t that the kind of cancer that kills you in, like, three months?”
“At the stage you’re at, we generally say three to six months until . . .”
“Until I die? What ‘stage’ am I at?”
“Stage Four. “
“How many stages are there?” I was hoping there were a great many.
“Four.”
“Fuck.”
“It’s advanced.” The Intern stood from my bed, straightening his white coat, making his escape.
“Would you like us to send the Chaplain?” She was Irish to the core.
“Yes. Please. Send the Chaplain. I won’t swear at him. Promise.”
“I’m sure it would be fine if you did. We’ll have him come up.”
“Thank you,” I said. I can’t imagine what for.
They both took it as an excuse to vamoose, however, and I was suddenly very and completely alone. Alone. Alone and scared.
This happened twenty-one months ago.
I still get scared about disappearing from this world soon—dying and being put in a box or burnt to ash– and so had to write this book. It isn’t a ‘cancer’ book or self-help, but rather the kind of sexy/funny murder mysteries I tore through in my youth. Kind of a way for me to be around once I am gone.
I’m now working on book #2.
I never did see the goddamn Chaplain.""

Asking Reddit for help is one of those things.  So here goes.

I'm a 22-year-old college student studying computer science at Drexel University in Philadelphia.  I am trying to transfer to a less-expensive school, but I can't do that until Drexel sends my transcripts to the schools I've applied to.  And Drexel won't do that until I've paid them the money I owe them: $5914.70.

I'm not looking for a free ride.  I am looking for one of two things:

1. A cosigner for a loan.
2. Work that will pay up-front.

I have internship experience in web development and also in Java development.  Off the job I have done extensive work in Python and C.  I am also a somewhat-skilled tenor and I have been teaching karate to children for a few years.  I have been a Redditor for a while.

I am offering the following:

1. 400 hours of work using any skills I have, to be completed ASAP and no later than 2010 AND my sincerest promises not to default on the loan, in exchange for cosigning my loan.  The 400 hours figure is intended to represent working off the full $6000 of the loan at $15/hour.  In comparison, my last job paid $18.75/hour.

2. 400 hours of work using any skills I have, to be completed ASAP and no later than 2010, AND the full loan paid back by 2015, if you would be willing to pay up front ASAP.  If multiple people want to give money, I am willing to split up my hours between people.

I will sign whatever contracts are necessary to make you feel safe that you won't be ripped off.  I would be willing to travel wherever public transit will take me in the Philadelphia area.

[Here](http://imgur.com/7AKbt) is a picture of my bill in the Drexel financial system.  If you can think of any other ways I can verify that my situation is as I say it is without getting my identity stolen, I'll happily provide the information.  I'll also send you my resume if you PM me.

Feel free to ask me any relevant questions.  Please help a fellow Redditor out."

adqq9,62,2009-12-11,How Not To Conduct a Relationship: A cautionary tale,[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/adqq9/how_not_to_conduct_a_relationship_a_cautionary/,"First, although I'm not sure it's actually relevant, I'm a 32-year-old female.

Secondly, I am currently ""on a break"" from an off-and-on six-year relationship. He's 30, and almost completely blameless. 

Briefly, when we began dating, I was a 26-year-old with a fantastic job that brought me both a sense of fulfillment and a nice salary. In addition, I was about to embark on a solo trip to Germany to spend a month with friends I made through my university's exchange program (including a German man I was in a relationship with until I met my current boyfriend; the German confessed to me that he met a girl closer to home, too, so we ended our involvement mutually and amicably). I had so much going on in my life at that time that I felt good about, that I didn't feel I needed a partner. The physical contact and companionship were great, but not something I was focused on. I left for Germany after this guy and I -- we'll call him D -- had been seeing each other for a month. I came back a month later, and he was so enamored with me that he formally asked me to be his girlfriend. As in, he took me to dinner, took my hand in his, and said, ""Would you be my girl?"" I had never had that happen before, and the gesture was off the charts in terms of its romanticism. Finally, I was experiencing the kind of love I no longer believed existed.

About three months later, the unexpected happened: I lost my job. I had been in my position for seven years by that point, which started out as an unpaid internship and progressed rather quickly to my running the department after I had seriously impressed the owners of the company. Because I had focused so much on my career, the job loss was devastating to me. For as long as I live, I will never forget how hollow I felt as my boss told me he was going to have to let me go. He sent me on my merry way with a mere two weeks' salary and a letter of reference. I lost it. D was right there, and he did everything a fantastic boyfriend would do to cheer me up. I gave myself a day to grieve and then hit the pavement. Everything I applied to, I was turned down for. The first week, I had four interviews. Then two the following week. Then one. Then none. Fast forward another three months and I lost everything I owned. Apartment, car, furniture... all of it. In four months' time, my world was turned upside down. I moved back in with my mother and had to face the tumultuous relationship with her I had avoided for many years by that point. 

I'm giving a lot of information here, and I should probably zoom out a bit. In the interest of brevity (too late), I'll say that it took me eight months from the time I was let go to find a crappy stop-gap job that paid me less than half of what I was making before. My debts accumulated, my credit score plunged, and I was utterly and completely without a way out of the hole I found myself in. I moved in with D at that point, but by then, I had become an entirely different person than the dynamic girl he had fallen in love with: I was fixated, utterly and completely, on him and our relationship. Where I had once simply enjoyed his presence in my life, I now *needed* him, and when he wasn't right there, I freaked the fuck out. Almost immediately, the pressure became too much for him, and I ended up back at my mother's (after a brief stint in a mental institution following a total breakdown). We didn't speak for a few months, and I eventually began dating other people. D was there to listen to me as I told him about the guy who showed up to our date and proceeded to tell me all the ways he'd like to defile Britney Spears, and the other guy who strung me along for several weeks before admitting that I was his ""side project."" Many months later, D and I were back together, but the damage had been done: I had a crappy, low-paying job, no ability to return to or pay for school, nothing else in my life from which I could derive even the most remote sense of satisfaction, and the moment we were together again, he became my world. 

This cycle would repeat itself a few times. I eventually got back into my own place, but it was too expensive for me. There were entire weeks I wouldn't have eaten if not for D. My father died recently and it affected me deeply; of my two parents, even though my father was two states away, I had the vastly less dysfunctional relationship with him. I repaid D for his kindness by fixating on the mistakes he made, no matter how big or small, rather than by appreciating him for all the wonderful things he did for me. And most recently, I had become consumed by the kind of jealousy I had only heard about from my guy friends whose girlfriends were utter psychos. Any female he talked to heralded the imminent end of our relationship; they were young, fun, attractive, and going places... all things I could no longer claim for myself. In my struggle to be his number one, I lost sight of myself, and became someone with whom he always felt on edge. His every move was under constant scrutiny as I looked for signs that he was about to leave me. On some level, I knew I brought nothing to the table, yet that wasn't enough to knock some sense into myself. And although he may not yet have left for good, I have to face the possibility that maybe he has. It destroys me, because we had some amazing times together, and I have dated enough to know that he's rare... but I know I have only myself to blame if this is truly the end.

Even as I sit and think of the things he did that weren't exactly helpful, I have to believe that if I had brushed myself off and continued being the focused, personally satisfied individual he met, I wouldn't be writing this. I've been so content to believe all this time that he caused these reactions in me, when it was really the other way around. 

Today, I registered for classes. It's the first time I've been back in school since before we met, and the act of paying off my old debt to the university and signing off on the classes I needed brought about a feeling I haven't felt in years: pride. I was proud of myself for taking this step, and it suddenly doesn't matter if he's surrounded by adorable college-aged girls anymore. I had an idea that it would do this for me, but I really didn't know for sure until I actually made the move. But as I picked up my cell phone to call him and share the good news, I stopped myself: we're not speaking at the moment. At least for a few weeks, maybe for good. I did send him a short email, but I immediately regretted it. I deserve what I'm getting right now and I know it. Still, knowing he's proud of me is important, and I'm having trouble deciding whether that's a good thing. I think it is; who among us doesn't like knowing we're special to someone? 

**Here's the tl;dr**: If you have love, honor it. Honor it by loving yourself. It's bandied about quite a bit, the old saying that you can't love anyone until you love yourself, but it's absolutely true. So for those of you who are smothering your significant other because of an underlying lack of personal satisfaction (and you know who you are), take a step back. Take stock of what is important to *you*, create fulfillment for yourself, and then enjoy your relationship for the ways it enhances your life. And for those of you who are being smothered, show your significant other this post. There's not much I wouldn't do right now to tell my boyfriend how sorry I am, but I have to sit quietly with this for a while and let my actions sink in. I had love, and I killed it. 

Thanks for being my catharsis, Reddit, and I'm sorry for the wall of text.

If you have any legal expertise please give me some insight on my options.",importantquestion,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/aeddn/i_am_currently_living_in_the_us_and_i_have_become/,"Greetings Reddit!

I have been battling with this problem by myself for a while but it has not affected my life drastically until now. I need advice and any information I can get. I feel as if my dreams and goals are getting further and further out of my reach. Here is my story (kind of lengthy but necessary) 

Let me start from the beginning.

I moved to the U.S. with my family when I was around six. We came legally on a temporary Visa, trying to get a break from some political pressure my mom was going through. She worked as an accountant for the Mexican government, some embezzlement ordeal began, and they tried to frame her / pull her into the mess. The issue never settled so we decided to stay in the U.S. for a bit, hoping to be able to relocate to another country (Spain) by selling all our properties and withdrawing our savings. It ended up that our savings had been locked as part of an investigation and all we had left were a few houses my mom owned. After selling the properties, we arranged to transfer the money here little by little (10,000-dollar cap for transferring money). Long story short we were not able to transfer enough money to relocate.

All this happened pre-9/11, so immigration laws were not so strict. 

My family decided to start a new life here in the U.S. My mother and father both were very successful in Mexico but had to resort to cleaning houses in order to get by. My family of six lived in one room in my uncle’s house for a few years. My sisters and I began to attend elementary school here while my parents continued to clean houses. My dad also jumped around as a handy man; pool clear, painter, truck driver, etc. (Pretty much anything he could do to make money). My mother worked magic with money so we were able to finally get our own apartment after almost 3 years of living in one room. (mind you, still only a 2 bedroom) With the help and good will of some of the most amazing people in our lives, we finally were able to rent a house. Again, my mother worked our numbers right and we were able to buy a house years later after a few loans from friends. We are now very stable and have come a long way from where we were. We own a home, 3 cars, and lived relatively well. (small house, standard cars, and we at least have food) We have always been a very humble family and do not have luxuries of awesome Christmas/birthday/graduation gifts, vacations, etc. Our income is around 15,000 a year. Nevertheless, we enjoy life. 

My siblings and I have always excelled in school and in our passions. I am bilingual, (no accent in English, accent when speaking Spanish), straight A student, and have many accomplishments to my name. I have excelled in robotics competitions, winning a few world championship titles when I was younger. Love working out and am an athlete (varsity swimming and wrestling). Enjoy music (symphonic band, marching band, jazz band, know how to play trombone, baritone, flute, guitar, and love drumming) Certified computer technician, enjoy programming/web design. I could keep going (not gloating) but basically, I am an all around person who enjoys learning new things and mastering what I focus on. 

Since I was little my dream was to become a Mechanical Engineer. I worked hard in school to accomplish my goal. I also have my own little workshop in our garage where I take on projects from time to time. Currently working on ""green"" a four-seater quad cycle project with the help a few friends.


Here's the problem
	

 I am currently in college studying mechanical engineering. I am on a full ride thanks to various private scholarships I was able to obtain. As you can figure my parents cannot pay for school, and since I have no legal status I cannot get financial aid. The only reason I was admitted into college in the first place was because of a new bill that was passed: House Bill 1403. Before this bill was passed, I was in a deep depression knowing all my hard work had gone to waste. 	When you are a kid, these restrictions do not affect you too much. However, when you grow older and realize you cannot get a driver's license like your friends, you cannot get a ""real"" job. You CANNOT apply to the school of your dreams even though you are qualified. That you MUST lie to people close to you (friends) about why you cannot drive nor do certain things that are usually not an issue. These things all hit me during my high school years. I pushed through regardless and excelled hoping that a new development would give me opportunities. 
	
 As a college student, I am very involved, and many doors are opening for me. Unfortunately, I am in a very stressful position. I have been offered/applied/accepted to a few internships. I have also been offered to go to a few conferences related to school, along with job offers. I would love nothing more than to be able to have these experiences but I cannot. Since I have no legal status, I do not have a federal I.D. to allow me to fly to these locations. I would use my passport, but it is expired. I would renew it but I cannot go back to Mexico without having to physically return. If I did that, I would not be able to come back into the U.S.
 Things are getting tough without the proper paper work. After I turned 18, a lot of pressure was set on me. I take the bus to school in the mornings when I cannot get a ride from my dad or a friend. I used to drive but sold my car after I was re-ended and went through a horrible experience dealing with the law. (realized just how quickly everything could dismantle even if someone else caused the accident- deportation)


I have looked into a lot of law in order to be able to find something that may be able to help me, but my efforts have been futile. My parents were able to gained residency / SSN # after my oldest sister got married and applied for them. (Took about 5 years, even with a few connections). They have applied for me but the process will still take about 8 years at least.


If I could somehow obtain a legitimate federal ID than I could apply for a TIN (taxpayer identification number). Which would allow me to get a job and fulfill my true potential.

Please help me. I live in Texas. If you need any more information PM me but remember, I can only disclose so much information.

-- this is of course a throw away account.

There are a lot of local internship opportunities here (Cluj, Romania), but I want to go abroad and experience living on my own somewhere.
I don't want to make a heap of money, just to support myself once I get there, and to work on something cool and meet some interesting professionals.

So, Reddit, my question is, have any ides of such internships here in Europe?, besides the obvious Google and Microsoft (for which I will try my luck and apply). Where have you completed your internship, how was it? Any tips? 

If you have any suggestions for the US, they are great too, please don't  hesitate to mention them, but my initial thought was for something closer to home."

I hate everything about our jewish community and my jewish experience, but now my mother has found me an internship through a jewish organization and i has to write 3 pages all about my wonderful jewish experience and how it helps me in life and AAARRRRGH. i can't do this.

I probably jst man up and B.S. my way through this, but i feel like i can't. I can't sell out like that.

**EDIT:** here's what i've writen.  i think i'll have to start over.

I grew up in an extremely Jewish environment, where being Jewish put you in the majority.  My family was reformed, but my great grandmother was orthodox and my uncle Gregg kept kosher in his household.  This put me in a little Jewish bubble.  I can’t say I minded this little bubble for a few years.  If everyone is like you, then what is there to hate, right?  Of course being from Beachwood, I and all others that would eventually make it off to college would be told numerous times that “This isn’t the real world” and “People might not like you just because you’re Jewish” or even “Some people will think you have horns,” but it appears that I’m jumping the gun a bit in my biography.  


From a very early age I had a connection to the Greater Cleveland Area.  I remember one of my first baseball games.  When we got past a certain street we would lock our car doors.  I loved that sense of “tiers of civility.”  After a certain street, those who lingered in that bubble were worse people, evil people, who would like nothing more than to car-jack a mother, father, and two little children’s car for no reason.  Cleveland is predominantly Christian, so I was given the sense that outside of the Jewish bubble of Beachwood were terrible Christian people.  It was an interesting blend to say the least.  


From that point on, I knew that Cleveland was nothing more than a cesspool of crime and grime with nothing beneficial or worthwhile to come out of going there, especially in an unlocked car.  As for the suburbs of Cleveland, I never bothered to know any of the other children from cities such as Orange and Mayfield and so on.  I met them a bit while I was playing Middle School soccer, but that meeting consisted of me picking out a fat kid to guard and dribble past so I wouldn’t have to put much effort into the game.  Beyond this I never cared for and never will bother with the Greater Cleveland Area.


So anyway let’s hop back on the topic of Judaism.   I remember in 9th grade being told the story of Martin Luther and the protestant movement in Christianity.  Now I know this wasn’t the only reason for the separation, but the people were frustrated with the fact that mass was held all in Latin.  You see, there was already colloquial English and at that point no one understood Latin except the priests for obvious reasons.  So the people sat in church listening to a bunch of gibberish for an hour or so and then left feeling somehow hollow and unfulfilled.  How can they show interest and passion for something they know nothing about?  They can’t.  So what have I done for the past 18 years?  I’ve sat through a bunch of Hebrew gibberish for a few hours every service and then leave dissatisfied.  Sure they tried to teach me how to read Hebrew in Hebrew School, but then never taught me what it means.  What good is a language that you can read but don’t understand the meaning of what you read?  Right now you feel as though I have once again gone on a tangent and need to focus, but patience is something that I have grown to appreciate and so should others.  The point I’m making is that I felt like Martin Luther.  I needed to separate myself from this ignorant system.  I however broke off in a different manner.  I became an Atheist.  I first defined myself as thus in about 8th grade.  That means I wasted about 13 years with religion, just long enough for a Bar Mitzvah.  I’ve grown to despise the thought of god and I’ve come to understand the great amount of ignorance floating around in this world, and refuse to take part.


So why on earth would I apply to a Jewish internship?  Well, you’re going to pay me.  I hate jobs for the youth.  They consist of stocking and cleaning things.  That’s it.  So if I can get 2500 bucks and not need to work at a two-bit restaurant, I’ll do it.  The main reason however is because my family is Jewish and thus they found this internship, not me.  They are practically forcing me to apply, and thus I write these ramblings.  I hope you appreciate the 20 minutes I put in to write for your little Internship.  I don’t expect that I’ll hear from you.


**EDIT: Alright, I completely rewrote the essay in a formal and kind manner.  I don't think i'll post it here in case they find it here somehow and see this magnificent piece of writing above.**

**I wrote the truth, just simply not in it's entirety.  My new essay paints me out to be the perfect Jewish child that just can't wait to get this wonderful internship.  I feel dirty.**"

I have a place to stay in San Jose over the summer, and my amazing parents have agreed to pay to send me there if I can get any kind of relevant internship so, how can I do that? I hope I'm not starting too late."
