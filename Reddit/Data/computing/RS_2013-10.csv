I’ve applied to multiple organizations for a multitude of different jobs, some I’ve been qualified for, some I’m not 100% qualified for. I’ve got a lot of no’s and I have also gotten a lot of non-response from companies, which I am assuming is a less involved way of saying no.

1njdny,8,2013-10-01,burned-out?,enraged_buddha,GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/1njdny/burnedout/,"Hi folks,

I'm entering the third year of my PhD program (Computer Science) and honestly, I feel miserable. I like doing research, I like my advisor, I like the projects I'm working on, and we're having success and getting good results, but I feel so burned out its like I can barely focus or get much done on a workday. This then makes me feel like I should work weekends to make up the time, and the cycle continues and gets worse.

I think a lot of this has been because I've been working for my advisor non-stop (summers, holidays, etc.) the whole time I've been in grad school. To his credit, he always makes sure I have things to do, so I'm not just thumb-twiddling, and I don't feel like I work any harder than he does... the guy's an animal!

Has anyone else dealt with this, or does anyone have any good advice for me? I feel like I could really use a vacation, even as much as several months, but I know that he's already got projects lined up for me this coming year. Problem is, I'm also sure that as I get done with these projects, more will just keep coming.

I feel guilty asking for time off when he doesn't take much time off for himself, and he's quite well-respected in his field, so I feel more like he's doing me a favor as my advisor and I don't want to lose the relationship I have with him. He's done a great job advising me thus far, and has connected me with some good internships, but I just can't keep up!"

and it's not like i'm not willing to make sacrifices; au contraire.

i would have actually stabbed my best friend in the back to get together with his ex and even got slightly physical with her... she told me that she doesn't want a relationship. cuz she decided to not have one until next year, cuz she hasn't been single in a while, and because she doesn't wan't to hurt her ex-BFs feelings... yeah, understandable, reasonable and i'm kind of a dick, but fuck you anyway, especially for the way you avoided me the last two months.

 ^^also, ^^thank ^^you ^^for ^^doing ^^this, ^^otherwise ^^i ^^still ^^wouldn't ^^be ^^over ^^you.

another potential love interest works with me, but just got out of a 11! year relationship with a good friend and ""blablabla i need time for myself now"", understandable, and actually i really like how we click at work, and we probably work better as friends anyway, so fuck you only a little.

^^also, ^^thank ^^you ^^for ^^being ^^amazing ^^at ^^your ^^job ^^and ^^in ^^general 

Then there's that girl that is just WAY out of my league at professional school. that woman is so HOT, and it seems like she doesn't even try to be, which makes her even hotter, which results in me secretly staring at her in vocational school whenever it doesn't look that creepy. she's nice, too, and i think we would fit together as well, but i have a really hard time getting a conversation going with her, and, of fucking course; turns out she has a boyfriend and is happy with him. i wish he got cancer or something. meh. 'Tis but a crush, i easily got over you.

^^but ^^i ^^still ^^can't ^^keep ^^my ^^eyes ^^of ^^you ^^for ^^long


Actually, i could deal with all of those. after some time. but this new episode of my non-existent love-life just seems to be a kick in the balls from some higher entity. i'm currently fucking PISSED at life. 

so 2 months ago, this really nice, beautiful girl showed up for trial work for and internship at my work. i show her around, get a really comfortable conversation going, i make her laugh, hoorray! I'll just wait 2 months until we work together, and there's BOUND to be romance. methinks. so fast forward, she starts working, we have a good time at work, she wants to hang out with me and my aforementioned female colleague after work, and i generally have that feeling that there were certain... cues. and just after i decided that i have to make SOME kind of move, she mentions that she's jealous when i tell her that two buddies came over for beers last night, because she has a temporary stay at work and doesn't know any one in that small town where i work.
well, i think now or never, i ask her if she would like to come to my town to hit this really nice bar for a drink... i just KNOW she would love it there. all of a sudden she's hesitant and says that she'd have to drive home afterwards, so she really couldn't have a beer. kind of dumbfounded (and also kind of woozy from last nights beers, joints and lack of sleep) i agree with her... but really, what else would i say in that situation. i mean, she seemed very open-minded to meeting new people, and didn't strike me as a person that NEEDS to drink to even consider going to a bar... and i sure do know that kind of people. then there's the quite obvious possibility of staying at my place... i did not even offer that since, you know, why embarass myself when i know the answer anyway.
in my wooziness i'm not exactly jumping from joy but not crushed either... until somebody calls for her to make an appointment. she says she doesn't have time because her B O Y F R I E N D and her have some kind of shitty plans that i cannot and do not wish to recall now or at any point in the future. 

alright. now i did feel kind of crushed. not that i showed any of that. i'm getting used to it. and i'm not letting it drag me down, because i fucking KNOW that i'm a good person, that i would make a great boyfriend, and an even greater husband and father... and also, that all my chances are going down the drain if i ever let myself think bad of myself again. fuck you though. fuck you really, really hard.

^^also... ^^i ^^still ^^enjoy ^^working  ^^with ^^and ^^talking ^^to ^^you ^^way ^^too ^^much

i am 27 years old and have never had a girlfriend. i'm a nice guy, attractive, intelligent, hard working, great at my job, and get to meet quite some women through work and school.

i'm nowhere near perfect, i am kind of an underachiever, used to be introverted and don't have that many friends. i have made some really stupid decisions in my past. but i worked hard to change myself into someone that i can respect and love, and others can, too. 

I DO NOT UNDERSTAND WHY THERE IS NO LOVE FOR ME IN THIS WORLD.

When I was still an intern a brand new 795 was sitting on the floor in our data center. It was staged, waiting to be hooked up. There was scheduled maintenance for Friday night, I don't recall the specific work but it involved rebooting a, separate, 795. 

So around 11PM the admin powers it back up. I don't remember specifics here either, I was mostly observing, but something was wrong. The 795 calls home, we put in a PMR with IBM and given our contract were supposed to receive a call back from a hardware person within the hour. That call never comes.

So around 2:30AM we finally get a hardware person on the line. Long story short, a CPU popped during the power cycle. The nearest replacement part was 8 hours away. 

Tell a bunch of guys who worked part of the day Friday, most of the evening through the night that they would have to wait 8 hours for a replacement part. No way. 

We work it out so that the part will come but in the mean time they are sending out a tech and we will cannibalize a drawer from the staged 795 to replace the broken part. Then when the part arrives from BFE the tech can place it in the staged 795. Kind of like musical CPUs. 

So a tech is on the way, eta ~1.5 hours. Someone asks if we know where the 795 is staged. ::blank stairs:: Five grown men descend on the data center. It's around 3:30AM now and we've got flashlights looking for this thing. I'm still new and have very little idea what I'm doing. I learned a lot of the DC layout that night. 

Finally we find this sucker. Just before the tech arrives. He understood the plan and I guess he did some thinking on the way there and starts telling us how he's going to have to mess with serial numbers since the new drawer will be different from the old and that's going to mess all kinds of things up. (He's telling me like I'm somebody important. I've been there a week and a half.) ""Sounds Good!"" and I walk away.

Around 5/6AM we get the green light to go home. Relief comes in and I went to sleep. I didn't follow up until Monday but apparently it did work. Happy ending but amazing still.

TLDR: If you have IBM products order N+1 devices so you have an ad hoc ""Parts Locker"" on hand.

These are fun. Screw you IBM."
1niyzo,1,2013-10-01,How do I get a grip?,nudelkopp,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1niyzo/how_do_i_get_a_grip/,"Hey /r/depression. 

I'm in a weird place right now, and I just need to write some stuff. 

I have a good life. I recently graduated and I had a job the day after. I have a girlfriend who I love and who loves me back. I have good friends and I have a family that's really open and whole. I don't drink more than moderately and I don't do drugs.

Still, I'm far from happy. I'm constantly stressed, I feel aimless and I'm basically on autopilot throughout the day. I picked up smoking as a stress reliever, and now I can't stop. I don't workout anymore and I rarely cook even though I used to enjoy it.

I grew up in a small town in the middle of the Swedish forest. The best thing about that was how often I could be alone, and just not do anything.

Almost three years ago I moved to the capital to study. I've always been pretty ambitious, so I moved straight after highschool with the goal of getting a good job and to work with big brands. I've achieved that, both through my current workplace and prior internships I've worked with Nike, Phillips, Converse and WWF. I still haven't found a new goal, in a sense I feel done, but not like I actually completed it. It doesn't help that work right now feels like something I'm just supposed to do. Fuck spending 40h a week, 120h a month and 1440h a year on work just because 'that's how it's supposed to be'.

I want to be alone, since that's how I used to cope with stress. Just me and no one else for a few hours. That's what makes me calm.

My girlfriend loves me but she doesn't understand my need to be alone. We hang out everyday after work, and all weekends. If I propose a day where I can get some me-time she almost always starts crying. She's also depressed, but her problem makes her have difficulties coping with being alone. Good combination, right?

I think the trigger for my (young) depression was when I found a friends suicide note in his abandoned apartment. Don't worry, he's still alive. He just fled to turkey for a few weeks. We were really happy that he returned, but something just clicked in me that night when we found it.

On a lesser note I also feel fat and disgusting, but I feel pretty fine about that. I don't care that much about it.

I know that everything would get better if I just started doing something about my problems, like work out, find a new job or stop smoking. I've done it before. I just cant find the energy to do it this time. "

I (M/24) got out of the Marines over a year ago and am in my second year at a junior college. I've lived with my family for the past year but this is starting to put a strain on our relationships and we have decided it would be better if I moved out now vs. waiting until I transferred to a university. I have a steady internship position that pays well and will employ me as long as I am in school. The apartment I have chosen is 25% of my monthly income (including utilities) and the payments won't be a problem. *no roommates 

**TL/DR 24, financially stable**

Here's a short list of things I have picked up through googling.

* Get everything in writing.

* Take pictures of everything before moving in and host them on a third party site with timestamps.

* Check every appliance, outlet, and door locks for functionality during the walkthrough, before signing the lease.

* Visit the complex at various hours through the night to get a feel for the area. *I have been lucky enough to stay the weekend with a friend who lives in the complex. The place is eerily quit for friday and saturday nights.*
* Renter's insurance is not an option, it is a necessity.

**Edit- I'll add all advice here for anyone searching this subject in the future.**

* Visit the actual place you will be renting!

* Ask about previous tenants owning animals.

* Check the number of washers and dryers vs. units in the complex.

* Get the landlord to like you. They will be more willing to fix problems immediately. Nitpicking every small problem is a great way to get on the landlord's badside.

* If you get a chance, introduce yourself to your neighbors so you know who they are and they know who you are. 

* Cleaning supplies, clean everything your first day 
* Remember to book an elevator 
* If your neighbor plays loud music at 3am do not pound on the wall screaming obscenities... instead call the building manager the next morning to deal with them. 
* Never let someone you don't know follow you in the building... at the very least ask to see their door key. 
* Know what your lease says and under what circumstances you might forfeit your security deposit. 
* Do you get a parking spot? is there street parking? (cities and towns usually have special street permits for residents) 
* Near a grocery store? (don't shop at convenience stores) 
* Bed bugs? (fuck those things, run like hell) 
* Are the common areas well maintained? if they aren't chances are the building manager or management company doesn't care
* take pictures during the tour and when you sign the paperwork -- get them printed and seal them in an envelope and mail them to yourself but don't open it. This way if something happens you have proof of the current state of the apartment.
* Keep a copy of the lease/renters agreement.
* Open all the doors and check the storage space. Open all the drawers, and closets.
* Smell the unit. Smell outside, are you downwind from things like farms/paper mills etc.
* Find out garbage/recycling removal. Ask about utilities and average cost of utilities. Find out about lawn care. Find out about fees like Home Owners Association etc. and if you are responsible for this. What internet companies service the area. What utilities are included with rent.
* Find out who it is you will work with if theres an issue. Superintendent or the actual owner.
* Are you allowed to paint the place if you want? Will improving things make rent less (ie put up a fence and the cost of the fence + labor is taken off the cost of your rent that month)
* What type of lightbulbs are recommended.

So Reddit, what am I missing? What did you wish you knew before you rented your first place?"

At the the end of the day however, this was only for internships, so I could definitely try again next year, but I feel like I'm just not built for audit, and hiring managers can see that.

Consulting is the real dream for me, all my ECs revolve around it and I would have liked to leverage Big 4 experience to help me in pursuing that.

Should I even bother again next year?

Anybody have similar stories to share? "
1nhhao,10,2013-09-30,"[Rant] I beat it before, this time is harder",[deleted],Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1nhhao/rant_i_beat_it_before_this_time_is_harder/,"I am a 30 y/o male. I suffer from anxiety/depression.

*Wow, I don't think I have ever said before, or really come to terms with that, but I guess that is the case.*

Here is my story:

At the ripe age of 22/23 I experience my first 'mental breakdown.' Prior to this I was a somewhat normal 20 something. I had an normal upbringing, normal teen years and never had any sort of diagnosis or major ailment.

At 22/23 was the first time I have any sort of mental issue, other than the occasional blues. I was on vacation with friends in a foreign land and was not having a good time. I knew before I went it would be tough for me as I don't like sleeping out very much, let alone sleeping in foreign countries. I went away on a 2 week vacation and after 1 week I had to call it quits. I remember 'freaking out,' crying to my best friend saying, 'I have to get the hell out of this place.' He tried to calm and told me to just spend the day resting in the hotel, but I refused and booked myself the first flight out of the damn country.

Other than the idea that I had to absolutely get the hell out of the country; that was it. I think the lack of sleep, alcohol and homesickness just got to me. I returned home and was slightly depressed for a couple weeks. I remember just feeling mostly 'blue' that I had let all my friends down, but it passed. With that, I did get some slight anxiety at school (college; i started late) for a couple weeks but nothing so bad. In a matter of weeks I felt absolutely like my old self; ready to conquer the world.

Fast forward to the age of 24/25. I had my second mental 'breakdown.' I got a job in the big city that I had some serious issues with. I was just really unhappy with it. I hated the hours and I hated the commute. One day on the bus to work, I started to 'freak out.' I felt the overwhelming desire to spit. I am a smoker, and I had phlegm, and I wanted to spit. *I know this all sound absolutely mental, but it is true*...I realized I couldn't spit on the bus. I had no window to spit out of, no bathroom to go and spit. I started feeling really closed in on the bus and had to remove myself from the situation. I started to slightly hyperventilate; but nothing too bad and at the next stop (which was only about 3 stops after getting on the bus) I got off. I was freaking out a bit, got light headed and started to think, ""what the fuck is wrong with me?"" 

I immediately called the main source of positivity in my life; my mother. I told her I 'freaked out' on the bus and I didn't think I could go to work. She obviously told me all the things a mother should. ""you are ok, take a breath, relax for a minute and then try again. You are a grown man, you just got a little claustrophobic."" I took her advice and then after getting back on the bus I made it to work. I was fine after a slightly harrowing experience on the way there. On the ride home I vowed not to take that bus again and I never have since. I realized some days afterwards I started to feel slightly depressed. I continued to work the job for another four months. Even though I felt fine for a couple days after I had the bus incident, I noticed the following week, I started to feel major anxiety going into work. I connected the dots and knew that the job was a source of a lot of my anxiety. Lucky for me the 'job' was an internship. I ended it a couple/few months of going in almost everyday with crippling anxiety.

I actually felt fine when I was home though; or mostly fine. It was only when going into the job. So I did what any normal person who had no idea what an anxiety disorder was, would do...I left the source of my anxiety. And like that....I felt fine. No anxiety to speak of, for mostly anything. 

**For 17 months** I had no anxiety nor depression. That was until I lost an aunt. I was very sad about her death and it got me thinking about mortality. One night, in bed, I started to go down a road (mentally) I wish I never have. I started thinking about everyone I will lose in my life, everyone I love that will one day die. How did I respond to these thoughts? Well, I had a minor panic attack in bed, in my sanctuary. I woke up the next day very groggy. VERY groggy, to the point when I woke up, I said to myself ""feels like I drank last night."" When the afternoon hit I got a new, but slightly familiar feeling. That feeling was an upcoming major depressive episode. I lost interest in everything, and with depression came the anxiety. I had no idea, but the coming month would be the worst months of my life. The depression was absolutely crippling and the anxiety was like something I had never experienced. I would get anxious for the sake of getting anxious; sure I had trigger like everyone else, but it just seemed anything and everything would trigger it. There were days I barely left my bed. There were days **I was sure I would have to go to the hospital**. I can recall one afternoon, home in my mother's house (who is the only other occupant); she was at work, I was at home and I felt like I couldn't catch my breath. This lasted close to an hour and finally passed. It was the worst panic attack of my life and it was with me, in my bed, in my sanctuary, all by myself.

So what did I do? Mostly nothing. I took time off from work (freelance work from home) and focused on getting better. I had a huge support system that had no idea I was in so much inner turmoil. The only person who knew was my mom and she was huge in supporting me. She never brought it up unless I did and did everything in her power to keep me comfortable. I admit as a 27 y/o guy, living with his mom, I sometimes went upstairs and laid in bed with her. I am not ashamed; there's nothing as scary as irrational fear of nothing and everything and your mom is always your mom.

I tried to do something everyday; whether that was going for a bike ride with my cousin or stopping by a friends house to hang out. I tried to be optimistic even though I felt a huge void inside of me. I made gains daily, but also took many steps backwards. Within a month I could almost 'fake' it perfectly. Within 2 months, I actually started feeling mostly better after three months I all but forgot about the episode. Once I was out of the 'episode' I changed my life. I started exercising regularly (joined a gym) and started eating healthy. I quit smoking and started to have weekly activities planned. I got my own place to live and just enjoyed being in my late 20s, single and happy.

**I kept the demons away for over 3 years. In fact, 3 years and 2 months.**

That brings me to my current situation. I am going on week 5 of hell. About a year ago, stuff started to slowly fall apart. I had a major injury which essentially stopped my very activity exercise schedule. Once that healed I had major trouble getting back into it, and never really did. I started smoking cigarettes again, started eating most unhealthy (skipping meals, eating crap) and had problems at work.

I ended up giving up my own place and having to move back in with my mom, weeks before my 30th birthday. Typically, people would feel like absolute shit over this, but I really did not mind. I love living with my mom, maybe part of me feels bad about it, but that part is not conscious in me.

I think the financial stress started to get to me; I even had warning signs of an impending episode. I even said to myself one night after a long, long day ""man this is stress like I have never felt."" It was so long since that last 'episode,' I was cocky and thought I could never feel that shit again. I should have changed my habits that night, but instead I let the stress go on, I let everything pile up and then one day, **I had another panic attack.** I was driving and just started to feel closed in again. There was traffic which I have dealt with so many times, but this time it was different. I got freaked out. I had to get off of the road and I did. I ran from the fear, I got out of the traffic and made it to my destination.

Just like the last times, once I got to my destination, I felt fine. No anxiety in site. I was going to a BBQ with loads of people I didn't know. I laughed about the traffic with a friend and went on with the day. On my ride home, I avoided the traffic (just like I avoided the bus) and got home fine. I was in a great mood for 2 days and then, like a light was switched off; depression hit. I couldn't believe what I was feeling. Disinterest, loss of appetite, a void. It was like **night and day**. All of a sudden the very worst I have ever felt in my life had come back to me. My demons returned. With the depression came the general anxiety.

I am now in the midst of it all again and I ask myself, ""am I strong enough to pull out of this again?"" All the other times I did it on my own, but this time feels different. I am older, I am wiser and I know more about the horrors of the world. I have already been to see a doctor who prescribed me medication which I refused (for now); I have seen a therapist, told almost everyone in my family and my good friends and hired an herbalist to help me find a good mixture of something to get me feeling like my old self. These are all things I did not do last time.

In the previous 'episodes' I mostly ignored everything. I didn't do online research on cutting edge depression/anxiety treatments. I didn't use forums and read about everyone else's symptoms or diagnosis. I just did other stuff to occupy my time, but this time, I am absolutely obsessed with getting better. I have taken time off of work and tried to focus on getting better but I am already starting to feel like I am not strong enough this time.

At some moments I feel like this battle is too big for me."
1nhdhh,1,2013-09-30,Just need to vent - senseless self pity,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1nhdhh/just_need_to_vent_senseless_self_pity/,"Hi reddit, just came here to post some shit that's been bothering me for a while. I know it's trivial shit, that others have problems a lot more troublesome than mine, or are in situations that are far more difficult to deal with. By all means, things are pretty good for me. I have close friends that I could talk with about anything. I'm doing really well in college, and I'm nearing graduation. I'm working at a paid internship for the moment, doing work at a prolific institution. I have family that is close and supportive. I'm not depressed. Despite all that, I need to get it out there anyways. Here goes.

In a lot of ways, I feel like a shell of a person. I feel like I'm just going through the motions of life. I have always been a very reserved person, a sterotypical introvert in almost all regards. Recently, I've begun to realize I probably have some mild social anxiety. Meeting new people is a huge chore. Sometimes I can barely make conversation with close friends. Put into a situation where I know almost no-one, my brain just freezes. I can't get out of my own head enough to stop worrying about what to say.

At the crux of all this is a feeling of loneliness. As far as dating goes, well, let's just say it isn't. I can't put my loneliness into words, it's too deep. At the same time, I feel like I can't do anything to help myself. There's nothing really stopping me, but I just can't seem to do anything. I'm sickened at myself for this lack of motivation and apathy. I've been single for about five years. Prior to that I had dated someone for over 2 years and I was the happiest I had ever been. I really loved her. For whatever reason, she became more distant until she admitted that she was not in love with me, and our relationship ended. I don't blame her, we were (and still are) quite young, and everyone's got to play the field a little bit. 

In my first year of college, I partied a lot. I drank a lot. I earned a reputation as a party animal, a real wild person that could pound drinks. Having come off my relationship, I just wanted attention. At the time I didn't realize that I was getting the wrong attention. I had a lot of popularity, but it was just for my stupid drunken antics. I would drink until I passed out, maybe 3 times a week. 

During this time I never really tried to date as I was not over my breakup. However, time took its course and eventually I felt well enough to consider myself completely over my last relationship. Several months later I was pursuing another girl. We talked a lot, hung out (alone, together) etc. over the course of a few months, and eventually I went to ask her out only to find out she had a boyfriend, and had been dating him for quite a while and had never mentioned his existence. I was disappointed, but having been in a deep relationship for much longer, I was hardly affected by it all that much.

Yet for some reason, since that happened, I just stopped trying. I was never very good at randomly flirting with people, I mean hell I have a hard enough time trying to make new friends nevermind approaching people romantically. As time went on, I considered dating and flirting was what ""other people"" did, not me. Fast forward to today, and I've been out of it for so long I feel utterly powerless to change my situation.

Again, like I said before, I'm not depressed. I don't really feel sad, or angry. There's loneliness, a desire to reach out and share myself with someone... But if I had to describe my emotion in a word, I'd just say... flat. Or empty. It's like I don't feel anything, and I know I should. The closest I get to feeling anything like catharsis comes when I listen to sad music. If I felt more, I'd probably be motivated to do more. But I don't, so my constant inaction continues. Sitting here, thinking endlessly about my inexplicable self pity.

1nm6ry,0,2013-10-02,Rant/Where to go to find decent players?,mattizie,DotA2,https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/1nm6ry/rantwhere_to_go_to_find_decent_players/,"Hello everyone,

I apologise for the long-winded post, but I have to get something off my chest.

I've been lurking r/DotA2 for quite some time now, every now and then there are very worthwhile good posts that appear. I particularly enjoy threads discussing strategy. Anyway, I used to play a fair bit of all pick, and then it got to the point where I was sick of losing, simply because we got outpicked, or my team went all full carry/retard. Following this, I found some temporary relief playing Captains Mode, strangely enough, I was captain for most of my games (before they added the button). And it really wasn't that bad; you could check each player's stats while waiting for the game to start, and it would give you an idea of their skill. Meaning if everyone had less than 50 wins, then it was drow, riki, ursa time. Then they got rid of it, and you had no clue any more, fair enough you see the odd guy that actually bothers to find out about this feature, and turns it back on, but most of the time you can only rely on commends, which are not a good indication at all.

Please skip this paragraph:
I didn't want this to turn into one of those threads about MM, but it really is beyond shit, one game I'm matched against a 600+wins pudge, the next I'm with idiots that don't understand what stack and pull means, or just as bad, ""hurr durr, a trilane is a stupid idea, no-one does that"", I can only facepalm hard. I hate to say it, but if LOL ever progresses to the point where roaming, pushing and different laning strats in general were viable, then I'd probably go play that. But fuck that.

Today I just finished a game ID#330924703. I was the QoP. And this game is what has pushed me to post my first piece of content on reddit. Teams are, in order of pick:
my team: Treant, weaver, rubick, AM, qop
opposition: warlock, PL, Sandking, Furion(prophet), pudge
Strat was weaver offlane, harrass/kill furion in jungle early, (living armor [LA] if needed), trilane top, rubick babysit, tree stacks, and LA is needed on AM, qop to harass pudge, deny runes.
What actually happened, tree went bot with weaver. they face a dual lane with prophet not in jungle (strange but weaver can still handle that, and PL gets less xp. AM is very very new, can't last hit, doesn't know how. Rubick decides to not buy anything (gets RoH), and last hits all game, doesn't harass or deny, or stack or pull, so AM can farm. Later in the game, I give up first blood to pudge stupidly, my bad, but not the end of the world. Then he goes on to hook AM, at this point we have nill vision of our jungle because rubick wants a bloodstone. And it just goes on from there, no vision, no carry, PL freefarms pushes down all three towers, no-one buys dust of course.

What I'd like to know is where does one go to get a decent team, are there any relevant forums where one may go to compile a team before starting a game? I'm Australian, but staying in Europe for an internship, so it's EU servers (fuckloads of Russians that don't or won't speak English). I'm not after legendary players, just those that understand basic concepts of the game, like warding, last hitting, farming (as opposed to pushing), stacking then pulling, that shit. I have 1000 hours, 300wins, 400 losses + abandons, though considering that a DC in pick stages counts as a loss, and that I learnt to play dota on this account, including experimenting with new heroes, I don't think that's too horrible.

My steam name is ""mattizie"", display name in dota is in Chinese characters; it translates to ""Australian"".
Thank you for your time, and apologies for the rant."

1nm4jp,15,2013-10-02,Preconception opinions (Wall of Text),[deleted],BabyBumps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BabyBumps/comments/1nm4jp/preconception_opinions_wall_of_text/,"tl;dr - waiting to try, dad probably has alzheimer's: wwyd? 

Hi Bumpers,
I've been lurking r/babybumps for several months and created a new account unknown to my friends to ask this question.

I'm a 26yo woman and my husband and I have been married for 6 months - together for 8 years. I am in graduate school - I will graduate in May 2014 with a Master's degree. We currently have no children. We've been waiting (I've been waiting for a lot longer than we've been married!) until we've achieved some other important milestones. Of course, I want to be finished with school, and we would love to have a house first, which means that I'll need to find a job and be there for a few months before we're able to get a mortgage. Our current time-table is ""we'll look at where we are in a year before removing the 'goalie.'""

Well... today, my 56 year old father was diagnosed with early-onset dementia. We're getting some further testing before it's confirmed to be early-onset Alzheimer's. This is, literally, my worst nightmare. My dad's aunt had Alzheimer's toward the end of her life and it was the worst thing I've ever seen. I'd rather anything - ANYTHING - else above dementia. I've been praying since I was a teenager that none of my family gets dementia. And here we are... the most important man in my life has it while he's still young.

My dad is so amazing. He's the coolest man ever. A total badass. One time, he treated himself for a poisonous snake bite while hiking in the mountains. He's so smart and so strong and he's got a love for his family greater than I've ever seen in anyone else. I've always wanted my children to know my father, and now it's probable that my father will never know my children. I've been home, crying, all day. My husband came home on his lunch break and asked if I wanted to move up our ""trying"" time table.

At first blush, yes. I do. Deeply. But I don't know how conceivable (no pun intended) that is. Given that I've got some congenital uterine defects and some endometriosis, it could take us a while, and that really scares me. Every day is precious time now. But we're living off of my husband's 25k/year salary and my student loans + part time TA work. Next semester I'll be eyes-deep in an unpaid internship and won't be able to work at all. We're living in a crappy apartment and there's not a lot of room for a baby or baby stuff. Money is tight with just us and I so wanted a house of our own, and having a baby before getting a house would make a house harder to save for. I just don't know whether it's possible.

So my question is for you, bumpers and experienced mamas. How hard would it be to be a graduate student/intern while pregnant? How hard will it be to find a Master's level job when I've got an infant at home? How hard will it be to find affordable daycare (I ain't going into a lucrative business... my starting MSW salary will be about 40k/year)? How hard is it to live in close quarters with a baby? How hard is it to buy a house with a baby?

And... what would you do? Do you think it would be worth it so my dad might have a chance at knowing who his grandchildren are for a while before he loses the ability to recognize his family? Or do you think it's more valuable to give one's children the life you've been working so hard for?

Thanks. "

Then there are CUNY schools such as City College and Hunter which I haven't heard much about.

I'm looking for some input in regards to the pros and cons to each option.  Is there a big difference in quality of education/ internship opportunities/ brand value to employers between CUNY and SUNY?  I would prefer to attend a school in NYC, but if Stony Brook is a much stronger school I would gladly go for it."

I am taking 15 credit hours and now that I realize that this class that is pretty difficult and taking quite a bit of studying to do well in is now unnecessary for my degree.

A few things to note, if I drop the class I will have to pay back $300 to the state of florida because of Bright Futures scholarship. Also, I will only be registered for 12 credit hours, and for my scholarships I need 30 for an entire year. This means that if I drop the class now, I will have to take a summer course (which is not too bad) but I'm wondering how that might interfere with internship opportunities.

I've been to my advisor/s and they didn't seem to concerned when it came to me dropping an unnecessary course. What do you guys think I should do? Stick the difficult class out for the rest of the semester and have to deal with it amidst my other classwork, or drop it and pay 300$ (because of my scholarship) and have extra time to do well  in my other classes?

Any advice will help! Well, I'm off to a discrete structures test now!"

After the aptitude test I got the call today for an interview. However, much to my surprise, it seems they are interested in having me in the DD team (Transaction Services line) rather than Audit (or even risk consultancy, that is).
I don't know which of them is more popular in my country, so I don't even know what to think - was my test ""not enough"" for audit or did they simply find my personality (judging by my cover letter) and skill set more fitting for DD. Or just simply trying to fill up that team because not enough applicants there... (?)

Now, I do know what Financial DD is by its definition, and it actually sounds very interesting ""on paper"" but I don't know much about the job itself - I don't know anyone who works in that service line, sadly.

So my questions are;

**1)** What are the key differences regarding the style of work between DD and auditing?

**2)** Which has better/more career opportunities (within the company / exits)? How about moving abroad - is it easier with either one?

*...and at last but not least the question I wouldn't dare to ask on the interview but can shamelessly do so here:*

**3)** Which one pays better (most likely there's no difference as a trainee but how about later in the long run)? :)

Bonus: Given my specific situation how would you prepare for this interview? Currently, I'm reading up on everything I can find about DD and gather my thoughts on what do I like about it / how I think I fit for it etc. Any advice other than that?

*Lastly, I'd appreciate any insight on the matter, so even if you don't answer any of those questions, I encourage you to put your 2 cents in.*

I'd like to persue a career in marketing, in particular social media marketing, I'm currently in a part of the world where this is a developing area so (theoretically) there should be plenty of opportunities. Unfortunately I have a contract until the end of June 2014, I'm unwilling to break it as there is a generous bonus waiting for me at the end, it's the only reason I stuck out the job last year, it would be a waste to walk away now.

Luckily as I have shorter hours than most it gives me time to do online courses and read up on relevant info online. I'm looking into a digital marketing course I can do online and I'm hoping to find some work experience or internship for two weeks I have off during April - hopefully then I will be able to go from there on a job-hunt.

My problem is my lack of experience / qualifications and my LinkedIn profile, obviously since I'm looking at social media and online related things it's necessary to have a profile that reflects that I'm capable. I don't want to outright lie on my profile but my current job is a teacher and I'm afraid that would put potential employers off when they see that.

How do I, in an honest way have my LinkedIn tell employers that I'm not ""just"" a teacher? Feeling really overwhelmed looking at my LinkedIn and am about to throw my laptop across the room with frustration.

So my SO (lets call him Dave) and I are in a long distance relationship and have been for a little while now.  We are about 700 miles apart which is a 2 hour plane ride.  Both of us are college students however he is a bit more financially stable than I am.  Dave has visited me once already, and I'm going to visit him next week.  Our time apart has averaged about 4-5 weeks long (I know thats not a long time compared to some other TRULY long distance couples but its still a struggle), and we've tried to keep up the goal of seeing each other once a month. 

Unfortunately, I'm beginning to struggle a lot with money, and it looks like I won't be able to visit him at all after next week for who knows how long. I've been looking for jobs/paid internships but no success so far (I guess I'll have to try harder). I'm graduating this year which means that I'll be on my own starting May 2014. I'll have to find a job where I would be making enough money to support myself.

Dave said that its not a problem if I can't visit him, because he'll just use his own money to visit me once a month. I honestly would not be able to sleep at night knowing that he would be spending hundreds and hundreds of dollars to see me while I would only be visiting him once. When I told Dave how I felt, he said that he can't be with me if we can't see each other at least once a month (two months at most) because thats not a relationship.

I really love him and I know he loves me too. However I love him too much to put him through all that trouble. His family and friends would eventually resent me, and maybe he will end up eventually resenting me. 

What should I do? Is it bad that I can't meet him halfway? Help!

**TL;DR**: LDR Boyfriend is more financially stable than I am and willing to use his hard earned money to travel 700 miles to see me every month while I can't afford more than a single flight. Bad that I can't do the same for him?"

* Graduated in 2012 from a school consistently ranked in the top ten for computer science worldwide by many different publications
* Interned at one of those famous government physics laboratories and also at Microsoft during my sophomore and junior years of college respectively (can't say what either project was, secrecy/NDA)
* My resume usually gets past the HR screen (probably because Microsoft internship and my school)

The Bad:

* GPA of 2.77 overall, major GPA of 2.85.
* At Microsoft, didn't finish internship project to their satisfaction and did not get a return offer
* At this point, I don't have a specialty: I have strong knowledge in CS theory and know several different languages pretty well (especially Java, C++, and Python)

There were many reasons for this, but it all boils down to enjoying the actual material better in all my CSC/SENG classes rather than my MECH ones.

Now that I'm here, however, I'm slowly realizing the scope of what I need to learn. Not just the stuff from my classes, but on my own as well. Pretty much all I have is an 'intermediate' knowledge of C and Java, as well as basic HTML &amp; CSS. I know half a dozen terminal commands (ls, dir, cd, etc) but I have never used linux for anything important.

What I'm looking for is sort of a track to get me going on being a more well-rounded Software Engineer. As hobbies, I would personally like to get a handle on web stuff (so Javascript and PHP are on the palette), and also perhaps app development.

*EDIT* - took away ""ideal job""

Not too sure what my ideal job would be, but I would like to potentially work for myself in the more distant future.

So what should I start learning? C++? C#? Ruby? .NET? SQL? What tools should I be utilizing? What ODE's are good? What are some good starting projects, or ways for me to practice? 

In school right now, I'm catching up on required courses, but I am taking a course on Algorithms and Data Structures. The problem with everything I've mentioned above is that I do have a fairly full course-load so I can only do these things in my minimal spare time. But hey, my girlfriend just moved away for a 6-month internship, so it looks like I'll have a little more of it.

Bear with me for a minute, y'all have done great things, and I want to tell you how.

My best friend. I've known him since we were 12, bumping Snoop Dogg and The Fugees on his basement stereo. We both grew up in Toronto, but he bounced for university in Hamilton (An hour and a half away), while I stayed in the T Dot. He went on to get a masters in biology and virology, and we still chilled. And as we got older, the music went further, from Snoop to Dre, and then when we were filling our brains with knowledge, it was Common, Kweli, and ATCQ. Though our paths diverged in life and intellectually, the music kept us around each other, reminiscing like listening to T.R.O.Y.

I haven't seen him in two years. 

Life has taken us in different directions - He studied overseas to become a doctor, and came back to Canada to intern at a hospital in Winnipeg (About three thousand kilometres from Toronto). I took a great consulting job not too long ago, in the next province over, about six hours' drive. Two years is not a long time, but when you're used to someone being around in your life like tomatoes in the summer, it's strange to not have them around, like waking up with a twinge in your shoulder that never quite goes away.

Last weekend, I went to see him. It was like meeting a long lost brother. For the entire weekend, we bumped joints I picked up from /r/jazzyhiphop, from Asheru to Jeru The Damaja to Pete Rock and InI. With the music, the edges of our personalities that had grown as we spent time apart, were smoothed over. I felt like I had a brother again. Every now and then 

I just wanted to say thanks, peeps. Y'all did a great thing, even by doing something small.

Feel free to share some good stories around the music you've posted to/heard about from this subreddit.

1njucf,1,2013-10-01,Worried about my own feelings for my girlfriend.,eCh2aa4A,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1njucf/worried_about_my_own_feelings_for_my_girlfriend/,"Alright, here's how I'm going to do this. I'm going to express my problem up-front, and then provide all the background information after as optional further reading.

**Basically**:

I'm feeling conflicted about being with my girlfriend. I start to feel like I don't want to be with her, and that it's ""just not right."" But I don't want to feel this way. She's been a good girlfriend, and I enjoy being with her when I *do* feel right.

I have a shrink. I go in feeling like I'm freaking out about things, and that surely I'm not in love with her and just want out of it, and that it just doens't feel right. I ask him if this is my legitimate position, or if something else is making me feel this way (hoping that he'll tell me that I don't actually have a problem with the relationship itself). He thinks it's a fear/anxiety/attachment thing. I'm instantly relieved, and I'll text, call, or visit her the moment I leave his office and tell her how happy I am to have her. I feel good for a few days before the worry starts eating at me again.

I'm tired of feeling numb, and I'm tired of obsessing over my perceived feelings (or lack thereof) for my girlfriend. I'm tired of thinking about breaking up all the time. I'm tired of feeling like I'm stringing her along when my feelings don't line up the way I want them to. And I sure as hell don't want to end a good relationship just because my worry is tricking me into thinking I don't want it. 

I'm moving into my own place pretty soon, and I know she's going to be spending a lot of time there (most days during the week, probably). I think I'm fretting about that, because of everything I've written here and possibly just because even by itself, that's a big step. 

One other detail: things that remind me of her will often induce a feeling of anxiety, proportional to how worried I already am at the time. I guess that's not anything too significant, but there it is.

Sound familiar to anyone? Any coping strategies? Thanks.

**Background info**

My girlfriend and I started dating at the beginning of 2012. She was my first. I knew from the beginning that she would be leaving for law school, and she told me that would probably be the end of it. I had eight months to change her mind, I thought. Nine months later, one month into her internship, I broke up with her because she wasn't putting time into the relationship. To her credit, she made a ton of progress in being open with her feelings and caring about the relationship. It just didn't go far enough.

I don't remember a lot of how I felt during that nine months, but at certain times I'd have ""worry storms"" (as I call them) where I'd obsess and feel doom over things, often a different thing every day. It wasn't always that way, but there were periods whjere I just wanted out. I'd think of things like the fact that she smoked (like two cigarettes a week) or that she was getting a tattoo (which was totally fine once she actually got it). But near the end, things seemed to be getting good. Then it ended.

Eight months passed. During this time, she had two... flings?... with a couple of guys (not at the same time), driven by her sinking into a deep depression, she tells me. She has bouts of depression now and then, and has attempted suicide in the past (middle school). She's been in therapy, but her insurance didn't cover it. I'm trying to encourage her to go back, and she promises that she will. Anyway, she's been doing really well since that low at the end of last year. 

Meanwhile, in spring of 2013, I started seeing this other girl I met on OkCupid. She's pretty cool, but I have issues with her, and most of them don't seem that major in retrospect. But it didn't really feel right. I would oscillate between feeling good about her to feeling like I wanted out. I felt really conflicted. I got a really simple email from my ex, and she was on my mind a bit. I was staying over at the new girl's place that night, and I had to leave in the middle of the night because I just felt so wrong being there. I wanted to be with my ex instead.

I started talking to my ex for about a week. I'm loving talking to her. I'm talking to her all the time, and the hope for us to be back together is there. All that. Then she tells me what happened during the months we weren't talking. It hurt. Really, really bad. I noped out of that, but told her I cared about her and offered the best advice I could. I went back to New Girl. 

I was with New Girl for a while longer, and would periodically hear from my ex. I was respectful of New Girl and didn't draw out any conversations with Old Girl. But I started feeling conflicted about New Girl again, and eventually broke it off with her. By the time that happened, I was itching to talk to my ex (Old Girl) again. I did. 

We started talking. Eventually we met. I hadn't seen her in about nine months. She was so *beautiful*. It felt so right to be with her again. Over a few weeks, we negotiated. Talked a lot. She's going into the Peace Corps in April of 2014, so that's obviously a concern. Established some boundaries. Discussed how we felt about things. I mulled it over to the best of my ability and took her back. She said she had changed, and wanted another chance.

As far as I can tell, she has changed and has been a very good, attentive, girlfriend.

And I feel conflicted. Not as much at first, but over time. The Peace Corps thing really bothered me, but eventually I kind of sort of made peace with it (lol). Or maybe I didn't. I don't know. I feel weird being around her sometimes. I just want out sometimes.

I have a talk with my shrink every two weeks, he reassures me that I have anxiety and/or attachment issues, and I feel instantly better. I leave his office and text her immediately, telling her how much I love her and how I can't wait to see her again. I feel this way until something sets me off again, like her being in a bad mood or something like that.

**tl;dr**: Read ""basically"" above, then ""background info"" if you need it. "
1njsyr,16,2013-10-01,"My roommate is nice, but so fucking annoying.",[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1njsyr/my_roommate_is_nice_but_so_fucking_annoying/,"He's a friendly guy and I pretend to like him. But I hate him. 

His room is under mine and the noise he makes drives me insane. He's Turkish and plays extremely irritating, droning Turkish music that I try to drown out by playing good music over it. He's also fond of the bad ""Creed."" He laughs manically at whatever about fifty times a day. He sings (irritating, droning Turkish songs - off key.) Sometimes he loses his temper and starts shouting to himself in Turkish - which always makes me jump.

I'll be in the living room, trying to eat my lunch in peace and he'll come in and launch into a twenty minute monologue about the problems he's having with his internship and other boring shit. He's never asked me a single question about myself.

I don't mind sharing food or other supplies and will borrow some milk or bread from my roommates now and again. But he used an entire bottle of expensive olive oil that I bought. Like, the bottle is empty. I don't know what he did with it, but it's gone now. Where did it go???

Tonight he started a long, long Skype conversation at midnight. It's now 1.20 AM. I have to be up at 6 for work. An hour ago I told him I couldn't sleep because of the noise (nicely). He dismissively told me that he would ""be quiter"" then continued at the same volume. He doesn't have an indoor voice - only slight variations of loud. 

The fantasies in which I murder him become more and more elaborate each day.

I'm a 20-year old chilean computer engineering student, and I come to you in search for help. Recently, I sent in my CV to Google, applying for their software engineering internships, and, to my own surprise, was elected to be interviewed through Google Hangouts. 

The thing is, my interview is next week, and I want to prepare as good as possible in the time I have left. Do you any tips you could share with me? Any websites I can practice on (I already know Project Euler)? I've been reviewing the basic algorithms (quicksort, mergesort, binary search, etc) and basic data structures. Is there anything more I should focus on? 

Thanks!

PD: Java is my main language, so if you have any resources on that as well, I'd be eternally grateful."

Some questions... 

1) should I forgo a branding statement and just highlight technical skills: wpm, windows, photoshop, etc?

2) Should I change Placement Student to Intern? Maybe that sounds more professional?

3) How should I indicate that my university graduation will be in the future? Can I just leave it as ""October 2014"", indicating I have a year left on my degree, or ""anticipated graduation?""

Thanks!"

Questions|Answers
:--|:--
[Is there any aspect of Washington's new policy that worries or concerns you? If so, what and why?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1no6uv/i_am_reporter_bob_young_i_cover_marijuana_for_a/cckdzn8?context=5)|One is youth access and concerns that the industry will evolve into something similar to the tobacco industry which tried to appeal to, and addict minors, according to public health advocates. I do think, though, that advocates and officials in Washington state are trying to guard against this in proposed rules, such as allowing no retailer to own more than 3 stores. 
[Do you think the state regulatory system will be able to keep up with the inevitably high demand for legal recreational marijuana? The last news I read suggested production will be fairly limited.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1no6uv/i_am_reporter_bob_young_i_cover_marijuana_for_a/ccke6jq?context=5)|The state is planning for licensing 2 million square feet for pot production, for a yield of 80 metric tons. That's a lot of pot. I should note that's for one year. And see a story I did below with details about the [state's consumption estimate.](http://seattletimes.com/html/localnews/2021890028_potconsumptionxml.html)
[Do you anticipate any major changes to the state's medical marijuana system in the coming months? And do you think current medical marijuana users will switch to using recreational marijuana since it might end up being easier to purchase (no paperwork necessary\)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1no6uv/i_am_reporter_bob_young_i_cover_marijuana_for_a/ccke6jq?context=5)|I do anticipate major changes to medical marijuana in the coming months. I think many current users will migrate to the recreational system. State and city officials believe there are patients who may need certain strains, quantities, and perhaps lower taxes than the recreational system might provide. 
[In Washington state adults are allowed to brew, transport, and share beer without a license. When will legislators make adjustments to 502 to bring it more in line with the reality that marijuana is safer than alcohol? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1no6uv/i_am_reporter_bob_young_i_cover_marijuana_for_a/ccke8mh?context=5)|Probably when the federal government changes marijuana's standing as a Schedule 1 dangerous drug. It's pretty hard for state lawmakers to treat pot just like alcohol when the federal government treats pot very differently than alcohol. Essentially, the feds have created a situation where they say they will let WA and CO go ahead with legalizing as long as we keep it tightly regulated in a way they approve. 
[As a CO resident, this is an issue I've definitely been following pretty closely on our own state. What are some of the major differences between the ways the two CO and WA will be regulating the retail sale of marijuana? Holder and the DOJ have claimed there will be little intervention regarding the retail sale of MJ, do you forsee that being the case, or do you think we'll see a lot more DEA activity in WA and CO? Also, how long do you think it will be before we see full-on legalisation at a national level? Thanks for this AMA, btw!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1no6uv/i_am_reporter_bob_young_i_cover_marijuana_for_a/ccke4lz?context=5)|Here is a [side-by-side chart](http://i.imgur.com/3gbgoON.png?1) comparing WA and CO laws and rules, prepared a little while ago by the Liquor Control Board in WA.
 |As for the DEA, here in WA the top prosectuors have suggested they will go after medical marijuana operations that they think are skirting or violating laws. 
[Do you see Seattle becoming a city like Amsterdam, with coffee shops serving as places to buy pot or will it be more open than that? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1no6uv/i_am_reporter_bob_young_i_cover_marijuana_for_a/ccke4ud?context=5)|I think Seattle, at least initially, will be less open than Amsterdam. The state's ban on indoor smoking and Seattle's intention to enforce the pot law's ban on public consumption make it unlikely that we'll see a thriving pot tourism business for a while. That said, city officials have said they want to find a way for people who don't own homes to consume pot without doing it in view of the general public. This may lead to some sort of cannabis cafes, if they get get around the state indoor smoking ban.
[When you say ""people who don't own homes,"" do you mean people who rent and are not allowed to smoke in their units? Or do you mean people who cannot afford any sort of stable housing?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1no6uv/i_am_reporter_bob_young_i_cover_marijuana_for_a/ccked61?context=5)|I meant, or rather city officials mean ""people who don't own homes."" They've raised concerns that people who rent won't be able to consume in the privacy of their abodes. They don't want these folks to get ticketed for consuming on streets or in parks so they're want to come up with some solution. 
[Do you honestly believe the Seattle Police are going to ticket people for smoking in public?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1no6uv/i_am_reporter_bob_young_i_cover_marijuana_for_a/cckekts?context=5)|Fascinating question. On one hand, they haven't, and you probably know that they handed out Doritos at Hempfest in a clever PR/educational move. But on the other, the mayor and city attorney say they want to enforce the pot law's ban on consuming in general public view. That would require police to write tickets. I get the sense the police will do it if they get clear unambiguous orders to do so. Otherwise, they've got bigger things to worry about, is my sense. 
[I believe the city has tried to create a civil citation -- like a parking ticket -- settled in municipal court. If I write a letter explaining the circumstances of my infraction, do you think they'll lower my fine to court costs?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1no6uv/i_am_reporter_bob_young_i_cover_marijuana_for_a/cckez70?context=5)|You're right about what they trying to do. It would be a $103 civil infraction for public consumption. And yes, Municipal Court has a history of reducing some fines for people who appeal. Not sure what argument they'd warm to in this instance. 
[How keyed in do you think government officials are to the way the tax rate on cannabis will affect the continuation of a black market?  Since people have been buying illegally for so long a large tax rate could make legal cannabis very overpriced relative to the sources they've already been using for a long time.  Are officials concerned about this or is there enough of a ""Sin Tax"" contingent from the less liberal parts of the states that the tax rate may end up prohibitively high?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1no6uv/i_am_reporter_bob_young_i_cover_marijuana_for_a/ccke5c3?context=5)|I think state officials are acutely aware of the complex interaction between supply-price-youth-access and illicit market. Generally, low state-system prices (and low taxes) means greater use and more youth access, but less illicet market. High taxes and higher prices means less overall use and youth access but a healthier illicit market. The market will ultimately determine prices, but state officials hope to arrive at a sweet spot in taxes and prices that produces a healthy legal system without fueling youth access and addiction. 
[My mom's 90th birthday party is Dec 1, which I understand is the date recreational marijuana becomes legal in WA. She'd like to try it but won't until it's legal. How can I get her some to try at her party?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1no6uv/i_am_reporter_bob_young_i_cover_marijuana_for_a/cckeh1v?context=5)|First, adult possession of up to an ounce became legal last Dec. 6. Since then we've been in a weird limbo where it's legal to possess but not legal to sell. I presume people continue to get their marijuana products from medical dispensaries or from illicit dealers. (Dec. 1 this year is when state rules for a recreational system must be in place.) You or your mom could get medical authorization, or find someone to sell you illicit weed.
[Do you think marijuana will ever be decriminalized on a federal level?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1no6uv/i_am_reporter_bob_young_i_cover_marijuana_for_a/ccke4et?context=5)|I think it is inevitable, much like repeal of the 18th Amendment prohibiting liquor. But I don't think it will happen for a while. There's not huge impetuts in Congress. Only 20 states now have medical marijuana. Many in the reform movement think that if California approves legalization in 2016, it will effectively be game-over for prohibition. The state's top pot consultant, Mark Kleiman, has said he thinks we'll have national legalization or decriminalization in Hillary Clinton's second term. I've got several questions about assumptions therein. 
[Will there still be dispensaries for those of us who use medicinal cannabis?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1no6uv/i_am_reporter_bob_young_i_cover_marijuana_for_a/ccke3sn?context=5)|That remains to be seen. State officials are now working on recommendations about what to do with medical patients when the recreational system opens. 
[I've heard that the State will be leaving the MMJ system alone for some time. They don't have time to put together the recreational system, overhaul the medical one, and deal with the protests that would occur. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1no6uv/i_am_reporter_bob_young_i_cover_marijuana_for_a/cckf04m?context=5)|The state budget requires 3 state agencies to come up with recommendations for the future of MMJ by Jan. 1, 2014. What those changes may be, and when they'll take effect remains to be seen. But it seems logical that the state would want to move quickly because they want the legal system to succeed and are concerned that a parallel, largely unregulated and untaxed medical system could undermine the recreational system. Some of the first ideas for recommendations have surfaced. They include reducing amounts that MMJ patients can possess (now 1.5 pounds), and taxing MMJ, but at a reduced rate, and tightening the requirements around getting a medical authorization, i.e. higher level of proof of the qualifying conditions.
[If it's limited to 334 retails stores, what happens to the current crop that are up and running now?  I ask this assuming there are more than 334 now because it seems like they're on every corner.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1no6uv/i_am_reporter_bob_young_i_cover_marijuana_for_a/cckecoh?context=5)|If by current crop you mean medical access points, or dispensaries, it's unclear what will happen to them. I think many will become recreational stores. I think others may remain as medical operations. But to be clear, any current dispensary owners would have to apply, undergo background checks, and get licensed by the state before they could become recreational outlets. 
[I'm a reporter in nearby Issaquah covering I-502 developments. Do you share my concern that aggressive state tax will keep the trade largely in the black market? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1no6uv/i_am_reporter_bob_young_i_cover_marijuana_for_a/ccke8lk?context=5)|I do not, although that's just my opinion and not supported by facts.  I think many people will be willing to pay the taxes (25 percent on growers, processors and retailers) in order to buy legal, quality-tested weed. To be clear, many users are price sensitive. The state's consultants stress that most users are not college-educated, and not necessarily affluent, thus sensitive to prices. But they also point out that the growers' wholesale prices and markups could dramatically effect prices. They're proposed scenarios in which retail price could be as low as $6 per gram -- but also scenarios where it could be $17/per gram -- all depending on markups and wholesale prices. 
[Thanks for your answer, Bob. I had not seen those proposed scenarios, only covered the 25 percent taxed at the three levels of consumer production.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1no6uv/i_am_reporter_bob_young_i_cover_marijuana_for_a/cckhgc8?context=5)|The state consultants did one long study that covered those. If you're really interested email me (byoung@seattletimes.com) and I can try and get you a copy. The principal author is Jon Caulkins of Carnegie-Mellon if you want to ask the state Liquor Control Board for it. It's a public record. 
[Is it currently legal for me to give someone else some weed in Washington?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1no6uv/i_am_reporter_bob_young_i_cover_marijuana_for_a/cckelsx?context=5)|It's my understanding that you cannot give weed to someone. 
[Maybe not legally, but ethically and practically you absolutely can. My question is: what has been your most profound philosophical insight on cannabis?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1no6uv/i_am_reporter_bob_young_i_cover_marijuana_for_a/cckfxz2?context=5)|Not sure if you mean most profound insight about cannabis, or under the influence of cannabis. I'll assume it's the former, which is a great question, though it's hard to pick one insight. I remember attending a meeting at which the Liquor Control Board has convened testing experts from around the country. And as they threw around terms like ""flame ionization diagnosis"" I realized this is rocket science in many respects. There are a lot of really smart people working in different aspects of marijuana. And there's still a vast amount of science to understand, such as why do some chemicals in the plant work the way they do. I was quite moved by the story featured by CNN's Sanjay Gupta of the little girl, Charlotte, who suffered from Dravet's Syndrome which caused her tiny body to be wracked by several hundred convulsions a week, convulsions that would ultimately kill her. None of the conventional treatments her parents sought worked. As a last resort, her conservative parents turned to marijuana, and it seems to have worked. (btw, Charlotte gets pot in a gooey form that she takes orally; she doesn't smoke.) Charlotte now suffers only a few convulsions a week. Her physical and mental development has returned, if you will, and she's now almost on par with her twin sister. That is profound, to me.
[Are you looking for interns or other knowledgeable folks regarding Cannabis? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1no6uv/i_am_reporter_bob_young_i_cover_marijuana_for_a/cckevap?context=5)|We're always looking for journalism interns. We're not specifically looking for an intern on the pot beat. Though you should feel free to contact me about your expertise. I'm always looking to improve my knowledge. 
[The level for DUI is zero for those under 21.  How long does active THC last in the blood in chronic users if they quit?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1no6uv/i_am_reporter_bob_young_i_cover_marijuana_for_a/cckf3w1?context=5)|I'm sorry I don't know how long THC remains active after one stops using. 
[As far as you know, are you the first reporter at any mainstream newspaper in the world with a marijuana beat? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1no6uv/i_am_reporter_bob_young_i_cover_marijuana_for_a/cckj7fz?context=5)|No, I'm not the first. My predecessor Jonathan Martin worked the beat for a couple years here at the Times, through voter approval of Initiative 502. BTW, in reply to comments below about how long active THC stays in your blood, Jonathan reported on the DUI standard and debate around it during last year's campaign. Based on reporting I did earlier this year, neither the city of Seattle nor King County were prosecuting an increased number of pot DUIs under the new 5 nanograms of active THC per ml of blood. We will periodically check back on that, but I think the real test will come after the state-regulated stores are open. 
[As always, what is your opinion on people abusing the system?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1no6uv/i_am_reporter_bob_young_i_cover_marijuana_for_a/cckfd5q?context=5)|Which system are you referring to?
[I mean, abusing Medical marihuana as a general.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1no6uv/i_am_reporter_bob_young_i_cover_marijuana_for_a/cckg5xr?context=5)|I think some abuse the system. How many is impossible to say, especially since we don't know how many medical patients we have in WA. We are the only state, as I recall, to not maintain a patient registry. I suspect there are many people who use MMJ for ""wellness"" -- insomnia, anxiety, digestive problems and more -- that are technically not qualifying conditions under state law. So are they abusing the system if they use it for their health? I think it's a tough question.  I don't think the medical patients help their cause -- and may feed some claims of abuse -- by using strains with names such as Chernobyl, AK-47 and Green Crack. Who would name a medicine ""Chernobyl""? And who would argue the government should never dare tax ""Green Crack""? 
[I really think legislators dropped the ball on this part. For now MMJ can still grow their own, I can only hope this will be applied to everyone eventually.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1no6uv/i_am_reporter_bob_young_i_cover_marijuana_for_a/cckh7ct?context=5)|Again, I think it's fear of the feds that keeps the state from allowing small home-grows. That, and the desire to collect tax revenues from the legal retail stores. 
[It's not legal advice. It is the position of the Seattle Police Department.  Don't sell to people under the age of 21.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1no6uv/i_am_reporter_bob_young_i_cover_marijuana_for_a/cckfau7?context=5)|They stressed not to sell to anyone under 21 because it is still a felony. Initiative 502 did not change that. And whatever they implied, it is still not legal to sell recreational weed in WA. You must be state-licensed to do that, and licenses won't be granted until December or January.

1nohha,1,2013-10-03,[Build Help] Is BaPC suitable for a small business with a budget? Or is buying better?,[deleted],buildapc,https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/1nohha/build_help_is_bapc_suitable_for_a_small_business/,"I'm currently working for a small non-profit organization. We're trying to update our Pentium 4 PCs with XP Home on them. It's time for an upgrade.

I spoke with my boss and he was willing to commit to buying several new Dells and several Mac Minis, I'd say maybe 3-5 new computers. Despite me being a huge Apple fan, I stopped him a bit and told him I could possibly find a better and cheaper solution for him. 

While I love Apple, they lack the support for Lao language that Windows 8 has. We're a non-profit that deals in Lao, Thai, and English and Apple is the worst when it comes to Lao language support, it's non-existant, so I want to push for Windows 8.

Since he was ready to commit to buying Mac Minis ($600), I figured I would try to build something a bit cheaper, maybe even around $3-400.

But is it a smart move? They currently pay $200 a month for an IT guy that doesn't really do much (well, probably because we pay him so little). It isn't a big business, there is only 3 full-time workers, two full-time interns, a few volunteers, and part-time consultants and interns that usually bring their own laptops. What I'm getting at is that there might not be a huge problem with support for these PCs if I were to build them.

Just asking what /r/buildapc thinks or if they have any input/experience on the matter."

1nodkq,0,2013-10-03,"I don't know if CS is the right major for me, but I also don't know if it can lead me there",I_am_Andrew_Ryan,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1nodkq/i_dont_know_if_cs_is_the_right_major_for_me_but_i/,"Hi there, I'll start with why I'm currently a CS major as a freshman.

**I have no idea what the hell I want to do with my life.**

I didn't even want to go to college till about junior year of high school. I wanted to join the army, see the world, meet interesting people, have the government pay for my education, and be a total badass. 
Then, with the end of high school looming over me, I realized multiple things.

-I'm not physically adept, at all. 

-I hate being ordered around by a system of bureaucratic nonsense. 

-And I want a family to come home to every day. 

Well now what do I do? I've never thought about what I want to do beyond ""what I want to be when I grow up is batman/an astronaut/a firefighter because they don't need to learn math"" when I was little. 

**I chose CS because

A. I like computers a lot. 

B. I'm good at using computers, I spent a summer working at a repair store because I knew how they worked and I liked fixing them.

C. This apparently pays well or something?

D. Game design is something I'm interested in.**

These may or may not be the correct reasons for choosing CS. Unfortunately, I don't know if CS can also be a stepping stone into another degree that is perfect for me. 

**Currently, I'm learning the basics.** C++ coding for dummies. ""hello world"" and all that stuff. Right now? I'm liking it a whole lot. I spend time on a tool I know very well, formulating ideas and coming up with a solution to a question using my skills. The problem I'm having is, I don't know if going deeper into this major there will be a moment when I say ""nope. this isn't actually what I thought it was going to be when I started."" Recently I spent hours on a problem, going over and over in my mind why I thought this was the right code, only to have the right answer staring me in the face.

**I'm terrible at math.**

No actually, I'm amazing at geometry and physics.Those were my best classes in high school made an A+ in both. The worst? pre-calc, and algebra. I failed algebra the first time, and I barely got a B- with pre-cal my senior year. CS is math based. This slightly worries me. I've learned I'm really good at solving real-world problems and physical dimensions and the like, but formulas and such are the devil.

I know that getting a CS degree is nowhere near actual coding and things. I worked as an unpaid intern in a computer repair store, and I fared either on par, or sometimes even better than the guy next to me with A+ certs. Degree != proficiency. I want to know how I can remedy this. 

I've heard before that computers are the biggest and fastest growing industry right now. I can believe it. But how does that affect me at all? Can I get a good job more easily? Can I be paid on a higher scale than my classmates upon graduation because of the major I chose? What are the real numbers involved?

**I also am very interested in game design**. Yes, yes I know this is a very popular misconception in CS, that you will learn to be a game programmer. I know that CS is not the straight line to game programming, but I also don't know what to do with computer science as a major. I think I would enjoy learning how to program, and learning how to use programming to solve problems. But if I could be a part of a game? That would be the best thing in the world. Can I get there through CS or a simliar degree?

Seen Indie Game: The Movie? Tommy Referenes. He's both what I want to be, and what I don't want to be. He's an awesome programmer, knows how to make a beautifully crafted game technically, but has no social life and is chronically depressed because it takes a lot of work and involves constant worry about whether this will bug or this code isn't executing properly. I want to be a creator, behind the scenes of something that is almost universally well-acclaimed to be top-notch mechanically. I don't want to be working day and night, not knowing whether or not I'll be able to make money off of these hours and hours of work. I understand that these wishes are a bit hopeful, and they are. I'm just looking for something good, not something perfect.

 This movie sort of solidified within me the exact reason and motivation behind my desire to work in the gaming industry.

**I want to affect people.**

**I want to make something**, be it a AAA blockbuster like Bioshock Infinite, or a slightly unknown indie title like any of the fantastic games on Steam, and have it affect people. Speak to them in one way or another. Be art, be fun, be challenging or innovative. One of the most crucial points in my life was during junior year of high school. That was when I decided that the military was not for me, I want a beautiful wife, beautiful kids, and a comfortable home to raise them in and be an all-american-white-picket-fence-homeowner. I also broke up with my shallow girlfriend I had at the time, and started dating my then best friend and now girlfriend of 2+ years. What stood out to me about that time among all of these major points was the game Bioshock. I know it's not the best game ever, I know that its watered down System Shock 2. But to me at the time, it was art. It was beautifully crafted, amazingly executed, and I wanted to get to know it intimately. I knew then that video games will from then on be something I can appreciate for something more than just a pass-time, but can be appreciated as a better medium than any other entertainment (possibly barring books, that shit's awesome) 

**I think CS is the place to start.** I decided to just start with programming, and go from there. If I end up coding software for British Petroleum? That's okay with me, I need to support a family. If I develop the next Super Meat Boy? I honestly hope I make good money doing it, but I know I will be at the very least happy that I did something in the world of games.


TL;DR: read the bold, I'm in CS right now, I don't know if its the best for me because of my failings in math classes before, but I know I could maybe do programming. Mostly I want to work on software, and more specifically games. I just want to know where I can go, what my options are, and what I can expect.


So I suppose my questions are, 

-what the hell am I doing wrong (because I'm sure I am doing something wrong)

- What can I do that is right,

- and how do I do what I want to do within the system of education that is before me."
1noa1n,0,2013-10-03,"I'm a rookie looking for a first Motorcycle, where do I look?",[deleted],motorcycles,https://www.reddit.com/r/motorcycles/comments/1noa1n/im_a_rookie_looking_for_a_first_motorcycle_where/,"Basically, I just want to know how to find a good deal in North Carolina. Here's a list of things I want from the bike to direct your advice more efficiently. I want to know how to bargain effectively, what to look for, and what a good low (read:not too high for a rookie) maintenance bike would be. I'll add background in the end if you're interested/in case it'll help.

**Requirements:**

1.) Under $4K, 500-750CC Cruiser

2.) In North Carolina, within a 40 minute drive of Davidson. I won't go further unless it's a really good deal.

3.) No older than 2001

4.) Shaft Driven, Liquid cooled. This is more about having a bike that'll last. It's negotiable if you can thoroughly convince me against it.

**Preferred:** These are things we both agreed on that would make a perfect bike. If I'm paying the full 4K budget, it would have to have all of these checked.

1.) Sissy bar+passenger seat, so that when I'm confident in about a month or so, I can bring a friend riding.

2.) Budget is 4K but I would love to have it be sub 3K.

3.) Model Year younger than 2006

4.) Any shade of red, possibly with white or black. Or any of the darker shades of green, possibly with black/white

5.) If you think you have a lead that I'll be interested in (I'm still relatively new here so I don't know how this works really), just telling you ahead of time. On principle I will not ride a bike that has noticeable amounts of any shade of Yellow, Purple, Blue, or Brown. 

**Experience:**

I took my MSF course in late July this year (2013). I learned incredibly quickly and apart from a little line-crossing in the tight maneuvers part of the test I had perfect scoring, plus perfect in the written test. The week after I spent a couple days riding my friend's 1999 Suzuki Intruder (1500 CC, 800+ lbs). I weigh 135 and was riding in NYC, but I handled the bike fairly well and without incident. Haven't ridden in a month, but I do ride my bicycle alot so that kinda helps?

**Background**

A good friend/relative is letting me pick his next bike. We have similar views on what a nice bike is/runs like/looks like, so he gave me a budget of 4K to get one. I take this as more of his last test to me, testing my ability to find good deals on my own since he can easily find his own bike and would be able to do so more easily than me. He paid for my MSF course and basically kindled my love for motorcycles, he's taught me everything I know so far so it's not a stretch to think that this would be a kind of a final test to kick off the training wheels. Obviously I'm going to talk to him before pulling the trigger on a deal. That said, to me, the 4K would be stretched to a rreeeeally good deal and/or the perfect bike. I don't want to use the whole budget on a bike that's just good enough/close enough. 3K would be more the ceiling if it isn't ""perfect"" and/or close. He's been riding for years, so I want to get something that he could enjoy but also something that would still be fun to ride once I'm more experienced. I have alot of room to practice on roads (I'm currently in a small college town) and alot of space to really run the bike once I'm confident in my skills. My friend and I are from New York, but I'm in NC for school. The plan is I get his bike down here, ride it and practice on the practically empty roads, and then he'll drive down, put the bike on a trailer, and I'll drive us and the bike to NY so he can have it for the spring. In the summer if I'm not in the city, he might let me take either the new bike or the Intruder as transportation for any internship I may land. If I'm in the city, we'll go on rides together. He paid for my MSF course and basically fired up my interest in riding, so I really want to get a good deal for him."

[John, can you please yell at me? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1nnxpm/i_am_jon_taffer_host_of_bar_rescue_and/cckbt9t?context=5)|Go fuck yourself!  :)
[If Obama asked you to rescue Congress.  What would the game plan be?  They already SHUT IT DOWN.  So, what's your next move?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1nnxpm/i_am_jon_taffer_host_of_bar_rescue_and/cckbex8?context=5)|If I was president, I would get in a car, I would drive to the Capitol breaking all precedent, I would walk up the steps, walk into a conference room, and sit leadership down.  And I wouldn't leave until the deal was done.  Rather than posturing and excuses, I would find a solution.
[Do you ever blink?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1nnxpm/i_am_jon_taffer_host_of_bar_rescue_and/cckbfav?context=5)|If you're speaking physically, yes.  If you're speaking mentally, no. 
[Hi Jon,  I’m a big fan of your show and I thank you for doing this AMA.  These days, with all the reality shows on air, it’s hard to distinguish which segments are scripted and which are not.  Can you give us some insight as to how much of the show is legitimate?  Are the owners/employees of the bars really that stupid/ignorant or is it just an act?  Also, when and how do you install those hidden cameras so that the staff is unaware?  Thanks!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1nnxpm/i_am_jon_taffer_host_of_bar_rescue_and/cckbhhg?context=5)|Well I will answer in the order it happens.
 |The cameras are installed a day to 1.5 days before I get there.  Yes, everybody knows the cameras are there.  But amazingly, after a day, they just start to forget and people start acting normal again.
 |Next, Bar Rescue is shot in real time. Day one is my recon, Day two is training and stress test, day three is training and tasting, day four is remodel (actually 36 hours so I can put that to rest) and then day five is when I reveal and we open.
 |None of Bar Rescue is scripted, ever.  We create situations like the stress test, a staff meeting, a meeting with the owners, and those situations of course I work into my thing, but nothing is scripted, ever.
 |As far as how do we find this people? Somebody says ""yes, Mr Taffer"" for 45 minutes, that's not going to make great tv, so if that's the bar I chose I would be a fool.
 |We have over 1,000 bars submit to be rescued.  We look at them all, and we pick what we think will be compelling.  We pick what we feel will be compelling stories, interesting people, interesting scenarios... In the end, the Bar Rescue is more about people and storytelling than it is about bars.  
[• What was your favorite bar to rescue and why?  • Can you discuss some of the off-screen interactions you have had with bar owners who were ungrateful for the work you did for them?  • Do you ever return to any bars you have rescued?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1nnxpm/i_am_jon_taffer_host_of_bar_rescue_and/cckbem0?context=5)|Off-screen interactions:  The thing about Bar Rescue is it's absolutely real.  Not one word is scripted. So if there's no camera present, I don't talk to anyone.  None of the employees or owners have any contact with me off-camera.  Nothing happens off camera, and nothing is scripted. Period, END OF DISCUSSION. What you see is what you get in Bar Rescue.
[My friends and I have been planning to do a Bar Rescue bar tour once we graduate next year, and we would love to see you at one of them! Thanks again for the AMA. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1nnxpm/i_am_jon_taffer_host_of_bar_rescue_and/cckbem0?context=5)|Do I ever return: Sure.  I will pop in one or two to say hello when I am in those towns.  As intense as Bar Rescue gets, with the exception of one or two times, it almost always ends positively where I have a great relationship with the owners and employees.  In fact, I'm talking to the network about doing a ""back to the bar"" kind of show where I go back and visit with cameras.
 |Favorite bar to rescue: Already answered.  Spirits of Bourbon was one of my favorites in regards to results, but favorite bar based on individuals, I would choose the Alexander Family, which owned Characters which became Moonrunners.  And that was the episode where the brother used to beat the hell out of the sister (mentally) and the sister was always crying and the family dynamic was a nightmare, and we changed the entire family dynamic, and it was a very powerful, emotional things to see.  It was one of my personal favorite episodes because I felt really bad for the younger sister.  But changing a dysfunctional family into one that loved each other was one of my greatest accomplishments, I think.
[Hey Jon big fan, who would be the first person you would like to encounter in a butt funnel?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1nnxpm/i_am_jon_taffer_host_of_bar_rescue_and/cckbuwl?context=5)|A butt funnel is something I invented about 25 years ago.  And it's one of the greatest tools of nightclub interaction I've ever done.  It's a narrow entryway to a dance floor.  It's wide enough to cause 2 people to go through it at the same time, but it's narrow enough that it causes the two people to have to turn sideways to get through it. So to answer the dance floor, the two of you are staring at each other in the face about 18 inches apart, stimulating interaction and eye contact.  First it's the butt funnel, next it's a drink, then it's breakfast.
 |My wife! ONLY my wife.  I've been with Nicole for 16 years and I would still be excited to go through a butt funnel with her. 
[What Bar Rescue are you most proud of either in terms of the changes you made to the bar or the changes you made in the owner's life?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1nnxpm/i_am_jon_taffer_host_of_bar_rescue_and/cckbfs6?context=5)|Well I think the one I'm most proud of for both would be Spirits On Bourbon in New Orleans.  I looked at one of the owners, and called him a failure, twice.  Now, their revenues are up $100,000 dollars a month.  The barbershop chair is one of the most photographed attractions on Bourbon Street.  And lastly, Steve and Brad (the two owners) just bought a warehouse to stock all their souvenir cups.  And people should check out their Facebook page, which is fun: [Link to www.facebook.com](https://www.facebook.com/SpirtsOnBourbon)
[Our question is:  Which bar rescue was the most difficult one for you?  Also, what is your drink of choice?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1nnxpm/i_am_jon_taffer_host_of_bar_rescue_and/cckbf8q?context=5)|Pirates comes to mind because it was so bizarre, and uncomfortable every minute I was there.  I can't really say this about any other bar that I've rescued, but I did not like those people, candidly.  And I did not enjoy one minute that I was there.  It was my most difficult in that regard.  The other one was Headhunters, where the owner did not pay the employees and was such a joke that I wound up rescuing the bar for the employees, not him.  I gave the employees a choice, if I would rescue the bar or get them jobs down the street.  And had they chosen the second option, I would have walked out of there, I was prepared to do that.  The third was Zanzabar in Denver.  That was an Israeli military owner that I got in a physical altercation with.  He called my chef ""fat boy."" And I went at him and we had a fight.  And Ami was one tough cookie.  Four days later, he called me an angel and hugged me when I left.  And that's the beauty of Bar Rescue. 
[Love your show. My family owns an Italian restaurant/catering business in Cleveland. I will probably inherit more and more responsibility/ownership as I get older. Any tips for the future? We had to close a location recently but still have 2 catering locations and 1 restaurant up and running. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1nnxpm/i_am_jon_taffer_host_of_bar_rescue_and/cckbprc?context=5)|You have the responsibility to keep a family legacy going, not just a business.  It's always managing costs that will keep the business going.  My suggestion is, don't change what your family has done, just make it better, make it deeper, make it more relevant.  Also, one more suggestion: go to work for a chain restaurant for a couple of months.  The problem with a lot of family businesses is that the only experience they have is within that one business.  Go to a chain who's really good at systems, procedures, controls, get exposed to it for a few months.  Then go back to your family business and you will see so many opportunities to make it better. 
[Jon,](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1nnxpm/i_am_jon_taffer_host_of_bar_rescue_and/cckbfhy?context=5)|He's a great guy.  He is a great guy.  I must say that I was told (and I believe it) that he had never seen Bar Rescue before he met me that day.
[Is Big Cat from Barstool Sports the best guy you have ever met? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1nnxpm/i_am_jon_taffer_host_of_bar_rescue_and/cckbfhy?context=5)|And I must admit, when I cut loose on him, there were moments I thought he was genuinely pissed... still might be. 
[Hey Jon, thanks for doing this AMA! I'm a huge fan of Bar Rescue. I was lucky enough to meet you back in July at On The Rocks Las Vegas. (Such an amazing event!\)  EDIT: Found a picture of us in Vegas! Link to i.imgur.com.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1nnxpm/i_am_jon_taffer_host_of_bar_rescue_and/cckbsn5?context=5)|I think I remember meeting you!  You really should come to the Nightclub &amp; Bar Convention in Las Vegas, from March 24-26. [Link to www.ncbshow.com](http://www.ncbshow.com)
[I mentioned a startup company I recently founded called BreathAdvisor. In an effort to break away from the hokey breathalyzer machine reputation, we have created the world's most accurate breathalyzer kiosk designed to save lives.  We cap the readings to deter people from using BreathAdvisor as a game, and users can even request a cab directly from the kiosk. (We’ve already seen this save bar staff time.\)  We've had great feedback so far, but I was wondering… **As a bar owner, would you have any concerns that we haven’t addressed?**](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1nnxpm/i_am_jon_taffer_host_of_bar_rescue_and/cckbsn5?context=5)|But here's my concern.  Sometimes these devices are used as contests to stimulate drinking, not to keep it responsible.  In essence, who can fail quicker amongst friends.  That's concerning to me.  Also, the ultimate responsibility lies with the employees and management, not with a device.  I would be concerned that the presence of that device moves responsibility away from the people.  Thirdly, if somebody fails on that device and does not get in a cab and drives home and gets hurt, and in theory, somebody from the bar should have known that, the bar would be more liable with the machine than with not since the customer was proven drunk before they left.  So I have a bunch of concerns.  But even though I think I'm always right, there are one or two times when I haven't been.  
[Jon,  I was proud that your show did a gay bar, are you going to do any in the future, were you worried about any controversy? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1nnxpm/i_am_jon_taffer_host_of_bar_rescue_and/cckbpxt?context=5)|No I wasn't worried about any controversy.  The gay community is a very big part of the bar and hospitality industry.  To me a gay bar is no different than walking into a rock n' roll bar or a hip hop bar.  Like any bar, I need to be tough, and show the staff that I respect them and that in fact, I am fighting for them.  I respect and fight just as hard whether they are gay or straight, I didn't feel any different, and if you watch the episode, I certainly didn't act any different.  
[Jon you are legend. I heard you had a role in developing NFL Sunday Ticket? To what extent is this true?  Loved your video on barstool last week. Viva. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1nnxpm/i_am_jon_taffer_host_of_bar_rescue_and/cckbkc3?context=5)|This is a long story so I'm going to try to tell it short.  In the mid-90s I was hired by a satellite company that wanted to buy sports programming from the NFL and sell it in other cities.  It was called ""out of market sports programming.""  My company was hired to put together the business plan, financial models, and programming model for the bar industry.  The satellite company went to the NFL to license the rights, the NFL chose to do it themselves, and put me on the advisory board of NFL enterprises.  I then worked with the NFL to finalize, create and roll out what is now known as Sunday Ticket.  So I did not invent Sunday ticket.  The idea pre-existed me.  I was a creator of the Sunday Ticket product.  
[1\) Have you ever considered taking a protege under your wing? If so, let me know how to apply. I'm 100% serious.  2\) If congress was under a stress test right now, how many rolls of stickers do you think would have been put on the congressmen?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1nnxpm/i_am_jon_taffer_host_of_bar_rescue_and/cckbfpv?context=5)|1)  You know, I have, and we do bring interns in.  As a matter of fact we are looking at starting an intern program in Las Vegas.   People can send resumes to us to info@tafferdynamics.com and we often can't respond to everyone but we certainly look.  We are not actively hiring, but there are projects where we do involve interns and students and people like that.  I see it as a personal responsibility to pass my knowledge down, so doing things like that is very important.  2) I think I would have gotten past the stickers at this point! I thinK I would have fired them all.  If you watch Bar Rescue, you know I'm not into posturing or ego.  I would have shot them down individually, not the government.  And candidly, I don't know why it's wrong to call a politician an ass on national tv.  Or a liar.  I don't understand why it's politically incorrect if they are.  I would call them out.  And I think they would think twice if they knew they were going to be called out in embarrassing ways. 
[What is the weirdest theme or gimmick that you've ever seen in a bar?  If that's not clear, maybe an example would help. An Irish Pub would be an example of a theme or type that is fairly normal. What is a super-weird one that you've seen?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1nnxpm/i_am_jon_taffer_host_of_bar_rescue_and/cckbeob?context=5)|Well I can to speak to one that I created many years ago. Midget tossing as a bar promotion.  That was pretty darn strange.  I've also given away breast enlargements in nightclubs.  We hung the ""before"" and ""after"" brassieres in the men's room.  The girls that lost got ""booby"" prizes.  
[Have you ever seen a bar that was unable to be rescued? Due to location, popularity, and other circumstances?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1nnxpm/i_am_jon_taffer_host_of_bar_rescue_and/cckbqr7?context=5)|I can rescue ANY BAR.  I can't rescue any person.  From a professional psychologist standpoint, changing human behavior takes 21 cycles.  Quitting smoking takes 21 days, changing something at work takes 21 shifts, learning to exercise takes 21 visits.  That is the science of human behavior.  In Bar Rescue, I have 5 days.  Steve, the owner of Headhunters, by the middle of day two I knew he could not be rescued.  I was prepared to walk out.  The staff asked me to stay.  If that guy stays in business, then it makes no sense to me, the only reason is because of Bar Rescue because he does not care about people. 
[What is the best advice to someone who wants to open up a bar?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1nnxpm/i_am_jon_taffer_host_of_bar_rescue_and/cckbntr?context=5)|1) First have a cool dad like you.  Next, money money money.  Opening a bar is tough.  The business is NOT inherently profitable.  You have to make it profitable.  First-time bar owners sometimes run out of money before they learn how to make it profitable.  If you had the money to make it through your mistakes, you have a much better chance of finding your profitability.  Football coaches say they never lose a football game they only run out of time.  Bars don't fail, they just run out of money.
[It seems like the commonality behind every failing bar is a failing owner. Have you ever been to a bar where that has not been the case?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1nnxpm/i_am_jon_taffer_host_of_bar_rescue_and/cckbntr?context=5)|2) Yes.  Absolutely.  And I can't wait for everybody to see it: on October 27 is our very special episode, the Hurricane Sandy episode of Bar Rescue.  The episode is called ""Hurricane Jon versus Hurricane Sandy.""  In this episode, I take winner owners who had a very successful business that was robbed from them by Superstorm Sandy, and we do our most aggressive, most complete, biggest bar rescue EVER.  And if anybody misses it, they are going to hear from me. 
[One of the most appalling things on the show is how dirty and unsafe the conditions in most of the kitchens are. Without actually going into the kitchen what are some things customers should look for which can indicate clean and safe food preparation? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1nnxpm/i_am_jon_taffer_host_of_bar_rescue_and/cckc3y1?context=5)|It's funny that you would ask this question, because on 10/7 I am doing a guest spot on the Rachael Ray show and she asked me that very same question.  And I answer it in detail there, but the fact of the matter is there three or four things you can look at when you go through the front door.  
 |Is the back bar clean and organized? Does it look like it's detailed?
 |Are the furniture, carpets and tabletops clean and detailed?
 |When you look at a menu, is it clean, professional and detailed?
 |Here's the premise: a restaurant with a dirty dining room will NEVER have a clean kitchen.
 |A bar where the back bar is a mess will never have a clean, organized kitchen.  So scope in the front, and you'll know what you got in the back. 
[Obviously, this was on Gordon Ramsay's turf, but if you had to walk into Amy's Baking Company, do you think you could have rescued them?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1nnxpm/i_am_jon_taffer_host_of_bar_rescue_and/cckbq1k?context=5)|I love Gordon.  He led the way for creating the format and style of the show that myself and Chef Robert Irvine (who's a dear friend of mine by the way) followed.  But there's a big difference between them and me.  I'm not a chef, I'm a businessman.  I go out to businesses and ownership in a different way because I'm coming from a different place than they do.  I'm in awe of the work that Gordon and Robert both do, as I know they respect mine.   That said,  I believe I can fix anything.  And if I didn't believe that, I wouldn't be who I am. 
[Is it weird that I love your show even though I don't drink?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1nnxpm/i_am_jon_taffer_host_of_bar_rescue_and/cckbrz3?context=5)|A sober mind is our most inquiring viewer.  
[Jon,  I'm always amazed by the bar owners that refuse to budge from what's obviously been a losing strategy for a long time.  They are deep in debt and on the verge of closing, yet refuse to change the business name or image.  Surely these people have seen the show in past seasons and see that what you do does work.  Why are they so resistant to change? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1nnxpm/i_am_jon_taffer_host_of_bar_rescue_and/cckbee6?context=5)|Some people are not the brightest bulbs in the box, candidly.  And they make thousands of bad decisions that got me there that day.  And they knew they were failing before I got there, and knew there were failing when I got there, and sometimes I can inspire them and get them to change.  But on some occasions, I can't. 
[When there is the recap after the show, and it says that sales went up by say 15%, while it was better than it was previously, how can that possibly be a big enough change given the amount of debt?

Watched since episode one, and also follow on twitter! :\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1nnxpm/i_am_jon_taffer_host_of_bar_rescue_and/cckbq5q?context=5)|What the show doesn't say, because we  don't provide so many details so it's boring, sales could be up by 15%, beverage costs could be DOWN by 50%, or the food costs DOWN by 50%.  So it's the increase in revenue and the lowering in costs that allows them to stay open.   Also, that update is typically only a few weeks after we left.  Their business tends to keep growing after that update.

As I understand it, and I don't track it full time so I may be off by one, maybe two, we've done 49 episodes and I believe 5 have closed.  And I might add in every case the owner told the camera that they were going to run out of money in a month or two.

[Jon, I know you have been adamant about changing bars around the United States, but have you thought about coming into Canada, perhaps even the more populated parts of Southern Ontario? Just curious because the work you do with some of the bars you work with is really top class. Have you ever thought about taking the show to Canada for an episode or two, and if so, which place(s\) did you have in mind?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1nnxpm/i_am_jon_taffer_host_of_bar_rescue_and/cckbrzn?context=5)|Actually we have talked about going there with Bar Rescue, so all my Canadian friends know I've worked up in Canada for the past 20 years quite significantly.  I've worked with the Roadhouse in Calgary, I've worked in Toronto at Prince George, Nova Scotia, Halifax, Monkton, and many other places.  And I look forward to getting up there with Bar Rescue cameras one of these days. 
[, Thanks for doing this AMA! Me and my dad are big fans of the show.  Second, I have a question.  What was the experience like when you first started helping bars get back on their feet (not the first episode of Bar Rescue, but in your career\)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1nnxpm/i_am_jon_taffer_host_of_bar_rescue_and/cckbetn?context=5)|The greatest thing about resuscitating bars is that it makes people smile.  The customers smile, the owners smile, it's a really positive and exciting thing when it happens. And it's very motivating.   When I do my job well, it makes people smile.  And that's pretty cool. 
[Who was the most entertaining owner to work with? Do you keep in touch with any owners long after the shows?  My Sundays would be incomplete without Bar Rescue! ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1nnxpm/i_am_jon_taffer_host_of_bar_rescue_and/cckbt7w?context=5)|It's up to them as to whether we keep in touch.  Everybody knows where they can find me.  I've developed very good friendships with some of them.  With the exception of Pirates, I've left everyone in a good relationship.  Bar Rescue is very intense for me.  I build very close relationships with all of these people while I am there.  I have very personal discussions with these people.  This past week I had a waitress crying to me when she didn't have money to buy baby formula because the bar I was rescuing was such a failure.  That makes this personal to me.  I can't let these people down.  Many times, they are what inspires me.  Feeling bad for them inspires me.  If you watch carefully, I tear up pretty often.  If it's intense and powerful for you guys to watch it, it's much more intense for me to have lived it.  I want to share that with everybody.  When you are living it, it's even MORE powerful.

 |Don't open a bar if you like hanging out in bars.  Open a bar because you want the business.  Counting the bottles, building the space, keeping it clean, making the customer smile. If you are doing it because you like hanging out in a bar, build one in your basement, it's a lot cheaper.  
[Hi John! HUUUGEEE fan!  I have been working for a pub for four years now and have worked my way up from bussing to management.  Now that I am managing, I have found out that it is all quite dysfunctional. The managing partner works two shifts a week and i usually end up working one of those, my bar manager is kind of full of himself and is running away all of the good servers in order to give the prettier servers more shifts, and I feel like it's just myself and another manager trying to right a falling ship.  We haven't had a work meeting let alone a manager meeting since i started managing in January.  What should i do?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1nnxpm/i_am_jon_taffer_host_of_bar_rescue_and/cckbqur?context=5)|Get 10 customers to agree to come to a ""Focus group meeting"" at your restaurant while it's closed.  Only yourself and the managing partner should be there, no other management or employees.  Pick those 10 carefully.  When an owner hears it from the customers that the bar manager is chasing people out, etc etc it becomes far more meaningful than hearing it from you.
 |They will always question your motive and whether you'd throw someone under the bus. They will always think of it as being an opinion.  When a customer says it, it's a fact.
[Thanks for doing AMA Mr Taffer. I've always wondered what is the most disgusting thing you have found in a bar?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1nnxpm/i_am_jon_taffer_host_of_bar_rescue_and/cckbst2?context=5)|The first thing that comes to mind is rat shit in chicken.   Raw chicken being served to my daughter was in one of the episodes, which was about as disgusting as you can get.  In Headhunters, I found about 50 cockroaches in a bottle of whiskey.  I'm not sure it gets much grosser than that.  I went to Headhunters with my wife and a cockroach walked across her foot.   
[Has the show ever considered showing the construction process? I'd love to see how the actual bar is flipped and turned into the final product.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1nnxpm/i_am_jon_taffer_host_of_bar_rescue_and/cckbpt4?context=5)|We're doing more and more of that now in each episode, where we are showing time-lapse of the actual work being done, and you'll see a lot of that in the Hurricane Sandy episode. 
[When/ How did you figure out that the bar business is one of your passions?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1nnxpm/i_am_jon_taffer_host_of_bar_rescue_and/cckbf1n?context=5)|I didn't plan it this way.  I went to college for political science, I was a musician when I was young and played the drums.  I loved music, and I got a bartending job when I was starting college, and one thing led to another, and I got hooked.  I wound up staying in bars, and I stayed in the industry.  What people don't know about me is that I've opened many restaurants, not just bars, I've been a food and beverage director at a resort, and a hotel general manager.   So I actually have a broader hospitality background than what is seen on Bar Rescue.

Do you still ever get behind the kit?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1nnxpm/i_am_jon_taffer_host_of_bar_rescue_and/cckbyqe?context=5)|I've never said this before, but I'm sitting in my office and to my left is a Roland, studio quality V drum set.  Further to my left is a Marshall mini stack, and two guitars.  So the answer is, I play the drums all the time in the privacy of my own office with the privacy of my headset and my ipad.

I took lessons in jazz drumming when I was younger,  I played in rock bands and jazz bands, I played blues, when I was a child I used to go to broadway shows with my family all the time.  A good tune with a good hook is great no matter what type of music it is.
[What kind of music do you listen to?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1nnxpm/i_am_jon_taffer_host_of_bar_rescue_and/cckbyqe?context=5)|Sometimes I wish I could have been a litigator, arguing cases in courtrooms and arguing for people.  Because at the end of the day, my motivation is being an advocate for something or someone during that day.  You see me being an advocate on Bar Rescue.  At this particular moment, I'm being an advocate for me, and I'm always an advocate for something.  
[I was wondering what the best part of the show was for you?  We all see the resolution at the end of the episodes, but what owners stuck out the most that have actually changed?  Also, is there any events on the east coast you will be at, would love to meet you!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1nnxpm/i_am_jon_taffer_host_of_bar_rescue_and/cckberk?context=5)|People might think that my most fun scene is when I reveal the bar, and it is (I guess).  I get to see the looks on everyone's faces, there's not denying that doesn't get old.  But actually, to me the moments that feel the best are sometimes the ugliest.  I use confrontation as a tool.  It doesn't scare me.  I have five days to change the way somebody thinks.  My greatest moments of moving their brain are my loudest.  I always scream for a reason.  I always use confrontation in a very purposeful and deliberate way.   I act mad, but I'm not.  I am consciously forcing someone to hear me because they never heard anyone else before me.

Thanks!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1nnxpm/i_am_jon_taffer_host_of_bar_rescue_and/cckbq3a?context=5)|Aw thanks for buying the book!  And its whole purpose is to inspire you, so put on your seatbelt and have a good read.  Your question is a great one, and the answer is yes.  Sometimes I look in their eyes and motivate them through compassion.  You've seen it on Bar Rescue.  Sometimes I appeal to their pride by mentioning their family, wives, families.  Sometimes I play to their fear by asking them where they're going to live when a place closes, what they're going to do.  And sometimes I play to their own personal ambitions if it's there.

Any great promotions, insight, etc?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1nnxpm/i_am_jon_taffer_host_of_bar_rescue_and/cckbrew?context=5)|Bar Trivia is a lot of fun because it's interactive. The problem with Bar Trivia is that it can lower the energy of a room, rather than raise it.  So it's not about the trivia, it's about the presentation of the trivia.  It's got to be fast-moving, it's got to be funny, and I would never allow the music to stop for more than 2 minutes.  Any more than 2 minutes of trivia, you rob the guts out of your nightclub.  Have a music program with trivia inserts, NOT the other way around.  
[What is one of your favorite cities to visit?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1nnxpm/i_am_jon_taffer_host_of_bar_rescue_and/cckbeqw?context=5)|I moved there!  About a year ago.  Las Vegas.  And I love Las Vegas because I call it an LBE - location-based entertainment business. That's what I'm really in.  Whether it's a live venue, a dance club, a comedy venue, a bar where people read poetry. Where there's a location based business, that's my business.  And Las Vegas is the center of the Universe for that, so I find it a very exciting place to live. 
[If you could re-do, or change, any of the Bar Rescues that you've already done, which would it be?

People might nitpick that they might not want that name, but these are businesses, not children, and the people are what matters.  In every case I am proud of the direction that we've done, the people that we've worked with.  And with very few exceptions, we've left people in a very much better place.

The problem with college bars is discounting.  College kids go where the drinks are cheap and the beer is very cheap.
 |College towns are all about building them inexpensively and keeping costs low so you can sell cheap.  Personally, I'd rather go to places where I can sell at higher prices.  I will receive far more income with higher prices for all the money I've invested.

1no5o5,2,2013-10-03,Software Developer looking for advice from the wise!,EntropicTempest,needadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/1no5o5/software_developer_looking_for_advice_from_the/,"I apologize, this will be fairly long, I have included some background before the actual question.

Hello! I am currently working full time at a small company, we'll call Job1, that provides many different services for mainly small businesses. Currently, I work in software development and specialize in C#, and have worked extensively with the .NET framework and MVC for the past year. I have not completed my degree yet, I have 21 credits left that I have been doing online to receive my Bachelors in Computer Science. Oh, and I am 24.

I took this job a year ago as an internship opportunity. It started out unpaid for about 3 months until I started getting paid for my work. We don't have a whole lot of development projects, but we do have a couple larger projects that have been around since before I started, and for the past year I have been the only person working on them. I started out just making very small changes, but eventually I have developed entirely new features. Prior to this, I had no C# experience, but only Java, C, Perl, and awk (all for very small periods of time in college).

Most of what I have learned has come from my own trial and error or internet research on any new topics I was learning. I knew the basics of programming, and C# was a very easy language to pick up, but I was pretty much on my own without any sort of mentor around to guide me. I have recently took it upon my self to pursue my Microsoft C# certification and have been reading Andrew Troelsens C# 5.0 and the .Net Framework 6th ed to try to sharpen what I already know and of course, learn something new.

Over the past month, I have been somewhat 'ready' to start looking elsewhere for a job, as I feel like the current environment I am in (working largely solo with absolutely no mentorship or team environment) has not been adequate to the development of myself as a professional developer. I have been approached by 2 companies in the past month that really got me thinking about this more and more, but I am concerned about some ethical issues of one, and some of the same issues I am facing now with the both.

One of the companies, is actually a client of ours. Let's refer to them simply as the Client. The Client has been in business with Job1 since before I started. They have commissioned Job1 to develop a program (which I have worked on extensively and am the only person with Job1 who has worked on it now), and since have been paying a service agreement for maintenance and pay for new features. They own the program - we just maintain it.

I was approached by them a couple weeks ago while I was onsite working on an IT issue (I do IT for Job1 as well). They told me didn't see the point in paying X amount per month and would rather do it in house, and thought I would be the best for the job. I had some serious ethical concerns with this though; it is Job1s biggest development contract and losing them would definitely hurt the company. No one would likely be in danger of losing their jobs, but I am not the one who makes those decisions. They pretty much want to hire me to work on their program, as well as any other development they may need for their website. They're not a small company, they probably have between 20-50 employees, and they're growing and still opening offices in different parts of the country.

Another concern I had was something my step-mom had pointed out to me, that I could be a 'one-trick pony'. I would really only being working on one project, at least in the foreseeable future, and I would likely be the only person developing these programs. I feel like it would present to be my biggest challenge yet, but I know I could do it. Again, my biggest concern here is the ethical issues..is it just business, or does it kind of make me a shitty person to do this? Because it kind of does make me feel shitty, but at the same time it sounds like they're going to just hire someone in house anyway. Also, I feel like I may be stuck in the same position I am now. I do not know how important it is as a Software Developer to be part of a team, or have that mentor starting out.

The other company who approached me was a previous employer. They want me to work for them but I feel like the role would really be temporary, since they just want me to build a retail website (they're a fairly successful company on Amazon, one of the top, at least in their department). Also, they would want me to be they're ""IT guy"" as they put it, but in all honestly IT is not something I really wanted to make a career out of.

Lastly, I have considered applying to other companies in my area. I live in Central Texas, and would like to stay in this area at least for awhile more. When looking for places to apply to for in Software Development, what should I consider? As a developer with 1 year experience in C# and a nearly complete degree, what can I expect to find?

Sorry if the post was kind of drawn out, but to kind of recap to clarify what it is I'm asking:

* What are any ethical concerns about going to work for a client of my current company, thus ending the relationship between the two?

* As a Software Developer, how important is it to work with a team of developers and/or work alongside senior developers in regards to building my skills as a professional developer? EDIT: Especially at the beginning of my career?

* What are considerations to make when deciding on what kind of company I want to work for, and what can I expect in terms of opportunities as a developer with a year of experience and a nearly complete degree?"

I was terminated because I was put on a 60 day probation period to improve performance and on day 40 they kicked me out. It's funny because I had an internship with another company and they didn't give me the full-time offer so now with me being terminated I really question myself and feel like a piece of shit.

I thought I was improving and thought I met expectations of people but apparently I didn't. I don't feel self aware and I don't feel comfortable in my own skin. It seems like I don't understand how people view me and don't understand what I say or how my actions have implications. Lets say work wise for example, I miss minute details and don't pay have a attention to detail skill set because I would be doing a project and think I did something that needed to be done but when I get review points for it, I am surprised I missed it. 

It's hard for me to express how I feel right now because I feel like a hopeless asshole. I've always been depressed but events like these send me down a deep rabbit hole. "

My longest relationship (~2 years) ended about 2 years ago, and not well. It messed me up for awhile, but for the past year or so, I've really enjoyed being single. I'm a senior in college, and after my internship I plan to travel anywhere and everywhere that I can, which is a big reason why I picked the major I did. 

My boyfriend also had a bad relationship that ended a few years ago. This sent him into a whirlwind of drug abuse and depression that he came out of last year. He's never been to college, never moved out of his parents' house, and does not own a car. He's a great person. Really sweet, caring, loving, etc. 

He contacted me on Facebook at the beginning of the year, but we never got too serious about talking because we lived in different cities. Around the beginning of the summer, we both attended this music festival (with separate groups, although we had hung out a few times prior) and we hit it off. Inseparable ever since. 

We live pretty far apart, and without him having a car, this gets frustrating. I didn't really mind, but as far as I know, he has no money saved towards buying one and although he is appreciative of me driving always.. I feel like this is something he should take upon himself. 

That isn't the big issue, however. The bigger issue is that lately, everything I say, he gets offended by. I'm really not attracted to sensitive men, and I have a pretty rude sense of humor. On many more than a few occasions, he has become hostile/offended by something that I said out of complete innocent humor. Also, he gets very offended when I correct/disagree with him. He has know-it-all tendencies, as do I, but I'd like to think that I can admit when I'm wrong, or at least accept it.

Keep in mind, he's a really great guy, otherwise. Not that these qualities are deal-breakers, but since I've never really been in a healthy relationship, I'm not sure if they're red flags or not. 

tl;dr I'm really confused by my boyfriend's behavior. He's easily offended, and way too dramatic/serious."
1nnleb,0,2013-10-03,"Keep going to school, or get a Firefighting job?",r_Dubwc,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1nnleb/keep_going_to_school_or_get_a_firefighting_job/,"I'm a sophomore in college and I'll get my AA in the spring and I've got both Fire/EMT certs in my state. The trouble is I'm conflicted of what to do, (potentially) get a job as a FF/EMT or do I keep going to school? I'm enthralled with politics, both domestic (US) and international. I'm currently a Honors student with a 3.8 GPA at my community college and I've got a direct transfer to the bigger school down the road once I get my AA.

The honors director and other faculty members have been telling me that they feel I would be not be reaching my full potential as a FF. The thing is that I'm a Fire explorer and love the job, and I know exactly what it entails, how much I'd be paid etc, but over the past few months it's been an internal struggle on what I want to do. 

Recently I learned of an opportunity to be an intern and study in DC for a semester (only to find out the opportunity only cost a low payment of $14,900) and that really pushed me more towards keeping on with school. As a FF I could still take online classes and work full time, but I am not a fan of online classes, it feels as if something's missing and I'm not actually in a class. 

One thing that I can't 'grasp' in my head is that my certs are good to go in 30 something states and that I can extend them indefinitely by being a volunteer FF for 6 months every 2 years, but I feel as if I'm walking away from an opportunity to make a lot of money at 19 years old. The jobs aren't even a sure thing but I'm certain in my mind I'd land one of them. It feels as if I go to school now, I won't come back to be a FF, which may be a good or bad thing, but going to a school far from here and landing an internship is a chance that may only come once in my life and it could very well change my mind on what I want to do in life. 

My parents say they'll support me either way, but I know my father wants me to get a job, move to a town nearby, work 20-25 years and retire as a FF. He says I have ""youthful idealism"", I always talk to him about current events in US politics and throw about solutions I think of  and he says that later in life that goes away, that one day I'll stop worrying about how anyone can fix the system and more towards how I can play the game to make it beneficial to me, but I think it's complete bullshit and he's just jaded and cynical. 

The struggle is most definitely real. Or I could just say no to keeping on with school or being a FF and just keep working up the ladder at my grocery store (absolute last case scenario). 


TL;DR : I'm 19, and I can't decide between 2 paths in life, be a FF or keep going to school and decide what I want do then. I'd like opinions from outsiders. "

The following are just my experiences and thoughts about what led to my GPA lowering/raising.

I started college in the Fall of 2008 and enrolled in a general engineering program at a university in the Midwest. After realizing my school did not offer the program I became interested in (Aerospace Engineering), I decided to transfer to the University of Minnesota the following year. The following years were a mix of frustration, guilt, and determination. My first two years were a complete joke. Being a new student I was often more interested in meeting new people and making friends as I didn't know anyone in the city I was living in. I partied quite a bit (although not that much compared to liberal education standards) and spent my weekends recovering from hangovers (but always finishing assignments on Sunday night ha). I was always diligent in attending my classes in the beginning of the semester but as it dragged on I would miss a lot of classes, especially the early ones but sometimes even in the afternoon. Even though I was missing some classes, I would always read the subject material and would spend hours studying and doing homework problems. Despite my best efforts, I would always do terrible on tests. After 3 semesters my GPA had slipped from a 3.15 to 1.74. To many of you that would seem insane. How did I not stop it from falling that far you ask? In my head I would always justify with other reasons. Early on I always thought ""C's get degrees!"" Yeah but C's don't get jobs as I found out when applying for internships. My roommates would often start partying on Wednesdays and would sometimes stay up till 3:00 am playing loud music. Lack of sleep led to more sleep ins than I would care to admit. Another reason was not really getting to know anyone in my classes. This was often difficult early on because you were in a class of up to 300 people (Physics/Calculus I, II, III). And as my grades slipped over the years, the biggest problem was the never ending doubt. Am I cut out for engineering? Maybe I should be Mechanical? Do I really want to do this for the rest of my life? These questions caused a lot more stress than they should have. 

However after my worst semester (3 D's and a B-), I decided to reform my studying habits and my educational lifestyle. As I retook some of my classes I realized that main reason I did so bad in them was because of my half ass effort in building block classes (Physics, Calculus, Statics, Chemistry, etc.) Attending class became a personal mandate of mine. I also got to know more of the engineering students by joining student groups and participating in competitions. For instance I became a member of Engineers Without Borders and The American Institute for Aeronautics and Astronautics and participated in the CanSat competition and SAE Aero Design competition. All of these drastically helped me as I made more friends (of which I could study with), increased my knowledge of engineering, and prepared me for an engineering career. Most importantly they displayed leadership, a quality that is not overlooked in resumes. During this time I applied to jobs and internships and never had any success. By the time I graduated I had raised my GPA back to 2.97 (my last year average was a 3.5). I applied to hundreds of jobs (literally) over the year and especially this summer. I had plenty of interviews and talked to many head hunters, recruiters, and hiring managers but nothing ever panned out. Often I thought it was because of my GPA. I mean how could it not be? An employer wants someone who can communicate, work in a team, and has plenty of skills. Those can all be accomplished relatively easily, but a below 3.0 GPA? Toss it.

Not true. Don't believe it. Why? Because I recently accepted a job to work as an Engineer for the International Space Station. Does GPA matter? Of course it does. But it's not everything. Your chances at getting a job are just as good as someone with a 3.5 as long as you have experiences or skills to back it up. College is what you make of it. Make no mistake no one is going to give you a degree or a job easily. You have all the tools and resources, you just have to know how to use them. If I have any advice for those of you with a low GPA, it's this: do whatever it takes to go to class (even if it means moving out of your house), make friends and study with people in your major, participate in anything engineering related (even the red bull air races ha), apply to EVERYTHING, and don't ever give up. In the end it will benefit you no matter what and one way or another, someone will notice and reward you with that job.

What do I need for an internship?,DuhGuy,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1nmuol/in_high_school_what_do_i_need_for_an_internship/,"I'm a junior in high school in the Chicagoland area and have been programming for about a year now. 

Although I'd dabbled before, I officially started when I watched the videos of Harvard's cs50 course in December. I did the homework assignments that involved C (so the first half) and then stopped to start learning java on my own for the AP Computer Science test, which I got a 5 on this May. I also took a VB course, which I found fairly easy.

Projects I've done include assisting programming (I mostly did autonomous) our robot for FIRST in Java, creating a platformer based on theCherno's game programming tutorials and later entering two Ludum dares (finishing one) based on it (Java), completing the first 21 project Euler problems the week before school started in August (java), making a pretty and iPhone-supported Tetris on Processing.js, making programs on my TI-84 such as pacman or programs for math team or calculus, and a tic-tac-toe game, single or two-player, in VB.

I'd say I'm well-acquainted with the Java Collections, having used ArrayLists and HashMaps and knowing the other Collections available to me.

Most of what I know about algorithms would be from ProjectEuler and the AP Computer Science course (search/sort, best path, how many paths, blah blah)

I'm weak on threads/concurrency/serialization and networking since I haven't worked on them much, though I hope to soon. I'm weak (ignorant) on web programming, knowing only how to do HTML and processing.js and applets.

TL;DR: I'm a first year Java developer.

Knowing this, I was wondering if it would be hard for me to get an internship with my age and experience. I'm super interested in programming and was hoping that you guys might know what I might have to do to get one. If not not an internship, is there a market for freelancing for what I've
been doing? Also, how on track am I for the future? Will colleges recognize the work I've done so far?


EDIT: Thank you for the thoughtful replies, I'll keep them in mind as I keep on programming! Seems to be that I'm ahead and that I should keep working on what I work on now, learning more, and getting an internship in college unless I know someone."

How do I prepare for these interviews?!! When I interviewed for my internship, it was really basic questions, but I've heard that for full time positions they ask MUCH harder questions, especially about algorithms and time complexity (my weakest points IMO).

I also have a behavioral interview with one of the companies.

Help?",buzz_off_fucker,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1nmsq2/reddit_i_think_someone_might_have_started/,"About six weeks ago, I started a new job that I love. I'm in a department with great people.

A few weeks ago, a new guy was hired in a different department. I saw him leaving the main office and he's of a different ethnicity of most of the employees so I noticed him right away, but then so am I, we're of the same ethnic background. I hadn't met him until last week when my department went to their building to help finish up some projects.

One of my coworkers (I'll call him S, we're good friends at work) was talking to him, he called me over because the new guy (let's call him B) mentioned that he's doing continuing education with the same university, in the same program and at the same level (related to the job, actually) that I happen to talk S's ear off about pretty regularly. I introduce myself, say I can't believe that we haven't at least crossed paths once in almost three years of this program, but hey, whatever... We're also about the same age (I think I'm a bit older), similar background, etc., so S and B and I are chatting it up. B seemed like he was full of himself, but a little lonely too, as he just started and doesn't seem to have a lot in common with the people in his department. He also had really wanted a position in our department but I guess our boss didn't feel like he met the qualifications, even though he's pretty experienced, although B said he didn't tell our boss about being in the continuing education program. (Weird in retrospect.)

He couldn't figure out why I was in the department I was when I'd only been there for a few weeks longer (where I work, you usually start in a particular department and work your way up and then move around if you want to, but I'd taken an unpaid internship via the continuing education and proven myself...I hadn't planned on working there but I loved it so asked for the job, even offering to start on a lower level but my boss placed me where I wanted to be). I explained the internship, and he kind of scoffed. I blew it off and didn't think much of it.

I had asked my boss if I could leave at lunch that day, since our department was caught up on all our projects and we were just killing time helping out the other department, he said sure, go ahead. So when lunchtime came, I told S to have a great day, see you tomorrow and hey B, it was nice meeting you.

B still wants to chat, so he walks with me to my car, saying he needs to move his to his building, as he'd parked at the main office for some reason. The different departments being in different buildings, each building has it's own parking area. Ours happens to be up front by the gate, just past the main office, so he basically walks me all the way from one end of the facility to the other. So we chat some more during our ten-minute walk, and suddenly bells start ringing in my head. He's starting to remind me of a few pathological liars and generally mentally unstable people that I used to know. I make sure to bring up my husband a few times (as if my not-inconspicuous wedding set was suspect-I also made sure to discreetly flash it at him once or twice). We get to my car. B says ""oh, this is your car! I noticed it my first day."" Sure, fine, I drive a somewhat distinct car with a few decals on the window, and have a vanity plate. But I realize I need to NOPE THE FUCK OUT OF HERE ASAP. I try to politely excuse myself, and manage to do so.

The next morning when I see S, I pull him aside and say, ""Hey, I know B seems really nice, and is having a hard time making friends in his department, but when he walked me to my car yesterday I got a bad gut feeling about him. So be careful, okay? And don't tell him anything personal about me."" S says, ""Yeah, I spent most of the afternoon with him and a lot of stuff he said just didn't add up."" He made some examples of stuff that B said while I was there, I agreed and that was pretty much that. We've joked about it once or twice since, but this week I don't know if it's come up at all. I asked my boss about him, and he seemed like he was on the fence about him and probed me a bit, but I didn't want to seem like ""OMG he's creepy!!!"" so I dropped it.

Fast forward one week, to today. When I got to work (I'm usually one of the earliest arrivals, I like to drink my coffee and check the task calendar in peace), B's car was parked in our parking area...in the spot where I usually park. The driver's side door was open and the dome light was on, but I didn't see B anywhere. I called around, but no answer. I wasn't about to go shut that door. When I walked to the main office a little later to pick something up, I noticed the door had been shut. Okay, just a little weird. I didn't see B all day; I managed to miss him at lunch and on breaks, even though I was running all over the facility all day. His car was still there when I left.

Tonight, I'm sitting on my front porch with a friend who'd stopped by (husband is upstairs reading) and I'm telling him about this guy at work that's a little creepy. Not five minutes later, a car that looks just like his drives down my street, in front of my house. It slows down when it sees my car (thankfully in my neighbor's driveway across the street, I've never been thankful before when my friend took up the whole driveway with his big-ass truck!), I say to my friend, ""Holy shit, I think that's B, the guy I was just telling you about!"" When the car, windows rolled down, stops at the stop sign (our house is on a corner), the streetlight illuminates his face... IT IS B. He turns left (the street dead-ends) and he comes flying back through, doesn't even pause at the stop sign. I'm flabbergasted.

Now, I know that he lives about five miles away, because he just moved to this area and we were talking generally about where we live last week. But there is no reason for him to be in my neighborhood, there's nothing here but, well, a neighborhood.

So. I tell the husband about this, and he's not happy. Usually if I think I'm overreacting, I'll run it by him, he's a good litmus test. Since he's worried about it (I have my CCW, he suggested I start carrying to work, which I don't currently because I don't have a good car safe/lock), that makes me take this a bit more seriously.

So, readers of Reddit, any suggestions on how I should handle this? I don't want to jeopardize my job, my boss has already given me more opportunities and responsibilities than anyone as new as me has gotten, so I really don't want to bring it up unless I have to.

I don't even know B's last name, and it would probably look like something else to the work rumor mill if I tried to find out (we don't have an employee database available to us).

I also want to tell S about the random drive-bys tonight, but not sure if I should or not.

TL;DR: new dude at my awesome job gave me the mild creeps last week. Parked in my parking spot today. Drove by my house twice tonight. Am I fucked?

Edit: adding TL;DR"
1nmsf6,5,2013-10-02,Ex of 1.5 yrs [21M] gave hope of getting back together with me [21F] not sure what to do or how to get over it,xyggz1,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1nmsf6/ex_of_15_yrs_21m_gave_hope_of_getting_back/,"So my ex and I dated a year and a half. Things were not so great towards the end. We could have worked on our problems and were actively doing so when he found out he got an internship requiring him to leave in two months for four months. Given our issues we decided to break up a few weeks after finding out he got the internship, rather than delay the inevitable.

Well, that was three months ago. He's back in January. I took it terribly at first, and additional issues with my father made it a very stressful time, given my ex had been my emotional support through thick and thin. We had been best friends for years before dating. Then I started to feel better.

Or so I thought. The ex and I kept talking on and off via text/facebook about very mundane stuff just to make his coming back easier. As we were friends before dating and have all the same friends, I have no choice but to keep talking to him if I don't want to up and find a new group of friends. Anyways, the conversation gradually got less volatile and eventually it was pleasant. It got to a point where I began missing him terribly. 

After we broke up I kept telling myself I felt like crap because I just missed being in a relationship. But it has been three months and I miss *him*. I've had other shots at new relationships but I only want him. We were friends for so long that I could be completely myself with him - and better than that, he loved me exactly as I was. Forgive how corny this sounds but I gave him my whole heart, and I don't think I'll ever get it all back. 

So just this week on monday, I, in a moment of weakness, ask him to call me. We end up talking for three hours. It was the best I have felt in so long. I confess I still have feelings for him, and he confesses the same and I am on cloud 9. He says there is no harm in trying to date again because the worst thing that happens we break up again after a month, and everything is the same it was anyways. He's coming back to town in two weeks for the only time until January and he asks to see me and I don't hesitate before saying yes. 

Well if that had been the end of it, I wouldn't be posting here. Last night, 2 o'clock in the morning, he calls me. Says he wasn't thinking straight. We are still going to be apart for too long to be making this type of decision. Says he doesn't want to do a half assed pseudo long distance relationship and he doesn't want to lead me on in case his feelings change. I tell him my feelings haven't changed and I don't see them changing and that I am willing to take the risk - that if I get hurt, then it is my own fault and I will deal with it - but he won't hear me out. He says if we still want to hang out in two weeks we can, but it will have to be as friends. He says if, in January, the feelings are still there - only then can we think about getting back together. 

I just can't believe it. He gave me this hope, and then 24 hours later, he ripped it away from me. I'm crushed. And when he was trying to console me he said if he were to come home tomorrow he wouldn't hesitate before trying again. He immediately followed it by saying I should try to move on. How am I ever supposed to move on if he leaves the door open a crack like that? And so many of our problems have been resolved. He was broke, and felt bad about going on dates, but now his intership is paying him more money than he knows what to do with. I was a stress case working all the time and writing the MCAT and couldn't commit the time we deserved together. Now I have so much free time I don't even know what to do with myself. And honestly, maybe all it is, is that it took me losing him to realize that I don't want anybody else.

I said I would wait for him to come home and not pursue anyone else, but he said he couldn't ask me to do that because it's too selfish on his part. He is a very generous, unselfish person and this doesn't surprise me. But I just can't take it. I was struggling to move on before when I thought we didn't have a chance in hell, and now that he's given me this hope, I don't know how I ever will. I still love him. I miss him so much. Nothing I can say or do will change his mind.

So now what? I feel like I just got the rug ripped out from under me. I haven't eaten since monday, which is exactly what happened when we first broke up. Am I getting broken up with all over again? And why do I care about him so much still! Why can't I want somebody that wants me and knows it and would wait those months for me. Why is it that with him, I can't listen to my own reasoning? I know getting hung up on him is a dangerous road to go down, and yet here I am. 

Reddit, I am totally helpless here. I need some advice. What the hell do I do now :( 

**TLDR** Boyfriend gets internship requiring him to leave for 4 months - we have pre-existing problems that we don't think will survive a LDR, so bf becomes ex-bf. Many issues resolve over time and this week we talk on the phone for 3 hours and he suggests getting back together. 24 hours later, he takes it back, and now I am devastated. Need advice about what to do now..."

I'm interested in ML/Data/Bioinformatics, but I'd happily take some work in AI/Robotics if I can. We have one CS elective in AI and one in ML . . . I plan on taking the one in ML if I can. The research and AI/ML classes are all taught by the same prof, and I'd like to work with him.

I guess my big question is that I see everyone talking about working outside of classes on projects, building a github resume (I have my linux configs and homebrew scripts there now), and getting some internships. But no one ever mentions research. Is there a big difference between the two when it comes to industry?

In terms of industry I think I would like to either be a *nix/sysadmin for the money, or a software engineer for (google) somewhere that I could use the ML/datascience stuff . . . I guess I like the science/math stuff, and enjoy coding. I'm not at all interested in web/frontend stuff is what I think I am trying to say.

1nr1w9,1,2013-10-04,Need help configuring Server 2012 Standard for Small Office,Reddcapp,techsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/1nr1w9/need_help_configuring_server_2012_standard_for/,"The picture I had in my head to begin with (which is slowly becoming impossible) is having the office server run the office domain, where everyones personal virtual desktops would reside as well as a shared network drive for company wide documents, files, etc. Anyone could login from any computer on the network into their own personal virtual desktop and all management, deployment, and monitoring could be done from the SINGLE instance of Server 2012 Standard. 

Im trying to set up first the main server partition with AD DS (active directory domain services) USING our domain of something.net, not something.local. This, from what i've read, is completely OK now and would allow us to use email addresses as login names for the virtual desktop environments. 

The first question becomes: What configuring do I need to do, the main server partition being the domain controller, for it to correctly interact with the DNS server, which in our case is called computer.otherdomain.com (if you ping something.net, its the same server and IP address so I can safely assume both domain names are on the same server). I have tried using the DNS IP as the static IP but then i cannot connect to the internet, so I doubt im actually doing this right.

Second thing I'm trying to get into is installing the Remote Desktop Services. I attempted once to install it alongside the Domain Controller (same partition) but evidently that is NOT supported and completely screwed up the install so much so that I had to reinstall. What i've found is that I need to install RDS and the remaining virtual environment services on another server or in my case a virtual dekstop running server 2012. That virtual machine would be running RDS, the Connection Broker, Virtualization Host, and Web Access server. 

So a summary of questions would be:

1. How do I use an external DNS server for our server?
2. How do I properly configure RDS and the other Virtual Desktop Infrastructure services on the same server, virtual or otherwise?
3. Why the hell is this all so difficult and no clear-cut documentation on the web of something seemingly every business uses today, including my university?

Hopefully this all made sense. I copy/pasted this from an email I sent my dad an hour ago (he's been a network admin/sys admin/information assurance for about 20 years) to save time and hopefully its not disjointed. I changed some information around to not share personal info. Thank you in advance for help, I recently got this job as an internship and am currently flying solo when it comes to all of these issues as no one else in my department has been hired on yet (very small company thats been run by one person for a number of years). The ""training"" I'm supposed to be getting has quickly turned into teaching myself. Im learning other things but nothing helpful with this problem."

I'm an autistic 18-year old boy from the netherlands. Let me tell a bit about myself. **The most important bit of this wall of text, for me, is the part with ""over-analyzing thoughts"". Please just read that part and try to answer it, and if you ignore the rest of the text that's fine to me.**

**My History (skip this if you don't want to read this)**

My past 4 years weren't that great, especially the last year. From the age of 14-17 i was generally insecure, had a lot of moodswings, and i didn't do much for school. Couldn't concentrate and wasn't motivated at all for school. I gamed a whole freaking lot in that period. In fall 2012, things started to get even worse and i sometimes felt pretty depressed, sometimes i felt a bit better, but it wasn't great. My doctor prescribed me antidepressum. And even though it prevented me from feeling really depressed, i was still a bit down and wasn't living my life the way i wanted it to be. In mid january 2013 it changed from slightly bad to miserable. I stopped using the medication because i wasn't satisfied with it. I stopped instantly without decreasing the doses and without informing my doctor. I actually felt good after stopping to take it, for the first 15 days... Then one evening, i started to feel very weird. I felt anxious, it scared me, i didn't know what it was. It became intenser. Every thought, everything that happened around me seemed to be too much to handle. I was almost panicking. I laid in bed and just tried to sleep and told myself that the next day it'd be over. But the next day it wasn't better, it was worse. I didn't know what was happening and i was very tempted to call an ambulance. I didn't. I went to school that day which was a very bad day at school. I called my mother, told her that i was freaking out. I can't remember everything exactly what happened that day, but it was really bad. The next day was the same story. Very f*cking anxious, feeling hopeless, didn't know what to do. I remember that evening talking with my mother, feeling incredibly depressed and just having no hope. Those two days were problably the worst days of my entire life. You don't know what mental suffering is until you've experienced something like that. It's sad to know that there are still so many people suffering from panic disorders and severe depressions. They should be offered some program instead of lame weekly therapy sessions. Not saying therapy doesn't help, but it's not as effective as the program i followed. I'll get back on that in a bit. Ontopic again. That evening i send a long mail to my therapist describing everything that was going on. It felt good to share it, though it still didn't take away my worries. I browsed on the internet that evening, and i found out i had a panic disorder. Before that i was never familiar with something like that. Before all this, I honestly thought that people with a panic or anxiety disorder were just  
some random freaks just being a pussy. I know better than that know. I found a long article which described exactly what i was dealing with, and how to get out of it. From that point on the sharpest edges of my panic disorder were gone. Though i still felt a lot of anxiety and moments were i was about to lose my mind and panic. It went with periods. There were periods where i felt okay and my mind was relatively calm (not happy, but not too bad either), and periods were i was caught up in my mind all day worrying about every little thing and not trying to panic. There wasn't too much improvement and my life still generally sucked until... i guess about half march. I browsed on the internet and found an CD-course that was directed at people with panic and anxiety disorders. I was a bit sceptic, didn't know what to think of it at first. But after i watched the introduction video, it convinced me. The guy claimed to have experienced panic attacks himself too, and he got out of it. He seemed very genuine and honest about it. And the main point that convinced me, was that you could try it for free for the first 8 weeks. Weren't you happy with your purchase at that point, then you could simply not pay and you wouldn't get the last 8 weeks of the program. So i tried it out for free (2 dollar shipping costs but let's disregard that). And it was the best choice i could ever make. It was focused very much on my own actions and thought patterns. He was giving you the tools to overcome your panic disorder, you were the one using it. The next couple of months, my panic attacks and my anxiety slowly disappeared.

2 months ago, i started doing pickup. Basically i wanted to become really good with girls. i started off really motivated, but as time progressed and i wasn't getting the succes i wanted, that motivation started to disappear and it started to feel more like an chore than it felt like something i wanted to do. it didn't feel good anymore, so my progress kinda stalled a bit. I used to go to the city every day to talk to girls, now i do it more like once or twice a week, usually going out with friends. Last saturday i met this really beautiful woman i thought i had an connection with, i got her number, and i asked her to go out with me on text. Unfortunately she refused to go. It kinda hurted. Because this is not the first time some girl refused or ignored me on text. It happened like 10 times already and i haven't had any succes yet. It's starting to hurt, yet i keep trying to be positive about this, and i won't give up. If there's anything i'm not, then it's an quitter. I learned, however, that doing pickup as an chore, something you feel like you have to do but you don't enjoy it, that's not good. Even when you feel like shit and really don't wanna talk to girls but you still do it, it won't make you feel any better and it even won't improve your pickup skills. Why? Because your mind at that moment automatically links negative emotions to pickup, so you need to do it with some motivation and  joy because otherwise you will start to feel worse and worse doing pickup.

**Mood swings**

So yeah, recently i started to have mood swings again. I can tell you an example of how this goes with me. Let's say today. I go to school, i go to english class, i feel relatively okay. I'm in a new class with new people though i'm not nervous at all. i talk, i'm myself. I'm a bit annoyed though that there is a hot girl behind me but i don't really have anything to talk with her about. I get in front of the class and introduce myself in front of the whole class (30 people or something). I was a bit nervous doing that, but not that much. Maybe i sounded a bit weird, but i didn't care too much. In the past few months my anxiety of doing things like that have decreased dramatically. Then i have lessons with my regular class with people i already know pretty well. At some point, i have a long private conversation with my internship mentor. And somehow, at the end of the conversation, i feel a little bit different. Though the conversation wasn't bad at all, i felt worse afterwards. I felt this annoying feeling again and in the next hour i started to feel insecure. It's a feeling where you can't rationalize things well and you just feel insecure and your brain feels foggy and unclear. These moodswings started to occur since saturday. Before that there weren't really such severe moodswings if i remember correctly. I used to have this during and before my panic attacks started, but i can't recall such severe moodswings since i've recovered. Before saturday i felt generally okay and i never felt really socially insecure, since saturday i do. Actually, sunday till wednesday i felt pretty down. Thursday was better, though not great, today was as good as yesterday. 

I can tell of a few possible reasons for my moodswings and bad feelings:

- The disappointments of my pickup failures, especially that girl from saturday.

- Relapse from NoFap :
I think this one is the most likely. I sexted with this girl last saturday which problably got a bad imbalance in my dopamine levels.
Check out this link for more information of what i'm talking about:
http://forum.bodybuilding.com/showthread.php?t=139933473

- Doing meditation the wrong way (very unlikely)
I'm doing meditation right now, but i'm not doing it consistent. I'm not sure how often to do it, when to do it, how long to do it. I read an article that it can actually be bad when you meditate inconsistently and/or too long

Anyway, do you guys have any idea what might cause these sudden moodswings, i'm not sure at all. It's weird.

**Over-analyzing thoughts**.

Because i'm autistic, i tend to over-analyze a lot of stuff in my life. Sometimes i don't know what the best option is in a certain situation, and then my brain starts to analyze it all but it doesn't work because it's such an abstract concept. i want to understand everything logically. I'm a very logical person. Whenever there's a concept that i don't know the best solution for straightaway, i want to know what is the best option in such a situation, i'll give you my main point that is wrapped up in my head:  

- Time management:

I do not know in which order and when to do certain tasks or activities. I really can get caught up in this in my head. let's say there is this girl i wanna text. There is an possibility that we get something going on. Then when do i text? Do i text her straightaway, regardless of some other activity i'm doing? do i text her after my activity? 

And let's say i'n not currently busy with something, and i have the time to text this girl, but i simply don't feel like it. Would that be an excuse to do it later? It's not a chicken excuse so i don't have to do it or something, it's just that i genuinly feel more comfortable with sending her a text at a different time then now, but would i use it as an excuse to not do it right now? 

The concept that bothers me the most is the 5-minute concept (i called it that way). I really can't figure this one out in my head.

one situation as an example: i text a girl, she texts back, i propose a meetup, she agrees with it. We meet up, we have a good conversation, we go to her appartment, we have sex, i have a really good time. I feel energetic and good again. 

And now, let's say the exact same thing happened, but all happened just 5 minutes later. Does this mean that the first situation grants you 5 minutes more happiness in life? If this was a single occuring event i would understand that it also ends 5 minutes earlier, but what if it's the beginning of a streak where you rack up a lot of girls, get really happy, achieve everything in life you want, but just 5 minutes earlier than the other situation? That would give you 5 minutes more happiness in your life, right?

See, this is a concept that i cannot simply comprehend because it involves too many factors and it just makes my brain a mess when i try to analyze something like this. Yet i know, that if i got a solid answer on how to comprehend this concept and i would understand it, that at that point i would be able to let it go. I'm serious, that is how my brain works. When i understand it, i can let it go. I've had this with multiple concepts in my life before. It's just because my autisctic brain won't allow me to ignore something i'm not able to comprehend.

**TL;DR**

Bad teenage years, got a panic disorder and recovered from it. Now i'm  mentaly relatively healthy again, yet not completely.

I got some moodswings and i don't really know why i have them.

But the most important thing: I'm not able to comprehend a certain concept. It's a concept confuses me and holds me back. 
Let me explain: When you do the things that will make you happy 5 minutes (or a certain time period) earlier in your life, you will feel 5 minutes of more happiness in your life. 

True or not? So does that mean i should do things that make me happy right f*cking now, disregarding of how i feel about it and what i'm doing at the moment? And with so many different factors it just seems impossible for me to comprehend this. But my mind won't allow me to ignore and forget something before i truly understand it. Can you guys help me with this?"
1nqgap,1,2013-10-04,Should I accept this Internship?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1nqgap/should_i_accept_this_internship/,"**A bit of background:**

I'm a 3rd year (Junior) Computer Engineering student focused on the software side with knowledge in hardware.  I'm planning to graduate within a year or two (Spring 2015), so this coming summer will be my last to find a good internship.

I have no real job experience, no research or any notable accomplishment towards my career.  I just have a really good GPA: 3.970

**Now for the story:**

A couple of weeks ago, I went to several internship and career fairs and I received two offers. 

One of the offers was a good engineering/Software company.  They give internships during all semesters, and they are close to my school so I could go there during Fall/Spring.  Problem is, I failed their entrance programming exam on account of not having known the material (The test consisted of 3rd-class tier Java material when I had just entered 2nd-tier).  They said they liked me a lot, and that I could contact them again in the future to try again.

The other offer was from a non-Software/Engineering company.  I don't know how much information I can say, since I haven't signed anything, but for the sake of covering my butt, I'll just say it's one of the big Insurance companies.

They offered me a contingent job offer for the Summer of 2014.  The position is basically IT/Systems (in the way they call it) where I'll most likely be doing App/Website stuff in Java.  I'll be flown out to another state for about 3 months.  The internship is paid at around $18/hr @ 35 Hrs/Week with living arrangements covered by the company.

I have about 10 days left to accept the contingent job offer, and I'm just wondering if it's a good decision to go?  

**Would IT/Systems internship do anything to enhance my career?** 

**At what point in the hiring process can I back out of a deal if something better is offered?**

**In general, what should I do?**

I'm currently a sophomore at a state university in Southern California. Because California will be changing their CPA eligibility requirements next year to require 150 units, I'm trying to decide what path would be best for me to go down in order to reach the 150 units and at the same time get an education that gives me as many options as possible in my future (ie. should I not go to grad school because I'll want to do that later in my career, or should I definitely go to grad school because firms will be expecting MAcc's). I'm assuming that if I want to go public after I graduate, I will need to be CPA eligible, please correct me if I'm wrong. Would it be better for me to get a double major, one in Accountancy and one in Management Information Systems (would this double major even fulfill California's new stricter rules?), or would it be best for me to go to grad school and get a MAcc?

On top of this, in this new five year school schedule required to get 150 units, what is the overall schedule of what things I should be doing and when assuming I want to work Big 4 after college? Here's my guess based on what I've researched so far, please add anything or correct anything if I'm wrong!

* Sophomore Year - Get good grades, participate in campus clubs, volunteer, join accounting society

* Summer after Sophomore Year - Attempt to get internship (unpaid?) at smaller local CPA firms

* Junior Year - Same as Sophomore, get more involved with Accounting society and join Beta Alpha Psi, go to meet the firms type events and network with recruiters

* Summer after Junior Year - Attempt to get Summer leadership program at Big 4, intern at small local CPA firm

* Senior Year - Apply for summer Big 4 internship during the fall

* Summer after Senior Year - Intern at Big 4, or other large firm (BDO, McGladrey), receive job offer (hopefully)!

* Senior Year pt 2/MAcc - If internship went well, work hard in school, don't mess up job offer, if not work on networking and finding future job opportunities

* Graduation! - Begin the joy of working in a large CPA firm

Thank you for your time reading this, I'd appreciate any advice I can get to steer me down the right path!"

I have to give him my contracts from the Summer some time in the next few weeks.
Anything special I should do for the occasion?

Some notes:

I produced $70,000, was billed for $60,000 directly from the company

Had to take out a $1000 insurance policy (yeah, you read that right)

GM referred me to a past FM selling his truck, guarenteed it would run for the whole Summer, it made it a month. $1300 down the drain there.

They never actually taught me how to paint a house.

Almost had to drop out of college because of my new debt.


I can't seem to think of the perfect parting words. Hopefully redditors can point me in the right directions."

I'm fairly new to NoFap, and for people who don't know whether or not it will work, they can read a day-by-day account of what I'm going through. I will be posting every seven days. Even if I relapse I will continue. 

A tiny splurge about me so you can get an idea of what my life was like before NoFap:

-19 year old college student, Asian American

-I've PMO'd around 10-15 times a week, daily.

-Before writing this, I deleted 56 gigabytes of porn. 

-I've been trying NoFap for 2 months now. Never made it past three days. Edged almost every time. This time, no edging, no PMO

-I am doing NoFap because I want to see what happens. I want to experience and log the changes in my mind and body as I go through this process. I also want to spend less time on PMO... it takes up time that I could be using doing almost anything else, which is more productive. I also believe that if I can take control over my urge to fap, I will be able to control my other urges as well. Such as my urge to eat, so I can lose some weight.  

Anyways, let the progress tracking begin. Start date: 09/24/2013 12AM

----------

**Day 1**: No significant changes. 

**Day 2**: Began drinking more water. I really want to fap, this is pretty difficult. This sounds weird and gross to some but urinating a lot turns me off. If I'm horny, I just pee, and boom, no more horny. So the water is helping a lot. 

**Day 3**: Began cold showers. Makes me feel like a MAN when I step out. Such an amazing feeling. Might be getting me a bit sick though...

**Day 4**: Edged a little. Not too disappointed since I've never made it past three days before. I will forgive myself this time but next time I edge I will reset this counter. 

**Day 5**: Today was fairly easy since I wasn't in the room for very long. Looking at girls go out and party about wearing skimpy clothing just reminds me of porn. You hear that? Looking at REAL people reminds me of PIXELATED PORNOGRAPHY. That's the kind of thought process that I want to get rid of permanently. 

**Day 6**: Relapse. Unfortunate, but this is a big step. This is by far the longest I've ever gone since I was probably 12 without any PMO. Unfortunately, my stupid ass brain decided to relapse 3 more times. Now I am disappointed.

------------------------------------

**Day 1**: I think my brain is still working to adjust itself to no porn. I no longer have the urge to watch porn. Even though I relapsed pretty badly yesterday, I think I can still make it. I made a new decree for myself: If I want to fap, I step in the cold shower, no excuses. It really helps me control my horniness. Cold showers shrink the dong so much that I can't even bring myself to TRY and get horny anymore. Even if I want to edge, I shower. If I don't want to constantly take off my clothes, I'm gonna have to stop thinking about edging and fapping.

**Day 2**: Just semi-asked a friend on a date. I have never done this before. My girlfriend throughout high school asked ME out. Yep, I never asked anyone out for anything in any way before. Any sexual relations I've had thus far was when I intoxicated. And I was able to semi-ask someone out today. I don't want to go into too many details, but I feel more confident already. I also have four internship interviews going on at the same time, maybe that contributes a bit. Now, before I even step outside, I take a quick 5 minute cold shower. Helps a LOT with my confidence, I feel like such a boss after being able to handle it. 

**Day 3**: Cold showered before an internship interview with a pretty prestigious firm. Really boosted my confidence in the matter and I think I did well. Cold showered before the ""date."" Turns out she didn't consider it a date. But then I did something I've never done before in my life. I asked her out, no bullshit, no beating around the bush. Straight up. She said no. But right now, for some reason, I am more happy at the fact that I even had the balls to ask her than I am disappointed that she said no. In fact, I don't really seem to care that she said no. I think it was mostly about me having the guts to man up and ask someone out for real. Personally very glad I was able to do this at last, after 19 years of bullshit. "
1npg5u,34,2013-10-04,IamA 24 year old living with multiple hereditary exostosis/osteochondromas (bone tumors). AMA!,nopix,IAmA,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1npg5u/iama_24_year_old_living_with_multiple_hereditary/,"I was born with tiny little bumps on my long bones (basically your limbs) which as my bones grew, they also grew. I have had four of the tumours removed. Two when I was 16, one when I was 17, and the last one was last year when I was 23.

The reason for the first surgery was that I was out with some friends and my ankle started hurting pretty bad. Then it was so bad I just went home. The next day we went to a pediatric surgeon who said (after an MRI and a whole bunch of x-rays) that I needed to have surgery or else the bone was going to tear the tendons at the sides of my ankles. If that happened, the muscle would ball up in the sides of my legs and apparently that would be excruciating. We went ahead with the surgery. They ended up taking away the sharp tumours on each side of my ankle, stitched up the tendons on each side (which were about half way each) and sent me home that day with 10 staples on each side of my ankle. I had a full recovery.

My forearms also had bone tumours in them. I have since had two taken out (one each arm) and one is still hanging out. One taken out when I was 17, the other last year when I was 23. The reason for both of them were the exact same. The tumours made somewhat of a hook shape. When I was 17 I reached into my backpack and the nerve and tendon bundle running across the top of my arm got stuck in the hook which was INCREDIBLY painful. I had a claw as a hand because I couldn't get the tendons or nerves out of the ""hook"". I was stubborn and slightly embarrassed, so I didn't let anyone know until I got home. I had been trying to work my nerves over the hook at school and they finally went back over. It hurt but after the initial pain it was way better. The next couple of weeks it kept on happening. Eventually I was just easily able to push them back with no problem but my hand just started to hurt all the time so we went back to my pediatric surgeon and she got rid of the one on my left arm. Actually she got interns to do it, but that mess is a whole different story. That surgery did not go well but they did fix my initial problem AKA my left arm. Years later the same thing happened to my other arm and I went to a surgeon (not the same one as now I am an adult) the first time it happened just to get it over with. That surgery went splendidly. In and out in 15 mins, didn't even feel groggy waking up.

I originally had 19 osteochondromas (which are bone-cartilage-tumours). Now I have 15. I can live with all of them except for one underneath my thigh which makes it incredibly difficult to be comfortable in a chair (the way I need to sit causes me to have bad posture and a really sore and unaligned spine. The surgeon told me how dangerous operating on it would be and that if I did it there were 3 options. 1. Everything would be fine. 2. A nerve could be damaged and I wouldn't be able to lift my foot ever again. 3. Everything goes fine and the scar tissue causes havoc on my nerves where I would be in more pain than I currently am in. His words were, ""If you were my son, I wouldn't let you have the surgery"" which was good enough for me.

This condition sucks sometimes, but I manage :) I think it makes me stronger in some ways (I have a very high pain tolerance level).

Ask me anything :)

TL;DR I have bone tumours and sometimes they get in the way."

I began interning at a very well-funded tech startup company in the southeast US in May of this year. The team of developers is about five total, including me.

I started my internship making $20/hr, and at the end of the summer, I was given a raise to $25/hr and an offer to stay on part time throughout my senior year. My boss really likes me, and he has given me reason to believe that he will soon give me an offer to come on as a full time developer after I graduate in May.

I'm pretty good friends with my boss. He's not too much older than me. When he gives me an offer, though, I plan to negotiate of course and get the highest salary I can. What should my approach be? I don't feel like I have much leverage as a current intern. I'm already working for this company, and I haven't been job hunting because this seems like a for sure thing that I'll get hired on full time. I just want to make sure I don't get shorted on salary.

Thanks!"

I've been lurking here for the past few months, and I've learned a lot of useful information.  I need help with something though.

A little background first. I am a 3rd year Computer Engineering student doing relatively ok in my major (I have a 3.0 and have never failed a class).  I have never been in a study group with people in my classes, and never seen a professor about grades or hw help.  I have a small group of friends, most of which are studying things that are hardly related to what I am (the closest is a MechE).  With this being my Jr year I will be needing an Internship this summer,  I am also looking at doing graduate school.   The information that I have been receiving on both of these is ""talk to people"" and ""have relevant and interesting clubs and competitions on your resume.""  I don't talk to my professors because they intimidate me, and I don't do any Engineering extracurricular because getting out is very difficult for me.  The things I need help with are:

* Is not doing any Engineering extracurricular activities going to hurt me?  Do I just need to suck it up and find a club or something?  
* How do I approach professors about graduate school? 
* Would you still recommend a study group for me even though I have made it this far alone?  If so, how do i go about finding one?

Thanks for reading my post.

**Edit:**  I didn't mean to make my situation seem so bleak.  I am heavily involved with a couple of clubs on my campus. However, they are not even remotely engineering related.  One is a martial arts group, and the other is a group that plans a campus wide, week long game of tag every semester.  I was wondering if the fact that I don't do engineering extracurricular activities is going to seriously impact me. "

I'm a 20-year old chilean computer engineering student, and I come to you in search for help. Recently, I sent in my CV to Google, applying for their software engineering internships, and, to my own surprise, was elected to be interviewed through Google Hangouts.

The thing is, my interview is next week, and I want to prepare as good as possible in the time I have left. Do you any tips you could share with me? Any websites I can practice on (I already know Project Euler)? I've been reviewing the basic algorithms (quicksort, mergesort, binary search, etc) and basic data structures. Is there anything more I should focus on?

Thanks!

PD: Java is my main language, so if you have any resources on that as well, I'd be eternally grateful."
1npadc,1,2013-10-03,Wondering if I [32 M] should salvage a friendship with an engaged woman [25 F] I am attracted to,oneoff0332,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1npadc/wondering_if_i_32_m_should_salvage_a_friendship/,"Almost two years ago I met a woman while going back to college after a hiatus.   Before I met her, I pretty much kept to myself, did the school work and really didn't socialize with anyone else.

After our first test in class, this gal asks me how I did on the test and how I was doing in class.  I told her I was doing okay but that it was a hard class (it was).  I asked if she would mind studying together, partly because I was attracted to her and partly because it would be nice to have the help.  She agreed and we began meeting outside of class to do the homework.

After about the 2nd meet-up I noticed she was wearing a ring and asked if she was married.  She said she had been engaged for quite a few years.  After learning this I decided to stop contacting her because I thought it might cause trouble since I was attracted to her.

Eventually she began contacting me on her own, asking if I was available to study.  Not wanting to be a jerk (ignoring her just because she was engaged), I agreed to continue studying with her. 

When the semester was finished, we both did well in the class and passed.  As a way to thank me, she offered to buy me lunch after finals week.  I agreed, so we ate at a local restaurant.

It was fun being able to talk with her about other stuff besides school work and it seemed like she was enjoying herself as well.  During lunch we discussed the next semester and found we were going to be in another class together.  We decided to work together in that class as well.

After that initial lunch she invited me out again, a couple of weeks later, for lunch.  I agreed and began wondering why she wanted to hang out again, thinking maybe she was attracted to me too.  About half an hour before showing up, she sent a text letting me know that her fiance would be joining us.  I felt a little put-off by this but, agreed to meet them.  After eating with them I realized my assumptions were wrong.  I decided to stop contacting her socially.  I texted her once that summer to let her know about an internship opportunity at my workplace.

The following 3 semesters we resumed studying for classes we had together.  She began inviting me to hang out for non-school stuff more and more often.  At first, after meeting her fiance, I was hesitant.  But my being single, lonely and attracted to her overrode that and I would agree to hang out.  Eventually, I even began asking her out.  Usually we'd do something when she was alone and wanted company.  Her fiance hung out with us a couple times out of that.

This past summer after spending an afternoon together, we planned to watch a movie later that night.  About half an hour before the movie she sent a text that her fiance would be joining us.  I replied that I wouldn't want to bother them if they already had plans, but she insisted it was ok.  During the movie it was very uncomfortable sitting next to them as they had gotten somewhat intimate with each other (It was a horror movie).  I decided at that point to stop hanging out with her and keep it strictly to school.  For the remaining summer I never contacted her.

I never told her this directly because I didn't know how to without it coming out about how I felt.  I also decided to be more militant about it this time, sort of as a way to keep myself from thinking she was in to me.  So I implemented it by turning her down the next time she asked me out and tried to keep the non-school conversation to a minimum; but whenever she asked to work on the homework or to study, I agreed.  I would also often to leave at the end of class without talking to her (we used to always talk for a few minutes after class) or simply say 'hi' instead of stopping to talk to her whenever I saw her.

As a result of this, she's been reacting in kind, acting very coldly (ignoring me in return, etc).  I feel like I could have approached this more tactfully since I now realize this is what I was doing to her in the first place.  I've tried to ease up a bit, waiting for her after class and making small conversation but her demeanor hasn't changed.  She still avoids/ignores me and she doesn't text anymore.

I miss the way things were and have thought about trying to mend things but I am aware that it is half because I valued her friendship and half because I am still attracted to her.  I've decided that there are two things that I can do at this point.

(1) I was thinking of asking her to talk after class.  I will let her know that I've noticed that she's been upset and ask if I can do anything to mend things.   I will try to leave out how I feel, but if it comes up, I will admit my feelings to explain why I acted the way I did.

(2)  Her cold demeanor makes it seem like she'll laugh at me or shrug me off for talking about how I feel.  Even if I can manage to mend things, I know that a part of me will always be attracted to her and I should just come to terms with the fact that she will never feel the same way about me.  Mending thing will just postpone the inevitable.  Over time I will get over it.  So I feel like I should just cut my losses and leave her alone.

I have trouble sleeping over it and have been feeling depressed.  I feel like talking it out will get a load off my shoulders.  In the past I've never talked to women before about how I truly felt and relationships have died because of it.  This time I want to try something different for a possibly different outcome but I feel, in this situation, it makes no point.

Any advice/input is appreciated.  Thank you for reading.

**EDIT:**  *Thank you all for your feedback.  Part of me wanted to try to mend things but I think the consensus of your replies is the right thing to do.  I will leave her alone from now on.  Thanks again.*

**tl;dr**: Friendship with an engaged woman has gone sour.  I am attracted to her and wonder if it's smart/worth-it trying to salvage."

At the beginning of the internship, the boss told us that we would be writing snmp drivers, one month have passed since then, and I still haven't been able to produce anything worthy, so the boss is giving me simple repetition tasks, I don't want to end up doing that my whole internship. I really hope people who were into similar situation would share their experience on how they got better. I do not have any precise objective for this internship, I just wish to learn the most I can even if it won't be related to my field in the future.

1np9t7,2,2013-10-03,Am I crazy?,[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1np9t7/am_i_crazy/,"Okay, so I know that certain mental illnesses surface when a person is in their 20's, I'm dealing with what I feel like is an overwhelming set of circumstances and I'm wondering if I might be experiencing symptoms of something bigger than just ""stress."" This is a long one, so read it or don't, I just need to get this out. There is no TL;DR at the end. Fuck it.

I am 23, just started my junior year of college with a bunch of people who are about 3 years younger than I am. I have tried for years (we all have the same class schedule) to connect with these people and find out what we have in common. The answer stops at our intended careers. They're nothing but kind to me, I just don't feel the kind of belonging and camaraderie that they all have with each other. It sucks to be the person sitting on the edge of all the excitement, watching everyone else get buddy-buddy with all their best friends. I'm lonely. And the fact that I'm constantly just observing might be coming off as creepy or something. I don't know. I'm insecure. 

The coursework itself is grueling. We have several different group projects (anyone who's done this knows how impossible it can be to coordinate schedules of several very busy people) that are worth huge portions of grades. The pile of assignments and research on my to-do list is staggering. I look at it and feel like there's no light at the end of the tunnel, that I'm not going to accomplish anything of value. The professors are extra tough on us, because ""no one's giving you any breaks in the real world."" Okay, but I'm paying you huge sums of money to teach me how to deal with things, not throw me to the wolves unprepared offering not a hint of guidance or sympathy. They often times don't even provide legitimate instruction on assignments and berate the whole class when everyone submits something different. We're all in the same boat here, my peers and I, so I guess we kind of bond over that sometimes?

On top of that, I moved into an apartment with my two best friends. One of them has since let her boyfriend move in, and no longer has time away from him where we can actually talk. He always seems annoyed by my existence and the ""stupid"" things I say. I try to stay out of their way. The other one will no longer speak to me because I asked her boyfriend to stop bringing his canine friend over when he visits (I'm allergic). I am single, so it gets weird when any of us try to hang out. I'm cool with being single, whatever. I couldn't care less, but feeling like the 3rd/5th wheel just isn't fun. Most other friends my age have graduated/moved/have real adult lives and no time for their old pals.

The apartment itself is a nice shit hole, but the neighborhood is filled with pill-popping drug addicts and bros with a perpetual hard-on for dubstep and subwoofers. My old, piece of crap car's engine exploded, so I had to buy a new car. This seems to draw a lot of unwanted attention my way in a place like this, but I didn't have much of a choice. I needed to invest in something that will run for at least the next 10 years.

Okay, so there's school and my living situation. My internship that takes up 40 hours a week is full of catty, gossipy people who inject as much dramatic bitching into every aspect of their job that it literally sucks the joy out of my life. Anything I once enjoyed just doesn't hold the same electricity anymore. I'm under the supervision of the worst one who makes even the people we work with feel terrible. She makes jokes at their expense and thinks she's hilarious, but really, she's scarring the shit out of some very impressionable minds. I really do not enjoy being stuck here for as long as I am.

My best escape from all of this? Work. I clean toilets, essentially. It's probably the best part of any day. I know what has to be done, do it, and leave. It's simple and fairly consistent. I can only squeeze in work on the weekends, so I literally never have a day off. I gotta try and pay rent and gas and the new car payment AND THEN worry about trying to buy groceries. My parents are saints and try to help when they can, but things are not easy with 2 other dependent children. I try talking to them sometimes, but my mom just ""doesn't know what to do with me anymore."" I can't even vent to her without her stopping me to tell me I'm overwhelming her and that I sound like I'm losing it. There's a history of addiction and some mental illness on her side of the family. On my dad's side? A mystery. He was adopted and denied information about his biological family. 

With all the stress, my physical health is suffering. I recently found a lump on my body and panicked until I was bounced from doctor to doctor to reveal that there was nothing malignant about the lump and it should resolve itself over time. Thinking you have cancer for 2 weeks takes a huge toll on a person. I ended up with strep throat as well, and missed some days of school (for which I was reprimanded by my professors against university policy). This made it even harder to catch up with everything.

I feel like I can't keep my head above water.

I feel like I am going to crack under all this pressure.

I feel like I am losing my mind. I think my mom's right.

I called University health services about scheduling an appointment, but they have yet to call me back.

I'm nervous about seeking therapy or psychiatric help. Maybe you fine folks might provide me with some strategies to deal with anxiety or depression, some words of kindness/encouragement...anything really. Just knowing someone cared enough to read might be nice.

I want to learn how to let this go. I apologise if I come off as selfish, I know I have a lot of faults. I am trying to learn how to forget this experience, which quite frankly, was mortifying for me. 

Two years ago, I did an internship and my boss was a supervisor who had recently been promoted to a managerial position. She is only a few years older than me and it was her first year. As time went on, she became increasingly demanding, obsessed with details (not in a positive, constructive manner), and engaged in passive-aggressive acts that made the workplace very uncomfortable to be in. Eventually, my internship came to an end and my boss told me she couldn't give me any full-time offers because the department had no money in the budget to allocate for it. I accepted the explanation and left without any qualms until I discovered from a co-worker that my boss had, in fact, given the job that she told me didn't exist to someone else. 

I really needed work at that point and was undergoing a health issue. I tried contacting her and unsurprisingly received no response. I don't know why I couldn't let go at this point. I became so frustrated and panicked that I communicated with my boss's supervisor and the department head about the issue, requesting an internal investigation because I somehow felt my boss had discriminated against me. I felt as though I had been wronged and suffering an injustice. It got even worse when the investigation found out a co-worker had accessed my medical files without permission. 

I was able to get work elsewhere but the experience has haunted me since because I am so ashamed of the way I behaved. I still feel angry and envy over my boss. I found out she is still the manager, she makes more money than I do, and she recently got married to what appears to be an amazing guy. Her life seems perfect....and mine isn't. I am frustrated and embarrassed over why I keep thinking and comparing myself to her. 

Please help me figure out how to forgive and forget. 

TL;DR: I resent my former boss and want to learn how to get over it.

1np8u3,10,2013-10-03,Siren Song of the City,PublicTransit,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1np8u3/siren_song_of_the_city/,"
My son Jariah is missing. My little 8 year boy has been missing for nearly 2 months today; the police have no leads, and the case went cold last month.  Understandably, I’ve given my input to the case, but they say I’m delirious; I need rest. And to all honest ends, I understand their point of view. 

My little Jariah went missing late one evening while coming home from the subway around rush hour; and to preserve my safety, I won’t give any specific locations or names; they’ll be ‘X’d out. We were coming home, and it was fairly busy. The subway musician idly playing the music as they would; something which I and Jariah both enjoyed. It is always a change from the hustle-bustle of the train ride home from the malls, and the talking of strangers on phones or among their peers. I was never a people-person ever since my wife was murdered; or to be more correct, vanished. Her body was never found, but police deemed it as a murder. It was hard for both of us to move on and get on with our lives. But we managed eventually. 

However, this walk home would be a life changer; the subtle sounds of a man playing the tune on his violin and the clatter of shoes against the subway floor is what I’d usually hear until we passed through the turnstiles towards the exit and walk the rest of the way home.
 I always held my sons hand when we walked through the subway; any good father would but...

I remember losing the sound of his little feet; his innocent giggling about half way to the exit, when I looked down. In my hand, all I had was the single bag he’d carry. My little Jariah has disappeared. I freaked out as soon as I found out.

“Jariah?”  I called out, spinning around. “Jariah!!” I called back into the oncoming crowd. I rushed back, pushing between the people. I pushed people out of the way, unconcerned for their being. All I wanted was my son.

“Jahriah, where are you!!” I ran past the violinist, stopping as I ran by. “Sir, have you seen a little boy?! H-He just slipped out of my hand!” I yelled frantically. 

“Oh no; no I haven’t what did he look like?” he inquired, as he put down his violin. 

“H-he’s a little child, hip height, no taller than any of us!” I began to breath heavy. The violinist sat me down and began to try and stop the passersby. He suddenly picked me up y the shoulder.

“You go look down the line, I’ll be here to see if he ran back!” He gave me a quick push, and I nodded in compliance; my little boy is here somewhere, he can’t just vanish. I spent the next several hours pacing the subway hallways, scanning shops, bathrooms and spending a week’s worth of transport fair getting in and out of the turnstile. 

By now, the crowd was diminished. Only me, and the violinist remained in the now quiet halls. He only looked at me and shrugged. He began to pack his things.

“I’m sorry sir,” he said with sincerity in his voice, one only a street musician would know “I didn’t get any word on your child. I’ll put a call in with 911 rep-“

“No, I’ll do that.” I cut him off mid-word. My heart racing still, body sweating and feeling nauseous, we went our separate ways. We turned our backs and left the subway lines; him with his violin and change, me, more a less empty handed. I only had the little bag for children, with no child.

When I got out of the subway, I flicked open my phone; here I could get reception. I quickly dialed for the police, and to my dismay, they couldn’t put a search out until an entire day has passed. My heart sank for a moment. However, they were kind enough to send out a missing child alert for the region. It was enough to relax me for a moment. Now I live in a big city, in case you couldn’t tell, with the subway, and thankfully public televisions are set up all over the place and are always fixed on the news channel. With the report going around, someone somewhere must be able to find my child. 

That night when I got home, my body ached for the regular routine. I set two places at the table for dinner; my heart sinking when no one would be eagerly waiting on the other side. Later that evening, I called out, “Jariah! Come brush your tee--“ I cut myself off.  I went to Jariah’s room to tuck no one into bed, before reading the empty air a story, and then heading to sleep.

That night, I had a very unsettling dream. My son was running towards me and me towards him, but in the air around us, the sounds of violins were playing. They were playing a tune that would be soothing in any other situation but here, they were eerie; it wasn’t right. Next to that, as longer the dream progressed, the farther me and Jariah got; we just kept running towards each other, but we got farther.

I called out to him, “Jariah! Come here!!” and I heard him call back.
“I’m coming dad! I’m ...” His voice trailed off, as his figure disappeared into the unknown crevices of a dream. I awoke in a harsh cold sweat that morning, my eyes shooting open as the real world’s light brightly shone in as if nothing was wrong. Body aching and irritated. I breathed deeply; realising that my eyelashes were still bound by that morning crust. 

I sat up in my bed, remembering that I don’t need to wake up my son this morning; I didn’t need to make him breakfast or lunch for school. I sighed, and walked down into my silent living room. I begrudgingly turned on the TV, expecting world news, war and politics to be topping the headlines. But as I tuned the TV into the news channel, the headline caught my surprise.

“A young boy has gone missing on the XXXX line during 5:45 PM yesterday evening. Jariah XXXX went missing during the rush hour movement, and presumably disappeared into the thick crowds and was carried off. Police are currently putting out signs and information to help find this little boy.”

They’re looking for him! My heart leapt in my chest. For this information to have made it on the front of a major news network, it meant it was pretty big. The newscaster continued to list a few other names of the missing, but all I cared about was my Jariah. Although the news didn’t mend the hole in my heart that I had that morning, it did give me hope.

I had a rough day at work, I couldn’t concentrate for my life; I had pictures of me and Jariah around the small cubical I called an office. I worked in info and technology, so it’s not important to dwell on; but the images of my son distracted me. I found myself staring at one; a picture of us on a camping trip where he’d chopped his first log.  I just wanted him to leap out of the picture, and say “daddy, I’m okay, see? I could do it...”
I found myself mouthing those words; the words he spoke when I took that timed picture out on that trip.

“Hey.” A voice mumbled from behind me. I swivelled in my chair, still with a dreamy glare on my face.

“...Yeah?” I really wasn’t in the mood for talking. My friend, Ivan, leaned worriedly against my cubicle wall. He’d been a dear friend to me; he was there for me when my wife disappeared, and like an angel, here he is when my son vanished too.

“...I heard about your kid. Um...” He didn’t look at me, scared say too much in fear of offending me. “If you need anything; anything, man. Just ask. I’m here for you.” 

“...Yeah, thanks.” I tried to be sincere. But I don’t think Ivan would know where my son would be.

For three days, I lived in this routine. I’d wake up, and take the subway to work. Ivan would check up on me, I’d do what I can then head home. But, as you’d expect, I was starting to give in. With three days in, no leads and no idea or trace of my son, I was losing hope. And it was showing.

My boss caught me staring at some of the pictures of my son during my break.  He’s usually an all-business sort of guy, but I suppose he had some compassion for me. He sent me home; at least until they found my kid.  

I was thankful, in a way; I get to stay at home and the likes, but now all I can do is think. There is nothing to distract me from my little boy.  I took it upon myself to move the investigation forward; if the police and public are on the case, I should be as well.

That evening; the night I got sent home was rough.  I had that dream again. Me and my kid running to each other, and that song; the violin. It was enchanting; I’m surprised my mind could create such a melody; let alone remember it. 

I woke up violently when the dream ended. I was out of bed, and my face was on the carpet and I was right in front of my bedroom door. I must have been sleep walking; probably trying to find my son in my sleep but too stupid to open the door.

That morning I ate a big breakfast and suited up. I was going to look for my son. I ran back to the station, begrudgingly paying for entry just to get in, and started walking with the crowd. I looked at the people passing by.

‘One of these people has to have been here when my kid vanished; if I can remember a face I can ask them where he went!’ I thought. A stupid concept, realising that I didn’t remember anyone’s face from nearly a week ago, but I had to feed myself any hope I could create. 
I looked from side to side, pacing the station hallway. The faces of people; so stone-faced and unforgiving made it difficult to tell them apart. However, I noticed that around noon, the violinist from before was back, setting up his instrument and opening his case to collect the change of people walking by. He quickly got to playing his tune; a solemn song that, at first, made me uneasy. But as the song progressed, it helped me concentrate. I could better see the faces around me. 

A few people began to drop change into his case, and others even stopped to listen; people who looked like they had places to be. They sat quietly on the benches close by, or stood across the hall just to listen. I was tempted to sit down and listen as well, but I had to keep concentrated; if I could find one similar face, I’d be able to at least get some info.

Unfortunately, my ‘brilliant’ idea was a major flop. I spent my entire day pacing up and down that subway line, with not a morsel of evidence. By the time I was done, the violinist was packing up as well. A couple people from earlier were still there; maybe one or two of them had actually left the station a while back. 

I was surprised to see them still sitting or standing where I had last seen them, idly listening to his song. But now that it was over, they looked a little sad, disappointed. 

As he packed up his things and began to move out of the station, the others left as well. They all left through the same exit; heading up some escalators to the bus terminal I never need to use.
I went home that evening empty handed; the single clicking of the turnstile only exasperated that fact. 

The walk home was not silent however. Today I was lucky enough to have a busker playing a saxophone outside of a bar raise my spirit a little, with a couple drunkards and a vagrant or two listening in on his inspiring song.

By the time I got home it was 10-something in the evening. I was hungry, tired and depressed; flicking on the TV with the news only repeating the fact my son is missing and not a trace of him to be heard. I just wanted to sleep at this point. I quickly microwaved some canned food, and ate alone, sitting in the stereo voices from my television before going to sleep.

I didn’t have a ‘visual’ dream that evening. It was more like just the sound of music playing in my head. It left me tranquil and helped me, I guess, because this morning I didn’t wake up on the floor. 

Today, I’m not going to go through with a stupid idea. I was going to go look around the city, and pass out fliers. I quickly cropped a picture of my kid and just threw it onto a MS paint image and printed a whole bunch out and shoved them into a bag. As I passed through the subway again, there was another subway musician instead of that violinist. He had that same thing going on; people sitting around the area listening. A different batch of people too; so it wasn’t like the same people are just interested in street musicians. Thankfully, the subway wasn’t all that busy today, so I was quick to pass through.
I quickly marched by, and boarded a train to a busier side of town. As I exited the train, I saw another street musician, with that same phenomenon of people crowding around her as she played. Then I hatched a plan. I walked up to the person playing her song.

“Excuse me, miss? Can I leave a few of these fliers here? My kid is missing and I could use some help looking for him.” I shyly mumbled.
“Huh? Oh sure.” She tapped her foot; gesturing for me to leave it by her case. She was very kind, and I left enough sheets for rush hour. I dropped a 20’ in her case and moved outside. It was a nice day outside, so I was lucky to be out there at that time. I stood on the corner, handing out the flier; trying to talk to people, who would only shake their head no to the question “Have you seen my boy?”
At one point, I shamefully broke down on that busy city corner.  People stopped taking the flier, and just walked past. I sat against the pole, with my head in my arms.

“Hey, are you okay?” a soft, tender voice of a woman caught my ear. I looked up; a shameful red was strewn across my face. She had a keyboard on her back, and was setting it up in front of me.

“Looks like you need some help...” she set her fingers on the keys, and began to play a soothing melody. Slowly, over time, people began to flock, taking the papers and hanging around. I felt instantly better once she started to play; a heavenly little tune and I sat against that pole for a while, just listening. 

At one point, she tapped my shoulder. “Sorry man, I need to get going. I have other places to be...” 

“...O-Oh! Okay. Thanks for the help.” I stood up and shook her gentle hand, and she walked down the street; the crowd dispersing after she left; some trailed behind her into the crowd, and others into the other crowd...

I ran out of papers unknowingly, so I was forced to head home.  The subway surprisingly absent of music here; and thankfully none of my missing child posters were scattered across the ground like I anticipated.

The station near where I lived had a musician, playing his song, which helped me get home, and go about my evening with his song in my head. I hummed it as I brushed my teeth, went to peek into my son’s empty room, and eventually hummed myself to sleep.

The dream that evening was that soothing song that lady in the city played for me; just lulling me to the point of euphoria. No images, nothing in particular. Just her song.

I did this for a couple weeks, with the same sort of scenario; some sort of musician stopping by to help me attract a couple of people, and I’d swiftly run out of papers and I’d be forced to head home. And every night, I'd have some sort of musical dream.

However, by the second month, some serious shit went down. After no progress in the case, and the news getting bored of a stale story, I was forced to do all the interviewing and talking myself. On my way home, I stopped to talk to a subway musician who was packing up; she said she didn’t see anything, as I expected, and her and her little pose of businessmen, students and stuff getting up with her; the very few people I actually saw on the subway that evening. We bid our farewells, as her and her ‘group’ went off to the station, and I, towards the exit. 

That’s when curiosity hit me. Where did all those people go to? They always seem to leave in the same direction. I decided to follow them a good distance away. They made a right; I made a right. They headed up some stairs, and I followed. One more right; I followed—and they were gone.

“What the fuck?” I mumbled out loud. I was outside of the station, on the corner of a street; the musician, and those people were gone. I spun around. I must have made a wrong turn or something; I made a mistake somewhere. I swiftly turned around, before bumping into someone.

“Shit, I’m sorry-“ it was that musician. She was carrying her instrument on her back; everything about her was fine until I looked at her eyes. There was something wrong; such an aggressive glare, so full of malice, hatred. They quickly and suddenly changed to a friendly look.
“Oh, don’t worry about it!” she said, with an up-beat tone.
We walked past each other; my heart pounding against my ribs. Her glare was so... mean; so harsh. I could still feel her eyes glaring at me, as if—I’m sure she was facing the other way but; I could feel her eyes, melting holes in the back of my head.

I briskly walked home, and never in my life have I locked my front door so quickly. I sighed deeply as I sunk into the couch, and turned on the TV. Never once, did I bother getting out of my own head to notice the long line; the names, upon names of disappearance cases across the city!

“Holy shit.” I mumbled. There was some serious crap going down here, and I’ll be damned if I’m caught up in it. But I still need to find my kid; I’m not leaving here without him.

I didn’t sleep that evening; at least not for long. For the brief moment I’d close my eyes, I swore I could hear music. As soon as I’d open my eyes, it’d be gone, and nothing but the sounds of the city would be heard.  I kept myself awake with coffee and an energy drink that I kept in the back of my fridge for working late nights at home.

I went back out empty handed around five the next morning, and I wasted no time getting to the subway to head downtown to see Ivan; something is happening, and he needed to know. There was one of those subway musicians again, playing a song of some sort. I had no time to stop. 

But as I passed that musician... right as soon as I passed, him, he hit a sour note; and it rung in my head and sank into my heart. I don’t know what happened, but I looked at him, with some unintentional fear on my face. He had this smug look; he smiled while he continued his song as if nothing wrong had happened. I had this irrational urge to go and sit by him; to listen to his song. But his damn face; that sour note; I couldn’t. With those things on my mind, I turned around and kept walking.

I blocked out all sounds from around me as best I could. As soon as I got onto the train, I knew I was home free; at least for a bit. When those train doors opened, I charged out; passing another musician. 
I never felt so much dread in a public place. When I passed this musician, she played, like the last one, harsh, rough, sour note when I walked by. It made the hairs on the back of my neck jump up, and I cringed. I ignored it as best I could; I had to get to Ivan. 

By the time I got to my workplace, it was mid day, and it took much longer than normal to get up the floor Ivan and I worked on; the elevator was broken and I’m not much of an athlete. By the time I got up those several flights of stairs, I was drained, and sweating like a pig. My boss caught onto me, probably because of how heavy I was breathing and was quick to address me.

“ ‘The hell are you doing here? You don’t need to be at work right now.”

“I...I need....” I let out a hot, deep breath. “I need to see Ivan.” 

“Hey, don’t you watch the news? Ivan went missing too.”

My heart sank to my feet. I felt sick; whatever the hell is going on, it got Ivan as well.

“Yeah” by boss continued “I’m sure he’ll turn up sooner or later. Dont get worked up too much. He’s a big guy, he’ll be fine.”

“Yeah...” I mumbled, turning towards the stairs, my hands beginning to shake, and my forehead wet with a cold sweat. 

“Hey! Be careful out there, kiddo.” Those were the last words my boss said to me on the way out.

I hung around in the building for a bit, just taking it all in. My wife, My kid, and now my best friend are missing; gone. Poof. Kaput, into some unknown void. 

I just wanted to go home. I walked out of the building around sunset after my head cleared up and I wasn’t sweating or panting. 

I went down to the subway, half expecting to see some sort of subway busker just standing there playing a song. But no. There was no one; no busker, no music. Just no one except the one or three people on the platform and the ticket taker. 

Now this area is packed with people by this hour, and my head is spinning. Where is everyone? Where is everyone going off to! A train arrived, and inside was virtually no one. I was quietly panicking; I could see what was happening, but what was causing it.

When I got to my station, the two people on the train came off with me. I tried to stay close to them, it made me feel a lot better. But when we passed one lone musician in the halls. They stopped, and listened. In my head, I’m trying to call them back; ‘keep walking... keep walking!’ but they stood, and they listened to that musician.

I booked it; I ran out of that station and onto the street. Something about those people; the music players and the fucking song--.
In the middle of my panicking epiphany, the sound of a lone violin was playing. Behind me, I saw, under one of the only lit streetlights, a lone musician, with a couple vagrants sitting around the area. 

His song, was strange at first; a few sour notes, and a little of tempo.  I turned away; getting ready to sprint home when...
The sound, of his violin became... angry. It was harsh, and it was being played very roughly, only barely on its notes.
 
I slowly turned my body, to see him in the middle of the street, playing his distorted melody, on his violin. I could feel my pupils shrinking. I began to wheeze and cough; barely being able to keep him in focus. Then, I swear by my heart; the light in the city, became... unmoving; static, light, that didn’t go anywhere past its source. It just all stopped. Windows became a solid colour of yellow; lights and lamps just became some sort of buzzing grey. I stopped coughing, fearing that noise would cause this phenomenon to take my being away, off this earth.

I could hear the sound of his violin becoming softer; the vibrato in its song began to stir, and a black haze began to emit from the bow. It sunk, and formed around his feet, devouring the colour from anything it touched, and It began to form its way towards me. 
Dark, sinister whispers were coming from that fucking cloud, or fog, whatever it was. It was telling me to ‘go towards the song’, ‘it will make you happy’, ‘leave the world behind’.

 I was dying inside; my heart was trying to leap out of my chest and run; every muscle in my body was frozen to a concrete state, and I couldn’t look away. He just played his song, and I listened. The only thing that I could move were my eyes; I couldn’t blink, I could barely breath, and I had to watch, as that fog began to creep towards me.
The whispers became louder, as if they were right in my ear; sinister temptation forced into my head, and slowly, without cue, my left food inched forward. 

“No...” My right foot followed in time. 

“No...!” My left foot went forward again; the whispers beginning to become a cackle, and the sound of his violin becoming louder. The world around became hellish; they began to bend and distort; the apartments began to lean in over us, like hands clasping onto a small insect in its palm.

“No...!” My right food shuffled forward, and this song; that hellish, nightmarish tune began to break me down; I felt my body being forced to move. I was losing control of myself.

By now, that fucking musician was engulfed in that hell fog; nothing but an inhuman form of almost liquid evil. The once-fog now dripped from his arms and anything too sharp to rundown.
I was losing myself. I was going to listen. 

“No.”

“No!” I raised my voice; hoping that someone would hear me, someone would break me free.

“NO!!” I screamed, drowning out the song, and I could feel my arms come back to my power; I clasped them over my ears and yelled louder than I ever have. I shut my eyes; my knees gave in, and I put every ounce of air in me in that last, final yell.

It was nearly a minute before I ran out of breath. I slowly, fearfully... opened my eyes.

The world outside was quiet. The vagrants looking at me in the middle of the street, on my knees and panting like I’d run a marathon in a minute. The musician stopped playing his song, and was looking at me worried.

He briskly walked over to my side. “Sir, you look I’ll. You should come with me to the hospital!”

“No...! I—I know what you are now...!” I mumbled, backing away on all fours.

“Come... With... Me.” His voice; distorted and perverted with a sinister intention. He looked at me, and I looked at him. His eyes; a feral and inhuman glare; filled with hate; full of malice. 

I got up and ran. And I fucking ran! I got home in what felt like a fraction of a second, and I shut everything. Doors, windows, shutters—everything.  I hid in my bedroom, under my blanket; just wishing to never see anything till daylight. In my panicking breath, and delirious thoughts... I could hear the sounds of alluring melodies just beyond my walls.

I didn’t go out till the next morning, and here I am at work. Writing out this bullshit explanation on what the fuck is happening in my city. 
A whole bunch of interns came in to replace those who went missing from the company, and there are more than I hoped.  Just a whole bunch of new faces from out of town. They never found my kid by the way. Ivan is still missing, and there has been no word on the other disappearances.

The interns seem to be going off somewhere though. 

...I can hear a soothing melody, from just outside these walls. I think I'll go check it out. Just take a break and have a listen. Maybe then, I can be happy.

1np3zo,2,2013-10-03,My [23F] roommate's BF [23F/23M] has moved in without discussion. What do I say?,kaijuhunter,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1np3zo/my_23f_roommates_bf_23f23m_has_moved_in_without/,"I moved in with my roommate in December. We are both moving out in January, she to live with her BF and me on my own. We currently live in a small 2 bedroom basement suite with reasonable rent.

Her and her BF seemed to split their time equally between our place and his parents' place. Recently, however, her BF left for and returned from an internship out of country and his parents apparently became very unpleasant. His family is passive aggressive and doesn't communicate. I sympathize, but as a result they've stopped going to his place completely and are here 24/7.

Both of us are students and we're not always home. I have my gf over some of the time as well - probably 2-3 nights a week.

He's a decent guy, it's not that I don't like him or don't understand his situation, but I'm starting to become resentful of the fact that they didn't discuss this with me at all and he's not paying any rent. I know we're only going to be here for another 3 months but I if I let my resentment build and don't work through this it won't be fun for anyone.

The problem is I don't even know what to say. I would feel weird and uncomfortable asking him to contribute money. He basically lives in her room and they buy all their own food. I'm an intensely introverted &amp; private person and best I can tell, part of what bothers me is the fact that someone lives in my space who I don't know and am not comfortable around. But I don't know how to fix it. ):

What can I do?

---

TL;DR: My roommate's BF has moved into our tiny basement suite, they didn't consult me, I am resentful and uncertain of what to do or say. Also not sure if I should even do or say anything, as we are moving in 3 months and he's not a terrible roomie or anything."
1nt8j8,11,2013-10-05,Throwaway here - Girlfriend drove drunk and pounded on my front door last night. I might be single now? Help.,ALthrowitaway,actuallesbians,https://www.reddit.com/r/actuallesbians/comments/1nt8j8/throwaway_here_girlfriend_drove_drunk_and_pounded/,"I've been a sometimes active member of AL for a while but needed a throwaway for this one. I just feel like I can't talk to anyone and I really need help. Thanks in advance for just listening. 

For the backstory, keep reading. For immediate advice, jump to the TL;DR

Backstory: My girlfriend (25) and I (22) have been together off and on for a little over 7 months. In the spring when we got together, we spent a LOT of time together and jumped into things really quickly. We also got in fights on occasion, the likes of which I'd never really encountered before, involving some pretty nasty talk which would later sort of resolve and we'd get love-y again. For the first few weeks of summer vacation we spent even more time together, and because I didn't have many plans or obligations I was available almost all the time. A little while into the summer I moved for an internship and we were long distance. This was definitely hard on both of us, and I recognize that I wasn't the best at it at first. I got pretty busy and wasn't being attentive or flexible for a while, but we got through it. Near the end of the summer stuff was getting worse, with my girlfriend often accusing me of cheating on her, getting mad at me for talking about work, and once telling me I had to skip work to talk to her (I didn't do this, and she later apologized for it). We also got into two big fights about family - I'm incredibly close with my family, but she is semi-estranged from hers because they are very uncomfortable and unaccepting of her being gay. She got mad at me for not ""making it clear"" earlier in our relationship that I was so close with my family, and told me that she tries to make her own family with her friends, and sort of expected me to do the same and be willing to put her on the same level as my family (which I wasn't ready for). So things were getting worse and right before I came back from my internship, I broke up with her.

Yeah, I know, here's where it starts to get weird. About 2 weeks after breaking up, I missed her and wanted to talk to her. Well we talked, which led to kissing and more and a whole weekend of spending time together and being super cutesy. I realized we jumped in way too hard without discussing any problems, I got super uncomfortable, and I broke it off. THEN, 3 weeks later, she ends up talking to me again, we talk more, talks get serious and we end up seeing each other again. After hanging out for a while and talking a LOT, we decide to give things another try. Now over the summer and over the past two months, I did have some revelations and decide some things I needed to do. I knew I needed to take care of myself more in general. Some of the big ways I have been doing this are: 1) Making a pretty tight schedule for keeping up with my college classes and meetings and other obligations, and 2) Creating a better budget so that my spending didn't get out of hand and 3) sleep in my own bed - I sleep terribly when I'm not in my own bed and it used to really detriment me when I did it a lot with her (lots of back pain, didn't really sleep, etc.) My girlfriend has gotten really upset with me over all 3 of those, for different reasons. 1) because I'm so rigid and make her feel like she has to keep to my schedule and that I give her deadlines, 2) because I didn't account for spending money with her or going out to eat at least once a week and 3) because it means a lot to her when I sleep in her bed, and she basically doesn't feel like we can be counted as a real couple unless we are regularly sleeping in the same bed (this bed has to be hers, however.)

So fast forward to last night. Here's where the TL;DR comes in

**Kinda long ish TL;DR:** Girlfriend asks me to come out to a bar with her on a Friday night, though I tell her I have to be up early and can't stay out long. Tell her I'm not sure if I can make it to bar, she gets upset, so I go to the bar. At bar she starts getting affectionate with me, then stops when another lesbian comes by. When she walks me out and I ask about this, she smiles and says someone is trying to hook them up. She and I end up in yelling fight in parking lot, she storms off, I drive home. She then gets drunker and tells me I have to come back to the bar (I am going to sleep because I have to be up at 6am). When I say I can't, she drunk drives over to my house (she had told me her friends barred her from driving because she was so drunk). Even though I told her I refused to talk to her if she drove, she POUNDS on my apartment door for half an hour and calls me 13 times. Today I see she has deleted all social media, including Facebook, Twitter, OKCupid, and she may have blocked me on Gchat. She hasn't spoken to me yet. Am I single now?

**Super TL;DR:** Girlfriend drunk drives to my house after a fight, pounds on my door for half an hour, then deletes all social media. What the hell do I do?"

[So. Was Blue (Da Ba Bee\) suggested as a song?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1nsvvf/i_am_breaking_bad_and_the_walking_dead_music/cclp92m?context=5)|Nope.
[Welcome, Thomas! The moment that cemented my love for Breaking Bad was the final scene of Season 1, at the impound lot with Tuco. Gnarls Barkely's ""Who's Gonna Save My Soul"" plays the scene out, and it couldn't sum up Walt and Jesse's realization of how deep in shit they are any better.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1nsvvf/i_am_breaking_bad_and_the_walking_dead_music/cclqnqo?context=5)|I can't speak to my favorite as I love them all, but am really happy to see you pointed out Gnarls Barkley's ""Who's Gonna Save My Soul"" at the end of season 1.
[What has been your favorite music related scene or piece you've worked on, and why?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1nsvvf/i_am_breaking_bad_and_the_walking_dead_music/cclqnqo?context=5)|We actually had a dilemma with that episode in that the writer's strike at the time ended our season early.  There were originally going to be two more episodes one in which Jesse Pinkman was going to be killed.  Thank God that didn't happen!  When we got to the end of episode 107, which was going to be a relatively straightforward episode ender, we realized that this was suddenly going to be the season finale.  By chance, I happened to be in Park City, Utah for a DJ gig at the Sundance Film Festival and bumped into my old friend Daniele Luppi, who had been working on the 2nd Gnarls Barkley record.  I didn't even realize there was one in the works.  When I got back to LA, I reached out to Danger Mouse and got an early version of that album.  That song struck me as being a perfect way of being able to make more of the scene than was originally there.  It worked out and we closed out the first season in style.
[I absolutely loved the music in Breaking Bad, but my favorite musical moments happened during the end credits (at least in the netflix version of the show\), where you would remix an important sound that occurred during the show into a song.  For instance, the moment when you put hector's bell into music was utterly fantastic as a viewer and a listener.  Now comes my question.  What is your favorite song in real life, and what was your favorite song in the show?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1nsvvf/i_am_breaking_bad_and_the_walking_dead_music/cclp4ta?context=5)|Hi Mrninja101.  I should point out that the end title music for each episode of Breaking Bad is created by our very talented composer Dave Porter.  He creates all those elegant call-backs and does remarkable work for Breaking Bad.  There are two soundtracks of his work available online.  Check Amazon.  Well worth picking up.  Can't speak to my favorite song or favorite song in Breaking Bad.  There are too many wonderful ones, and you wouldn't ask a nun what her favorite child was in the orphanage.  There's my diplomatic answer...
[Was there  ever a song that you wanted to use in Breaking Bad but couldn't find a way to fit it in?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1nsvvf/i_am_breaking_bad_and_the_walking_dead_music/cclpanc?context=5)|There are tons of them.  Someday I'll look into putting together an 'almost made it onto Breaking Bad' mix and upload to our website, or Spotify.  
[Hi Thomas, thanks for all your work on the show! The music you chose gave Breaking Bad an even greater atmosphere than it had on its own.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1nsvvf/i_am_breaking_bad_and_the_walking_dead_music/cclpnal?context=5)|The creation of the narcocorrido ""Negro y Azul: The Ballad of Heisnberg"" was one of the most challenging efforts on Breaking Bad, and one that I am very proud of.  Vince and the Breaking Bad writers had found an amazing video to a narcocorrido online and sent it over to me.  ""We want to make one of these about 'Heisenberg'"" was the directive.
[Are there any good stories for the song ""Negro y Azul""? How did you find that group of musicians? What made them stand out?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1nsvvf/i_am_breaking_bad_and_the_walking_dead_music/cclpnal?context=5)|I looked into existing artists in the narcocorrido field but found that everybody I spoke to either had an outstanding warrant, or had immigration issues or otherwise needed to be paid in cash, which wasn't an option.  Sony Picture Television wouldn't allow us to work 'under-the-table' so I reached out to one of the Godfathers of the genre Pepe Garza who runs a radio station that plays narcocorridos and also writes songs.  He was hired to adapt a song that was written by the writers, and we reached out to Sony Music Latin who brought Los Cuates De Sinaloa to the table.  It all came together in a low-key studio in Burbank and we shot the video on location in Albuquerque.  It was a great adventure...
[Why ""Knife Party - Bonfire""?  That was the most startling moment for me in all of Breaking Bad.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1nsvvf/i_am_breaking_bad_and_the_walking_dead_music/cclptev?context=5)|We have Walt Sr. and Walt Jr. both acting like clowns.  Writer Sam Catlin and Director Rian Johnson made a product placement opportunity into something really fun and story-specific and a bro-step rager like ""Bonfire"" felt right for it.  Glad you liked it too...
[I think my favourite music moment was repeating the full version of the intro in the penultimate episode. Felt so epic. Was that something you'd planned to do for a while and were trying to find the right time?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1nsvvf/i_am_breaking_bad_and_the_walking_dead_music/cclpcyt?context=5)|That was all Dave Porter, our very talented composer for Breaking Bad.
[Hey bud, so you're the chap who came up with Apparat's Goodbye for the scene where Gus walks towards the retirement home?  I'd like to shake your hand someday, maybe.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1nsvvf/i_am_breaking_bad_and_the_walking_dead_music/cclr42q?context=5)|Thanks, Quakespeare.  I will be happy to share in that handshake.  That was another scene that I am particularly proud of.  I remember that when Vince Gilligan first watched that scene with that song, he said it was one of his favorite music moments in the series up to that point.  
[Do you ever walk around with head phones on and try to score the world with the perfect music?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1nsvvf/i_am_breaking_bad_and_the_walking_dead_music/cclq3y3?context=5)|All the time. Every moment you are alive is an opportunity to be creative and playing music through your adventures in life is a very nice way to spend it.  IMO.
[Hi, Thomas. Thanks for the AMA. I realise there might be several questions from Breaking Bad fans about that final scene in Felina, so I'll get mine in early. Before Vince Gilligan suggested Baby Blue, did you have any other songs in mind? How aware were you of Badfinger's work?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1nsvvf/i_am_breaking_bad_and_the_walking_dead_music/cclp2a7?context=5)|Hi no1partyanthem, I was already well aware of Badfinger's work, and that song ""Baby Blue"" was in one of my mixtapes, but not one I sent off to Vince.  I liked the song, but didn't really have a scene in mind for it.  It was Vince who pulled it from his iPod when he was first working on the final episode, which he wrote and directed.  Before I saw the scene, I pulled together a number of ideas - one which I thought worked pretty beautifully against picture: The Bees ""No More Excuses"" - but once I saw that beautiful shot, and saw the scene in context, I realized why Vince was so strongly attached to the Badfinger song.  It's tricky for us as music supervisors in that we keep pulling together ideas and revising them.  None of us know the right answer until we are at the very end of that process and have cut and locked picture to work with.  Vince is just really talented at knowing what the final effect he is looking for, and knew early on that Badfinger's ""Baby Blue"" was the right choice for what he was looking to do.  It took until the final picture was assembled that I was able to also see what a fantastic choice it was.
[Hi Thomas - Thank you for taking the time to answer our questions. The tone of Breaking Bad gets much darker as the season go on. How did you try to capture that with the music? (genre, etc.\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1nsvvf/i_am_breaking_bad_and_the_walking_dead_music/cclp5j1?context=5)|That's a tricky question.  I would say, we always work with picture and with the story we are telling.  By making sure we are always sensitive to that, we will deliver the right answers.  In some cases, when the story in Breaking Bad is at its darkest - for example Ozymandias, this season - we ended up presenting a song to Vince ""Take My True Love By The Hand"" that was deceptively upbeat, but it did speak to the story we were telling and allowed the audience to take a little breath after the brutal actions that had preceded it.
[How hard was it to decide the music for the Breaking Bad ending? Did Vince have a say?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1nsvvf/i_am_breaking_bad_and_the_walking_dead_music/cclp5ek?context=5)|Vince always has a say.  Breaking Bad is great because of Vince Gilligan's talent and generosity.  He encourages all of us who work on the show - whether it be Bryan Cranston, Aaron Paul and the rest of the case, or Michael Slovis, our incredible Director of Photography or any of the members of his team, or the rest of the crew - to do our very best work, and he guides all of us to the best creative answers based upon the options we deliver to him.  So, Vince has say in everything.  It's his tireless work and generosity of spirit that make the show so special.
[One of my favorite parts about the series was it's ability to use silence just as well as music to create tensions and dramatic moments.  We're you involved at all in the decisions on where to add music but also where silence would be more effective?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1nsvvf/i_am_breaking_bad_and_the_walking_dead_music/cclqc3d?context=5)|Excellent question. You guys are asking some really smart ones... We have what is called a 'music spotting session' where the showrunner, or director (for a film) and the key producers, editors, music editor, composer, music supervisor and often the key sound effects and dialogue supervisors all gather together in a room to watch the episode from start to finish and discuss all music, foley (sound effects) and dialogue (ADR) needs for the episode.  This is a very creative session and we present, or come up with all the creative directives there. Then we each go back to our studios or workplaces and assemble the options or elements to deliver to the producers.  In the case of Breaking Bad, we are very careful to use silence as a key ingredient in our creative palate.  
[Why did you chose ""Breathe Me""?  Excellent choice, by the way.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1nsvvf/i_am_breaking_bad_and_the_walking_dead_music/cclp12x?context=5)|Thank you, Morrison 21.  Myself and my former partner in SMV, Gary Calamar, were both introduced to Sia when she guested on the Zero 7 record many years ago.  We were big fans of that record and reached out to her management in Australia for more of her music.  Gary and I were both DJs at Los Angeles radio station KCRW at the time.  Folks don't remember this, but Sia's ""Breathe Me"" was actually used in the trailer for Season 5.  Alan Ball loved the song so much that he decided it was what we should use to build the final sequence of the show, and that's how it came together.  There's a much longer story about the complexities of making it work, but it was another mixtape discovery. 
[I have a bit of background in clearances for musical works. I'm curious what difficultly you've had in obtaining sync licenses for certain songs in the course of your career (especially given that producers/writers/directors/etc. may really depend on getting those specific selections\)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1nsvvf/i_am_breaking_bad_and_the_walking_dead_music/cclp7r6?context=5)|Breaking Bad was a very poorly budgeted show.  The entire production really strained to get the job done with the budget were afforded.  It was because of Vince's stewardship and the quality of the scripts and production that everyone brought their A-game to the table.  It would have been a lot easier if we'd had a more reasonable budget to work with.  As far as sync licensing, we did our best to make the case for licensing music within those very narrow parameters and were very lucky in the generosity and understanding that was afforded us by our film and television licensing colleagues.  Smart directors and showrunners recognize that we are the experts in licensing and when we let them know that something is unlikely to be affordable, they will entertain additional ideas that we present.  It's always a struggle, but we do our best to be fair and honest with everyone about what we can and can't offer.
[How was ""Crapa Pelada"" chosen for the scene at Gale's house? And did you ever consider using ""Albuquerque"" by Neil Young at any point for the show?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1nsvvf/i_am_breaking_bad_and_the_walking_dead_music/cclpdjq?context=5)|That's a good question.  As much as ""Baby Blue"" and ""Crystal Blue Persuasion"" are both pretty on-the-nose, we generally don't do too many literal song choices in the show.  Also, Neil Young is notoriously difficult to license so we tend to avoid pitching his songs.  ""Crapa Pelada"" was a song I discovered on a compilation of music from the 1930-1960s of Italian pop music from the Sugar Label.  It's one of those songs I would DJ out when I had painted myself into a corner and needed to cleanse the proverbial palate.  When we discovered that the very talented David Costabile, who played Gale Boetticher, was also a talented singer, it gave us a wonderful opportunity to showcase that skill.  Gale always seemed like a character that would travel the world with great love and enthusiasm and would want to learn the local languages and learn the local songs.   This was a particularly difficult one to sing, but David knocked it out of the park.  Also check his full-length version of Gale singing 'Major Tom' in a Thai karaoke joint.  It's a genius performance.
[Did you consider Bob Dylan's ""It's AllOver Now, Baby blue"" for the BB finale? Seems like a dumb question but what a great song about tangled webs, no?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1nsvvf/i_am_breaking_bad_and_the_walking_dead_music/cclpqph?context=5)|Love the song, but it's been used too many times in high-profile scenes.  I try to not to re-use songs that have been used really well before against picture.  Martin Scorcese's ""Goodfellas"" took a lot of amazing music off the creative table for us, as did Paul Thomas Anderson's ""Boogie Nights"".  Hopefully we used music in a creative dynamic and exciting way on 'Breaking Bad', 'The Walking Dead' and 'Ray Donovan' and those songs have a strong home in the imagination of fans.  
[Hey Thomas. Do you do record/produce/create your own music? If so, what is your setup gear wise?  Also, how big is your record collection? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1nsvvf/i_am_breaking_bad_and_the_walking_dead_music/cclp32v?context=5)|Great question, prariedan.  I do produce music.  I have a mash-up music production project called 'The Arbiters'.  You can download two EPs of music for free from my bandcamp site:  [Link to arbiters.bandcamp.com](http://arbiters.bandcamp.com)  The first EP was inspired by Brian Burton aka Danger Mouse's ""Grey Album"" and was completed in 2006 and called ""They Are Biters"".  The song ""Sure Side of Fame"" which was a mash-up of Lou Reed ""Walk on the Wild Side"", David Bowie ""Fame"", St. Germain ""Sure Thing"" and vocals by Biggie and Tupac got a nice amount of club and radio play.  The second EP ""Arrival"" was released in 2010.  You can download them both from that website.  I use Ableton software to create them and work with co-producers who polish my ideas nicely.
[If you could be any character from Breaking Bad or The Walking Dead, who would it be?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1nsvvf/i_am_breaking_bad_and_the_walking_dead_music/cclqeq8?context=5)|Badger  :)
[Have you ever regretted a either using, or not using a certain song, or piece of music? Any particular faux-pas spring to mind...?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1nsvvf/i_am_breaking_bad_and_the_walking_dead_music/cclpb6c?context=5)|That's a great question.  On Breaking Bad there is only one song that I didn't love, and we placed it because of a clearance problem at the very last minute.  For the sake of discretion, I don't want to point it out.  But that project suffers from almost no mis-steps.  I don't really think it's my job to look back at the work and judge it.  That's for you folks to do... 
[What was your favorite piece to work on for Breaking Bad?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1nsvvf/i_am_breaking_bad_and_the_walking_dead_music/cclp2lf?context=5)|Great question, Torquedo.  I am not sure.  There are so many wonderful scenes that I've spent countless long sleepless nights working on.  I love what I do, and there is a special magic when you find that perfect song that falls beautifully against picture and tells your story in a unique and surprising way.  There's nothing quite like that feeling.  Sometimes it comes very quickly and sometimes it takes days or weeks of digging to find.  So, I can't really answer that.  But if you take a look at our website: [Link to www.supermusicvision.com](http://www.supermusicvision.com) myself and my team have assembled clips of a few of our favorites. cheers...
[What were the reasons you chose Tom Wait's *Hold On* for Beth to sing in Walking Dead?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1nsvvf/i_am_breaking_bad_and_the_walking_dead_music/cclpfk5?context=5)|That was a song that then showrunner Glen Mazzara chose for the scene.  I love Tom Waits - I wore a ""Tom Waits for No One"" pin on my jacket in highschool - and had spent the better part of a decade looking for a home for one of his songs without any luck.  We almost found a home for ""Big Black Mariah"" in a scene in Six Feet Under when Nate has a fantasy sequence that he is in the afterlife waiting room in a restaurant with his dead dad, but we ran out of music budget and couldn't afford it.  I was thrilled that Glen was up for using ""Hold On"" and actress Emily Kinney did a great job singing it.
[Will you be working at all on the spin off show for Saul Goodman? Do you know anything about it that you could tell us?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1nsvvf/i_am_breaking_bad_and_the_walking_dead_music/cclpzgn?context=5)|We'll see.  Nobody has asked me yet.  Fingers crossed.
[Hey Thomas, can you talk a little about how you became a music supervisor? Do you also play any instruments?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1nsvvf/i_am_breaking_bad_and_the_walking_dead_music/cclp2tr?context=5)|Hi Scooby4.  There is a ""Huffington Post"" interview that gets into some detail about my road into music supervision.  I'm sure you can find it with a quick search.  In short... I went to film school at Boston University, and ended up getting into journalism because of the war in Yugoslavia in 1991, and ended up working as a writer and journalist for the next 10 years or so.  I started an internet magazine in Los Angeles called the ""LA Magnet"" Los Angeles Magazine on the Net.  But lost a lot of money trying to keep it alive.  We were too early, and there were no city-oriented online magazines at the time.  I volunteered at KCRW 89.9 FM a radio station here in LA, and was offered a job doing A&amp;R (artist &amp; repertoire) and realized I would be terrible at it.  Somebody suggested I look into music supervision, which I didn't even know was a job.  I met G. Marq Roswell through my friend Gary Calamar and started working for his company as an intern.  I worked as an intern for a year, learned the basic ropes and then broke off on my own, where I spent the next two years eating Ramen noodles and barely making rent.  But I learned a lot, and with hard work and perseverance, I was eventually able to make a living at it and build the company I have today. 
[Hey Thomas thank you for everything you've done to bring such awesome music to the fore. I'm curious what would you say is the best pairing of music and image in movies or tv that you have seen outside of your own work?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1nsvvf/i_am_breaking_bad_and_the_walking_dead_music/cclp3dg?context=5)|Great question Savvy_Sav.  I will go back to the experience that I think started it all for me: Stanley Kubrick's ""2001: A Space Odyssey"".  My dad brought  me to the Nickelodeon Theatre in Boston for a screening of the 10th annniversary of the film.  I was 10 years old and completely mesmerized by the experience.  I still think all of us are working our way up to what Stanley Kubrick did in 1968.
[Thanks for doing this AMA! How many genres will you typically experiment with when trying to choose music for a scene?  Or do you typically immediately have a feeling for a direction you want to go in when working on visual/musical pairings?   Do you examine lyrical content when choosing non-English songs (like Quimey Neuquén in the ""Buried"" episode of BrBa\)? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1nsvvf/i_am_breaking_bad_and_the_walking_dead_music/cclqpax?context=5)|That's an excellent question, decenthappiness.  We put thought into everything on 'Breaking Bad'. Vince Gilligan is absolutely meticulous about every detail of the show and we make sure that the music has also been thoroughly thought-through.  If a song is in a different language, we are sure to have and often present the translation.  There was a lot of effort involved in translating ""Crapa Pelada"" which is in an extinct Italian dialect specific to Milan.  We will often take poetic license with songs, but always want to make sure that it feels right to the audience whether they speak the language or not.  It's one of the joys of Breaking Bad.  Nothing is by accident.
[How much does the cost of a song factor into your decision for using it? will you typically price up songs before even attempting to suggest them? or is everything considered from the start?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1nsvvf/i_am_breaking_bad_and_the_walking_dead_music/cclpcyn?context=5)|Excellent and very intuitive question.  Budget makes a HUGE difference in what makes into Breaking Bad.  As I mentioned earlier, the music budget for the show was inadequate from the start was a constant challenge.  We tend to pre-clear (as much as possible) every choice we deliver to showrunner Vince Gilligan.  In the few times when he selected something we couldn't end up affording, it was such a disappointment, we never wanted to revisit that experience again.  So, in short, the cost of a song is a very big factor in our decision making.
[Do you have any projects lined up for the future now that Breaking bad has finished?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1nsvvf/i_am_breaking_bad_and_the_walking_dead_music/cclp9x8?context=5)|We do.
 |The Walking Dead - Season 4 (premeries Oct 13th, I think) Ray Donovan - Season 2 (Showtime) Back in the Game - Season 1 (ABC) Halt and Catch Fire - Season 1 (AMC) Turn - Season 1 (AMC)
 |Lots of work ahead...
[What was the work flow--would they edit scenes before or after they had the music?  Or both?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1nsvvf/i_am_breaking_bad_and_the_walking_dead_music/cclpwhk?context=5)|This wouldn't by chance be former Massachusetts Governor William Weld, would it?  Just kidding. Our work-flow depends on the episodes needs.  Sometimes we would send  music ideas to the writers so they could work a song into the script, other times we would send music ideas to the directors and actors to get into character or choreograph a sequence.  For example the narcocorrido ""Negro y Azul: The Ballad of Heisenberg"" was worked on at the script stage and then developed before we ever shot the episode.  Other times, in fact most times, we work with picture and try to find the right answer once the episode is in editing.
[Playing Gounod’s Faust in the the scene with the schwartze's was genius. whose call was that?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1nsvvf/i_am_breaking_bad_and_the_walking_dead_music/cclqs3h?context=5)|I can take credit for that one.  I grew up listening to classical music, and read a lot as a child.  I know the story of Faust and that particular piece of music and we knew that we could have some fun with ""scoring"" Walt ambushing Gretchen and Elliott and at the same time wanted to make sure that the music choice felt like something realistic they would program into their very expensive modern house alarm/music system.  
[Another question I wanted to ask you about is regarding song ownership. How do you and your colleagues feel about non-exclusively represented songs (specifically music libraries that re-title the songs\)? Thanks again!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1nsvvf/i_am_breaking_bad_and_the_walking_dead_music/cclp5m8?context=5)|I'll be quick on this one...  We hate re-titling.  It's a bad idea, it creates confusion, it allows for a lot of illegitimate tagging of songs, and crediting writers who didn't write a song. We try our best to avoid working with companies that do retitling. I would suggest the same to any artists out there.  Regarding exclusivity, that's a judgement call for individual artists. If you meet someone that wants to represent your songs and you trust that they will do great work, and the terms they represent feel fair, I think an exclusive arrangement is ideal.  You trust them, they trust you and you see how it goes.  I would give this a good year window and if it doesn't seem to work out, move your songs elsewhere.  I would NOT recommend giving anyone your publishing, unless they truly act as a music publisher.  Hope that's helpful.
[I was pleasantly surprised by some of the music choices in breaking bad like bassnectar and knife party. How did these choices get pitched and ultimately accepted into the series?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1nsvvf/i_am_breaking_bad_and_the_walking_dead_music/cclppjl?context=5)|They just felt right for the scene.  Vince Gilligan really trusts his collaborators and if he doesn't know the music, or at times may not even like the music, but does feel they are right for the storytelling, he greenlights those choices.  The breadth of music selection in Breaking Bad is as much a tribute to Vince Gilligan's bravery as it is to my obscene music collection.
[Were any of the musicians whose music you used in BrBa fans of the show?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1nsvvf/i_am_breaking_bad_and_the_walking_dead_music/cclpzq4?context=5)|Absolutely. We brought Steve Perry from Journey to the Breaking Bad premiere and he is just about the nicest guy you could ever meet...
[Do you have any pointers for people who just want to put some of their original songs or compositions up online and no worry about copyrights, massive storage costs, etc?  ""Windy"" (1967\) was genius, guys, by the way!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1nsvvf/i_am_breaking_bad_and_the_walking_dead_music/cclq0p7?context=5)|Soundcloud does the trick pretty well.
[I have a question about the Six Feet Under theme.  I absolutely LOVE the part where the flowers wilt.  It's so fitting with the music and the show as a whole.  1\) Is that something you talk to the editors about when putting together opening credits?  2\) Also, in season 5, Billy and Claire's manic scenes were accompanied by frenzied music.  How did you choose the songs for those scenes?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1nsvvf/i_am_breaking_bad_and_the_walking_dead_music/cclps10?context=5)|In the case of the 'Six Feet Under' theme, that was actually written by Thomas Newman prior to the creation of the opening main titles by a Seattle company called Digital Kitchen.  Ordinarily, the visuals and music are created at the same time, or the music is written to accompany visuals.  In the case of the Main Title to 'The Killing', I worked with both the company that designed the visuals 'Sarofsky' and the band that created the music 'We Fell to Earth' and we worked back and forth to  make that come together. Most of the time, music is created for the existing visuals.  Six Feet Under worked in the opposite manner, but what a beautiful result!   For your question 2.  We worked against picture for the scenes with Claire and Billy.  Their relationship was a fun one to work on as they both brought out the best and the worst in each other, we spent a lot of time trying to get the music choices right for that.
[Hey Thomas, can you talk about working with Dave Porter and how often you would have to communicate to determine what would need original score music versus what would need a licensed song?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1nsvvf/i_am_breaking_bad_and_the_walking_dead_music/cclq5ft?context=5)|I love working with Dave Porter on Breaking Bad.  I had known Dave and his work prior to the show and introduced him to Vince and our producers when we were first looking for a composer. He has done stunning work on the series and hopefully this will be one of many amazing projects he does.  Dave Porter rulez!!!
[From Iron Maiden?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1nsvvf/i_am_breaking_bad_and_the_walking_dead_music/cclp9vk?context=5)|Nope. My friend Fred has his birthday on the day I met Eddie the dog. He was from the Long Beach animal shelter and had just barely survived being put to sleep.  Fred became Ed, which became Eddie.
[Hey Thomas,  I saw you at Bonnaroo this year while you played a soundtrack for the Harold Lloyd silent film Safety Last. This was a really cool experience and something I hope more people get a chance to see.  Do you have any plans for doing more events like this?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1nsvvf/i_am_breaking_bad_and_the_walking_dead_music/cclr6mi?context=5)|How nice that you were there!  It was great fun.  I was actually invited by Bonnaroo to perform a live DJ re-score of the film ""The Road Warrior"" but wasn't able to get permission from Warner Bros to do it.  We then tried to get them to ok a live DJ re-score of ""Blade Runner"" but got the same response.  A last-ditch effort to get approval for doing a hip hop re-score of ""American Psycho"" was also met with a denial, so Sue Lloyd, Harold Lloyd's granddaughter was kind enough to let me perform a re-score of Harold's classic ""Safety Last"".  I would love to do another one,  maybe next year at Bonnaroo or some other music festival.  Fingers crossed somebody asks me.  Glad you got a chance to see that one.  It was great fun!
[Please bring some clarity to the debate; was Daft Punk's Random Access Memories any good?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1nsvvf/i_am_breaking_bad_and_the_walking_dead_music/cclp2sw?context=5)|It's just my opinion, but I do think it's great. What's wonderful about Daft Punk albums is that they don't always show their charms on the first listen and they don't always feel like coherent or even contemporary statements.  But they are always interesting, and always ahead of the times.  I think ""Random Access Memories"" is one of those albums you'll enjoy pulling out and listening to 10 years from now.  I'm not sure I'll feel that way about Justin Timberlake's ""20/20 Experience"". 
[Did you realise Breaking Bad would be such a hit, or where you going on a hunch?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1nsvvf/i_am_breaking_bad_and_the_walking_dead_music/cclqx1v?context=5)|I loved the pilot to Breaking Bad the first time I saw it.  I don't think I am particularly talented at guessing what will be popular, but I am pretty good at figuring out what is of high quality with people who are talented and enjoyable to work with.  I've been lucky enough to be on a few of those projects over the years.
[Hi thomas!! happy saturday! i just moved to LA and want to intern at SMV. is that possible? i'll be your assistant's assistant. or i'll walk eddie, i just really wanna get my foot in the music supervision door. thanks so much!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1nsvvf/i_am_breaking_bad_and_the_walking_dead_music/cclpb3o?context=5)|Thanks Danidooo.  Welcome to LA.  Thanks for the offer, but we already have a full staff at SMV and young Eddie is walked often enough.  Appreciate the offer.
[What's the most consistently underrated band you love? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1nsvvf/i_am_breaking_bad_and_the_walking_dead_music/cclrawy?context=5)|There are many.  One of my favorite underrated bands that I was sure I would find a home in Breaking Bad was 'The Bees' or 'Band of Bees' as they are known in the U.S.  Sadly, we never found a song to work magic in a scene.  Hope people will get to know the band and explore their music.
[Hey Thomas, huge local fan. How much interaction does it take to match music with the editor?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1nsvvf/i_am_breaking_bad_and_the_walking_dead_music/cclrm08?context=5)|We work closely with all the editors on our different projects.  Everyone is working toward telling the story in the best way and often it's the editors that can make something work seamlessly.  What Kelley Dixon (editor) and Michelle MacLaren (director) did with Moira Walley-Beckett's script for ""Gliding Over All"", episode 508, is remarkable.  The integration of all those elements in the ""Crystal Blue Persuasion"" sequence is a tribute to that.  It's very much a team effort.
[If you could work with one composer today, who would it be?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1nsvvf/i_am_breaking_bad_and_the_walking_dead_music/cclr9gh?context=5)|Alive or dead?  Dead: Dmitri Shostakovich. Alive: Arvo Part.
[Was there ever a disagreement between you and Vince on choice of music? I've heard he's pretty easy to work with but I've wondered if he's ever put his foot down. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1nsvvf/i_am_breaking_bad_and_the_walking_dead_music/cclrm6s?context=5)|There was never a disagreement.  Vince knows his story better than anyone else does, and we all follow his lead.  I've learned more about storytelling with music on ""Breaking Bad"" than any other project and have Vince to thank for that.  We always arrived at the right answer for the story and the characters, and I think the end results speak to that.
[Hey Thomas! A lot of the music is Season 5B was very dark and chilling, such as the scene where Jesse goes to Walts house with thd gascan. Where can one find music like that? Thanks!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1nsvvf/i_am_breaking_bad_and_the_walking_dead_music/cclqmdx?context=5)|Dave Porter's music is collected on two soundtrack albums of Breaking Bad score, both available on iTunes and on Amazon.  Great albums both.
[Lots of people are confusing Dave Porter and Golubic.  Golubic supervises what songs get put on the show.  Porter scores the theme of the show.  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1nsvvf/i_am_breaking_bad_and_the_walking_dead_music/cclr5i3?context=5)|Thanks for sharing that clarification.  Thomas...
[Thanks for introducing me to Ana Tijoux and Knife Party.  Goddamn you're good at what you do.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1nsvvf/i_am_breaking_bad_and_the_walking_dead_music/cclr7vf?context=5)|Thanks, Violet.  Appreciate the kind words.  I can give props here to Tom Schnauz's lovely wife Maya for presenting Ana Tijoux to the show.  That was her idea.  As I mentioned earlier, it's very much a group effort.
[That Digital Animal song by Honey Claws is ridiculous, and I would never have heard it without you. Thank you.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1nsvvf/i_am_breaking_bad_and_the_walking_dead_music/cclr4wc?context=5)|My pleasure.  It was a great way to end that sad and desperate episode for Jesse.  That's a good example of where affordable music is presented to me and works really well against picture.  We had very little source music budget left in that very music-intensive episode and because ""Digital Animal"" was affordable to us, and creatively worked really well in the scene, it got to take us out of the episode and turned a lot of folks onto Honey Claws.
[I can't think of a question, but your dog is cute.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1nsvvf/i_am_breaking_bad_and_the_walking_dead_music/cclp1qw?context=5)|Thanks, Rocketshipotter.  Eddie is the best dog in the world.

Most of the realty world loves their iPads to death, but my experiences with Apple hardware ($600 and a nonreplaceable battery, you say?) and browser incompatibility with their web-based MLS viewing system makes me wonder if something else would be a better alternative.

There are a lot of really great Android tablets on the market, but the new Bay Trail tablets with 8.1 keep pace on price and offer a very nice feature set for the dollar. But I do have a few concerns. Issues include:

1. How well, exactly, does 8.1 on one of these tablets play with standard desktop apps? Sometimes, you just want to run a spreadsheet.

2. How well does 8.1 play with Google Docs? My employers are using a Google Apps based CRM system, and the full Google experience - complete with offline editing - is a big deal.

2. What's the nature of MS Office bundled? Will it access things with macros in unecessary places that trip up Google Drive? 

3. Are there any tablet-oriented applications useful for their purposes that you can recommend? 

Thanks!"

I am an MSA student and I just finished up my office visit with PwC.  I think all of my interviews went great and I am really hoping to land an internship with them this winter in Risk Assurance.  I also had on campus interviews with EY, BDO, and Deloitte, (KPMG doesn't recruit on my campus).  I have not heard from EY, but it has been two weeks so I am assuming no office visit with them.  This doesn't surprise me because the on campus interview felt a little awkward.  It was my first on campus interview and I really wasn't feeling comfortable/ natural during the interview.  

The BDO interview was phenomenal and they extended me an office visit on the spot.  I thought my Deloitte on campus interview went great as well.  I have visited there office recently, had a great familiarity with their staff, and was on a first name basis with the recruiter.  Surprisingly, I was not offered an office invite.  

At the PwC office visit I spoke with another student who let me know they had an excellent relationship with Deloitte.  She attended all their on campus functions, visited the office, and knew several staff; yet, she was even offered an on campus interview.  Hearing this really shocked me.  

Should I be worried over not being selected with Deloitte?  Is this natural with the Big 4?  Do they think I just might not fit the culture?  

I plan on contacting the recruiter to inquire why they did not bring me further in the interview process.  Any tips for how to follow up with Deloitte and possibly EY would be useful.  

THANKS!

1nsi94,28,2013-10-05,The Tales of Crazy Charles,Journeyman42,badroommates,https://www.reddit.com/r/badroommates/comments/1nsi94/the_tales_of_crazy_charles/,"Alright, boys and girls, let's listen to a tale, the tale of crazy Charles (not his real name).

I met Charles through a mutual friend when I moved away from my parents house and into an apartment in a much larger city.  The rent was decent (I paid $350 a month for a room in a 2 bedroom) and the location was great, right in the heart of downtown.  Charles seemed a decent guy at first, but lo and behold his inner douche was unleashed.

Charles was very muscular and into bodybuilding, so he walked without a shirt on all the time.  Even in winter.  He also hit on literally every single girl he encountered, and needless to say hooked up a lot.  He had three ""girlfriends"" at the same time.  I didn't mind, but all of them (and him) were very vocal while fucking.  I had to tell him to move his bed to a different location in the room, because the headboard of his bed would pound into the shared wall between his room and mine while he was fucking for hours on end.

The apartment itself was a dump, and he refused to help clean or do dishes.  Eventually I moved all of my dishes to my room so he couldn't use them, and the sink became permanently clogged with dirtyass dishes.  I washed mine in the bathroom sink.  He got a papasan chair from somewhere and, instead of using it as a chair, hung the base upside down from the ceiling as some kind of retarded chandelier.  He nailed HR Giger posters into the walls.

One day early into our living arrangement, he found a big-ass tv on craigslist, one of those massive 48 inch CRTs that some older lady was getting rid of.  We drove out to the suburbs to get it, had to haul the bigass thing up a flight of stairs, and then try to put it into my Pontiac Grand Am, which needless to say didn't have a lot of cargo space.  He had a buddy pick up the TV in a truck (why he didn't ask him earlier, I don't know, I just have so much free time to fuck around with this bullshit) and haul it to our apartment.  I made the mistake of getting an audio receiver for the TV so we could have better audio, which Charles used to blast shitty rap music at 120 decibels at all hours of the day.  His response to when I asked him, if he wanted to listen to loud music, why he didn't use headphones was ""because headphones hurt my ears"".  So I had to endure his shitty music blasting from the living room, and my room was directly next to the living room.  He also plugged his laptop into the audio receiver with a headphone jack, which lead to such lulzy moments as when he tried to have a quiet conversation with his mom over Skype about how he knocked up some girl, only for her voice to boom out like God was speaking to him.

His idiocy was amazing.  About the only thing he was good at was fucking and weight lifting.  And boxing lessons.  He couldn't afford his own apartment (his parents paid the rent) but he went to fucking boxing lessons, even though he was creeped out by the Muslim boxing instructor.  Charles also had rage issues, and on a few occasions he threatened to kick my ass (looking back, I should've called the cops on his dumbass, but I didn't want to deal with any of that shit).  Charles went to the same tech school as I did as a graphic designer, although his artwork was amazingly bad.  He did work as a lifeguard at a pool, but was fired one day because he didn't bring his uniform to work and told his boss our cat pissed on his uniform that morning.  We didn't have a cat.  There was also the time he bought a rolltop desk from St Vinny's and wanted me to transport it in my Grand Am.  He had to get some Mexican guy in a truck to carry it for him, then when they got to our apartment, Charles (who was learning Spanish) accidentally said he would give the guy 500 dollars instead of 50 dollars for hauling it.

The last straw was one night, I went out to the orchestra.  I love classical music, and the local orchestra was playing Beethoven's Third Symphony.  As I was dressing up, Charles asked to come along, and not thinking, I invited him.  He got bored of the concert halfway through, played around on his cellphone, texting one of his fuckbuddies, and hit on chicks during the intermission.  I was pissed.

I made arrangements to move in with a friend far, far away from Charles at the end of the lease.  Charles saw this as a sign to give even less of a shit, so he did.  One day when I was at work (internship related to my major), he moved the bigass CRT tv from the living room into his room.  He didn't even use it, as the TV was placed with the screen facing the wall.  He simply did it out of spite.  It was about this point that I moved all my dishes to my room.

The single most WTF moment was literally the weekend before I moved out.  Charles, one of his fuckbuddies/girlfriends, and her friend were getting drunk and his fuckbuddy got horny.  Charles and his fuckbuddy went to his room, I went to my room (and put on headphones), and her friend left.  After about an hour, I go to take a piss and as soon as I take off my headphones, I hear someone calling for an ambulance.  Then I realized its Charles!  So I go to his room and he pokes his head out.

""Journeyman!  Call 911!""
""What happened, Charles?""
""Just call 911!  It's an emergency!""

He wouldn't let me go into his room.  So I whip my phone out and dialed 911.

Dispatcher ""911, what is your emergency?""
Me ""I don't know""
Dispatcher ""Do you know someone who does?""
Me ""Yep""

And I hand the phone to Charles, who disappears into his room.  In the split second before he closed the door, I saw his fuckbuddy kneeling on the floor, with her head in her hands.  After a couple of minutes, Charles comes back out to tell me to wait outside for the ambulance.  I don't know what the hell he told 911, but two cop cars, an ambulance, and a firetruck show up at our apartment.  One of the EMT guys asked me how much vodka she had to drink.  They all leave without her.  Apparently, all that happened was that she puked while they were fucking from all the liquor they had, and then she fell on the floor.  When I went back inside, Charles yelled at me for not calling 911 fast enough and how dare I questioned him during such an emergency.

I moved the fuck out.  Didn't even end there.  During the last month, he purposefully cranked up the AC while I was at work so that the electric bill was $60 dollars (usually it was around $30, which we split).  I asked him for his half of the electric bill and he ignored me, and cut off contact on Facebook.  After I didn't hear back for about a month, I messaged his fuckbuddy (she thought they were exclusive) and told her that he was cheating on her.  Then I deleted her from FB.

Glorious post-script; earlier this year, I was hanging out with some friends when the topic of shitty roommates came up.  I brought up Charles when one of them, Pam, asks if he was a graphic design major at X college.  I said yes, and it turned out she was in his class!  Not only did he hit on her (which she turned down), for their final semester, they had to complete a portfolio of artwork to graduate.  His professor failed him because he didn't have enough work, and what work he did have was pisspoor.  Because he failed the portfolio class, he failed the graphic design program.

I hugged her I was so happy."

The back story: I started working at a popular spot in Paris about three months ago.  Before that, I was working in a similar spot in the same city where we would take the total of each week's tips and divide them up equally between the staff.  High fives or disappointment were shared by one and all.  At my new spot, there is a restaurant and a wine bar.  We share mise en place, staff floats back and forth, its pretty linked up, but at the wine bar the staff, FOH and BOH take an equal share of the tips.  In the restaurant we split it up as:

1/3 the dining room manager

1/3 the (only other) server

1/3 between the 3 cooks

Fuck that shit!  I guess that the policy dates to a time when the kitchen staff was one cook and an intern.  Now I'm pulling 10% of the week's tips for 14-15 hour days while hung over club kid is taking 3 times that for a 9 hour shift littered with cigarette breaks!

So a recent management change in the FOH, a new server coming in,  and the looming departure of my sous chef seemed like all the ingredients necessary for an equality soup.  I spoke up.  I said ""this isnt fair, let's all share it"".  My sous went to the new manager and she was defensive and upset and said no.  The next day I went to her and pleaded my case, smiley as all hell and very polite.

Well she folded and yesterday she let me know that starting next week we will be sharing the tips 20% each.  Doesn't seem like much, but the difference to me personally means that I will be bringing home an additional 15% take home each month.  An extra 300 euros for trips to restaurants in the countryside, new knives, city breaks, visiting family in England.  Just had to raise a voice!"
1nruey,2,2013-10-05,"[long story] childhood anxiety, ego, obsessive compulsive disorder, yoga, meditatoin... my story",mungabunga,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1nruey/long_story_childhood_anxiety_ego_obsessive/,"When I was born, the 2nd day after my birth my dad left for another city for financial reasons. 

1 Year later my mother and sister left as well to the same city as my dad because my sister would start school.. I was left living with my grand parents. 

I was a very healthy boy.. fatty (good fatty) and very intelligent.

Around 3 years old my parents take me from my grand parents for the summer.. So i lived with them around 3 months.. and then they sent me back to my grand parents again.

I remember the moment when they sent me back.. I knew they would leave me again. I didn't like it. I didn't want them to leave me. They literally told me : ""go out with grandpa for a walk and we will wait you here"". I knew it was a lie, that is probably the first time I felt my anxiety. Like I was being lied. I went for the walk to come back and not find my parents anymore. Since that day I would cry uncontrollably. I stoped eating. I did have bad sleep. I would wake up at night asking myself questions (at 3 years old!) about everything. My grandparents were afraid. I used to ask them everyday : ""when is dad coming?"".. they kept telling me lies about : ""the bridge between the two cities is broken"" and stuff like this. (they left me at my grandparents for financial reasons, and mom/dad/sister couldnt take care of me during the day)

My parents eventually take me back around 5 years old. They send me to a small kids house.. I throw up and cry the first day. I stay a couple of days more but I never felt well. I would have friends in my neighbourhood but I didn't like being there closed in that building and waiting for my parents to come and take me. So they sent me home.. and lock me inside all day.

around 6.6 years old I have my first day of school. My dad sends me there, I cry and puke (again).. I cried the whole day and couldn't even wait my dad come and take me.

School was hard, I used to be beaten by some kids, I used to beat some other kids. At home I used to have a hard time. My dad was missing almost all the time, he was working too much. My mom was anxious herself and she used to beat on me.. sometimes without reason. I had lots of pressure on school. I was a good student but it was never enough for my mom! When I finished my homework she would never let me go play, but I had to do more homework for the rest of the week.

I used to have anxiety about speaking in front of people, anxiety about performing, anxiety about responsabilites etc. once i kept thinking about ""me swallowing"" and told to my mom that ""I only think about me swallowing.. i think about it this much that I actually swallow all the time"". (ocd?)

In high school, first day I don't cry. I had friends already in my classroom. I was a big boy, I used to protect myself.. sometimes I used to speak more loudly than  normal. So I made 4 real good friends, with whom we were all the time. Eventually the 2nd year of high school we discovered weed. That was it. My sleeping problems, gone! My anxiety, gone! My overthinking, there but good overthinking! My eating problem, gone as well. So we smoked weed til the end of high school. HS was happy period even though with one broken heart (in which I cried like a kid).. I was a cool boy in high school. I used to do what i wanted to do. I never overthought (almost). My friends were much like me so we got well together.

For university I leave my town and country to go somewhere else.. in europe. Inserting myself into this new culture seemed impossible. I was unhappy with who I was, I used to feel like ""i can be with better people than just this"" or the inverse ""they are too cool for me"". I had somehow of a breakdown the first months but I handled it well, apart the fatigue and lack of concentration here and there.. I became more paranoid since I couldnt understand everything.. language difference also culture difference, like ""are they talking about me"", ""why did he say that"", etc. And since being direct and saying smth like : ""shut the fuck up"" was impossible in this country (you have to be polite in school) i just.. shut the fuck up myself. I went to amsterdam (with one of my high school friends who lives elsewhere), tried mushrooms, had a glimpse of eternal bliss it was beautiful.

Later on I find my own friends in this new country.. who smoke weed. I start smoking really heavy weed. Every day. I used to go to classes high. Meet my professors high.. and I start feeling this unpleasent feeling here and there. Like tense, anxiety, sometimes some kind of depression. Especially when around lots of people, I was shy. Much more shy than in high school. I couldn't speak myself out. It never lasted more than one evening. I would wake up tomorrow and feel ok. When I was stressed (exam period) it was almost impossible to talk to people.. I sometimes even tried not talking to them in the streets or turn my head the other direction! It's like my head was all the time cloacked to ""exams"". It's like I had no reason to be happy.

When in masters I continued smoking the same amount of weed.. but I was tiring myself more!! At a moment, I was studying so much and I was smoking so much I didn't know what was happening. Ive had panic attacks and though, this is just me being high, I will go to sleep. When with these ""new friends"" I would feel sad sometimes. I couldn't laugh. I would be too serious. They could sense it. I could sense they could sense it (anxiety?).

One day when at a guys house, after learning my parents were fighting, after listening my mother tell me ""i want to kill myself"", after doing lots of medical checkups because i had a very upset stomach, while smoking weed instead of studying it hits me. the real anxiety attack with physical symptoms. I can't get my head away. I think too much. I was like : ""i'm going crazy"". I start speaking more and they notice it. They ask me if everything is OK. I take it personally.. like ""why shouldnt it be ok?"". I can't sleep. I try to play Play Station but I'm too tense. I decide to leave (and act normal). The shame and guilt are there. I start crying in the metro and go to sleep, telling my self tomorrow is gonna be ok (like it might have hapened before when i as just tired).

I wake up tomorrow, the same feeling of emptiness is there. I cry. I dont wanna eat. I have to study. I can't think. I think too much. Don't know how to act. Go for a walk come back, my head is thinking how I ashamed myself last night, how I have to study a lot, how my parents can't understand me. I throw the weed that was left. I decided to never smoke again. 

I go to the university and it was like people see me in a weird way...all the time. I'm anxious and nervous. I try to hide it but some things they say.. i take it like ""HMM THEY KNOW"". Paranoia. I only ride the bike since the metro/bus has too many people. I understand the weed was always there as ""reason"" for my feeling.

My parents come to my country, they try to talk me out of this depression (that lasted like 3 weeks or so). I start yoga. It helps me a lot. I still have the anxiety around people. Sometimes I want to ask my yoga professor a question but too many people are there so I don't. Physically I feel good. I have a better physical body. everything is going ok. I run. I still am sad around my friends. Sometimes I think about ""my situation"" when I'm with them. I can't let myself go. I can't be normal.. 

2nd year of masters went ok. lots of work but it was ok. I kept doing yoga, then I start my internship of 6months.. they love me. they love my work. everything is going ok! I get anxious when we eat together..but it's just a moment of anxiety..like 30-45 minutes. it's a new environement for me that's why. I have to act like a grown up. 

Work sends me in another city for working at the client. (at this moment i have stoped yoga since 3 months, i have lost muscle, and it's been 1.5 years since my ""BREAKDOWN""). I live in hotel, work 8am-8pm. and 8pm-10pm talk about work while eating dinner. I have no more friends, no more family with me. I'm all the time with my work people (collegues). 

It is stressful more and more.. I feel bad. I lose apetite but I keep on going. I'm paranoid when around my collegues. They joke about me and I almost cry. They tell me it's just a joke.. I can't not take it personally. I try to but I can't. I joke on them.. laugh and feel bad. I joke on myself.. feel bad. I try telling jokes.. almost cried. When drinking my head blocks. I freeze. My neck trembles. My hands as well. I'm doing too much introspection. I'm forcing myself to be something i'm not.. not now! I tell my boss thas.. ""going in a city from monday-friday and coming back is tiring me"". He's like : ""you will get used to it [mungabunga]"". (i think :""they don't care about me.. they care about themselves and the work I do""). This goes on for 3 weeks.. they don't notice. I have a couple of panick attacks. I try to run them out etc. One monday i start crying in the train while going there. I can't focus I can do nothing. I don't wanna work anymore.. I realise, I'm in the same situation as 1.5 years ago with weed.. just that there's no weed. And well i'm more prepared than last time. I ask my boss that I need to see a doctor back home. I see one and he gives me 3 sick days. I decide I don't want to work anymore. call my boss, fire myself. Right now I'm waiting for all the paper work to be done.

Taking some homeopathic anxiety medicine. Feeling bad from time to time. Going for runs every day and trying to eat a lot. I'm asking myself questions. When depressed I used to just cry, and imagine myself as a bum in the street or in a mental hospital. I had suicidal thoughts (which i told to my gf, and father). 
I keep reading r/meditation. I keep asking myself questions about my situation.

I notice a patern. When I need attention I act up like this. Is it un unhealthy ego I have? I will maybe start cbt soon, but i'm very sad as well. Do you have ideas? how should I act?"
1nro8n,7,2013-10-05,I think I have found my passion. How do I become a financial adviser? (CA),[deleted],personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1nro8n/i_think_i_have_found_my_passion_how_do_i_become_a/,"I am currently 17, and started my first year of university. Right now I am on my way to majoring in Mathematics/Computer Science. I enjoy math and everything, but I think that finances are my passion. I have enjoyed investing vehicles, saving, budgeting, and over financial health since I was young.

I am worried about whether or not this is a viable career. This subreddit seems to hate on them and constantly say that they are useless. Why would I go into a field that can apparently be easily replaced by a small amount of research?

A (seemingly silly) issue is that I don't actually know how one becomes a financial adviser. I know that you can do a business degree and likely go from there, however, is it also possible to finish a math degree and have the same qualifications and employability (after you finish your certification)? I told myself that I would get a degree that I know is employable and I wouldn't become another young person with poor career prospects.

I had a few questions about the career:

 * Is financial advising going to be 'phased out' in the future?
 * Do I have a proper picture as to what being a financial adviser entails? 
 * Can I become a financial adviser while sticking on the track that I am on right now?
 * Is financial advising an employable career?
 * What can I do to help myself get internships? What are some good university to go to for this?

My boyfriend and I have been together for a little over 2 years now, and it's always been long distance. I've been in NY and he's in CA. I'm originally from CA, and we met when I was doing a summer internship in the Bay Area. I was going to the school in NY at the time, and when I graduated, I moved to NYC for a job. Now, he just went back to school (community college) in CA after working at a job he didn't like for about 8 years. The plan was that after school for him, he would move out to NYC with me.

Now, he's going back on that plan, and he says that he hates NYC and doesn't see himself living here at all. He claims that he wants to continue the relationship, but doesn't want to move to NYC. I find it unfair because I've already established a life here in NYC, whereas he still doesn't know what he wants to do.

We wrote this together. Some of it is my words, some is hers. Written from my point of view.

 My girlfriend and I have been together almost a year, but are currently three hours apart because I'm doing an internship in another city. The internship is very important for my career and was mentioned before we started dating. We've been apart for a month and will be until December 21st. It's VERY hard for both us, but it's killing her. I've visited 2 out of the 4 weekends (once was a last-minute surprise and we were only together for one day), we talk on the phone and skype at least three times a day. These are often short and rushed, although we try to have a longer conversation every day, but she often has other things she needs to be doing, so sitting around talking makes her very anxious. We also chat a lot on FB and send each other plenty of text messages, but because of her very busy schedule, she feels pressured and disrupted. We were pretty much living together before I left, and we both got used to having the other person just there, so adjusting to the change is very difficult. She's visiting me next weekend and we're staying at a magnificent hotel. Our 1 year anniversary is in about 2 months and the hotel is already booked for that, too.

We love each other madly. I'm crazy for her and I know she feels the same way for me. Breaking up is not an option. We're both heading towards jobs that make us travel frequently and we both want to learn how to deal with being apart.

The problem is that she's been terribly lonely since I left and she craves companionship and emotional intimacy. She needs significant people in her life, she needs a close and constant connection. She doesn’t really have a family, and that’s very difficult for her because she feels like she’s missing a significant part of what most people get to have. She has lots of amazing friends (but she doesn’t really get close to people) and she's been participating in a lot of social activities since we've been apart. Nothing compares to that deep emotional connection between us and it's killing her. It's driving her crazy, to the point where she shuts down, cries, and is stressed all the time - it doesn’t help that she’s taking a full course load, working two jobs, and now has to take care of our condo alone. When she shuts down, she gets very aggressive towards me and says really bad things that she later regrets. It's extremely taxing on both of us. She's an amazing person, my best friend and a wonderful girlfriend, so it's really hard to see her in tears, begging me to come back, knowing that it's impossible.

We discussed opening up the relationship before. In my case, I'd be totally fine with sex-without-feelings on the side for both of us. However, since I'm not too far away and able to visit frequently, we decided that it was not the best time. I would be willing to change that, but I think right now, in the middle of a long distance relationship, is a terrible time to do it.

&lt;Her speaking&gt; I’ve had a few minor crushes throughout the relationship, but lately I talk about them more often (although I’d never do anything with them if it weren’t okay with him.) I feel weird about them, like they’re more intense because of his absence, but when I think about actually doing stuff with my crushes, I feel hollow and empty. &lt;/Her speaking&gt; She logged on to her OkCupid profile for the first time in months and mentioned dating other people and honestly that kinda hurt me because I feel like I'm being replaced - but if she can find a good friend out of it, that would be great. She doesn't know what she wants, she keeps repeating that all she wants is for me to come back, so it’s impossible to discuss boundaries and how to handle these kind of things.

The last few days have been worse than ever before. She's told me multiple times that she can't do it and that she wants to break up with me, but every time I am able to calm her down and make her come back to her normal and rational state. We’re both so excited to be together again. On the other hand, she feels like if it’s this hard after just a month, if she’s this interested in other people, then she doesn’t know how to survive another two and a half months like this. We know that if I were still there, she wouldn’t feel like this, and it makes it very painful for us.

It's REALLY FUCKING HARD. We both love each other so much and that's the basis of why it's so hard. Breaking up is not an option. Tons of couples go through similar situations and they survive. We need your advice, we need your tricks. How can we make it easier? To those of you who have been in a similar situation, how did you overcome it?

We need your help.


**tl;dr**: LDR is proving to be extremely difficult for my girlfriend and we need your help.

The faculty advisers help students with scheduling conflicts, general questions, help with internships/employment, etc. My adviser is named Jess Depew and she's pretty hot. She's like 25 and she's only been at the school a few years. Anyway, I have been looking into getting an internship at a TV station or something over the summer, and the school helps coordinate these things with an internship database that's maintained by the advisers. You log on with your school ID and password and you can browse internships and stuff. I was having trouble logging on to mine so I went to go see Ms. Depew. That's where all the trouble started.

&amp;gt; Firstly, I walked into office like 15 minutes early like an idiot and she's in the middle of lunch. So I awkwardly make stupid stall talk until she's finished.

&amp;gt; ""Oh, hey, what are you eating?""

&amp;gt; ""Salmon. I love it. I eat it practically everyday.""

&amp;gt; ""Just salmon? That's pretty weird."" Why the hell did I say this?

&amp;gt; ""Oh, well, I don't know. I try to eat healthy, natural foods...you know, like wild berries and honey and stuff.""

&amp;gt; ""Yeah, I like food too."" *facepalm*

&amp;gt; Man, I was so nervous. Anyway, we finally begin squaring my stuff away. She looks up what I registered with in the beginning of the year. This is when the crap really hit the fan. This is how the conversation went:

&amp;gt; ""Okay, you're account name is [my name] and your password is ...'depewissexy'...""

&amp;gt; Oh damn. I completely forgot that I put that as my password in the beginning of the year. What the hell was I thinking? It was probably the longest 20 seconds of my life before I finally got my balls together to stand up and leave. Just as I walk out the door she says,

&amp;gt; ""In the future, you might want to bear in mind what kind of things you want keep to yourself.""

&amp;gt; I was so freaking embarrassed I wanted to kill myself right then and there. I wanted to run the hell out of there and never, ever see her again. But something about what she just said kept me standing in her doorway. I decided to man up and apologize. I turned to her, looked her straight in the eyes, and swallowed my pride. And then, it hit me like a train full of bricks.

&amp;gt; She was eating Salmon.

&amp;gt; She tries to eat all healthy, natural foods, like wild berries and honey.

&amp;gt; She told me that I might want to **bear in mind** what kind of things I want to keep to myself.

&amp;gt; Ms. Depew was a bear disguised as a human.

&amp;gt; Immediately, the bear saw that I had seen through its charade. It roared loudly and took a menacing swipe at me. I deftly avoided its claw and sprinted out of the office. The bear was soon in chase, crashing through the walls of the office as if they were made of paper. I jumped over the receptionist desk and ran out the back entrance. The bear followed, tossing the secretary aside like a rag doll. The bear began to pursue me through the street traffic. While I fought my way through the maze of vehicles, the bear simply careened its massive force through anything standing in its way. Cars veered off the road to escape the onslaught of grizzly force that was barreling down the road. The bear was gaining fast. I had no other option but to make my way into the nearest building: a preschool. I burst through the door, startling the children from their naps. Immediately, the bear slammed through the wall, crushing a child beneath his massive paws and burying several other children in sheet rock and debris. I maneuvered my way through the chaos towards the back exit. The pre-schoolers were little more than a screaming annoyance for the bear. Its massive paws cut swaths through the sea of toddlers with each swipe. I used the precious time these children had afforded for me to make my escape into the playground. I scrambled up a ladder to a fort-like structure. My goal was to walk across the monkey bars then jump to a tree which I could climb to the roof of the preschool and perhaps flag down a passing helicopter.

&amp;gt; I began my trek across the monkey bars just as the bear charged outside, its teeth and claws still fresh with the blood of the innocent. It let out a monstrous roar and began its assault on the cheap, woodenplayset. I let go of all caution and ran to end the end of the monkey bars. I leaped for the tree branch just as the bear's enormous girth came plowing through the entire structure. I grasped the branch tightly as the bear collided with the tree, sending it into a daze. I saw this as my one opportunity not for escape, but for victory. I leapt off the tree onto the ground and grabbed a stray bar that had been shorn from the playset. The bear was slowly coming to so I had to act fast. I ran to the beast and thrust the jagged end of the pole into its jaw and through it's skull.

&amp;gt; The bear had been defeated. I shambled home in pain but victorious.There will be more blogs and more bears in the months to come.

&amp;gt; But today, I returned home a champion."
1nrdz0,19,2013-10-04,"6 months since graduation, still unemployed.",gettingnothing,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1nrdz0/6_months_since_graduation_still_unemployed/,"I'm at my wits' end. I graduated from a good school and live in a large city with a supposedly booming IT industry. I have two good summer internship experiences (1 in web dev, 1 in BA) and a good body of knowledge for a fresh grad in those subjects. I also have great references and interview well. 

I've applied to positions with all sorts of titles: ""junior"", ""fresh grad"", ""intermediate"", etc. 

I have received a callback for exactly ONE, from what is easily the most respectable of the companies I applied to. This only happened because the interview process began with a code submission where I actually had the chance to prove I knew what I was doing. I made it quite far but didn't get the job, which is fine as it was sought after by applicants globally and I was proud to make it to where I did.

Besides this, I have only received the odd polite rejection and emails from local recruiters. 

When I started looking I was open to positions in software development, web development, and business analysis (basically everything and anything). While I consider myself a skilled Java programmer, I stopped looking for software dev jobs due to my lack of professional experience with it, and the fact that my applications for even the most junior Java dev. positions were declined (ironically except for that large company mentioned above). 

I now have two resumes, one tailored for BA and one for web development. I tinker with them for every resume I send out. The problem with BA is there are few junior positions available in the field (maybe just locally). 

That leaves web dev; a field which I would be ecstatic to land in (I really like it). However even here I'm struggling  to land interviews. I'm seeing junior positions on Craigslist and Indeed from unknown companies that demand knowledge of several stacks on top of having a high-profile StackOverflow account and a GitHub with several open-source project contributions. Seriously, what the hell?

Can people who landed web development positions after graduating post their experiences?

What did you include in your resume?

What was in your portfolio?

What was your callback ratio?

I think my biggest issue is showmanship of work. Unfortunately I can't showcase my professional web dev experience as it is constrained to a government intranet. I do have a portfolio but it looks like the projects there aren't enough. I would be happy to add to it but I need to know what employers are looking for when they look at an applicant's portfolio, since apparently I'm not measuring up (if they even look at my resume).

Thanks for reading, guys."
1nrdad,1,2013-10-04,Ex from long distance relationship is back in town for three months. (need advice),heart_bender,LongDistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/1nrdad/ex_from_long_distance_relationship_is_back_in/,"20F and 20M
I started dating this guy about a year ago. The anniversary would have been tomorrow. :( Three months into the relationship he was to do a four month internship in San Francisco. Our hometown is in southern Ontario. Halfway through those four months I fly to visit him for five days. We both had an amazing time. I remember walking through the airport heading towards to home so I could study for a calc midterm that was in four days. I still had some american money left so I decided to splurge on myself by getting a grapefruit frozen yogurt.   At that moment life was perfect. 

A few weeks later he leaves message saying he needs my advice on something. His boss has offered to extend his internship for four more months. I don't want him to but in the end it's his decision to make. A short while after he makes that decision he breaks up with me. Eight months is a really long time for such a young relationship. 

When he broke with me, I was sad however I knew that it wasn't anything that I had done. He would be coming back in September and in the mean time I could finally sleep. The time differences was really tiring me out.

Flash Forward to September. I am so convinced that he'll want me back that I make a bet with my best friend that he'll ask me on a date. I only bet when I'm certain I'm right. 1 weeks goes by nothing happens, 2 weeks go by still nothing happens. 3 weeks go by another guy asks me out. I go on a date with him though everything about dating reminds of my ex. The entire I can't help but think this is a decent date but I had it better with my ex. I'm not sure I want a lesser relationship when a better one failed. The morning after that date I wake up at 5am crying because I miss my ex. 6 months after he broke up with me, my heart shatters. 

Right now I just trying to pick up the pieces. I finally saw him this week. I told him how his actions hurt me, how I felt abandoned when he chose his job over me. He listened. Even while I was chewing out we still made each other laugh. He offered to let me slap him as compensation instead I asked for a hug.

I still madly in love with this guy. If I go an hour without crying due to heartbreak, I consider it an accomplishment. I know he'll be going back to San Francisco. Long distance sucks however heartbreak sucks a whole lot more. 

So my question is: Is it worth it to get this relationship back? How should I go about it?

I had a great time visiting Toronto (from the USA) and meeting new people several months ago when I was here on a short vacation. One redditor recently mentioned the Students Working Abroad Program (SWAP) to Canada and as a recent graduate, I think it'd be an once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to take to work abroad (given that I was not able to study abroad - so I was sad about that). 

My background : Most of my development experience is with web application development with PHP/Javascript(Front/Back-end)/Golang and a bit of Django/Rails from school. I've done three internships during my college career. 

[Link to My Resume (PDF)](https://www.dropbox.com/s/shsr8c87vtw2rru/generic_resume_1006.pdf)

What I'm Looking For: I'm looking for an opportunity with a small/mid-size firm/startup that faces interesting and fun technical challenges. I've definitely done some looking on StartupNorth and done some applying here and there. Money's not as important - as long as it's fairly survivable though I know I won't be getting as much as what I'd be getting in Mountain View, California, USA.

I've heard from friends/redditors about getting the visa first opposed to finding an opportunity first. At the moment, I have a few options between companies in the USA, but I am looking for something different. 

Tips/advice would be appreciated. :)"
1nv9re,16,2013-10-06,Switch to CS or stay in Computer Engineering?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1nv9re/switch_to_cs_or_stay_in_computer_engineering/,"Hey everyone, I'm a freshman Computer Engineering student in his first semester. I'm trying to decide whether to switch to CS or stay in Computer Engineering. In terms of interest, I have a hobby-level interest in electronics, but I wouldn't say I have a *passion* for it. However, I do seriously enjoy CS and I've spent a lot of time out of school working on the Intro to CS course on MIT OCW and the Algorithms course on Coursera and just generally spending a lot of my free time on CS. With that being said, I have no experience with what an industry job in CS is like. I have done an electrical engineering internship and while I didn't love it, it was interesting. 

The CS program at my school is fairly well-regarded and the CS majors have a 100% co-op placement rate. The same goes for the ECE department at my school. In terms of academics, both programs are just as rigorous. The CS program is your normal CS program with  all the usual courses. Computer Engineering has a huge variance from school to school, so I'll explain it here:

     The first two years of the Computer Engineering degree are mix of Electrical Engineering and CS. So I'll take the traditional physics I &amp; II, Electronics I, Chemistry, Intro to ECE Lab, etc. (the usual 'first-year curriculum'). 
     My CS courses consist of Engineering Computation and Algorithms and Data Structures. Engineering computation is not a real CS class. It is an intro programming class. The most advanced thing we'll get to is probably making a class in C++ and Matlab integration. It's mostly basic stuff that anybody who has even gone through a book about C will know(very little C++ specific stuff.) 
     The last 2 years are the specialization years. They consist of technical electives which range from Software Engineering I and Computer Vision to Antenna Design. So technical electives run the whole gamut of the CS-EE spectrum, with topics that are CS to topics that are deep EE topics. I'm only allowed to take on course from the college of computer science as a technical elective, but the college of Engineering has about 4 technical electives that are basically CS-like:
Software Eng I &amp; II
Parallel and Distributed Processing
Numerical Methods and Computer Applications
Image Processing &amp; Pattern Recognition
Computer Vision
I can take exactly one of the traditional CS courses as well, such as Object Oriented Design or Compilers. 

I'm also required to take Optimization Methods, which is a high-level algorithms course. I can also use my general electives to take more CS courses if needed. 

My question to all of you is, if upon graduation, I wanted to compete for a top CS job at one of the in-demand employers like Google, would I be competitive? How about if I wanted to apply to a CS PhD program? 
If the answer to any of those questions is no, would I be better served by switching to CS and losing a semester or staying in CompE and doing some self-study?

Current Background:
Know C, Python, learning Scala through Functional Programming Principles In Scala course on Coursera. Have a working knowledge of C++ and Java. Completed the Algorithms I course on Coursera and trying to working through the problems in Sedgewick's textbook. I'm also taking Programming Languages on coursera. I'm also about a quarter of the way through Foundations of Computer Science: C edition by Aho(turtle book). I have a working knowledge of Linux, I can install an Arch Linux distro, use a makefile, UNIX utilities, and built a basic dependency manager using instructions from Zed Shaw's LCTHW. (Although I can't really get it to work like it's supposed to.) I learned how to use github and deploy code to Heroku and use SSH from Startup Engineering on Coursera but was unable to complete the course because I wasn't good with JavaScript."

1nv5y9,6,2013-10-06,How many suits do you own and how often do you wear them? What justifies buying a new suit?,[deleted],malefashionadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/1nv5y9/how_many_suits_do_you_own_and_how_often_do_you/,"I currently own two suits, an Alfani RED charcoal gray suit that I love/hate (I think it's too dark for my complexion, I'm a caramel colored Asian), and a Navy Tallia Orange suit. Both need to be tailored but fit relatively well.

Macy's is currently having a great sale on some of their suits. Along with a coupon, I could nab a 3-piece suit for about $205. It's a bit darker navy than my current navy suit.

It got me thinking... when will I actually wear a suit? I just graduated. I could hardly get an interview before I got hired part time at a non-profit. I *hardly* wear a suit, maybe 3-5 times a year. When I had an internship in DC, I wore one once a week, but I'm living in a very casual metropolitan area now that thinks a collared shirt and slacks is ""dressing up"".

I've found every reason to justify me buying this suit. How ""it's the right color"" or ""how I've always wanted this brand's suit"" to ""it can be my graduation present to myself"" and ""maybe buying suits is my thing? like how other guys buy jordans they hardly wear"". 

At the same time, I've found reason to talk myself out of it... ""you already own two suits"", ""you already have a blue suit, just get them tailored"", ""$200 could get you something else, or save it"", etc.

Thoughts? Opinions? It's one of those purchases where you'll feel regret buying or not buying, but the only difference is that if I don't buy, I'll save myself $200.

Does getting a standalone certificate make sense, given that I have a military background, as well as some significant civilian professional experiences prior to that?

1nuxqs,1,2013-10-06,"My [19F] family is driving me nuts, How do I move out?",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1nuxqs/my_19f_family_is_driving_me_nuts_how_do_i_move_out/,"Let me start off by saying that I do love my family and that I realize that I am incredibly lucky to have them. 

I have a mother, a father, and an autistic brother who is one year younger than me

After I graduated high school, I moved 300 miles away to go to school, even getting involved in a paid summer internship the semester before my freshman year. I got used to living on my own (with room mates, but they were hardly around) and loved the solitude. I could sleep as much as I wanted, leave messes for a little while before cleaning them up, etc etc. I loved the freedom.

At this time in my life, I was NOT financially independent, my parents paid for part of my tuition and housing, the rest was covered by scholarships. 

After 1 year of being at that school, I realized it wasn't a good fit and that other schools relatively closer to home would offer better opportunities, so I decided to move back home and commute 30 min twice a week to go to a different college while I sorted things out. I also got a job that pays slightly over minimum wage (relevant later).

I am currently 5 months in and I am incredibly frustrated with my living situation. My parents have always been on the over-protective/helicopter side and I know that. They complain that I'm ""never home"" and (maybe not on purpose) guilt me emotionally. 


I never experienced anything like this when I was away, which confuses me. They would keep me at an arm's length, call me 3-4 times a week and our conversations would be healthy and civil. Now I fight with my parents almost constantly (which is not an exaggeration) and cannot get 2 seconds of privacy. 

I desperately want to move out but cannot afford to. I make 7.65/hr +commission and get paid twice a month. I pay for my own gas and anything I need while at school, but I am very much financially dependent. 

I feel like my family (my dad in particular) relies on me for their happiness, and I cannot deal with that. I am not emotionally stable and sometimes, when I would rather keep to myself or do homework to stay on track, they take it personally. This morning, my father was attempting to make plans around Christmas time and asked how interested I would be in that. I historically do not enjoy travelling with my family at all, but I felt that I couldn't say that to him, so I instead asked him not to base any major travel decisions on my opinion, present or future, because I am not reliable. This made him very upset and I don't really get why. 

I wish my family would invest less in my happiness, because I feel that I hold them back from going where they want to go. I want them to be happy, but I also want them to be aware that I now have a job and a college career, both of those things require a lot of time and effort.
---

TL;DR My family bases their happiness off of mine, which is taxing for me. I have school and a job and they wonder why I am never home and never willing to do things with them in the little amount of free time I have. How do I go about moving out and would that even fix this?"
1nu4fx,20,2013-10-06,"""Non-Traditional Student"" (44 Years Old) - Recently graduated with BS in CIS. Should I hold out for a big company with room for advancement, given how hard it is to get hired as an older new grad?",[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1nu4fx/nontraditional_student_44_years_old_recently/,"I graduated in May of this year. I may have made a mistake by not beginning my job search immediately upon graduation, if not during my final year of school.

I have a stable employment history (including 8 months as a student researcher, but no internship), and my resume looks very good.  I was very careful not to put anything on the resume which would indicate my age.

I realize that the hiring process for the big companies usually goes slower than that of small to medium companies.  That being said, I have already been rejected by a couple of large companies, but am getting several nibbles from smaller companies.  Glassdoor reviews are not good for any of them.  I take that with a grain of salt, as I believe that disgruntled or laid-off/fired employees are generally more likely to post reviews than satisfied employees.

Looking at my current set of opportunities (no actual offers yet, but a full schedule of interviews for the coming weeks), it appears that I should be able to meet my salary requirements by going either route (big company or small to medium company).  The benefits at either would probably be similar.

My question is for those who are either in a similar situation, or at least know people in a similar situation:  Should I accept a job which meets my salary and benefit requirements, even if I'm not sure that the company has ""career potential,"" or should I hold out and try to land a job with a big company, where I would have a much more reasonable expectation of growth opportunities.

TL; DR:  As an older new graduate, is it still a viable approach to ""string together"" a career by working a few years here and a few years there, or should I really be trying to find a long-term, proven company which offers the possibility of employment and advancement until I retire?

I am much more interested in the technology aspect of business, rather than the accounting. 

Anyway, this last summer I had an internship at a Big 4 firm performing IT Audits. I really had no desire to go into accounting, but it was the most prestigious internship I was offered. I worked hard all summer and got a full time offer. However, the firm required an acceptance of the offer by the end of August, but recruiting season doesn't happen until September-October at my university. Even though I wasn't exactly thrilled performing audits, I accepted the offer because, hey, its a full time offer. Please spare any moral judgements you have, but I am going through recruiting with a few other companies right now that are offering positions which are more in line with what I would like to do in the future. Even if I were to get another offer, I'm not sure if I would take it because nearly every ""best place to start a career with"" article I read claims starting with a Big 4 is a huge advantage. My question is, does this ""advantage"" have any ground outside of accounting (that you know of anyway), and do you know of employees transferring to non-accounting positions once they leave B4?"

in the past 6 months i've contacted my dad around 8 times, compared to him contacting me once.  that is down from me calling even more frequently, where despite having good conversations i was always the one calling.  same thing with my older brother, who now doesn't even respond. every so often when i see him he'll apologize for being a shitty brother and even cried about it once or twice and promises to try and make it up to me. 

when i try to participate in facebook shit i get ignored, even when it's in the same vein as what everyone else is talking about.  shit that if someone else wrote, it would get dozens of likes (yeah that's pretty petty of me but i dont understand it at all).  so i dont really participate in facebook that much anymore.

i've never been accepted into a group my whole life; i see people excited to hang out with other people regularly, and i am never that person.  obviously this would suggest that its a problem with me since i'm the common factor through it all, but i've put lots and lots of work into it.  i try to be kind, inclusive to everyone (because i know how much it sucks to be excluded), i share, i go out of my way to meet commitments and help where i can, and people just take advantage of me until i lose heart in it.  

some people act like they like me but when i try to set up hanging out or invite them out most of the time i'm not even fucking acknowledged, just no response on phone or online. this is even after a tentative agreement to hang out a few days prior; when i call the day of or the day before theres often not even a response.  this is especially frustrating if there's evidence of those people being active, like another acquaintance just talked to them or they're posting on facebook. its fucking insulting.  i learned a long time ago its pointless to try and figure it out or inquire when you get the freeze, but when i wait for a return call it never comes.

i've been sick and unemployed for the last two months; no one cares.  life just passes me by.  i have interests and hobbies but no one gives a fuck.  some days i want to just stay in bed for a week.

i try to stay positive, but it's just so soul-crushing.  i feel like the butt of a joke, and the whole world is in on it but me. :( i've tried for so long to be strong and successful and accepted, but i feel like a fucking pussy loser with no friends and no job prospects.  i'm poor as fuck and i feel like if i died pretty much no one would even fucking care, and if they did it would only be in a hindsight-is-20-20 sort of way (besides my grandma and my girlfriend, i love you guys). instead i get to look forward to busting my life away for shit-ass pay with grim prospects and a gaping hole where friends should be.  i got an associate's degree in a field which is turning out to be totally fucking worthless and the only work i can get is unpaid fucking internships and minimum wage jobs for the last 2 years.

i even sort of fell into a group of neo hippies / electronic music enthusiasts which at first i was really excited about because on the surface they practiced love and equality for all, but really it's just a hippier-than-thou hierarchal circle jerk where it's all about who's got the coolest clothes, who knows the best djs and parties, what things do you have that can be used, who do you know.  i put a lot of effort into trying to get to know people in that group and almost 2 years later i'm welcome to the parties but no one wants to hang out.

god fucking dammit."
1ntjqa,12,2013-10-05,Seventeen (pt. 1),Grakmarr,TheAssembly,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheAssembly/comments/1ntjqa/seventeen_pt_1/,"I apologize for the length of this story, if I were a better writer I would've made it shorter. But people seem to enjoy it. Fair warning, though.

[If you've got 45 minutes to kill, here's an awesome reading of my story! Dude has skills!](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNk_kF519J0)

Edgar raised his head up from his chest; back pressed firmly into his favorite recliner, his entire body drenched in cold sweat. He stared into shadows at the edge of the living room, eyes welling with tears as he lifted the revolver slowly and deliberately to his temple. “Seventeen”, he whispered to the darkness.

The index finger of his right hand had already found its perch on the trigger during the weapon’s ascent, during which he had hesitated no more than a second, his only concern ensuring that the angle he chose would prove fatal. He clenched his left hand into a fist at his side, steeling his will. He inhaled sharply. And with further need of neither breath nor will, he clenched his right hand.

Darkness flashed brilliantly to light from the barrel of a .38 Special, as the gunshot’s dull thunder echoed around the room. The remains of Edgar Freeman slumped sideways in what had once been his favorite chair. The other man with him in that chamber smiled softly, the one in the shadows who had been briefly illuminated by the muzzle flare, that sallow man in the dark suit with the pale blue eyes. He smiled as everything turned gray.

Edgar flailed his way to a sitting position, ripping the covers off the bed as he always did when waking up from that goddamned nightmare. After the fourth night in a row with the same dream, he had taken to sleeping with his bedside lamp turned on. After the sixth night in a row, his frenzy upon waking had sent it crashing to the floor – bulb broken and shade cracked by the impact. Tonight had been the eighth night, and as he recited every vulgarity he could recall into the inky darkness of his bedroom, he swore that today he’d find the time to go purchase a box of light bulbs. Involuntarily recalling the stranger in the dream’s inappropriately sweet smile, he reminded himself to ask the clerk for their highest wattage.

After a warm shower and a few minutes collecting his thoughts on the side of the bed, Edgar set about his day. Nearly-tasteless scrambled eggs and coffee which would have been merciful if it had been tasteless comprised his breakfast, and his thoughts turned to how absurdly better Haley’s morning meal would have been. Whatever other problems they had, Haley’s cooking had been beyond reproach. He would regularly wake to the mouthwatering aroma of a nutritious breakfast which she had prepared for him – usually egg whites on a wheat English muffin with a tall glass of orange juice – at least before the morning sickness had started and kept her occupied in her prayers to the porcelean goddess for her first waking hour of every day. All this, he reminded himself bitterly, was in the past now.

As the Vice-President of Marketing for the second largest athletic apparel company in the country (and, as he thought of himself, a reasonably attractive man) Edgar was more than used to the occasional flirting – both casual and aggressive – from young female interns and employees within his department. It came with the territory, and it was never anything he couldn’t brush off. Thoughts of either taking it further than flirtations or reporting it to Human Resources very rarely crossed his mind; the former on account of his pregnant wife, the latter on account of the ego boost it provided. One month ago, however, Edgar began an affair with a particularly buxom college intern named Samantha. Above and below the brassiere, she had been nothing special; just a warm body to quell the urges to which Haley had been unwilling or unable to tend after entering her third trimester. Even the sex was unremarkable.

Their first rendezvous took place in a motel a few blocks away from the office, the type of place with bay windows overlooking less than scenic freeway overpasses, and even the roaches use black lights before scurrying under the unmade bed. As a cursory nod to legitimacy, the establishment stopped short of offering rates on a per-hour basis – a fact known because Edgar had inquired upon checking in.

After that first encounter, the two grew bolder and less discerning in their indiscretions. Edgar’s office came next, and that time had been a little more satisfying – a combination of the danger and the skirt Samantha kept on at his request. But boldness turned quickly to carelessness, and Edgar was an apprentice of infidelity less than two weeks before Haley discovered his betrayal.

Whether it was a whiff of unfamiliar perfume or a phone call from one of Edgar’s jealous rejects who had spotted the two of them around the office, his adultery with Samantha was soon the topic to which Edgar returned home from work. The accusation was on her face the minute he walked through the door. He had come home late from a particularly wild romp with Samantha, and the words from Haley’s trembling lips quickly disclosed exactly how much she knew.

It would have been pointless to lie – she had too many details and he too little imagination – so Edgar confessed, and made a perfunctory effort to justify his behavior. She cursed him with a severity and intensity which Edgar had never seen from her before, and in her final words to him she made it clear that she was leaving, and that she would make sure he would never in his life have a role in raising their child. Despite his heartache at the prospect of losing Haley, Edgar had spent too long in a cutthroat business to take threats passively, even from his wife. He laughed bitterly, and reminded her of the quality of the lawyers within his means. When he was done, Edgar said with words he instantly regretted but found himself powerless to silence, she would be lucky to get weekends and a few holidays with the kid.

That was a lie and he knew it, but at the time his main objective was to get off the defensive and regain the upper hand in the fight – maybe even make Haley reconsider her choice to leave. He would happily cut some hefty checks to a marriage counselor if it saved him from the much larger ones in the form of alimony and child support. But something in the way Haley was smiling at him suggested that he had misunderstood her intentions. And as he realized far too late; if he had been more observant, he might have noticed an empty hook on their key caddy, and connected it to that sardonic grin she was wearing.

She hadn’t left right away, like he had expected. Isn’t that always the way it works in the movies and on television? The guy comes out of the bathroom or back from the bar a little while after the fight to find the gal’s suitcases dusted off and bulging with all the expensive clothes he bought her over the course of their relationship? Her haughty and defiant, him prostrate and pleading?

Edgar would have never played the latter role in his life, but he had fully expected the former from Haley. Instead, an hour after he walked away from their screaming match to take a much-needed shower, he stuck his head into the living room to find her sitting in his favorite chair (what a bitch) staring off into space and rubbing her (Goddamn is she ready to pop) pregnant stomach.

As far as Edgar was concerned, that was the end of the first of presumably many arguments on the subject. He ascended the stairs quietly, and slipped into bed. The day had been long enough, and she clearly wasn’t going anywhere or she would have left already. Haley never came to bed, but neither did he hear the front door slamming behind her before he drifted off – so it seemed she had decided to stay at least for the night. All will be well, Edgar told himself as sleep overtook him. But I doubt she’s going to fix my breakfast for a few days.

The noise which ripped him out of that deep slumber came just after five o’clock in the morning, according to his alarm clock. By the time consciousness took hold, the sound had died as quickly as it came. He stood reflexively, and scanned over the bed with eyes barely awake enough for even that simple task. Eventually determining Haley’s side to be empty, Edgar shuffled out the bedroom door and down the stairs to determine what caused the sudden clamor.

He didn’t need to reach the bottom of the staircase, or allow his eyes further time to adjust, to know that she had decided to leave him after all. One glance into the living room cleared up any doubt on that subject. There were no bulging suitcases, or haughty looks – just an unlocked and opened gun cabinet, a crimson splatter on the wall, and a steady trickle of the same beading down the side of his favorite chair and pooling on the hardwood floor beside it.

After a moment of shocked paralysis, Edgar lunged for the house phone in huge, desperate strides. The rapidity was not for the sake of Haley, through whose newly-ventilated skull he could clearly catch glimpses of the televised presidential debate at the far side of the room, but for her blameless passenger of seven and a half months. He gave all the pertinent information to the infuriatingly indifferent emergency control room operator, and waited in the hallway with the front door flung open wide.

The gunshot had drawn a crowd of early-waking neighbors to the driveway in front of the Freeman residence, a phenomenon bred not out of bravery in the face of danger but from the casual ignorance of danger reserved exclusively for neighborhoods peopled by the wealthy and sheltered. They eyed him accusingly, none with less than dawning suspicion in their gaze. Edgar raged at them for this; first with harsh thoughts, then with guttural growls and impotent flailing. They would collectively step backward when his fury and frustration flowed strongest, and advance again when the yelling waned in ferocity – a human tide of slack-jawed gawkers.

The spectacle was temporarily dissolved by the wailing siren and subsequent appearance of an Advanced Life Support ambulance, from which paramedics rapidly spawned just a few minutes after Edgar’s conversation with their dispatcher (another feature exclusive to the type of neighborhood in which Edgar and Haley Freeman resided). The crowd made way for the emergency vehicles, but soon found a new vantage point on Edgar’s lawn.
The paramedics discovered Edgar’s wife slumped over in his recliner, and strapped her lifeless form into a gurney. Once she was properly secured, they wheeled her rapidly out of the house and into the back of their ambulance. Edgar jumped in as well, and there was no time to either ask or answer any questions before the crew slammed the bay doors and sped off toward the county hospital.

Between checking vital signs and attempts to keep oxygen pumping into the corpse of his wife for the sake of her unborn child, Edgar noted the cautious glances being shot his way by the Paramedics – as well as the blue flashes from multiple police vehicles following close behind the ambulance. I didn’t have anything to do with it, he wanted to say – to scream – but in the back of his mind he knew that was just a degree or two away from being precisely the truth, and so he remained silent.

He had thought they would throw the handcuffs on him as soon as they arrived at the hospital, but instead the throng of police officers just explained they would wait with Edgar while the doctors did what they could for the baby – and maybe get some information from him if he felt up to talking. Edgar nodded assent, largely because the officers bore all the mannerisms of men who intended to get some information from him whether or not he felt up to talking.

They stood outside the operating room, lined up in the viewing area. The officers gave Edgar his space; his face mere inches from the glass, taking occasional breaks to wipe the window off with his sleeve after frantic breaths had fogged it to the point of opacity. They questioned him hesitantly; he answered them hastily and with little regard for the words he used. His concerns were elsewhere, and he knew there was nothing he could unintentionally blurt out to incriminate himself. He watched as the surgeon made a large incision into Haley’s lower abdomen (at least she’s sedated for this, Edgar thought insanely) and set about removing the baby from her womb.

Within a few minutes, everyone in the viewing area knew everything they needed to know. The officers knew that Haley had apparently died at her own hand (the autopsy would either confirm or deny that), that she had likely done it as a result of her husband’s infidelity, and that Edgar had seen little or no warning signs leading up to the suicide. Edgar, meanwhile, knew that the baby was alive but fading fast, that the baby was a boy (they wanted the gender to be a surprise, one of the few things on which he and Haley never disagreed), and that the baby was being placed in an incubator as a last-ditch effort to save its life.

Edgar stood outside the room, the police now keeping an even more respectful distance as he watched his infant son die. There was little commotion about it, and little the doctors could do to prevent it. The child’s eyes opened once the entire time, and the next thing Edgar knew they were pronouncing the time of death as 5:46 AM. They just cut him out of Haley at 5:29, Edgar thought frantically. My kid – my son – was alive less than half an hour. I didn’t even have time to name him. A girl and Haley names him, a boy and I name him; that was the promise we made since we couldn’t even fucking agree on names. Edgar slammed his fist against the wall, and distantly felt his knuckles grinding. As he fell to his knees, his hand hurt far less than the scalding hot tears welling behind his eyes."
1ntf4h,0,2013-10-05,Me [25M] found out my gf of 1 year [23F] did a porno shoot in the past.,throwawayforaproblem,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1ntf4h/me_25m_found_out_my_gf_of_1_year_23f_did_a_porno/,"My gf and I have been dating for a year now and have known each other for a little over a year. We went to cross-town colleges but met at one of my friend's parties. After being friends for a couple of months, things got serious as we started to really like each other. It was as if we were a perfect match. 

I made it clear pretty early on in our relationship that I wanted complete honesty between us because we really liked each other and therefore should at least show the respect of being transparent with things that could affect the other person. She understood and for the most part, things worked perfectly fine for us.

But I got hit with a ton of bricks a couple of days ago. My gf came over to my place visibly a little shaken up and worried. I asked her what was wrong and she hesitated. I thought to myself, okay she cheated and just waited for the bomb to be dropped. I asked her if she cheated and she emphatically said no, that she would never ever do such a thing. She said she loved me and cared for me so much. So I told her to tell me what is wrong then.

She then began to tell me that 2 years ago, while she was still in college and a couple of months before we met, she made a porno video. I asked her what she was talking about because I didn't want to believe it. She said that a couple of months before we met, she got an offer to do one of those amateur teen girl casting videos with a legitimate company. She said she was having some money issues, her internship was not paying well because she was going to school full-time and she didn't want to turn to her parents for help. So she took the gig.

She thought she was lucky because it turned out she was an alternate stand-by for some girl who may or may not have been able to do her own shoot. One of the production guys said that they would pay her the full amount she signed for up front and would use the video if/when they had to. Well just 6 months ago, her video was released and my gf just found out about it a couple of days ago from another friend of hers. She was shocked and worried because she thought that after a year had passed, they had probably decided not to release her video for some reason which is fucking stupid because she's hot so why would they pass up an opportunity like that after paying her already.

I was pissed as she told me all of this and I asked her if they at least used a condom. She said no, that both had to get tested before the shoot. But I didn't care because the fact that she decided to intimately fuck another guy she just met without a condom, on video, made me think she was some floozy slut. 

I told her I was pissed and needed time to register all of this and she started to tear up and apologize and all that which didn't do much for me because of how betrayed I felt. She told me to forgive her and I asked her how after she *literally* whored herself out but most importantly, was not honest about it with me. I told her that I needed a couple of days to think about what was going on even though in my mind, I was sure I was going to dump her either way.

I am so pissed and sad at the same time right now. I trusted and loved this girl and she drops something this big on me like it was no big deal. What sucks even more is that I've met her parents and they like me very much, like a son, and I like them a lot too. I wouldn't know what to tell them if I broke up with their daughter because as pissed off as I am at her, I would never even think about telling them what their daughter had done. After all, she betrayed me, not her parents.

I don't know what to do. I've ignored her calls/texts or the past couple of days just to understand what is going on. No luck so far.


**tl;dr** - Girlfriend was in a porno video before we met and didn't tell me about it. I'm pissed and want to break up with her because I can't stop thinking that she was some dishonest whore to me."
1ny1cz,1,2013-10-07,Who is in the wrong here?,ificouldhaveitall,teenagers,https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/1ny1cz/who_is_in_the_wrong_here/,"So my brother and I have been going to a summer camp for two weeks every year for the past 3 years. Over time, since 2010, we have made many friends. One of these friends is a good friend of both of ours who I will call Hannah. We were like the triple threat, we loved each other so much and it was great. She is a senior in high school now and my brother and I are sophomores.

So this summer we all went as CITs (counselors in training,) and over the two weeks, Hannah and my brother got really close. They started developing feelings and they pursued them. On the last day of camp, we were told whether or not we got an internship, which means we get to stay for another week. Hannah and my brother got it and I didn't. So they stayed another week and pretty much started dating.

Hannah lives in NY and my brother and I live 150 miles away from her. And she's a senior in high school. So it's a long distance relationship between a sophomore and a senior. She is going to college next year.

My problem is that this relationship will obviously not work at all and I have told my brother that and I have flipped out on him numerous times over it and I've said some stuff that I shouldn't have said and of course he told Hannah. She doesn't hate me or anything but we're not the friends we used to be ever since they started dating. It's annoying and they will obviously break up by next summer.

So at *OUR* camp, they're having a get together for everyone at the end of the month and I want to go and see all my friends. My brother doesn't want me to go because he doesn't want me to hang out with him and Hannah but Hannah wants me to go because she misses how we used to be and because camp used to be all of our thing. I am mad because she is my friend to and I can't even talk to her or see her anymore every since their bullshit ""relationship"" started. 

We used to be such good friends and now it's blown because they did this.

Who's in the wrong, me or my brother?"
1ny0op,2,2013-10-07,How to get a paid internship,why_the_love,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1ny0op/how_to_get_a_paid_internship/,"So I will be blunt and honest here, I am asking for some help about how to go about getting an internship. I live in southern California, I have a lot of undergraduate experience in mathematics and physics, but I did not graduate, I will say it was from a pretty good university. 

I am currently working in retail and I have no job experience in programming or any CS related field. I am attending a junior college for computer science and will transfer into a 4-year shortly.

I really don't know if I am wasting my time looking for a paid internship or not. I have programming experience in web dev with PHP and some minimal experience with OOP in Java. 

My plan was to basically create a basic resume and send it out. Should I send it to companies even if they aren't advertising applications for an internship? How do I go about this guys? Thanks."
1nxwbx,0,2013-10-07,my life is a lifetime movie,[deleted],sad,https://www.reddit.com/r/sad/comments/1nxwbx/my_life_is_a_lifetime_movie/,"
I’ve had a pretty rough college experience. My freshman year, four years ago, I was raped in November. The cops found naked and unconscious in a parking lot. I had been drinking, but I was with someone I knew- the person that ended up doing this to me. But I didn’t do anything about it because it was he was my at the time closest friend in college and I didn’t want to start anything because I was drunk. After that I didn’t cope well, it took me a long time to start to hangout with my friends and meet new people again- the way that I was able to do this was through blowing/eating a lot of molly for over a year period that ended in a downward spiral, eating over 2 grams to even feel and effect. But at that time I was seeing a boy G and only intimate with him, he was my backbone during all this. Sadly he was unable to live full time where I did so things feel to the wayside. He was the person that basically helped me be me again after my rape and added in my drug addiction. But a year later I started to date this kid N, because I was trying to filled void of G and love in general, and we stayed together up until last week, which ended up being three years. If it wasn’t for N I would have killed myself, overdoses, or dropped out of college. He was the only one that took care of me and spent time with my pathetic self. But our relationship got very dependent and unhealthy, a lot of other things happened, my unexpected pregnancy and miss carriage, his trying to kill himself because of personal issues. But when all of this started to spiral out of control last November G after he got out of rehab moved to my area and turned my life even more upside down. I had feelings for both, loved and cared for them. Back and forth, back and forth, between the two G and N. G pretty much used me and fucked around with other people. He ended up giving me chlamydia and really fucking up and complicating a lot of thing in my life and relationship with N. I tried so hard to help with his sobriety, be there for him and he would gravitate to me and I would try to be best friend as possible. But I was only taken advantage of in a lot.

But I’ve trying to work on myself, strengthen myself, be independent and stand-alone. So, last weekend when all of my best friends were away I finally cut things completely off with N, ending out long-distance relationship (he moved home after college this past June). This left me feeling the most alone and empty than I have for years. Since high-school I have been filling my void through different drugs, relationships, or meaningless sex and for once I just want to be able to be happy with, love, depend on, and respect myself.  And last week was a really hard struggle. Because I’m in my fifth year of college a lot of my friends have moved away, or are just as busy with school and working full/part time and having an internship, so that makes me feel like I have no one to reach out to because I had been feeling so empty I was wanting to fill that void with the number of substances I’ve had issues with over the years. I decided that I wanted to take it easy this weekend, stay in, and see G on Saturday night after I got out of work because he leaves tomorrow (Tuesday) for NJ for court then jail for his second DUI. Saturday he ended up blowing me off and screaming at me at 3AM for not going to the bar. Despite that I am broke, starting to get depressed, didn’t get off work until 11:30PM, and made shit for tips. Sunday morning continued the same way, with him yelling at me over the phone and ended in a text from him telling me that he came out to everyone last night, and that he is gay. I cannot help but be hurt and upset. I am not angry at all that he is gay. I am happy for his self-discovery and honesty. I hope that it will allow him to actually become sober and not use substances as a coping mechanism for this probably long time inner turmoil. What I am sad about it that I feel used, lied to, taken advantage of, a piece of ugly meat that he was never attracted to in the first place, and the thing that made him feel like, wow, this is so disgusting I now realize that I could never be attracted to that.  I hate myself for hating myself that caused not respect my body or myself and sleep around and get taken advantage of by people that do not care about or deserve me. I’ve put in so much time, care, and love into a human being that has only made me hate myself even more and hurt me (and he’s not the first person to do this to me). Not only that he drove a huge rift in my relationship with my best friend NC. To the point where at time I wondered if they were fucking, but she ended up being the one the he came out to and she and my other best friend H kept this secret from me for two months while G continued to fuck me and play games with me. I know they were doing the right thing be being quite, because coming out is extremely personal and not something for something to tell another person about someone else. I fully acknowledge that they were acting properly, but I cannot help but feel hurt, lied to, and betrayed by the people that I really need to rely on right now. I cannot reach out to them. I have huge trust issues and something like this, although I know they were doing the right thing, really just destroy my trust in them because they watched and played dumb and he’s ripped me apart and used the past few months. I feel so alone. I hate myself. I cannot stop crying and do not know what to do. On top, of that I have this inner turmoil of wanting to handle this on my own, but part of me just really needs someone to come hold me or hangout with me. I don’t want to feel like I need someone to be they’re for me, and I hate that I feel this way but I honestly cannot handle being alone right now. It’s making me even more depressed. I don’t know what to do or who to turn to. I’m so ashamed of myself.

1nxpsd,69,2013-10-07,Interested in contributing to Dota Radio? We have one on-air host position available! Details inside,TheRealZyori,DotA2,https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/1nxpsd/interested_in_contributing_to_dota_radio_we_have/,"Hey guys!

Dota Radio launched with a bang, much in thanks to some awesome support from Reddit!  We wanted to start this thread off with an expression of gratitude for all the feedback and praise that showed up across the multiple threads folks put up.

As many of y’all know, our goal is to emulate a more traditional radio format, which means adding radio talk shows to our programming!  Right now we’re working on launching the *Dota Radio Morning Show*, which will air 5 days a week for about 45 minutes in the morning (around 10am EST) before we begin casting for the day.  

The show format is modeled after what they do over at [The Dan Patrick Show](http://www.danpatrick.com/), but for Dota 2 instead of traditional sports.  The format hinges on our ability to find interview guests on essentially a daily basis- that's where you come in.

------

We are looking to add one person to the staff to fill a necessary role in this newscast.  The person that fills this position will serve as a permanent on-air host, but will also need to have channels of communication with potential guests, including players, casters, team managers, team owners, bloggers, and really anyone with an informed opinion about what’s happening in Dota 2.

We need someone with a vast network in Dota 2 that is comfortable approaching prominent community members for statements and offering interview slots.  This individual will work very closely with Zyori and Hippie in organizing show content.  He/she will be given creative freedom over who to approach and how to best utilize our time slot set aside for interviews.  Someone up-to-date on recent tournaments and match results is most desirable.  

TLDR; your job is to find daily interview guests for our Dota 2 newscast

------

**Requirements:**

* Decent quality mic
* Firm grasp of the English language
* Availability from ~10-11am EST at least 4 days a week
* *Well connected with players, team managers, and community members*
* Passionate about Dota 2 &amp; esports

------

**Bonus:**

* Nearly Philadelphia / South Jersey / Delaware area
* Experience in live show production

------

**As for pay:**

We do have some funds available, but we much prefer to invest in hardware and infrastructure rather than directly into people’s pockets whenever possible.  Most of our staffers operate as interns that are looking to get something on their esports resume. There is a possibility for pay, though most likely through revenue-sharing options.  Compensation varies greatly by individual and will be discussed on a case-by-case basis; payment is possible for the right candidate.

This position is a great way to make a name for yourself and be on air 5 days a week without having to invest in quality streaming equipment.  It's also perfect for someone who free lances or works on a flexible schedule that wants to get their foot in the door with Dota 2.

------

**How to apply:**

There isn’t an official way we want folks to spend us their information.  Keep it simple; tell us about yourself, your history in dota, how long you’ve been following the scene, and the size of your network.  Links are good.  Links are really good.  Social media links are helpful too. Please include an audio air check or cast you’ve done, as well.

**The most important factor is your ability to contact people on a daily basis for quotes/comments and find fresh people to interview.**

Email your app to: contact@dotaradio.com 

If you're not sure what Dota Radio is you can find all the details at: http://www.dotaradio.com 

Thanks!! See yall soon :)

Good GPA, involved in lots of school activities, etc. The problem is I have never had any idea of what I wanted to do with my life, so instead of getting internships over the summer in CS like everyone else, I was exploring other possible career paths. Now that I graduated I decided to stick with CS, but I have no experience outside of school. Every job I look at seems to require me either still being in school, or having more than 1 year experience. I seem to be stuck in the middle. What can I do to solve this?"

1nxina,0,2013-10-07,Big 4 Target School and its starting to look like I will be in the minority WITHOUT a Big 4 offer :( Feeling pretty down right now.,[deleted],Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/1nxina/big_4_target_school_and_its_starting_to_look_like/,"So, I go to one of the top accounting schools in my area and it really seems like at least half the people in my classes already have jobs lined up in the Big 4. 

I know plenty others in my classes who don't but I'm a top performer in my classes and in previous jobs so I'm really getting bent out of shape over it.

I applied to all four firms.

Delloite- never got to schedule an interview and everyone I talked to who applied didn't get to either (about 5 of us).

EY- I have a second interview lined up.

PWC- Interviewed Thursday and no call back or email.

KPMG- interviewed Wednesday and no call back or email.

I'm really just feeling pretty down. I don't want to be in public forever so I need to start at a really big firm.

I just don't even know what to do with myself. I must have really blew it. 

Also, if you're wondering why I didn't intern Big 4 its because I missed the deadlines and was unsure if I was eligible. I'm a rare commuter student at my school so I don't get to hear about all of this stuff the same way. Sometimes I think the fact that I'm a commuter student hurts me because when alum interview us they want to talk to someone like themselves."
1nxiec,2,2013-10-07,2L at T14. To drop out or not to drop out?,[deleted],LawSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/LawSchool/comments/1nxiec/2l_at_t14_to_drop_out_or_not_to_drop_out/,"I am currently attending a t14 paying sticker. I understood the risks of going to law school but decided to risk it anyway. I had the usual ""plan""- do well as a 1L, and then join the 40+% of students from my school who get BigLaw gigs, work at the firm for 5 years or so, in that time pay off all of my debt and save some money, then switch to a position that pays well (but not BigLaw well) but offers normal working hours. 

Well, unfortunately (at least for me) I did not do well in my first year. Even though I did all the assignments, read supplements, and took practice tests for every class- I ended up in the bottom 1/3. OCI comes and goes and I strike out.

Now, the problem is that I am taking on all of this school debt when according to my school career adviser my best chance of landing a job is targeting small firms that pay anywhere from 45k to 70k (this is assuming I'm even going to get a job there). 

I thought about going the DA route, but my interests lie in business law. So even if I somehow manage to convince the DA that I always wanted to be a prosecutor and get a summer internship, the city I want to work in has a hiring freeze at the DA's office.

I have also considered doing JAG, but that's just not something I am interested in- I like having control over my life, even if I do make foolish decisions that cost me a lot of money.

If I drop out now, I will have a six figure debt, but it will be half of what it is going to be if I stay in law school until graduation. I could at least land an entry-level job that pays 35k a year; and, and 35k a year working 40 hour week with 100k debt  seems better than 60k a year working 60 hour weeks with 200k debt (plus, the interest on 200k will make a huge difference)

Should I cut my losses now and do something else? Or stick it out till the end? What would you do in my shoes? 

Thank you.

1nxfay,1,2013-10-07,Stressed undergrad looking for insight regarding education path and career outlook!,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1nxfay/stressed_undergrad_looking_for_insight_regarding/,"**Caution: Wall of Text**  
  

I am currently an undergraduate student at a state university studying Information Technology with a minor in Computer Science. This is my 2nd year in college but I graduate in the Spring of next year (2015) because of credits I have come in with. I really like the IT curriculum and very much enjoy the information systems and data analysis coursework.  
  
**First Question**  

I have a passion for development (strong interest in web application development) that I just discovered last year through a web development class. However, I am also gaining interest in database management. Are there any positions that could involve developing as well as database design/administration?
  
  
**Second Question**  
  
I have a couple of options when looking at the future.  
  
**My first option** would be to pursue a Master's degree. I really enjoy learning relevant technologies at a college level, and I think it would be nice to have a Master's degree. I am also not losing much time since I will most likely be finishing this degree close to after people my age would be graduating.    

  
I know many of you would advise against this, however, I will have around 29 credits already paid for if I did this and most of the Master's program I am looking at are around 32-33 credits. Would I be foolish not to take this opportunity?  
  
  
**My second option** would be to find an entry level position after my Bachelor's. Like I said earlier, I just started to pursue programming and development last year. Being so, I do not have much of a portfolio to show off at the moment. I am currently working on this though! In my free time I am learning more programming languages and computer science topics (e.g. Udacity, Code School, Learn Code the Hard Way) and am going to start working on side projects soon.  
  
I feel like I am behind though. I need to look for an internship for Summer 2014, and then I graduate next year. If I continue to learn on my own and work on side projects alongside my course work, would I have enough knowledge/experience to get an entry level position in software or web development?  At the moment, I am fairly proficient in HTML/CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, and I am currently learning Ruby. I also know Java, but not as well as I should. I work at a Software Company also. I started out as a Help Desk Agent last year and have since been moved to QA(going to start unit testing next week)! They also have encouraged me to learn C# to further my abilities there. Also by the time I graduate with my BS, I will have taken C++, Java, Python, and PHP courses.
  
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  

I am sorry for the amount of information but I feel a little overwhelmed trying to think this through on my own and needed a place to express my concerns. Any advice, comments, and feedback are truly appreciated.  
  
**Also** to add on to the Master's part: I plan on pursuing a Computer Science degree. I have also been looking at MIS but currently CS is ideal. Would I have problems getting into grad school with my IT degree and the CS minor?(Assuming I can demonstrate basic CS knowledge)

I need a little help, here. I don't have much experience with C# and just did a little programming before, so please be kind ;)

I wrote a little program that reads a txt file, searches it for the facts i need and put these in a SQL db. Everything works fine, but the thing is, that the method is called when i click a button, therefore it puts the same data into the db everytime the button is clicked.

Is there a way to avoid this other than to disable the button sensitivity? 
I have absolutely no knowledge of SQL thus far, so i don't know if i can handle this problem with it or not. Or how.
(I'm an intern, so i got a little help setting the db up but that's all).
I don't have the Code here, but let me know if something is unclear or you need more info or whatsoever!


edit: here's a little summary of what i'm doing


    protected void OnButton1Clicked(object sender, EventArgs e)
    {
      import();
    }

    private void import()
    {
        string[] textlines=File.ReadAllLines(@&lt;location of file&gt;);
        foreach(string line in textlines)                                //it's repetitive text with the same variables so i   need to repeat the following 
           {
              if(line.StartsWith(""zHd""))
               { //here come a few methods to get the value i need for my variables (splitting the line etc)
                } 
                 //also some more if-request to get the other variables i need
              if(line.StartsWith(""--""))      // i have all i need now and can put the first row into the db
                      //    here comes the method to put the variables in the db, i can't remember it right now, 
                      //    but it worked 
        }
    }

                                               
i simplified it, because i don't think you need to know how many data i need to get for my database to understand my problem.
Due to the fact that import() is called on ButtonClicked everytime i hit the button it adds the same five rows(that's how much data i got from the .txt file) into the db.
So my question is now if i can avoid this somehow?

Also, sorry i can't remember the sql code but it really was just putting the variables in the right column-order.

the summer, 23 students had unpaid internships at US Immigration and
Customs Enforcement (ICE). The summer internships varied in length from four to 12 weeks. They worked with forensic investigators, examining devices confiscated by ICE agents. In the first round, 300 students applied, 200 were interviewed, and 23 selected for the program. DHS plans to increase the number of students participating in the program and to include another agency in the next round of internships. The announcement for the new round will be published by early November, and the 12-week internships are expected to begin in February or March 2014.

This is all due to my schedule. I have to be up in the morning at around 4 or 5 am depending how I am feeling. Be out of the house an hour later and have another hour commute to college. Then I wont leave for another 12-14 hours in which basically 100% of that time is being productive whether it is spent in class, studying, doing work, or practicing on my primary instrument (music major... kind of).

This'll probably end up being pretty long, but I'd truly appreciate it if some of you would read through it. Thanks for listening, I'd love to hear any advice if anybody has some ideas on how I can improve my life or be happier in general.

I've been having a rough couple years, and it's getting tougher and tougher to be able to convince myself things will get better. It all started when I was diagnosed two years ago with a skin condition that, while not-immediately life threatening, is very demoralizing and stressful. Without going into a ton of detail, it's a very, very rare genetic condition that causes tumors to grow in my skin all over my body. They start tiny and take years to grow, but they never go away, they just keep growing over time. While only a few are even visible now, I already have more than 50 growing in my skin all over me, and it's likely that after a few more years, I'll really start becoming disfigured by it. The only ""cure"" is to go through very painful (and expensive, thanks U.S. healthcare industry) surgeries to remove them, and it just wouldn't be possible to have enough surgeries to rid them all. Besides, I'd be riddled with scars and more tumors would just grow in their place eventually. Despite some of the tumors causing pain, insurance will often just claim the condition is cosmetic and therefore operations to remove them are no more essential than plastic surgery. So getting a single dime of treatment covered is a fight every single time, and I often have to wait until a tumor causes excruciating pain to finally get it cut out. The medical industry doesn't give a shit about this condition; in fact, there's more money being spent to research this condition in dogs than in human beings (apparently dogs can get it too). 

While the chances of this condition becoming life-threatening are somewhat rare, the dangers are there; if one of these things starts to grow in my internal organs, I could die. This condition also mimics the growth patterns and form of a very deadly cancer too, and so if I get this certain type of cancer the odds would be virtually zero that it would be detected early enough to treat me (before it spreads).

While the chances of this killing me are fairly low, it's so, so, stressful. I've been slammed with a nagging feeling of existential dread that's been beating me down for two years straight. I think about this condition every single day and feel sick whenever I find another lump, wondering if maybe my luck has run out and this one is cancerous. Wondering how disfigured I'll be in a few years even if I manage to not get cancer. Wondering how long I have to live. Wondering if I'll somehow one day come up with enough money to get the most painful tumors removed, as they get more and more painful. On top of all that, I've worked very hard to get myself in great athletic shape and I'm very proud of my body, so it makes me feel awful to see my body slowly being disfigured, to see all that hard work go to waste. It leeches away at my self-worth and esteem and has taken away one of the things that gave me confidence, being in great shape. Running my hands over my body, I can feel the tumors by the dozen in my skin. I can't imagine anyone wanting to touch me because of these, and being fearful about someone being affectionate with me makes me feel awful. If someone ends up loving me at some point, I dread the day I have to tell them about this disease, and the reaction they might have when they try to be affectionate and touch me.

I previously struggled with depression for years and was finally, finally, just coming out of it and starting to feel truly happy when I was diagnosed with this condition. It sent me spiraling right back down, way below where I was even at the first place. My girlfriend of two years saw my mood changing and started to act much more distantly towards me. When I tried to talk about it, she would complain that the condition was all I ever talked about and would get angry at me for being sad all the time. She eventually moved back in with her family and started to ignore me. Despite that, I still worked as hard as I could to keep the relationship together, but no matter what I did she would remain emotionally distant. Eventually, after a lot of passive-aggressive behavior from her and a constant refusal to ever talk about our relationship in order to try to work things out, I broke up with her.

Now I feel like I have absolutely no support system. Money is way too tight for a therapist. I recently graduated from college, and all my friends have relocated to various sides of the country for work. I'm stuck in a shitty small town in the southern U.S., and I hate it here. I can count on one hand the number of people that are within twenty years of my age that live here, no joke. It's essentially a retirement community. I feel so, so alone. My friends have gradually stopped talking to me, and initiating conversation rarely works anymore, I usually get no response. I know I have to move out of here as soon as I can, I feel like I'm absolutely wasting the best years of my life alone in a place with no chance at a better job or making new friends or finding a relationship. So I'm applying for jobs all over the country, and despite a killer resume, a ton of relevant skills, internship experience in several major cities, and graduating with honors from one of the best schools in the world, not a single job application has even warranted a response. Not even a rejection or a ""thanks for applying"" generic form letter. I knew applying for jobs out of state in a competitive industry would be difficult, but after 6 months of effort to absolutely no effect, it's hard not to feel worthless. I see nearly every single one of my friends from college landing jobs, going on adventures, living in fun cities, making a career for themselves, and finding relationships, and it makes me furious, jealous, and hateful. Where did I fuck up? I have incredible grades and plenty of work experience, why do I get to be left behind? I went to a great school, I got great grades, I worked my ass off every single day for years and years, what did I do wrong?

And so I'm stuck here, in a town I hate, with no friends for hundreds of miles, no chance of making new ones here, nobody to talk to, no career, treading water in a low-paying, no-future job that doesn't allow me money enough to do anything but sit at home on my days off. The feeling that I'm wasting what's left of my youth and the best years of my life is eating me alive. The stress of my medical problems has been dragging me slowly, slowly, down and I can barely even remember what life was like before this disease. One piece of advice I received from an older person here was ""go out and have fun, your 20's are the only time in life you don't need to worry about medical problems!"" All I've done every single day for two years is torture myself over my medical problems, and it made me feel even worse to think that most people my age don't even think about stupid bullshit like medical conditions. I'd give years and years of my life away for just a single minute of having the medical stress lifted off my shoulders. And I know I'll never, ever be free of this disease, that those days are long gone.

I've felt lonely for so long that it's growing into something worse, a constant feeling of cynicism and hate towards myself, the future, and the world in general. Even though I used to get compliments all the time from women (when I was actually around people my age) on my looks and my intelligence, I still didn't feel any better about life, or myself, or my future. I don't know why. I assume the worst case scenario in every situation I come across and I have no hope for my future, which I know is a little silly, the odds are still on my side to have something of a decently happy life, and obviously billions of people have it much worse than me, but I still feel hopeless. I never had a fantasy that I'd be a millionaire and things would always be easy and my life would be struggle-free, but I never guessed my life would be this...demoralizing and lonely. 

I'm a kind, loving person, and being so, so, lonely is the worst feeling imaginable for me, because I remember this feeling very well; back when I first struggled with depression, saying I didn't handle it well would be a massive understatement. I isolated myself, lost all my friends, and didn't talk to anyone for years and years. I obviously learned that that wasn't the way to deal with it, so I made friends, chased my dreams, and slowly climbed out of the pit. I was happy, finally, for a time. But now I find myself just as alone and isolated, and the difference now is that I feel like it's been forced upon me. The loneliness has brought some bad, bad memories back.

On the outside, I'm tough. I'm happy. I'm invincible. I'm fine. I'm tough. Nothing's wrong. I'm a man. I'm tough. But on the inside I feel gutted, ripped apart, and completely, completely, alone. Knowing that while I'm in this city nothing will get better just makes the job search even more depressing and desperate. I can't imagine a few more months like this. I'd give nearly everything I have for a warm, loving hug, a smile, or a gentle hand to hold through the night. Or even just someone to talk to in person, some sort of eye contact. It's hard to believe a couple years ago I was happy. That I had finally escaped depression and things were looking up. I've found myself becoming cynical, jaded, hopeless, and hateful, and I despise every second I spend here. I just want a reason to be hopeful, something to think about that isn't so bleak and lonely.

Thank you for listening. Despite what it might sound like, I'm not trying to throw a ""woe-is-me"" pity party. I'm tough as nails, I'm one hell of a fighter. I just wish some sort of luck would find me after these last couple miserable years is all. Thanks in advance for any advice you might have to give. If you read through that whole thing, thank you so much."

1nw0tv,7,2013-10-07,Mixed Signals! How do you know when another guy is interested in you more than just a friend?,dcubed333,askgaybros,https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/1nw0tv/mixed_signals_how_do_you_know_when_another_guy_is/,"I know there are hundreds of posts about similar situations, but I wanted to post my story and see what kind of next step advice people would suggest. 

I'm 24, freshly out of the closet, and currently finishing my last semester at graduate school.  My coming out happened after spending 3 months in NYC this past summer for an internship.  It was the perfect opportunity for me to live authentically in a new city, as I had finally reached a point in my life where I accepted me for me.  

Upon my return to grad school this fall, I began to share with only a few close friends that I had come out.  I go to a VERY small private business school and people love to gossip.  Therefore word started to get out about me, but I am fairly confident that not everyone at school knows that I am gay.

Enter the guy in question.  Lets call him GB. I've casually known GB since last year, but after we returned to school and gossip has gone around about my sexuality, he has been giving me a lot of attention and more mixed signals than I know what to do with. I spent a lot of time this summer trying to learn the ins and outs of gaydar from other gay friends in NYC, and I feel like GB has thrown a wrench in my detection system.

It all started one night a bar that everyone from school hangs out at.  
Backstory of GB.  He's tall, good looking, athletic, and literally every girl at school lines up to throw themselves at him.  However, he has never pursued a girl at school and he's left girls probably more frustrated than me. 

Back to the bar. A few weeks after school, I saw him standing at the bar waiting for a drink and I decided to walk up next to him to order myself one. After he jokingly puts his arm around me and says some cheesy pickup line (caught me way off guard), we started to talking about post graduation plans.

We talked for 2 hours (never have we talked that long before). First thing I noticed was the most consistent direct eye contact I've ever had with anyone.  I don't think we looked away from each other once. We kept finding so many things in common with one another and the conversation flowed so naturally.   It ended with him asking for my number.  Later that night he texted me saying, ""it was so good getting to know you more tonight, sorry we haven't talked sooner. Lets meet up this week.""

At this point in time I had convinced myself that he was straight and all I was doing was simply projecting what I wanted to see in his behavior. I do this so as to not get my hopes up, as with any platonic straight guy friend. But then a few nights later, one of my good girl friends from school (not knowing anything of that night at the bar with GB) texts me saying ""GB gay?? If so get on it!""

Confused I responded by asking her to explain. She said that a bunch of girls at school were convinced that he is gay and really far in the closet. My first thought was, okay, he are 5 jealous girls who are just pissed that GB doesn't respond to their advances. But then over the past month and multiple questionable actions, I'm starting to think they are right.

Since the bar, GB and I have hung out quite a bit.  This is strange, because what I noticed since last year is that GB is very popular on campus and is always seen with groups of people.  However, now all of a sudden he takes a lot of time out of his week to spend just with me and specifically one on one.  We grab meals together of campus, go hiking, and spend time just talking. In addition to constant eye contact every time we meet, he has now started to throw in fleeting touches.  Such as lightly grabbing my thigh or touching my arm when making a point. At a recent meeting on campus for a club, he leaned in close behind me while seated and whispered in my ear while letting his face brush against mine. (I nearly lost it!)

I would respond with more flirting, but I'm honestly left not knowing what to do. Especially during one instance this past week where I got super mixed signals. We had just gotten back from going out to a late dinner and drinks and we're sitting in my car.  When it was time to say goodbye or continue that night and he got really nervous and quite uncomfortable.  All of a sudden after 4 hours of eye contact he wouldn't look me in the eye after we pulled into the parking lot. It was like he had something to say, or was waiting for me to say something but I didn't. All we said was goodnight and ""talk tomorrow.""

We texted and talked since then, and are meeting up again this week, but I don't know where to go from here. 

 1.) I am not entirely sure he knows I am gay. I've never directly told him, although I believe he heard me talking about it with a friend at the bar (she was drunk and literally yelling at me ""why do you have to be gay?"" Haha) Should I directly tell him I am gay? And if so, how do I causally work that in without freaking him out if he really is still in the closet or just straight? It all just seems weird to me that he really started talking to me after people at school began to find out I was gay. Maybe just coincidence.

2.) As mentioned, if he is gay and not ready to deal with it/accept it I don't want to make him feel uncomfortable. Over the course of this questionable month I've begun to really appreciate his friendship and I am afraid to lose that. If he is in the closet and not accepting it, I've been there (after all I waited till 24 until I fully accepted it), and I don't want to flirt with him, freak him out, and send him further in the closet.

3.) Is there any subtle ways I can flirt back to send signals to him that I am interested? The only ""safe"" ways I've learned are maintaining his eye contact, looking away shyly every once and awhile and also playing the fleeting touch game.

I guess I am just frustrated because I don't know how to proceed and I can tell that I've started to develop feelings for him. If you've made it this far thanks for reading.  Reading Gaybros has helped me get through a lot of my own personal coming out process.  I would appreciate any advice or insight people are willing to offer. You guys are the best."

I'm doing an Arts degree with IT and Geography as my subject choices. I wanted to do a CS course but I didn't get the points (It's a Irish system, long story short, I didn't get in) so I decided to take up arts as I wasn't even sure if I was gonna like IT or not at the time, but now I've come to discover that I really like coding. I love the feeling when I get my assignments to run and when I'm bored I'll write some basic programs to help me in my everyday life such as wages calculators for my job and what not.

I'll come out of the course with experience in programming in Python, Visual Basic and Java as well as some basic HTML. I'm also taking AI and Multimedia as optional modules this year. By the end of the year I'll have done a final year project consisting of designing an Integrated Transport System for a city, as well as having written a conference paper on an original research topic of my choice. 

What I want to know is, where do I go from here? Will I need to do a postgrad or a master specifically in IT to really be in with a chance of getting a job. My brother, who has a masters in CS has a friend who works for Google who is going to try and get me on the list for a possible interview with them for an internship, although that is very slim at best.

Since I've got no family or friends that are really fit to give advice, I thought I'd ask for some help.

Story: I'm an Engineering and Science major who's been working his way through College. Took on an Internship in Florida, which I loved, just the circumstances weren't a perfect fit. I received a job offer opportunity from a friend, but turned it down since I didn't know how to go out and look for a place. Instead, I trekked back 3,000 miles and am back home to the familiar, where I'm mistreated.

My options right now:

1. I've received two job offers thus far, both well-known corporations. The only concern is it means I'd be staying in the state I don't really enjoy. Would it be worth the while of taking upon two jobs, and how would I go about doing so? (Not conflict of interests)

2. Return to Florida after 6 Months, and apply for a new job. The main concern is, how would I find a place to stay beforehand while I'm so far away?

3. A combination of the two: Take upon the first job offer, whom support my growth and eventually transfer down to Orlando after looking for an apartment beforehand. Once 6 months is up, then apply for my old job (non-Internship) for extra money, and the enjoyment.

Overall, I'm just really stressed about the next few months and am really unsure on how to go about taking care of it all. Unfortunately, it doesn't look like school is in the plans, albeit my love for it. 

I'd really appreciate any advice, as everything helps. Thanks.

TL;DR Unsure about the future, need advice."
1o0u29,0,2013-10-08,My Problem with J. Crew,NobleGnome,malefashionadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/1o0u29/my_problem_with_j_crew/,"In high school I was a very competitive rower.  I was always trying to put on muscle, particularly in my legs, which gave me some scary proportions.  I at a time I was a 6' tall, 145lbs, guy who could leg press 1200lbs.  Because of this, I never invested in clothes because the fit would never be decent with out a tailor and I knew I would just out grow them in a couple months anyways.

However, now that I'm done with crew and have a decent paying internship, I want to invest in clothes that will last, which brought me to J. Crew.  Now I buy everything from them.  If I need a shirt, sweater, jeans, really any basics, I just wait for it to go on sale and pick it up with my student discount.  I know my sizes with them so I can shop effortlessly and I rarely ""need"" tailoring.  I'm not bored with anything I've purchased from them which is perfect because everything has lasted for longer than expected.  And in short, this is my problem.  With the exception of some shoes, ties, and other accessories, I find myself getting dressed in the morning wearing almost exclusively in J. Crew.

I am worried that I'm not branching out enough but I'm so content with my purchases at J. Crew that ordering from a different company who's fit might not be right and who is more expensive just isn't worth the risk for me.

Should I try to expand where I shop and if so where do you recommend?
tl;dr I exclusively shop at J. Crew, is this a problem?"
1o0rb6,5,2013-10-08,Advice on Headhunters/Recruitment agencies,kindofengineer,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/1o0rb6/advice_on_headhuntersrecruitment_agencies/,"Hello /r/engineeringstudents

A bit of a back story: 

I graduated with a BS in Mechanical Engineering Technology this summer. Due to poor life choices and shitty circumstances, my GPA fell to 1.04 after my freshman year. I took a year off to figure things out and I finally got my degree after 6 years in school, with a GPA of 2.4. Now I know that's pretty shitty for an engineering GPA, but what's done is done.

I don't really have anything in the way of internship experience as I was an international student without a work permit, and nobody wants to sponsor a work permit for a student. The only thing I have going for me is a bunch of academic projects that I've been involved in over the years and I did mention that in detail in my resume.

I've been applying to about 100+ jobs on job aggregate sites like monster, indeed, beyond, careerbuilder etc. and even submitted my resume to a bunch of recruiting agencies like kelly, adecco, etc. but so far all I've gotten back are a handful of phone calls and 4 in person interviews. I thought I did well in the interviews, but apparently not well enough. I had some amazing referrals for the last job I interviewed to, but its been a month and they just gave me the ""we're still deciding"" bullshit when I called back.

So anyways, it's been about 3 months of job searching now, and I'm getting pretty desperate. I don't have any loans to pay, but I need to support my parents who pretty much put me through school and paid for all of my expenses. If anyone can offer me advice or let me know of headhunters or agencies that specialize in placing engineers, I would be grateful. I've heard that some take a percent of your pay as a cut, but at this point, if they can get me a job, I don't really care. Any help would be appreciated, thanks!"

My self and two friends want to compete and think we have a legitimate shot at being one of the six finalists sent to Disneyland California (for free) IF we got one more team-member. We're looking for someone with great creativity but also has great skill in computer-based art programs. We have noticed that past winners have one thing in common: their submissions are very professional when it comes to the design/presentation aspect. The three of us are as creative as it gets, but means nothing if we have no way to present our ideas. Finalists will present in front of a panel of imagineers and cast members, and all finalists have a shot at possibly getting internships with Disney Imagineering. 

If you're slightly interested, would like more information, and are creative with skills in computer-based design programs (photoshop, etc.) send me a PM. I would like to send in our application in the next few days.

I hate to complain because I have been fortunate enough to work 40 hours a week and make a decenty salary, plus benefits.

Yet, I feel like I hit a ""wall"" the way runners do when they reach a point they feel they cant go any further and if they do, every inch of them is yelling, stop!

I feel that way now, I feel overwhelmed and I don't know how to shake the funk im in at work. The reason for this is I rarely say no to an opportunity. I have been getting work piled on me and I am having a hard time just getting through it. I just see this big mountain of stuff that I need to complete, with not alot of time and little amount of resources.

I am doing about 11 different tasks at my job right now and it's really really draining. Once a week I am on the floor helping customers with resumes, computer skills, cover letters, applications, faxing, emails, copies and community resources. Then I oversee paperwork for one of our partners and have to complete a very specific and involved paperwork packet for their clients as we are their partner and oversee their enrollment, I do two of these and the paperwork for each person is aobut 1/4 inch thick, then everything is made into triplicates. As well as enter the information into a program. I also teach a computer literacy workshop twice a month for the general public. I also do paperwork for a Union training center, we are in charge of their enrollments and paperwork. Also, at my office we have about 70-100 diferent type copies that are single, double sided or in packets that we have out for the general public, in  order to make mass copies here, we have to order them from our main office and keeping up with that alone is a challange. Also am in partnership with a local utility company doing outreach for youth in the area where i recruit the local highschools in the area and screen them for internships, last time i saw over 500 applications, by hand. I am also part of a research team putting together a packet for the available apprenticeships available in our area of all types to have as a resouce. I teach a workshop on conflict management/office politics/workplace ethics. I am on a panel to create a video to have running at our office for our cutomers that bridges our employess and what they do to the public. I want to have an introduction of all of our staff and our main functions on video and played on repeat so that the customers can get familiar with our staff and be informed of what they can get involved in. Lastly I am also on a panel to improve our in office advertising. We have alot o fbare walls with just pieces of paper laminated and thumbtacked up. I secured funds to get legitimate signs, so i am overseeing exactly what will go up on our walls, etc.

I'm a few years shy of my thirties, and i have been doing this for 5 years and 7 months now. Granted I wasnt doing all of this when i first started, but I started when i was 23 and am now i feel really really burned out. It's great the job is somewhat fulfilling, but i just dont feel like i have enough time to do everything, especially this year.

Alsot, of the stuff i am doing is outside of my job scope, which i never cared about in my life, but i would say about 70 to 80% of this stuff that i am doing is pretty much extra. 

My company is non profit, but i heard somewhere if you can bring in busines x3 your salary, then you are considered a successful an asset to your company. Theres no way for me to guage that as we just get yearly funds but i feel like im doing my part and more.

I have days where i just want to ignore all reason and flat out quit. What can i do to keep myself motivated to overcome all these duties... I know that I will, it's in my nature, but what can i do to make sure my level of quality doesnt slip? Also, how can i make this stuff not affect me outside of work? I am constantly worried about this or that and feel like am am working around the clock, i dont have alot of separation from work and home or at least it feels like that.

It is the end of my sophomore year of college, and as with any lazy entitled college kid, I'm procrastinating my FASFA and looking forward to spring break. Afraid to tell my parents about said FASFA, I think ""Oh well, what's a couple more days?"" Thinking I can enjoy spring break and then submit the fasfa through subterfuge by questioning my parents nonchalantly about tax information. 

Dick move on my part, but I have a habit of lying about my procrastination to the extreme in order to present a facade of normality, even it creates huge problems later on. You know when you think if you ignore a problem long enough it will magically go away? That's my auto-mode.

Bear with me.

Jump forward to halfway through the summer. I've decided to stay in the city instead of going home for the summer, in an apartment my dad is paying for, in order to get a summer job and start living my own life. The apartment is a good deal because it is slightly cheaper than college dorming, and I plan to be paying part of the rent with my summer job. No summer job, and I have to retake an extremely difficult class that I got a D in originally (though I have learned I passed it with a B this time).

Still haven't filed that FASFA. That point in procrastination where you know you are so late that just a COUPLE more days/weeks can't fuck you over any more than you already are.  Plus, has to request W2 forms to file the FASFA now, which can take 60 days to process, and god fuck, already fucked over.

Falling into a circle of anxiety, shame, and depression due to loneliness, my own idiotic stupidity, and doubts about my mechanical engineering major. Thinking I should have gone to art school, know parents will never support it now, feel trapped in a rut because I chose mechanical engineering purely based on money and career options. 

Just before fall semester begins, finally buck up the courage to talk to parents, and possibly request a semester or year off to get my head back in the game. Didn't tell them about the FASFA thing, figuring I could handle it with my school without my parents finding out for some ungodly stupid reason. Lied that I still wanted to do mechanical engineering. Got a slightly-above-minimum-wage job that can cover my rent completely and most of my living expenses, which was a bonus in my argument.

Condition for time off was to see a counselor. Agreed, thinking that yes, I DO need to talk to someone. Figured I could do it on my days off, weekly.

Have not contacted or sought out any type of counselor or therapist, and have procrastinated on filling out my leave of absence form for college. Am possibly up for default/delinquency, though I have (finally) responded my financial office lady at school about meeting up to hash things out.

 Have entertained thoughts of both running away to Portland, Oregon and creating a new life or possibly suicide, neither remotely serious thoughts and only kind of half baked fantasies that flit through and are easily dismissed.

I have so many opportunities and am so goddamn entitled by I throw it all away by being a useless fucktard that can't get shit done on time because she is too lazy.

I know the logical thing to do is to sit down with my parents, tell them I have a compulsive habit of lying and procrastination, and seek help. Possibly even go away to the loony bin for a while. 

I know the logical thing to do is to get my shit together, finish college, get the internship that's damn near promised me by my dad's friend, and do art on the side. Maybe even go to college for art later.

But hell, I'm that stupid kind of optimist. I think I have a romanticized version of supporting myself, maybe because then I don't have to worry about disappointing anyone else because all of my choices will be on me. I like the appeal of working to support myself now, even if it's just waitressing, instead of going through two more years of fucking school that I hate to get into a career that I'll be stuck in for 20+ years.

And I just.... I have no idea what to do. Now, I know that turning to the internet for advice is a crappy choice for dealing with life-altering problems, but I just want to see if anyone out there has gone through similar circumstances.

So, my questions:
-How the hell do I get out of my current financial blunder?
-How the hell do I talk to my parents about all of this and possibly NOT get sent off to mental-rehab?


**TL;DR:  WAS A LAZY PROCRASTINATING IDIOT AND DIDN'T FILE MY FASFA, LEAVE OF ABSENCE FOR THIS SEMESTER, AND AM CIRCLING DEPRESSION LIKE A WOUNDED, RABID COYOTE. 

ANYONE ELSE OUT THERE FUCK UP COLLEGE FINANCIALLY, AND CAN SHARE ANY TIPS?**"

Trying to decide how I should approach things.
Currently a sophomore.  Had an internship at a fortune 500 tech company last semester and summer.  Great experience, loved it.  GPA suffered though.  Currently hovering around the 2.8-2.9 mark.  Retaking one class, will certainly end this semester with a 3.2-3.4 depending on how hard I push.  Resume consists of said internship, independent development of mobile apps, and a few cool hackathon projects along with brief summary of technical experience, student involvement, etc. (I think my resume’s alright - would rather not post it but could share via PM if need be)

Have a return offer from first company but they might want me to start in January again and I don’t know if I can do that.  Plus, I think there is benefit from trying something new and learning a whole new set of skills somewhere else.

Dream is obviously a top company (you know who) but willing to try something totally out of the ordinary if it’s in my career interests.

Do I:

1) Go to the career fair and talk to as many reps as possible, hoping they won’t be put off by my GPA (do I explain it?  Not mention it?  Can’t really leave it off, looks suspicious).

2) Skip the high-profile companies for now until my GPA is higher then apply online in December and talk to reps at the next career fair in ~February?  I’d be a stronger candidate but I’m concerned that is too late in the hiring process?  Hard to understand, different companies seem to be on totally different schedules.

3) Something else?

The one thing you got to know about Dave is that he’s working real hard these days. So, I asked him like a week ago if I could post since he’s so damned busy. He said cool, and now we’re down.

Dave finds an internship at some life insurance place in Manhattan. He shows up for his first day, real eager beaver, and gets the lay of the land. Apparently it’s one of those real old, stuffy kind of offices. Of course, his job is kind of shitty. Filing papers. Making photocopies. Tracking office supplies. Real office bitch kind of stuff. He figures that’s alright, got to start somewhere to get out of nowhere.

So, he’s wheeling the trolley, trying to deliver paper or some shit to some cubicle, when he starts hearing really loud clacking. And it’s getting louder. When he turns the corner, he finally sees her. She looks real old, hair all white, wrinkles like two feet deep around her mouth. She’s wearing this weird green visor kind of thing. And she’s just whaling on this old-school typewriter. Just beating it like it owes her grandkids money.

Dave’s surprised, then kind of annoyed because she’s so damned loud. But no one else seems to mind, so he figures it’s no problem. Actually, it’s kind of cool. So he walks up to her wooden desk thing, and tries to introduce himself. Like a bunch of times. But she never looks up and never stops typing. Dave figures she’s probably deaf. No worries. He walks away with crazy respect for someone so old who can still work so hard. From then on, he always makes sure to say hello.

Now, apparently Dave’s boss is a real grade-A dickhead. Just abusive, rude, and over-demanding. Everyone knows Dave is the office peasant, but some of the boss’ shit is getting ridiculous. So, everyday it seems like Dave is working later and later. But no matter how late he stays, the old woman is always still working. 

One night, he’s heading out. He starts saying good night like always, not expecting anything, when her fingers finally stop. Dave freezes. She looks up, staring straight into him. Says, “Richard Feinman” and goes back to typing even faster than before.

Well, Dave’s real confused because that’s his boss’ name. Maybe she thinks that’s his name. Maybe she’s not really deaf after all. Anyway, Dave’s beat so he forgets about it and heads home to sleep.

Week goes on. Just flying by, Dave says, when he finally realizes why he’s so much happier. His boss hasn’t been in the office for the last few days.
 
I got to go let Dave know I posted, maybe catch up. See what shit has gone down in the last week or so. If I get anything, I’ll let you bastards know. Peace.

I'd love to live in Iceland, so I want to go to either Reykjavik University/University of Iceland to study CS. I figure, if Iceland doesn't work out, I could always go to college in another Scandinavian country or use the study abroad program to visit other places in Europe, so I can have some variety either way. 
The unis/schools abroad, especially in Scandinavia, are cheaper than in the U.S, but I mostly just want to get out and find out if living in Northern Europe is really for me like I think it is. Honestly, I don't want ot stay cooped up in the U.S anymore, which is a huge reason why I want to pursue higher education abroad. 

They're universities, and I don't know about the rest of the world, but in Iceland, to get into a university, you need to pass a matriculation exam. You get it from spending at least 1 year from an ''upper higher education'' school, e.g: community college or a 2-year IB school. 
So I was recently considering going to IB school for 2 years at a low cost in Iceland, seeing how I like it over there, passing the exam, and if I like it, I go to one of the unis in Iceland, if not, another one in Northern Europe.

But, I don't want to go to a pre-uni-IB school if it's not necessary, hell I'd rather go right to uni and start on my bachelor's in one of those 2 schools, but the only way I can do that is if I show that I have ''maturity and adequate experience.'' I'm thinking an internship and good grades could help with that. 

What should I do? I'm a mess about what to do and where to go and what certifications I do and don't need, especially since I hear a lot about CS schools. "

1nyar2,1,2013-10-07,Me [23/m] having trouble deciding between two girls. (x-post from /r/askmen),5678throwaway,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1nyar2/me_23m_having_trouble_deciding_between_two_girls/,"TL;DR at bottom but please read it all. Sorry for wall of text

So I guess I should start from the beginning. Last winter my best friend of 3 years, lets call him Jake[23/m], started dating this girl whom we'll call Susan[19/f]. Since he was my best friend and she practically lived at his place we all became good friends. Soon I went away for the summer for an internship and Jake moved back with his parents across the country. He did this for various reasons including money and only having one class left that he could take online. Before he left (at the end of the summer) he was asking me to keep her company since he wasn't going through with the LTR that he agreed to try and she didn't have too many friends.

By the time I got back from my internship Jake had been moved back for about 3 weeks and had started to talk with me less and less. I would try and talk with him and he would always find a way to make the whole conversation anywhere from 3-5 minutes. The night I got back I was hanging out with one of my roommates and he introduced me to his girlfriend's friend whom we'll call Lilly[21/f]. Lilly seemed cool but I did only get to talk with her about 15 minutes before she left. About a day after I got back I was hanging out with Susan since we both had the day off and we ended up sleeping with each other.
At the time we both agreed that it was sort of a mistake and we would never mention it to Jake because by this point he had stared to get depressed about moving in with his parents, not having a job, feeling like a loser, etc. Some time in the following days we agreed to be friends with benefits (I had been in a 3 year dry spell and she only liked sleeping with people she trusts) and continued sleeping with each other from time to time.

At about this time Jake would only talk with me if I started a conversation and would usually escape it by saying he didn't feel good and would just stop talking with me. I found out from Susan that he would still have conversations with her, some of them about me and how our friendship is basically over since we don't live in the same place anymore along with other reasons (not working together on projects or at our job). He did mention that he didn't know how to feel about me hanging out with his ex, even though he was the one that told me to, and I told him that if he was uncomfortable to tell me.
About a week or so into the FWB arrangement with Susan I told her that I was starting to get feelings for her (we were spending a lot of time together) and that we needed to stop according to our terms (if anyone started getting feelings we stop) and since she was still kinda in love with Jake. Of course it didn't stop but I started pursuing Lilly more aggressively.

Lilly and I would occasionally chat over FB and moved to texting each other while Susan and I continued our FWB. I stopped really getting more feelings for Susan since I had another prospective girl and it was more of a traditional FWB arrangement. About 3 weeks into the FWB situation Susan starts telling me some of the stuff Jake is saying to her about me and even showed me chats that they have had about me. All through this time I still try and talk with Jake but he keeps just pushing me away.

So let's skip ahead to about 4.5 weeks into the FWB situation. Susan claims that she is now starting to get feelings for me and is kinda hinting that she would like to date me. Lilly and I finally go on a short coffee date (she is halfheartedly cramming for a test and talking with me).
Around week 5 or 6 Susan and I start talking about what is going on between us and we both agree that it kinda feels like we are unofficially dating, but she still cares for Jake, albeit less and less every day. We agree to just see where it goes

Skip to a week ago (week 7). Susan is now saying that she is done with her ex and would kinda like to date me. I wen't clubbing with Lilly, my roommate and his girlfriend over the weekend to celebrate Lilly's 21st and ended up crashing with Lilly in a hotel. Nothing happened since we were in a room with 4 other people (including her mom and aunt) among other recent problems. Susan asks about it and then proceeds to get upset at me when I tell her the truth. She feels like she is second to Lilly even though she isn't and I promised not to do anything until I figured out what I want to do.

I do care for Susan and think that we would make a great couple but I am not sure what to do about Jake. He was a good friend but recently he has been a dick and has even said that if anyone wanted to be his friend they had to ""fight for him"". At the same time I wouldn't mind seeing where this thing with Lilly would go. To top it off I am going to be graduating in December and leaving for another state in January.  I know that Susan would be down for a LDR but I am not sure about Lilly nor am I sure that I want one. At this point I don't know what to do. Do I go with the relationship I am already kinda in (Susan) and permanently loose a friend (Jake) or do I go for Lilly and hope that he comes around? Please reddit, at this point any advice would be welcome.

TL;DR -- Friend moved cross country left ex whom he promised a LDR. Didn't do LDR. His ex and I get together as FWB because we hung out a lot. Another girl comes into picture. Have feelings for both girls. Possibility of relationship with one and guaranteed with other. Not sure what to do."

Very difficult.  I'm 4 months into a 7 month internship, the only time I'm going to see him is in 2 weeks for a few days, I'm going back for a wedding. 

There are good things that have come of it; better communication, relying on each other emotionally, etc but it seems like the distance might just be too much for us right now.  My BF said the other day that it pretty much feels like we aren't even dating because of the limited amount of contact we have with each other.  Our schedules are the worst - I work 7am-5pm, he works 2pm-10pm (4pm-12am my time).  We talk on his lunch break for fifteen minutes maybe sometimes and then try to skype on the weekends.  

""Going on a break"" has been mentioned but not a decision that has been made, but at this point I think we both are aware that we aren't getting much from the relationship other than the pressure to make it happen (which seems impossible right now).  

I guess I just don't know what's best, should we go on a break, continue talking when we can, but if other dating opportunities come up take them and plan to date when I'm back?  I guess what's even the difference between taking a break and breaking up with a possibility of dating when it's possible again?  I'm having a super hard time knowing how to go on with this the best way.  Any experience and advice would be greatly appreciated.

Around week 5 or 6 Susan and I start talking about what is going on between us and we both agree that it kinda feels like we are unofficially dating, but she still cares for Jake, albeit less and less every day. We agree to just see where it goes

Skip to a week ago (week 7). Susan is now saying that she is done with her ex and would kinda like to date me. I wen't clubbing with Lilly, my roommate and his girlfriend over the weekend to celebrate Lilly's 21st and ended up crashing with Lilly in a hotel. Nothing happened since we were in a room with 4 other people (including her mom and aunt) among other recent problems. Susan asks about it and then proceeds to get upset at me when I tell her the truth. She feels like she is second to Lilly even though she isn't and I promised not to do anything until I figured out what I want to do.

I do care for Susan and think that we would make a great couple but I am not sure what to do about Jake. He was a good friend but recently he has been a dick and has even said that if anyone wanted to be his friend they had to ""fight for him"". At the same time I wouldn't mind seeing where this thing with Lilly would go. To top it off I am going to be graduating in December and leaving for another state in January.  I know that Susan would be down for a LDR but I am not sure about Lilly nor am I sure that I want one. At this point I don't know what to do. Do I go with the relationship I am already kinda in (Susan) and permanently loose a friend (Jake) or do I go for Lilly and hope that he comes around? Please reddit, at this point any advice would be welcome.

TL;DR -- Friend moved cross country left ex whom he promised a LDR. Didn't do LDR. His ex and I get together as FWB because we hung out a lot. Another girl comes into picture. Have feelings for both girls. Possibility of relationship with one and guaranteed with other. Not sure what to do."
1ny8t1,2,2013-10-07,How do I get a compiler job?,ktt3ja,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1ny8t1/how_do_i_get_a_compiler_job/,"I am a fourth-year CS undergrad with no internship experience. As this is my last year, I have been pondering to myself what kind of job I would like to obtain post-graduation. An option that I'm interested in is compiler development.

The problem I have is that I don't know how to obtain such job. My university's job listing has no entry for compiler engineers. A brief look at http://www.compilerjobs.com/ shows only one compiler job at VA, the state where I live, and it's only for senior developer. In addition, most of the listings for junior engineers demand industry experience that I don't have. So here are some questions that I have:

- If I want to find a compiler job, should I look to moving somewhere else? (how much does location matter in this case?)

- Given that I have no experience working with a real life project, realistically speaking how much chance do I have now? What about after I finish a toy compiler? (I have stellar grade on the academic side, but I don't think anyone cares; on the personal-project side, I have a few small ones on [github](https://github.com/ktt3ja)--unfortunately, the most impressive project I have is a simple shell written in Rust for class that I can't show)

- If I realistically have no chance at all, what should I do the first couple years so that I can obtain such jobs later on?"

At my lowest weight earlier this year, I was 121lbs and shredded - thanks to bulimia and excessive exercising. I've kicked the eating disorders, but now I'm on a 2-month sedentary job internship in a city with amazing cuisine. Since I don't banish my food to the toilet bowl anymore, it has found a new home on my thighs and stomach. 

The business meals, happy hours, and special event dinners aren't doing any favors for my waistline or my well-being. Here's the plan:

* Eating clean --&gt; sticking with unprocessed or minimally processed foods when possible. No diet or sweetened beverages, no Splenda or other substitutes. Water with fruit for flavor at all times. Not calorie counting because it tends to be a trigger
* Sticking with current routine of 30 mins of Pilates per night
* Walking for daily commute as time allows, vs. public transportation
* Incorporating bodyweight programs (SimpleFit and Beast Skills) into workouts until internship is over and I have access to a gym again

Goal: Not worried about numbers on the scale, just want to feel BETTER and STRONGER!

Will add measurements when I can grab some tape tomorrow

Good luck everyone, let's do this!"

Most of the websites I come across claim that GIS is an expanding field with many job opportunities but then I look at the comments and there are tons of ""I'm in GIS and can't find a job to save my life"" posts. Is that something you guys agree with?

I've got a MA in Applied Sociology (learned a lot..but goodluck getting a job) and am going back to school. I've been taking some Computer Science courses and I enjoy the programming aspect of it but not really the math and electrical engineering components. I have my doubts to actually being able to complete all of the math in any reasonable amount of time or at all (although I still plan to casually work at it). A career advisor at the school suggested I look into GIS since I really enjoy using computers, I’ve done some work with environmental orgs using GIS technology, there are areas of overlap with Sociology, and I seem to be able to learn at least moderate programming.

I could probably get a degree in Geography with an emphasis and certificate in GIS in about 2 years. However, I'm terrified about investing that time and money into something that won't have any job opportunities (like the position I am in now with Sociology). Any ideas/suggestions? Thanks! 

EDIT: This is assuming I do things correctly like participate in internships, continue to learn some programming like Python (currently I'm about a year into learning Java and will soon be looking to expand), and really focus on learning as much GIS software as I can.

I've been searching for a part time IT job while I go to school and a friend of mine who works at a small software company put in a recommendation for me. The company has only one IT guy so my friend said they would probably hire me no problem (possibly as an intern) although there was no actual job postings. I just got this email from the IT guy:

&gt;Hi Rob,
I have reviewed your resume and certainly take Steven’s recommendation quite seriously. I am not totally sure I am in a position to hire at the moment, but I welcome you downtown to sit down for a coffee and discussion?

&gt;I have a bunch of things on the go right now… and am looking into late next week. How does that work for you? What does your class schedule look like Wednesday/Thursday?
 
&gt;Thanks,

How should I treat this interview? It sounds pretty casual to me. Should I just wear my best jeans and button up shirt or something? I've only ever done one job interview in the past (for a factory) and dress pants/shoes weren't required so I don't actually own any. Should I purchase some for this interview?

My palms get sweaty just thinking about this. Like I don't even know where to begin. How should I act during the meeting? Should I be as professional as possible or just be myself? I have never even been to a real coffee shop, haha. Do you sit down at like a restaurant and you order your coffee? I am so hopeless, lol.

Evidence: A meta-analysis and 1 randomized controlled trial (RCT)
• Meta-analysis (1) of 21 RCTs (including RCT below) with 91,074 patients (54% males) randomized to multivitamins or placebo for 3.5 years. Most are primary prevention  studies from Europe or North America. 
o No effect on overall mortality: Relative risk (RR) 0.98 (0.94-1.02)
 -No effect on cancer mortality: RR 0.96 (0.88-1.04)
 -No effect on CVD mortality: RR 1.01 (0.93-1.09)
 -Multiple subgroup testing found no differences
o No evidence of publication bias or meaningful heterogeneity

• Physicians’ Health Study II: Heavily publicized RCT (2,3) of 14,641 men (mean age 64.3) randomized to Centrum Silver™ or placebo, followed 11.2 years. 
o No effect on overall mortality: Hazard Ratio (HR) 0.94 (0.88-1.02)
 -No effect on cancer mortality: HR 0.88 (0.77-1.01)
 -No effect on CVD mortality: HR 0.95 (0.83-1.09)
 -No effect on CVD events: HR 1.01 (0.91-1.10)
 -Reduced cancer incidence: HR 0.92 (0.86-0.998) 
• These were adjusted (for unclear reasons)
• Unadjusted is not significant RR 0.94 (0.87-1.003)
o Multiple Issues: lots of exclusion including run-in to remove non-compliant 
patients, adjustments (without clear reason) always in favor of multivitamins. 

Context: 
• Multiple cohort studies have found no mortality reduction with multivitamins. (4-7)
• Vitamin supplementation may help reduce overall mortality in undernourished populations (like rural China). (8) However, in this RCT of 4 different vitamin interventions, only one reduced 
mortality RR 0.91 (0.84-0.99)
• Meta-analyses of different vitamin components on mortality
o B-Vitamins:(9) No effect
o Anti-oxidants:10 Increase mortality RR 1.04 (1.01-1.07) 
 -Increase with vitamin E, beta-carotene and high-dose vitamin A
 -No effect from vitamin C and selenium
o Vitamin D:(11) Decrease mortality RR 0.97 (0.94-1.00)
o Increases and decreases are small (Numbers Needed to Harm (NNH) or treat around 200 over 5 years)

TLDR: Present evidence does not support the routine use of multivitamins to reduce mortality, cardiovascular disease or cancer for people in developed countries.

I would appreciate any info or offer that could help me find a developer position in Sweden. 

So i am a programmer and currently a Comp.Sc. student in Riga, Latvia. Have got two year professional diploma and am continuing my studies. I have a 2 years experience with some variety of technologies starting with internship in Accenture as .Net #C programmer and some part time job developing Drupal webdites. But now have mainly been working as a C++/PHP programmer with MySql db designing and Javascript coding when needed. Also have a little experience with C programming microprocessors.

Have studied in Denmark in my previous studies as Structural engineer, but later decided that programming/ software development is the thing that i actually love. Have been learning swedish for 4 months. 
So I am looking for a C++ or PHP position but ideally a position that would require some creativity and ingenuity on projects in different platforms.
I am definitely looking to master C++ and related frameworks as I have the not that original dream of getting into Game Industry. I would prefer an larger city where i could possibly continue my studies

Anybody can contact me in comments or pm.

I started lifting a few months ago to work on overall strength, but now I'd like to really focus on dropping the fat by adding some cardio and watching what I eat more carefully. Currently I lift with my roommates 3x/week. I'm going to be adding core work, running and/or cycling, tracking all of my food, and really push myself to increase my lifts.

My goal is to drop about 20 lbs in the coming 12 weeks. Mostly, I'd like to drop from a snug size 14 to a comfy size 12. I'm confident that I can do this; at my heaviest I was 210 and within a year I had dropped to 175 after making some lifestyle changes. I gained some of it back over two years of grad school, working, internship, lack of sleep, and the usual excuses, but I've decided to stop making excuses and to make my health a priority again.

Current: Weight: 185lb

Squat: 125x5

Overhead Press: 65x3

1o32fo,6,2013-10-09,Confession,snowboardshorts,confession,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/1o32fo/confession/,"I'm never really happy.I have struggled with depression for years. As a kid I dealt with a lot of abuse from my family. My mom would pick on me and tell me my friends didn't really like me or want to see me because I was weird and hyperactive, she would get involved in everything I did. She made me lose my best friend because she told me my best friends mom called and said I couldn't come over anymore. She told me that I was getting stupider because I wasn't doing well in school, and maybe we should go back and have them re test me for intelligence because if I was so fucking smart why was I failing my assignments. I remember when I quit ballet she got super upset and threw my favorite tapes out the window of the car. Stuff like this happened often. My Dad was gone from home a lot and has always had a short temper. When he came home it was late at night and there would be more fights. He would take the dishes out of the dishwasher and break all of them and yell, my mom would yell. My dad would hit me and threaten to break my neck and tell me how easy it would be for him to do that, just break all my bones, or kill us all and burn the house down. He would hold his hands over my mouth to stop me from crying until I blacked out from lack of air. I couldn't breath through my nose because of the snot from crying. I got dumped in the shower naked and they would dump ice on my and cold water. 

They made me feel responsible for their debt, marriage problems, problems at work, and for going to the therapists I didn't want to go to. It was always about the most stupid little things, like not having dinner ready when he got home. They blamed me for their fights, I was their first kid.  We would get into fights and I would just cry and cry because some part of me thought that if I kept crying someone would help me. I was medicated from an early age at first for hyperactivity, then for bipolar disorder, then for depression. No matter what I did something was always wrong with me. If I was doing poorly in school it was because I had ADD not because I was too burnt out to care. If I fought with my brother it was because I was manipulating my family somehow, trying to be the center of attention, not because that's what siblings do. I was forbidden from talking to my siblings. I was often told that no one would ever love me, or want to hire me for a job because my grades were poor and because my mental health record would follow me into adulthood. These things were said to me at age ten.

 My parents would go to a doctor, and tell them all this stuff that never happened, making it look like I started the fights and blaming me for all the problems. No one ever listened to my side, and I was drugged without my consent. I remember having the pills shoved down my throat. I hated it. The pills took away my power to think or feel. I just existed and it was maddening. I would fall asleep all the time against my will because they made me so fucking tired. I had to stand up in class to keep from falling asleep and sometimes that happened to me anyways. When a doctor would not give me the drugs my parents would pay to go find a new doctor who would. They would provoke me into yelling at them and record it and use it as proof to the new doctor. I fantasized about killing my family, and the only reason I never did was because I didn't want to go to jail for the rest of my life or be locked in an insane asylum. I never had any friends or anyone over because my parents wouldn't let me. I almost never got to go to other people's houses. 

I ritually hit the wall until my knuckles bled and I liked to feel the pain because I could feel nothing else. I thought no one would ever love me, it was like a fairy tale to me. I told myself even though I was ugly and horrible eventually someone would love me. Like Cinderella.  I would stand in the bathroom late at night and stare at the mirror imagining I could be a better person who someone would love. I became bulimic and started making myself throw up because I wanted the pills out of me, and because I hated my body and how fat I was.

 Every time the psychiatrists said I was getting better and took me off my meds my parents would provoke me into another fight and use it as an excuse to prescribe something else. I believed I was fucked up until I tried an experiment. I stopped taking all my meds and didn't tell them. I went through the same cycle where according to my parents I would get ""better"" until I was taken off the imaginary drugs. Then the cycle would start all over again, even though I was not taking anything. Slowly, things became less horrible. As I got older the physical abuse mostly stopped, but the mental abuse was constant. The guilt over being who I was, over making them spend money on me. I quit everything I ever loved doing because I was constantly told I'd never be good enough at it for it to matter. Swimming, volleyball, running, basketball, rugby.

 I dove in to books and they were my only friends, and even my books got taken away. I would hide them like contraband in between the sheets and outside in places where I could find them. Books are the only reason I didn't kill myself. I felt like at least through the words on the page, I could touch the mind of another human being and that mental closeness was better than being alone. I went off to college and did great the first year. The next year I had a total break down.

 I was too depressed to get out of bed, and my anxiety made me feel so sick I threw up. I failed my classes and didnt tell anyone. Not even my boyfriend at the time. I asked if he would still love me if I was failing my classes and stuff and he said if that was the case it would just mean I didn't care enough about us to try. I could never get up the nerve to tell him what I was going though after that. I loved him, and he left me because essentially I couldn't be honest with him. He never said that was why, but its a big part of what the problems were in our relationship. He left me over email after two years. He has not spoken to me since and its been three months. 

What started out as something good between us devolved into an abusive relationship for both sides. I could not let him go because he was the only person I thought could love me, and he couldn't share his feelings or emotions. Towards the end I was ending up with bruises every week and a couple broken bones but I don't even care because I cared about him more than my self or my body. Even though he left like he did I don't hate him. I just feel nothing except for sometimes when I'm having ice cream, or looking out the window and I remember being happy with him and it hurts so I kill the feeling because I don't want to remember anymore because what I had with him was never what I really wanted it to be, he was just someone to love, who made me feel less alone. But he never loved me back as much as I did him. He never would have made the sacrifices I did for him. He made me move out of my dorm room by myself with a broken wrist because he was mad at me, for example. His own life and self were more important to him than me.

 I wanted to die so badly I would sit and look at the lethal dose of medicine I laid out for myself. I calculated exactly how much i would need to kill me. I reached a breaking point where I realized I could either end it all or keep trying. I tried to go to a counselor at the school, but she never helped. She just sat there and felt sorry for me, and when i asked her what I could do to fix my life she told me that was up to me, I eventually just stopped seeing her and laid in bed. I slept a lot to get away from the world. I sometimes wondered if I really existed or if I wasn't real because no one seemed to be able to see me and no one really talked to me. I finished up the school year failing my classes. I went back to my internship, and worked there for part of the summer, living a lie. I only left because if I hadn't they would have got my transcripts and realized I was failing and fired me, even though I was good at my job. 

I decided to just tell my parents I was failing, expecting rejection. I was going to join the military and somehow pay off my debts. They didn't reject me and told me I should come live with them so I did, because I didn't know what else to do. 20,000 is a lot of money. As soon as I got home the abuse cycle started up again. They would say they wanted me to get better, then they would tear me down. Telling me everyone knows I am a failure, I had a bird in my hands and I crushed it, now no one will want to risk hiring me, I'm an embarrassment, they always knew I would fail college, they are going to kick me out on the streets, I'm too full of myself, I should have more humility, they never had problems when I was gone, that I'm a manipulative person and am lying about the depression. 

I still want to die but lie and say I don't. I don't know how to fix me. I don't know if I should move out because with my part time job I would barely make enough to cover a rent here. I asked to go full time but they wont hire me because they would need to pay me benefits, which is really unfair because I already work five days a week and am just under the hours that would qualify as full time. I have told bits and pieces of this to people, but never the whole story. I act happy, and laugh and pretend I never worry, but in reality I have this huge burden that weighs down my life and makes me feel trapped and alone. I feel like no one really knows me, but if they did they would hate me."

I started an internship in may and it turned into a job a couple months ago at a financial advisory firm.  I am studying to pass my 65 and hope to do so in November.

The place I am working at has had a run of bad luck lately and as a result they have told me they are going to have to let me go.  They have not said when yet.  They are going to let me stay on as long as possible.

I have a wife and 2 kids and we have a decent amount of savings to last us a while, but I'd like to save that for a house.  My financial knowledge is still a little shaky, but I need to get a new job somewhere.  What should I do?

**edit:**  My job is updating a software (morningstar) with yesterdays trades/activities and using that software to make any trade requests from clients.  These could be accounts closing/opening or cash requests or (re)balancing.  I use excel a little to perform some of these tasks.  I can sort in excel and use if statements, so not too much.  

The biggest projects I do are to (re)balance entire groups according to their model portfolios.  I'm given a model that i throw into morningstar and then I have it calculate buys/sells for all the clients in that model.  Then I put it into excel and format it so it's readable for the broker to make the trades easily.  

I don't do too much, but it is my first finance related job."
1o2s4o,0,2013-10-09,"Wondering if any of you also have this dissonance in your personality, concerning annoyance with others",pootertime,enfj,https://www.reddit.com/r/enfj/comments/1o2s4o/wondering_if_any_of_you_also_have_this_dissonance/,"So, I'm preaching to the choir here when I begin by noting that I always try to see the best in people and treat them kindly and with respect.  The thought of being rude or cold to someone without provocation makes me shudder.  Generally, it takes a LOT for me to be annoyed by someone-- they have to really be trying hard, haha. I love people!

That said...

Every once in a while I will come to just find someone completely repellent.  That's the case right now with a coworker.

I'm in my late 20s, she's in her early 20s.  We rarely have to work on projects together, but when we do it's fine.  She's not the best at her job, but she tries. 

She's well meaning, and most of the time very nice.  (She easily becomes impatient with our interns, which really irks me, because she is someone who requires a LOT of instruction herself.)  

She's very awkward.  She doesn't know when to end conversations properly, often just trails off.  She mumbles constantly and I often have to ask her to repeat herself.  She talks to herself a lot when stressed.  She also will start trailing off awkwardly in the middle of a conversation sometimes, and when someone else will start to speak, she interrupts them loudly to finish her thought (when the person had obviously thought she was done speaking).

I hate myself for being so irritated with her awkwardness, because *I used to be awkward too!*  Middle school was so tough for me until I ""found myself"" (I know, groan, lol) in high school.  So USUALLY I have a huge soft spot for awkward people.  But not her.

She doesn't know much about the world around her, and doesn't really care to (I think she believes everything she needs to know comes from her church).  Now, my problem from her does not stem mainly from this.  True, she's very conservative politically, due to her strong Christian religious beliefs.  I'm a progressive atheist.  But I have more than a few friendships with people with similar belief systems to her, and it's never presented a problem and never made me think less of them.  It's just a bit different with her, I guess.  I usually am not at all quick to judge someone based on their religion or political stance.

Our desks are right next to each other.  EVERY TIME she returns to her desk from being somewhere she says, ""Hi. What's up?  How are you?""  Every single time.  It drives me nuts.  EVERY TIME I eat lunch she says, ""Ohhh that smells good. I'm so jealous.""  She doesn't eat lunch herself, and you guys, it takes everything in me not to say, ""YOU COULD HAVE LUNCH TOO!""

I could go on some more, but those are the first things that come to mind when I'm trying to describe what annoys me about her.

So my question is...

Do any of you find yourself becoming this annoyed with a nice person?  What do you think my anger toward her is stemming from?  Any tips on how I can quiet my brain when it's yelling at her?

Thanks, all :)

I'm a third year student , first year in Software Engineering (I know, pretty expensive to change majors but I'm happy.)

I just want to ask you guys how I could save up money in general.

I know there's a FAQ but I'm more specifically asking...

What kind of investments and things can I do to maximize the money I will have saved by the time I leave school to get a career?

I want to have enough money to be able to get settled in right away and live in a nice place in a nice neighborhood off the bat (Girlfriend and I are deaf so we want safe neighborhood because we can't hear anyone break in.)

I also have three kittens, and we've been very careful not to get them in situation where they get sick or anything and we ration their food.

I have a good idea of how to spend money on food and I cook pretty well so I can be frugal with food but what about everything else?

Girlfriend and I plan on getting internships every summer to get money and job experience.

So what can I do to maximize my savings now and maximize how much money I will have when I leave college?

P.S. My school is paid for, but I do have a bit of loans to pay off.

**A Little Background:** I'm currently working as a paid intern in a secondary school/sixth form (college) here in the UK, helping out two other IT Technicians.


**The Tale:** So the school recently decided to give brand new Windows Surfaces to every Sixth Former. They didn't bother consulting us about this however so were completely unprepared when more than 30 of the things turned up in our office.

Now I know next to nothing about the Surfaces but even I can predict what's going to happen. You can't connect Windows RT to a domain so we can't manage them with things like group policies and Active Directory logins so we know all hell is about to break loose when the Staff starts handing these tablets out to everyone before we've even had a chance to turn one on.

So this morning more than a dozen students come into our office asking to be connected to the Wi-Fi. Our usual method of simply using their logins doesn't work so my co-worker opens up AD and works his magic. I'm not too knowledgeable with AD besides setting up new students and resetting passwords but he manages to set up a group and gets some of them connected.

Their logins should work now so that's what we tell them, some manage to connect, some not. The ones that couldn't presented a number of face-palming moments.

&gt; **Student A: ""Do I need to use my school login?""**
    
&gt;*What else are you going to use!*
    
&gt; **Student B: ""I don't have a login.""**
    
&gt;*You've been here nearly 2 months, Why haven't you come to see us!*
    
We've still got the odd student coming in for help connecting but the problems aren't just limited to student's.
    
&gt; **Teacher: ""I've got some students that need to print from their Surfaces, can you set them up?""**
    
&gt;*Of course they can't print, all the printers are on the domain they can't connect to.*

This is just the beginning, may the gods have mercy on us."

Here is a little bit about me. I love IT work. I do practically everything IT related for my school even though there is an IT guy. I also intern at a film production company doing IT work. I have a huge amount of experience (at least I think I do for my age) with servers and networking.

A snippet from my resume is “Great amount of knowledge and experience with the following: Windows Server 2003 - 2012; Ubuntu Server; Web Hosting (and Some Web Development); Office 365; Google Apps; Printers and Print Servers; Active Directory; Exchange Server 2003-2013; VMware Virtualization; Cisco Systems and IOS; Switches; Firewalls; Security Appliances.”

What I am overwhelmed by is if I will continue to enjoy it as much as I do now later on in my career. Also, I want to get an IT degree or something similar (I still don’t exactly know the difference between IT, IS, etc.) but I am hearing CS is the way to go. I do somewhat enjoy coding (I am not too knowledgeable, but I know enough to get around) but I don’t exactly want to pursue it as a major or a career.
As for college, I definitely want to go to a smaller school, at most 8,000 people but preferably less than 5,000. Location doesn’t matter (in the U.S. though) but being closer to Los Angeles (within 1-2 states away) is a plus.

So my questions are:
1. Is majoring in IT the way to go for me? (Bachelors)
2. What colleges should I be looking at? Suggestions?

Thank you in advance :)"

[22 F] confused after recent breakup with [22 M] of almost 5 years [LDR],sockembopem,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1o1oc0/not_sure_where_to_go_from_here_22_f_confused/,"Sorry this is going to be very long but I feel it is necessary... 


**TLDR** Had a happy and satisfying LDR for 5 years when out of nowhere he tells me that something is missing....


Five years ago (2008) ""M"" and I began talking through an online video game that we both played. We were both 17 at the time and seniors in HS. After continuously talking and calling one another we agreed to start a relationship even though we were thousands of miles apart (TX - VA). As our relationship progressed we would constantly call, text, chat, and webcam each other every day. We spent the next 4 years of college talking to one another every day. We would webcam and chat daily, watch movies together, play games, and basically anything else we could think of that involved spending time together while on a computer (LDR, remember?). We tried to visit each other as often as we could but it would mostly be during big breaks or holidays.




**Senior Year**
During this year M became busier in school and we didn't get to see each other as much as in the past. He started an internship over the breaks so we weren't able to visit over the holidays. I know at times I was sad because I felt like he wasn't giving me enough attention and I would start talking to other guy friends from back home to fill that void. I never stepped out of line with any of them but I knew that I wasn't entirely happy with how the relationship was going. When I eventually brought it up to M he said he couldn't always talk to me like before and that he was sorry but school was very demanding at the time. I remember telling him that since we are a LDR communication is very important and vital to our relationship. He was understanding but also felt I wasn't being realistic. I eventually became more accepting of us not talking all the time but even still at times felt neglected. Looking back now I know I shouldn't have been as needy but I guess that was one of my downfalls in this relationship.



M began to vocalize how tiring commuting back and forth was becoming. I began to visit him more whereas before it had been pretty even. I brought it up and he just said how it was tiring and he wasn't sure if he could keep visiting every month. At one point during this time he mentioned the idea of us taking a break but we talked it out and decided not to. When we did visit things were still normal and we always had a great time together and never had huge arguments. Sex was also never a problem with us, we always were excited to do stuff when we met up again. 





**This Past Summer**
Now that I was back home in Tx I asked when he would be able to visit me since he hadn't been to Tx in a good 1.5 years. He just started working at his new job and said he wasn't sure because he couldn't take off. I was understanding even though I was pretty sad about it but I knew that this was the reality of us now starting to work. Since graduation we weren't really getting on webcam anymore with each other because when he would get home he would want to do other things to spend his time before he went to bed early. At first I wasn't really understanding but eventually I found a job and became more accepting/understanding since I was the same way. We would still text every day, less frequently but constantly after work. We did make sure to watch some shows and videos together on the weekends whenever we weren't busy which was nice and I know we both enjoyed that. 



In terms of his future, he has no plans on going back to school but wants to work his way into a long desired career path. For me, I have been considering going to grad school and was hoping to apply to graduate programs. During my time looking into programs I started thinking about applying to ones in VA. I didn't really mention it to him because I wasn't sure if I really wanted to go back to school but I continued to do my research into the various programs. I ended up finding a program that sounded like a good fit for me and that was a few hours away from where he lived. 




Eventually, I made plans to go see him last month (Sept) for his sister's wedding. During my stay I planned on asking him how he felt about me applying there. The week I was there for the wedding was very normal. He did work during the day but when he came home he was very loving and sweet and caring like always. I was on my period so we didn't have sex but we did fool around at night. During the weekend I spent time with his siblings whom I have become really close to over the past 5 years. We all enjoyed sitting around playing drinking games and talking with eacother. M always made sure to ask how I was doing, if I needed anything, and would show me affection by kissing me or holding my hand, etc. 



**The Dreaded Talk***
I asked what he thought of me applying to schools in his area; he was quiet and said he didn't think that was the best idea. I asked him why and he went on to say how he wasn't sure if things would work out. He kept going on about how he knew I was very family oriented (come from a huge and close immediate and extended family) and that he didn't want to be the one to force me to give them up to be with him. I told him that it was ultimately my decision to move and that his family would be able to give me everything I needed. He said he would feel like an asshole for forcing me to do that and how eventually in the future the type of work he wants to do would require him to travel. I told him I loved to travel and that I would be okay with that but then he said he would probably have to go alone and that he wasn't sure if I would be able to handle living by myself, go without communicating with him, and again without the support of my family. I told him that we have done long distance for so long that I think I would be able to be okay with that and again how his family would always be there for me for support, communication, love, etc. I told him that me going to school there was just an idea and that I still wanted to apply to schools in my area. Eventually he went on to say how he just wasn't sure if our relationship was right and that he feels we are just growing apart. I told him that I could see how he might think that but that isn't what I wanted and that we didn't need to make any decisions right there and then. We agreed to continue our relationship but after I left I felt like he was already dumping me.



The next few days were brutal because we didn't text much at all during the day and when we did it was very brief. I was already feeling empty so I decided that I would go ahead and talk with him. When we talked he said that it doesn't feel right to continue our relationship and that he feels like it's not going to work out in the long run and that it would be best if we just ended it now. He repeatedly said how he just felt like something wasn't right/was missing and it wasn't fair to either of us to continue. He went on to say that he thought it was best if we distanced ourselves because he knows how attached we are and that eventually we start seeing other people. He said the more he thought about it the more it just felt like the right thing to do. 




**Closure**
A week later I texted him asking if we could talk because I wanted some closure. I was confused by everything he told me and felt like he wasn't being completely honest with me. We talked for an hour on webcam and he tried to explain it as best as he could to me but I am still pretty confused. 



During our talk he started off by saying how the relationship was wearing on him and how he also didn't want to have me make the decision to move. He said it was a culmination of how he feels about everything and that he just feels like the best thing for both of us is to move in different directions. He wasn't sure if he had the emotional feeling to keep the relationship going and wasn't sure if he feels ready or ever felt ready to move past that. He said he always thought it would be more clear but that it hasn't and he isn't sure if it ever will and it's not fair to me or himself to keep it going. I told him I felt like he was using the distance and his future as an excuse to not say he doesn't want me anymore. In reply he said he gets along with me and that we are great friends but in terms of the relationship sense he just felt like it was wearing on him. He said he felt like making it work was going to be more of a struggle and that he doesn't feel up to that. He said he doesn't see it working and he doesn't want to keep investing in it when it's not going to work. I told him that saying distance is one thing and saying he's not emotionally invested is something completely different. In response he said he didn't view it that way but it was more an accumulation of things. He said it was hard for him to admit that since we are great friends and get along so well. He also said he respects and admires me and wishes he had specific reasons but he doesn't. I told him how I thought a lot of it was because everything going on right now with him starting his new career and he said it was probably part of it but the reason was that again, he isn't emotionally invested in continuing. He also mentioned that he felt a relief to let things end and i told him how that was understandable because of how draining a 5 year LDR can be. 



After this he went on to say how we are both eachothers' first real relationship and that he wants to see what else is out there and see other people. He wants that flexibility at this point and having that feels like there's a relief to it and that is more of what he wants to do right now. I told him that there obviously isn't going to be someone else like me and that though another girl may have similar traits it won't be the same. He said he understands that and he's been happy every moment he's ever been with me and that i've shown him so much and he just feels like we both need to see what is out there and meet new people and grow in more ways. He also said he didn't feel complete or like if it's absolutely everything he's ever wanted. He feels like he needs to move on to see if he can ever feel like that. I told him i understood but that of course it will feel like we are outgrowing each other when we aren't close enough to have other experiences. He replied by saying even if we worked it out he feels like he's just letting it happen and that he's not making the decision he really wants to. After talking with family he said that if he isn't feeling like his heart is truly in it now it never will be and that he is trying to be fair to both of us. His feelings have been building up for a little bit and to him this felt like a better time than any to lay it all out. Again he kept saying he wasn't sure what it is and how he has been choking up when talking with other people because he can't explain what it is because he doesn't know. So I asked him why is he willing to let it go so easily if he doesn't even know and he replied by saying he just knows that it's there and in the back of his mind he never felt like it was quite what he wanted and that he doesn't know what it is but that's just how he feels. He said he wants me to still be in his life and talk but that it's unfair to continue the relationship when he's not reciprocating what i'm feeling and that he really doesn't want to hurt me over a long stretch of period of time and that it scares the hell out of him. 



I asked him if there was anyone else and he said there was absolutely nobody else, not even on the radar and that he knows that when he was with me he loved me and he still has feelings for me but after talking with his new brother in law something he told him resonated with him (the guy was in a LTR and just felt like something was missing and then when he met his wife he said it was a completely different feeling). He said it's not that he doesn't love me but that it's one of those questions of where do you see yourself in 5 years and he just doesn't and he didn't feel like it was fair and that when you meet more people you learn what it is and it's hard to have just one experience and know everything.  



He ended the conversation by saying he's not seeing anyone and is honestly trying to figure himself out and trying to make a push to better himself and that's just really what he is trying to do right now. 



**My Thoughts**
All of that said, I know he obviously has fallen out of love with me but I feel like he isn't realizing that what we have is special. We have been together so long and gone through so much growth together to where it might feel to him like he no longer loves me but I feel like this is a temporary bump. I am also upset because throughout the entire relationship he has been the one who has always been so great about communicating and he would always try to get me to communicate more and yet he never once told me that this was how he was feeling. To me this all came out of nowhere and I wish he gave me a heads up to where we could've tried to address the issue and maybe I wouldn't be taking it as hard as I am now. 



It's so hard for me to accept that it's over because I could really picture myself being with M for the rest of my life. I could vividly see myself being with him and having kids with him and being happy for the rest of my life. We have always been so compatible on so many levels and never had any major arguments other than dealing with the distance and my neediness. I just don't know how to go about handling the break up. It is too hard to accept that the person I want to be with for the rest of my life does not feel the same way. And yet he still wants to be friends and have me as a part of his life... Does that mean he never really loved me or is it more of a bad timing/him not knowing what he wants and us being too young type of thing? I just wish he was honest with me and told me when he started feeling all of this. I also wanted to just hear that he doesn't love me anymore but he never flat out said it. I have been struggling to not contact him but I miss my best friend and I don't know how else to deal with the situation. I love him enough to let him go but it just makes me so sad knowing that he most likely will never make his way back to me.


I know I need to move on and I am trying but I can't help but feeling like he's making a huge mistake that is going to end up as regrets for the both of us. If he still loves me then why isn't he willing to fight for me? :["

Warning, wall of text ahead!",[deleted],LongDistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/1o1ihi/its_been_downhill_ever_since_we_met_in_person/,"I'm not sure if he's feeling the same, but because of the way he acts, I think he may be.

I'm gonna give you guys our story so this will be less disorganized, and hope he doesn't see this, because I don't want him to know my feelings until I can tell him them. 

We met online, on a depression chatroom. He was trolling, but he was also depressed, I was legitimately depressed and went there to be less lonely. I met him maybe after a couple days of visiting the chatroom? We met September 26th of 2012.

I, honestly, lied to him from the beginning. I lied to him about my age, my name, and some small details. I told him about my name in October. I didn't think my age would be a good time to tell him, as I was younger than him. (I'll refrain from telling how much) He started college sometime around January, going into culinary school to be a chef. Around sometime in May, my parents offered to let him fly here. My parents didn't know his age and they didn't know I'd lied to him, so I refused to accept their request. It was very depressing, I'd fallen in love with him but was afraid to tell him the truth. So then, come July, his mother offered to pay his plane ticket for him to fly here. He, of course, said yes.. which I was unaware of, and I told him I thought we should wait, and it cause a huuuuge mess... then, she bought the ticket, and he told me about it. That's when I realized I had to tell him. I told my mom everything, she was a bit upset but she got over it.  I was dumb enough to wait until he bought the ticket. I told him my age.

He, understandably, flipped the fuck out. I thought he was gonna kill himself. I convinced him that we could make this work because we loved each other, that age was just a number, and everything would be fine as long as we didn't do anything sexual. So, after about two days, he was a lot better. He said I was right and that we could make it work and that he'd do anything to be with me, because he knew that we were made for each other.

He flew here July 26th, on our 10 month anniversary. It was amazing.. amazing. We'd waited 10 months for this and it was so worth it, but I got far too comfortable and got so used to him being around. I was very emotional, little did I know I was actually PMSing so it made me be a pretty big bitch. I was annoying, I'm sure, as I couldn't keep my hands off him. I don't mean sexually, I just mean in general. I loved just having him within reach. Once, we (me, him, and my parents) went on a road trip to a town a few hours away. We stayed in a hotel and were once gonna play Monopoly with my mom. I refused, got pissed, went into the bathroom and cried. He made me open the door and we hugged it out and I apologized. A few days before he left, we laid in his bed, just crying. I helped him back the night before it was time to go. We slept on each other in the car ride to the airport. I didn't even realize what was going on, saying goodbye felt so odd and I didn't quite realize he was actually leaving until I couldn't see him anymore, that's when it hit me and I cried like a baby in the middle of the airport terminal. He left August 9th.

We both got pretty upset, but were still in the phase where it was like, ""Wow, I'm really sad but that was really amazing and I love you a lot."" Eventually, the happiness wore off. We fought quite a bit a few weeks after he left. By ""quite a bit"", I mean we fought sometimes every other 2-3 days.. and it was over stupid stuff. It's changed a bit, we haven't argued as much but we have argued. I blame me.

I've been feeling like we don't talk as much, like we don't tell each other as much as we used to. I feel really distant from him, and I miss him a lot, which is making me (and him) really depressed.

That's when his internship got really close. He realized he could come here for it, because he wanted to own a restaurant with a wooden smoker and smoke meat and butcher and etc.

We thought he'd be able to come stay with me for his internship but his college denied his request. It really devastated us. Everything would have worked out amazingly if he could have come. He could have stayed with me, he'd go to ""work"" (his internship would have been a paid one if he came here), I'd study while he's at work, he'd come back and we could do whatever we wanted. After he finished his internship, he'd go back to graduate. I'd soon be finished with my schooling and then could do whatever I wanted. He'd be finished with college. We could get married really soon, which we plan on.

His college took fooooreevvveerrr to get back to him on it. I had higher hopes than I should have, just because it would have been so perfect. So they said no, the budget was too low, because they had to come check on him several times to see if everything was good.
 
Lately, it's been getting harder to wait. I miss him a lot, and it hurts like hell. He's been really busy, finishing up what little bit of college he has left before his internship and whatnot. He said he'd try to visit for Christmas, which will be great because my birthday is December 21st, so he can come around that time, maybe. But I just don't wanna wait anymore. I've been feeling so lonely, he's been going to sleep sooner, he's been really busy and tired. I'm not upset with him, I understand completely. I just miss him. 

And I just wanted to get this out because tonight has been really hard."

I have been separated from my wife for almost a year now. O recently started a job after finishing school last spring. I had been unemployed since fall of 2011. The issue of child support quickly came up. I have been trying to set something up quickly because the communication from the social services office was mailed to the wrong address, now a court date is pending. 

I own three cars right now, all three are dead. I recently took one to a good friends shop to get fixed. A couple weeks after that is when the their car died leaving without a vehicle. The car that is in the shop is still several paychecks away from being fixed and forced me to offer my wife less in child support temporarily until I get my car fixed. This did not sit well with her. She then started bringing up all kinds of shit.

We separated because she cheated on me. After months of staying in the same house, but not rooms, she asked me to leave. I obliged and moved in with my parents as I had no money and no job. I was only able to see my daughter once a week due to school and schedules. I never complained because I didn't want issues between my wife and I.

I landed a NASA summer internship and an awesome job with a local company a and started a little more than a month ago. I was now able to see my daughter more. I have spent the last month trying to rebuild my life. Moved in with a friend, buying all the things I left behind, paying debt from being unemployed. Now I have to fix my car fast. I make more than twice my best paying job ever but still live paycheck to paycheck because of ask the expenses of restarting my life.

My wife doesn't seem to understand how much I have sacrificed and how much I want to take care of my daughter. I feel like she is using child support as an excuse to live a better life.

A few things that I left out along the way. My wife is sharing our house with the person she cheated on me with. I asked for nothing other than my cars and to store some of my stuff as I had nowhere to take it. My first offer of child support was approximately the same amount I contributed when I was unemployed, not much but it would have kept her from struggling while I fixed my car.

I'm sure I left something out, but I'm tired and frustrated."

I'm curious how other INFPs have handled stuff like interviews, applying for positions, etc.

I've already applied for some companies and had a few interviews, and I think the biggest thing that sticks out to me is how fake everything feels, and the fact that I'm not really that great at telling someone about myself. I have a good knowledge of the subject, I've learned a lot about it just on my own time before entering the program, but I always find talking about it directly and trying to make myself sound good to be hard. I tend to be fairly modest about my knowledge, I hate sounding like I'm better then someone, but that doesn't really work well when interviewers ask me to start spouting off stuff about why they should hire me. I really just makes me feel uneasy. I'm fine talking about stuff I know or demonstrating my knowledge, but just trying to tell someone *why* they should hire me is extremely hard for me, even if I feel like I'm a good person for the job. Every-time I come-up with an answer, it just doesn't really feel like *my* answer, just some scripted, obvious answer that anybody could come-up with and is just what I think the interviewer probably wants to hear.

I'm curious to hear, if any of you are willing, your experiences in this area, and any recommendations you may have of how you managed it all."

1o68rs,8,2013-10-10,Where do you usually write?,[deleted],nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1o68rs/where_do_you_usually_write/,"I'm not a great author, but I'm a writer. Like many of you I've wanted to write horror, but felt like I couldn't reach that level of horror that could really make the reader shiver.

So I bought some Psilocybin spores awhile ago and grew some. Why did I do this? Well, I've always read many authors tend to have a sort of... addiction, in the mind altering sense. Before a few nights ago, I had never tried shrooms and in all honesty probably would have loved it with my friends. I cultivated them, did a lot of research before, everything was perfect.

I was asked to monitor a server at this place I'm interning at, they gave me a little run down and said it would be a long night and they just needed someone there to keep upstairs happy. So, with NaNoWriMo coming up, I made this night my shroombingewriting night. I stored some pre made pizzas and cola in the fridge that day so I would have something to snack on. 

I trudge through the day. My boss, Peter, comes and tells me that I probably won't get a job there. I'm not going to get to much into it, but man, fuck that guy. Then again, I wasn't expecting a ton from an internship.

I pull up to the building around 9:00 PM in my beat up little Civic and get to work. Around 11:00 I'm the last one there and I pop open my laptop next, pop some shrooms in my mouth and start to fire away. Strange thing is, nothing out of the ordinary happened. The lights were on, there was a deep bellow that would echo the building and startle me every once in awhile, but besides that, nothing. I wasn't worried about the noise because I figured it was probably just me hearing things. I was worried that I got ripped off on the spores.

I clocked out with around 25,000 words (including an outline).

I was stoked. 

I had the next few days off, and left what I wrote to simmer. I've heard that when you write a bunch, you should take a few days break, come back and reevaluate.

&gt; **manuscript5.docx**

&gt; Title: Cunt

&gt;**Summary**

&gt; Put on rubber suit (remember 1st season of American Horror Story)

&gt; Goes in house

&gt; Slice yapping dog's throat

&gt; Wife is in bathroom, showering.

&gt; He is asleep, kids murmuring in room, won't go to sleep.

&gt; Quickly tie him up and cover his mouth with ducktape.

&gt; Wife in shower. Rape scene? (to far possibly, will edit out, trying to be too edgy?)

&gt; Tie her to bed, want to make their last time together a little bit more scary so do some devil worshipping type stuff to freak them out. (possibly too campy)

&gt; Bring kids in, tell them that the one who wins the game gets a special prize. (rock paper scissors)

&gt; Younger one actually wins, scoop out eyeballs of older one with spoon from downstairs. (maybe campy, Evil Dead vibe)

&gt; They all beg to stop, older one won't stop crying so cut off fathers tongue and shove it down his throat.

&gt; Duck tape his mouth shut.

&gt; Dismembering, blah blah blah.

&gt; Incest (no mutant babies though)

&gt; Finish up the job, younger kid is sort of freaked out, but hey, he got lucky. (Up all night to get lucky)

&gt; Throw him in trunk, light house on fire.

&gt; Man likes feeling that this gave him. Rinse repeat. 

Then the word ""cunt"" written about 100,000 times. It was written like it had paragraphs and such.

I don't remember writing that, I'm more into the psychological horror. The story I remember writing was about a man who finds out he will lose his eyesight in a year if he is not careful, almost once a week he is visited by a man who was (""sent by the doctor"") and gives him eye drops everyday. At the end the man finds out that the doctor had no idea who the man was and that he had been putting nothing prescribed in his eyes. He wakes up the next day blind.

That is what I wrote, not the word ""cunt"" 100,000 times and this summary.

Fuck those spores.

I just got back from work and my coworker Ronnie greeted me, he looked shaken up.

""Did you hear? Peter and his whole family died in a fire a few nights ago. It was all over the news."" I began to sweat.

Okay, just spilled my heart out here. Pretty long but could really use some help.

---

[Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1iv351/i20m_just_broke_up_with_my_gf_20f_after_8_months/) is the original post after the breakup. 

---

I broke up with my girlfriend of 8 months in July. Things were okay the last month of summer. Not to say she wasn't on my mind, because she was, it was just that I was extremely busy and didn't have a lot of time to commit to thinking about my choice. When my internship ended for the summer, and college was only a week away, I started to think more and more about her. We really had no contact between the breakup and the first night back at school.

---
Back to college:

We share the same friend group so it was inevitable that we would be around her. My heart was literally racing with anticipation for the moment she came into my apartment (the whole friend group was at my appt). We were all ""pregaming"" in my apartment and within 20 minutes of her being over, we ended up in my room talking, and me telling her that I thought I made a mistake. This was Aug. 23rd, and within a week we decided we would be 'exclusive' and try to figure this situation out. We were hanging out, talking, and acting very closely to how we had when we were together. We didn't have sex or anything during this time, and there was minimal amounts of kissing. Then things started to get a little weird. on Sep. 8th, I had really started to get bothered by how she was acting. The night before I was to meet her at a party. When I was on my way, I ran into my friends who told me the party was not letting anybody else in. I texted her and told her I couldn't get in. No Response. I texted her a few more times and still no response. I went to a bar in the area (yes I know i'm not 21 i don't need a lecture on this.) and one of my friends (who was throwing the party) was there as well. He told me ex-girlfriend was hooking up with a guy at the party. I went to HS with this kid and honestly he's not very credible so I didn't believe him at first. So on my walk home from the bar, in my drunkenness, I texted her questioning her about what my friend had said. I didn't get a text till the next morning...

---

She responded pretty early and apologized profusely and told me she gave her friend her phone and slept at the same friends apartment (a girl). So we both went out again the next night separately, and at about 12:30 i told her i wanted to talk. I went to her apartment and long story short she told me she doesn't want to get back together and that I hurt her too much from the initial breakup, yet she still loves me. So now that I was annoyed with this out of the blue (ironic if you read the last post) choice, i once again pressed the question of whether she hooked up with anyone while we were back at school and 'exclusive/trying to figure things out'. she simply kept replying ""that's not important"" or ""i don't want to talk about it"". Finally, over a week or so, i found out she did hook up with someone, and it was the night I was supposed to meet her at the party.

---

Now I am in a weird spot. She doesn't want to lose me as a friend, but she doesn't want to be together. So since all of this has happened, it has been a month of me going back and forth on what to do. First I told myself we could no longer be friends. Then the feelings persisted and I just wanted to see her. It went back and forth between be friends / cut her off probably 5 times. The one thing that has been consistent in my mind is the fact that I know I am in love with her. There is no doubt in my mind that I want to be with her, even after what happened, because I know what kind of person she is. She was really drunk the night she hooked up with the guy (and trust me, I know that is not an excuse and I still cringe over the idea of it even happening), and we were in a really weird place. The time spent over the summer without her and then seeing her back at school removed all of the doubts I was having leading up to the break up.

---

Current time:

She has an 18 credit semester, works 10 hours a week, and is trying to be more involved in her sorority. I understand that she feels like she is scared to get hurt and scared to try again, but when we were together, we were really perfect for each other. I honestly don't think we ever fought during our eight months. She tells me she may want to try down the line, but I can't just wait around for that it will destroy me. 

Also some important notes:

* when I say she wants to be friends, she want things like snuggling, watching movies, rubbing her back, etc; aka relationship things, not friendship things. 

* Her best friend hates me and was the one who helped her when I broke things off, so undoubtable told her she can never take me back

* Her mom loves me and pushed her to try and fix things.


**So reddit, I want her back. How do I get her to take this risk on me? I really love her, and though nobody can 100% say they will never hurt someone again, I feel so strongly that I will not. I really do feel like this is the girl I see myself spending the rest of my life with.**



**tl;dr**: Broke up with her because of doubts. Two months apart, want her back, doubts are gone. She is scared to try again."
1o5ydd,1,2013-10-10,I designed a few websites for some businesses. How much will that help in getting me an internship?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1o5ydd/i_designed_a_few_websites_for_some_businesses_how/,"I've designed a few websites for some businesses. I have about four in total right now. One of them is a charity, which I did for free. The others I have charged and I've made a few hundred from them. 

The websites I made employ modern web design practices, including responsive design so they can be easily viewed on mobile devices. They feature implementation of cookies, php, mysql databases, and the standard html,css,javascript. 

They allow the person who I've made the site for put in information themselves and have it dynamically appear on the site. Including event planning and calendar applications that utilize mysql databases. All input forms are scrubbed for possible exploits and there's at least an attempt at error control. 

I did this to earn some money and also position myself better for internships. But now that the time is here and I need to start aggressively applying, I find myself hesitant. So I'm wondering if what I did would really help my chances. Especially with getting a paid internship, since I can't really do unpaid. My parents like reminding me how I'm young and still in college, and probably won't make much and probably never get an internship, etc. 

I have a personal site that shows off the sites I made. I made sure it does this in a visually appealing way. By fading in the sites in an overlay when you hover over the link, but still keeping the top part. That way you can easily navigate all my sites without having to actually go to each one individually. I thought this would make it easier for a potential employer. 

So how good does this sound, and what else should I be doing to improve my chances of getting an internship. To add I thought myself Java and made some small Android apps, I also have a intro level knowledge of c#. Plus a strong mathematics background, easily Aced Calc 3, although that probably doesn't mean much. "

I'm coming up on three months at my new job and I'm almost to my breaking point. Reddit, I work hard. My job is my life and has always been a source of pride for me. I interview well, have been told that I seem extremely put together, and come across very confident. Work feels like the one area I succeed in, but at the same time, I'm extremely paranoid about losing my job, and it's become crippling these past few days.


Background: Immediately after graduating, I took a 3-month (full-time, paid) internship with the potential to turn into a concrete job. A close friend of mine worked at the company, and had originally started as an intern before getting hired on. 3-months came, and I was signed on for another 3-months. After 6 months, they made me an offer, and I accepted.


Things took off and after a few people were laid off, I ended up picking up the slack of a coworker who was let go. I was essentially working two jobs and stressed out all the time. I repeatedly talked to my boss and HR to tell them that the workload was undo-able, only to be told by my boss that she was happy to ""help me prioritize"". Then, if I didn't complete a task, she would say I needed to figure out how to get everything done. There's only so much time in a day, and I found myself working constantly- 13-14 hour days became my norm.


In the last 6 weeks I was there, I started feeling extremely paranoid about getting fired. I'd surpassed my quarterly goals though, and tried to tell myself that it was just my anxiety talking, that I'd be fine. The day before it happened, I could sense it. Sure enough.. I was laid off the next morning.


Again, I was super fortunate and got another job a month later. 6-month assignment, with the hope that budget would be approved and they would bring me on full-time. Six months came and went, I was signed on for another 30-days, then another, then another. Nine months total before I was told that there simply wasn't budget for my position. Technically, my contract ended. No harm, no foul. My boss gave me a great recommendation, and I got another position almost immediately.


Now, I'm coming up on 3 months at my new job, and while my at-will employment has no contract end-date, it does state that the first 3-months is a probationary period and can be terminated at that point. Again, I've been working extremely hard (and long hours- 15 hour days). Even though I've only been here a short time, I'm leading a number of large projects, and for the most part succeeding (minus a few beginner errors that come from learning new process). However, a new woman just stepped into the management role for my team just 2 weeks ago, and she makes me extremely nervous. I feel incompetent around her, and I'm sure she can smell it.   

I can't go on feeling this anxious wondering if/when I'm going to get fired, and I have no idea what to do. Has anyone been in a similar situation? Any advise would be great.  

**TL; DR: 3-month review coming up. Paranoid about losing job, since last 2 jobs did not pan out.**"

I'm waiting for my intership to start in two weeks, then I have some exams and final paper left. Those are easy, but I'm scared, paralyzed. I don't know what i'm afraid of though.

I've been in this situation before, several times. I don't want to be on a sick leave again and mess everything up. I called my doctor, but she cannot call me back til next week, my other worker is on a holiday. But they cannot solve my problems, I know, they give me more meds. I'm on voxra now.

This happens almost every autumn, it gets better during spring. But I cannot wait til spring. I want to get better and finish my studies. But however I think this through, I just cannot understand how to do it. I know it only takes to read some books and do the paper but in my mind it is a huge task, even the smallest ones are too big things to do. 

How can I find the energy to finish my studies and internship? How can I put things to a normal perspective? What have helped you?"

Welcome back, and for those seeing this for the first time, I encourage you to check out the first introductory post that I made [here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1o1l7i/the_yukaghir_documents_introduction/) In the meantime, I will be continuing with my duty and providing an insight into a Cold War era investigation of the extranormal. 

The biggest dilemma I now face is simply which document to choose from. Most of these files were made before the digital era and thus they were stored on volumes of paper, which I now have in a filing cabinet filled with musty manilla tomes. Most are like the first case - interesting, but ultimately useless and uninteresting. After careful deliberation and a few cups of coffee, I think I have found a suitable document to illustrate to you the intentions of the Agency.

I apologize for the speed at which I am providing this evidence. I am an old man, and these bones can only serve so well these days. Let us begin.

_______________________________________

Agency of Paranormal Investigation, est. 1953

Document #555.1

DATE: March 1, 1963

SUBJECT: Codename Assumer, classified Natural Entity

LEAD AGENT: Mikhail Golovin

LOCATION: Vladivostok, at streets **WITHHELD** and **WITHHELD**

The Assumer was first brought to Agency attention when one Agent Vasin disappeared. After ruling out the possibility of going AWOL, Agency dispatched men to investigate Vasin's residency. They found distinct signs of a struggle, a spattering of week-old blood liberally applied to most surfaces in the bedroom, and a journal which all Agents keep and update regularly. Vasin's Agency Journal shed light on the manner of his disappearance. Vasin is now classified as MIA, presumed dead. Official explanation: American saboteurs, or assassins. Whichever tickles Pravda's fancy. Journal contents are transcribed below by lead investigator Golovin.

THE JOURNAL OF ROMAN VASIN

February 20, 1963

Dear diary. Writing in a diary every day is stupid. I suppose there should be something for the interns to do, but even the most paranoid in the Agency must realize that telling us to write down how we 'feel' everyday is a waste of time. I feel like I am a girl from one of the videos they showed us of Americans and their lives. Don't their teenage women write in diaries?

Dear diary. I feel fine. There, boss should be satisfied now. Miserable fuck.

[

February 21, 1963

Dear diary. Today I felt pretty awful. I guess I must be coming down with something. I know I shouldn't have trusted any Chinese food. I feel nauseous, but I can't seem to puke. Maybe I can sleep it off.

[

February 22, 1963

I couldn't get a fucking wink of sleep last night. This is what I get for living alone, nobody to take care of me. I was shivering in my bed all night. Damn these winters! All the blankets and furs couldn't keep me from feeling like I was in an icebox and then when I woke up and shaved, I must have had a black spot in my vision or something because there was a fleeting little line or puff of smoke I thought I saw in the mirror. My mind must be playing tricks on me. Nothing there, nobody but me in the house. Hey, maybe this is what the Agency was after? A shadow that moves by itself. I'm sure it'll fit right in with the entity that can only turn ketchup into mustard when you ask and it's a full moon, or with the anomaly that makes your moustache turn blue if you walk through it. 

Fuck this job. At least the pay is good. Not starving.

[

February 23, 1963

Another sleepless night. Can't focus on the words. My stomach feels like I am riding in a truck on a Siberian dirt back road while trying to read something about puking. I should see the physician as soon as I can.

In the meantime I could have sworn I saw that... something... something or someone in my house today. Well, apartment, I suppose. It was funny, I think my memory is just mixing with my vision - I could have sworn I saw a faint outline of shadow sitting where I sat yesterday, bent over the desk, just like I was all day yesterday. It must be the product of my imagination though. I'm sitting here at the desk now and nothing's amiss. Can't see the shadow now either.

[

February 24, 1963

I think I finally got some sleep last night, though I could have sworn I saw that same little dark spot in my bed beneath the covers. That's what was weird - it looked like it was *beneath* the covers. The spot ended when the covers began, and what else I could have sworn it was.... it was looking at me. I turned on a light, rubbed my eyes, and it was gone, but... I think I might call this one in to work. But... I haven't seen it all day after I got some sleep, so that's worth something. Maybe I was just imagining it, but I'm a bit jumpy now. We'll see how I sleep tonight. My stomach still feels like it's doing cartwheels or something... that Chinese was days ago, though. What greasy quasi-communist food. Disgusting.

February 25 63

I slept. At least a few hours. Woke up with a terrible headache. Writing is hard. Stomach still hurts. Saw the shadow again today. Headaches present with hallucinations. I called it in today just to be safe. They told me to take a few sick days off and that there was no lead in Vladivostok about a shadow. It's not just a shadow though, I see that now, it's a person. An outline of a person. Black like smoke. It disappears if I get too close. Maybe it's a ghost. Well if it is I'm going to find out and keep the credit for myself. No need to involve the higher ups if they'll just take the credit for 'rescuing me'.

[

Feb 26 63

No better. No sleep. Head hurt so much. Fucking A. I just want to leave but every light seems really bright and I don't want to go outside. Kept the lights off and stayed at the desk. Tried to nap, didn't work. I saw the shadow outline again, this time in the shower. It didn't even look at me. I think I want to leave.

[

2-27-63

I decided I need to stay to figure this the fuck out. I can barely get any sleep at this point but the outline is showing up more and more frequently so maybe it'll try to communicate with me. Imagine that, Vasin would be the first Agent to communicate with a paranormal entity. Straight to the fucking top baby. I sat across from it at the table today, it just held up its arms like it was reading a newspaper. Funny, I did that yesterday. Why does it imitate me? It's creeping me out.

[

2-28-63

**NOTE: The script is erratic and jittery now, which proceeds to become more frantic as the entry goes on.** The outline is thick now. Thick enough to see it clearly. It's definitely a person. I think it's me it looks like me it has my hair and when it turns I can see it's nose like mine the outline is getting thicker and I feel so sick so sick can't think straight because of my headache and lightheadedness, so lightheaded. Cut myself shaving this morning, hand was trembling from not being able to sleep. That fucking outline was in the bed again, just fucking looking at me I fucking hate I fucking hate it so much I cant sleep and I'm just going to leave. It's not worth it.

Can't

Door locked, I can't get it open. Outline must have locked it somehow, tried to call the Agency but it didn't work, phone line must be dead too

I'm gonna see if I can hold out in the bedroom, I see it now walking around, opening my icebox and sitting where I sit and doing whatever the fuck I do or whatever the fuck I did rather

maybe that's all it can do is just imitate me it hasn't done anything I havent not yet it must be one really fucking stupid gho

February 28, 1963

Dear diary. Writing in a diary every day is stupid. I suppose there should be something for the interns to do, but even the most paranoid in the Agency must realize that telling us to write down how we 'feel' everyday is a waste of time. I feel like I am a girl from one of the videos they showed us of Americans and their lives. Don't their teenage women write in diaries?

Dear diary. I feel fine. There, boss should be satisfied now. Miserable fuck. 

There's lots of blood on the floor of the bedroom. I think I'll clean that up.

END OF JOURNAL OF ROMAN VASIN

AGENCY DESIGNATION: Yellow-Orange (Limited damage, clearly malevolent)

AGENCY SUGGESTION: Primary directive is to detain the Assumer, or anybody attempting to pass themselves off as Roman Vasin. The name has yielded a few matches in the census of Vladivostok, and they have been rounded up and detained and will remain so for the duration of the investigation. We can't afford to let the entity escape if it is pretending to be Vasin. 

The Assumer's use to us is multifaceted. Assassination, espionage, and possible psychological warfare. If it is a pliable entity it could be used to devastating effect in a large number of ways. 

CASE STATUS: ONGOING

____________________________________________

This was the first of two case files pertaining to the Assumer, who was thus named because he 'Assumed' the entirety of its victim's life. Personality, routine, and, we assumed at the time, physical appearance. Thus we launched an ongoing investigation for similar stories, and a manhunt handled by the KGB for the AWOL Agent Roman Vasin. He was never found. However once we sent some Agents to suggest the story to locals and see if they had ever heard of something similar... we found a few leads. I was one of these Agents - I would go to a pub, make idle chat, then tell a scary story about a spirit that steals your life. Some people helpfully noted that they had heard of it before, and we gathered information thusly. Golovin was in charge on this case, though. He was a good man - dependable and level-headed. But luck tended to be the deciding factor who lived or died in our line of work.

____________________________________________

Agency of Paranormal Investigation, est. 1953

Document #555.2

DATE: May 19, 1963

SUBJECT: Codename Assumer, classified Natural Entity

LEAD AGENT: Mikhail Golovin

LOCATION: Vladivostok, at streets **WITHHELD** and **WITHHELD**

Agents bring into custody a mild-mannered middle-aged man in a scruffy business suit that does not seem to have either been taken off or washed in at least a week. The man has haggard lines around his face but seems to be full of life and vigor, if a little confused. After standard processing and decontamination procedures the man, identified only as Sergei, is placed in an interrogation cell with Agent Golovin. The ensuing conversation was taken into records via an Agent on the other side of a one-way mirror.

Sergei (henceforth 'S.'): Why have you brought me here?

Golovin (Henceforth 'G.'): We have questions for you, nothing that a normal person wouldn't be able to answer. Are you willing to comply?

S. Certainly.

G. Good. Alright, first, I want your name. Full name. Please understand we will know if you are lying.

S. Of course. My name is Sergei.

G. Sergei what?

S. What?

G. Your last name. Surname. What is your surname?

S. **There is a long pause.** I... can't seem to remember it. Silly me, ha, my brain just seems to be malfunctioning again.

G. I see. And... it says here that your friends tell us you've stopped going to the bars with them, stopped playing chess, stopped... 'doing what you used to like to do', can you tell us why that is Sergei?

S. Do I need to justify why I don't enjoy doing certain things anymore? I guess I just got bored of those hobbies.

G. Your friends also tell us that your personality has changed quite a bit. They say you're being cruel, or angry.

S. Not their concern. 

G. And you were fired from work because your boss said you stopped getting even the fundamentals of your job right.

S. I guess... it was just a bad week. Being tired, sick, out of it. I'm sure you've had your fair share of hangovers, Captain.

G. I'm not a Captain, and I definitely have, but I didn't forget how to do my job for half a month because of it, Sergei.

S. I guess that people just change sometimes. As for your questions, I don't see how they're relevant, and I really should let you know that it would be best for both of us if you let me go... now. 

G. I'm afraid I can't do that, Sergei, and you know it. You should know that we want to work something out between us.

S. **Another long pause.** No. That won't work.

G. **Sighs.** If you won't cooperate, then we'll have to detain you until you do.

S. Which would be another mistake.

G. For you?

S. For you.

G. I doubt that. Guards, could you please -

*At this point the audio feed from the chamber was terminated and the lights went entirely dark. Armed personnel were unable to get into the locked door. Chamber remained sealed and dark for ten seconds. When the lights flickered back on, Agents reported a scene of carnage similar to that of Vasin's place. Sergei's body was lying on the floor beside the chair he had been seated in, whilst Golovin's body was never found. The room was covered in gore, presumably from the deceased Golovin.*

AGENCY DESIGNATION: Orange (Limited damage, incapable of controlling, clearly malevolent)

AGENCY SUGGESTIONS: Desist efforts to detain Assumer. Kill hosts if identified. Hopefully the entity will be susceptible to some sort of weapon which can be used to destroy the entity before it causes any more damage to government property. The entity is considered far too volatile to be of any use as a weapon, and it resists even the most basic attempts of civil communication. Note: perhaps in the earlier stages of its 'assuming' it might be weaker or more susceptible to be chased away? If the opportunity arises experiment further.

CASE STATUS: RESOLVED

_________________________________________

The document is one of the first detailing an encounter with a vicious and, for lack of a better word, 'evil' thing. The Agency, or rather the people in it, were not prepared to deal with a new threat of this magnitude. We were too used to dealing with benign entities, ones that didn't care enough to avoid our attention. I do not know why there was such a sudden shift of the kind of things we found in the early '60s, but it happened, and we just had to deal with it.

The most important thing? The Agency never cared about our lives. Not from the get go, and up until the end, we were all expendable. It is a very Russian concept, to view people as cannon fodder, whose lives are relevant only in the currency of their expenditure. Golovin was unlucky. I was lucky. In the end, when you're dealing with things as powerful as what are in these documents, luck is really all that kept anyone alive.

I will let you all mull over this. Maybe you have seen the Assumer. Maybe there's more than one out there. And maybe this might help explain why your friend has been acting strangely lately.

Stay safe."
1o4rg3,1,2013-10-10,"3-Month Review Coming Up At Work, Paranoid About Being Fired [Help]",[deleted],Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1o4rg3/3month_review_coming_up_at_work_paranoid_about/,"Hi r/anxiety. I'm coming up on three months at my new job and I'm almost to my breaking point. Reddit, I work hard. My job is my life and has always been a source of pride for me. I interview well, have been told that I seem extremely put together, and come across very confident. Work feels like the one area I succeed in, but at the same time, I'm extremely paranoid about losing my job, and it's become crippling these past few days.
Background: Immediately after graduating, I took a 3-month (full-time, paid) internship with the potential to turn into a concrete job. A close friend of mine worked at the company, and had originally started as an intern before getting hired on. 3-months came, and I was signed on for another 3-months. After 6 months, they made me an offer, and I accepted.

Things took off and after a few people were laid off, I ended up picking up the slack of a coworker who was let go. I was essentially working two jobs and stressed out all the time. I repeatedly talked to my boss and HR to tell them that the workload was undo-able, only to be told by my boss that she was happy to ""help me prioritize"". Then, if I didn't complete a task, she would say I needed to figure out how to get everything done. There's only so much time in a day, and I found myself working constantly- 13-14 hour days became my norm.


In the last 6 weeks I was there, I started feeling extremely paranoid about getting fired. I'd surpassed my quarterly goals though, and tried to tell myself that it was just my anxiety talking, that I'd be fine. The day before it happened, I could sense it. Sure enough.. I was laid off the next morning.


Again, I was super fortunate and got another job a month later. 6-month assignment, with the hope that budget would be approved and they would bring me on full-time. Six months came and went, I was signed on for another 30-days, then another, then another. Nine months total before I was told that there simply wasn't budget for my position. Technically, my contract ended. No harm, no foul. My boss gave me a great recommendation, and I got another position almost immediately.


Now, I'm coming up on 3 months at my new job, and while my at-will employment has no contract end-date, it does state that the first 3-months is a probationary period and can be terminated at that point. Again, I've been working extremely hard (and long hours- 15 hour days). Even though I've only been here a short time, I'm leading a number of large projects, and for the most part succeeding (minus a few beginner errors that come from learning new process). However, a new woman just stepped into the management role for my team just 2 weeks ago, and she makes me extremely nervous. I feel incompetent around her, and I'm sure she can smell it.   

I can't go on feeling this anxious wondering if/when I'm going to get fired, and I have no idea what to do. Has anyone been in a similar situation? Any advise would be great.  

**TL; DR: 3-month review coming up. Paranoid about losing job, since last 2 jobs did not pan out.**"

Next year will be my final year of undergrad and I am looking for an internship in algorithmic trading anywhere in the world. I have applied to places like GETCO, D. E. Shaw, Jump, Tower, Wolverine, and Allston but am wondering if I'm missing out on any good companies, especially those outside the U.S.

As for my background, I am a computer science major at a top 3 school for CS with a very quantitative background (my specialization within the major is in artificial intelligence, and I have taken classes in statistics, machine learning, optimization, and control theory). Also, I am very interested in functional programming (but before you ask, Jane Street has already rejected me).

Thanks in advance for your help."
1o4jhq,6,2013-10-10,"My [25f] BF [24m] of 3 years isn't willing to move with me, and I don't know what to do..",sillylittlegirl8,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1o4jhq/my_25f_bf_24m_of_3_years_isnt_willing_to_move/,"First post, forgive any errors, please.

My bf and I met when I started university away from where I was from. Since day 1 I told him that I would likely not stay in his area after graduation because there wasn't anything else for me there, graduate school or career wise. We talked about what we would do when the time came, but at the beginning of the relationship I still had 2 years left, so that felt really far away. At that time he said he could see him self moving with me, as long as it was within a reasonable distance from his family. Which is totally understandable, I don't like being too far from my family either.


I graduated after dating for most of the 2 years I was in his city and then moved back to my home city, only three hours away, so I could save some money while working and studying for the LSAT to get into law school. I got into my top pick school, which just happens to be in my home city, still leaving us three hours away from each other.


Through out the ~1 year that we've been living a few hours apart, we actively talked about what we would do when I figured out where I would be going to school and he told me that if I got into my top choice he would move in with me in my city. I found out I got accepted early December and he agreed that he would start looking for a job down here.


In the past year he's had a couple family issues. His older brother is kind of a dead beat. The brother, his wife, and his 1yo all live at home because his brother makes less-than-stellar business/life decisions and has poorly invested and therefore lost everything he had. My bf gives him a little money each paycheck to help with little things, but his brother relies a lot on this money. (imo, they're enabling his brother, but this an entire other conversation) His dad had a minor heart attack and he wasn't comfortable leaving his family at that time, so he put the job search on hiatus for a bit around then, but now his dad is well again. Then his parent's talked about separating which freaked him out for a but, but they've since worked it out. And on top of that my bf only has a high school diploma making finding a decent job very hard in the field he's currently employed in.


He’s since resumed his job search, but I don’t think he realizes that he’s not going to be able to go out of market and get his current pay. He says he wants to make sure he can contribute and pay for things, and I appreciate that; he wants to take care of me and I couldn’t ask for anything better. But I think he’s being unrealistic. I suggested maybe he could take a part time job down here and maybe work on getting some certifications or whatever else he needs that would make him a better prospect to employers. I’m not hurting for money, so I don’t need him to work full time so he can pay for everything. Just working so he can help with food, and have a little extra for his own hobbies would be fine for me.


I've just started law school. Everyone always warns you it's going to be intense, you're going to be busy, and you're not going to have enough time for everyone the way you used to. A couple months in now and I can see what they mean. I do not always have time to talk to my bf on the phone every night, which means I definitely don't have time to make spontaneous trips up to see him like I was able to before school started. We talked about how him living here with me would enable us to see each other and interact better because it could be something as little as going to the grocery store together to spend our time. The little things that can’t happen because he’s not here are the things I need the most right now, I feel.


It's not to say we don't make time for each other, we do. I just don't think this type of relationship, the way it is now, will work for me for too much longer. I honestly feel like I can’t sit and wait around forever. There is so much going on in my life. I’m meeting new people, networking, studying and reading for more hours that I thought possible. I’m involved in a couple organizations through my law school that have time commitments, but look great on a resume when it comes time to get my summer internship. And he’s not here to experience a single thing with me. 


I personally feel like he’s afraid. He’s never travelled, he’s never been more than 6 hours away from home, and the one time we did go away that far it turned out a family member was going to the same place, so we stopped and saw them. I don’t think he can leave his family. And the thing is, I can’t fault him for that. My family raised me to be more independent, but I don’t see anything wrong with being connected to your family. But does this mean were just not compatible? Am I being selfish needing him to move? Is he being hesitant for a reason I just don’t see? I’m at a loss as to what to do..

---

**tl;dr**: Bf won’t move with me as previously discussed and I just don’t know what to do anymore."

I played since closed beta launched and quit a bit afterwards (to play more Tribes) and I can definitely see the focus coming to fruition. 

As a serious Hi-Rez game fan having played since Global Agenda launched, there is no doubt that this is the best game to come from your studio.

I played Tribes more heavily than any other Hi-Rez game and like many others, was sad to see Tribes become dropped. However now that I see what Smite has become, I no longer hold that grudge. 

Anyways, I just wanted to say thank you and pass compliments to the dev team.

1o49vv,20,2013-10-09,How competitive is it for a new college graduate to get hired?,ironmanscv,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1o49vv/how_competitive_is_it_for_a_new_college_graduate/,"New college graduate here and I'm looking for some advice on landing that first job opportunity.  I recently graduated from a UC in california with highest honors (summa cum laude).   I have also had a software engineering internship experience with a leading hardware company (think Nvidia, Intel, AMD).  I currently do programming exercises on sites such as codeeval, projecteuler, etc.  I am attempting to learn Ruby on Rails.  I've also read both Programming interviews exposed and cracking the coding interview.  


Don't get me wrong, I am able to get plenty of interviews at both big/small companies (seeking positions in silicon valley/bay area).  However, I always seem to get the response, ""Although the interview went well and your coding is good, there's someone who's a better fit for this position and we are not moving on.""  How do I improve based on responses like this?  Sure, I may not be able to answer coding questions the fastest or the best, but I am very good at analyzing and answering problems through a theoretical view, but not a ""practical"" view.  I also understand that my experience is not all that amazing, as I only switched into computer science at the end of my sophmore year, but should a new college graduate with great academics be struggling this much?  Looking back, I wish I had gotten into programming earlier and had more internship as getting hired through an internship seems to be the ideal path.  Now, as a graduate, companies are much less inclined to offer internships.  I also see a lot of people working on github or personal projects, however, I feel like these experiences can be completely useless without any mentorship as bad habits or coding practices go unnoticed.  


Do you guys have any other suggestions? or is it time for me to head back to school or apply to some companies an airplane away from california?"

My concern is my first degree is in English and so now I'm getting the lightest version of CS my school offers. I know it's enough (along with my two cs internships) to get an entry level software engineering job, but since I haven't really been doing any math, I'm concerned I wont be qualified for sciency development jobs.

1o3ylz,2,2013-10-09,"I feel like I'm so far behind the other people planning on majoring in CS at Uni, even though my grades are fine. Is it even worth it to continue? How late is ""too late"" to start?",[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1o3ylz/i_feel_like_im_so_far_behind_the_other_people/,"I'm currently about midway through my first semester of University, and I'm doing well in terms of coursework; I budget my time well enough to get everything done early, get my studying in, etc. I'm here on a full-tuition scholarship that poofs into oblivion if I don't maintain above a 3.0, so that keeps me motivated enough.

I've always been interested in computers, but not in the way that the  guys in the program and most people on Reddit seem to be. My adolescent hobbies were doing work for my classes, playing basketball (up through Junior Year), and playing video games. But, now, I've been talking to a lot of guys that are my age and planning on majoring in Computer Science, and these guys have ACTUALLY BEEN DOING COMPUTER SCIENCE growing up. I didn't even have AP Computer Science at my school.

All I had were a couple of summer camps where I learned about 2-3 weeks of Python 3 and (a few summers ago) very rudimentary C#. But I still am infinitely further back than some of the guys here. Hell, this is going to be the first year of my life I'm running an OS that's not Windows, because the department wants us in Ubuntu.

Like, just today I was talking with a guy about how we have to pick between Java and C++ for a class in the 300 block, and he said ""Yeah, they probably just want to offer both an interpreted language and a compiled language"" and I had to just nod my head like I had any idea what the difference was. (I looked it up when I got back to my residence hall; apparently Java is actually compiled to bytecode, but that doesn't make a difference to the programmer. Or something.)

***My question is actually starting here:***

So, to make a long story short, I feel like I don't actually know anything about Computer Science other than how to write really basic programs, since I was always putting it on the backburner before Uni and my school wasn't quite the boon either. Now, I'm seriously questioning whether this is worth it, when I'll basically be playing catch-up with my graduating class in terms of outside knowledge.

- Do people who ""start"" CS in their freshman year of university stand a chance in the real world? Why would anyone give me an internship when there's going to be someone else who's been coding since he was 12 years old?
- If I am able to continue, is it worth it to look for summer internships when more than likely I'll be at the bad end of the bell curve? Should I just use my summers to be an autodidact instead?

I'm sorry this got so long, but I've just been really frustrated with how little I actually know, kicking myself for my past and worrying like hell for the future. Thanks for your input in advance!"

Listen to my problem...,Gradius87,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/1o99de/just_got_offer_from_my_1_choice_firm_but_not_for/,"So here's my dilemma: I'm 25, live on my own, pay for my own schooling, pay all of my own bills, and work full time making $20 an hour.

I just offered a winter internship at my #1 choice firm, however I was hoping for a summer internship. 

The reason I want summer is so that I can work part time (23 hours) at my current job to keep my benefits. If I take a winter internship I will only be able to work Sundays at my current job which means I'll lose my benefits. And also means that I will not be considers part time but instead ""limited"" part time

I will not have a full time offer (if even) until fall 2015 most likely, from this firm. That means I'll have a year of being ""limited part time"" at my job in between internship and full time. I would have to wait until a part time position opens back up at my current job in order to regain benefits but that is not a guaranteed chance.

What should I do? If I don't take the internship I may not get another chance at this point."
1o96pb,1,2013-10-11,I'm having a hard time choosing which school to transfer to.,qualiaqq,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1o96pb/im_having_a_hard_time_choosing_which_school_to/,"I'm having a last minute reconsideration of the university that I'm transferring to. I've been taking classes at a local community college with the plan to transfer to UNT in Denton to pursue a BS in CS. I chose UNT just out of convenience because it's closer to where I live than any other 4 year college. I should note that I'm a non-traditional student, 30 years old, and moving for the sake of school is hard. However, several times now it has been brought up to me in conversations that UNT is “not an engineering school” or at least they are not known for that or computer science. When people think UNT they think of liberal arts and music. College is expensive so if I'm going to spend as much as I am on college driving a bit down the road for a college that is known for engineering and computer science doesn't strike me as insane.

Specifically I'm considering UT Dallas that happens to be right smack in the middle of the “Telecom Corridor” where 600 technology companies are housed. Their internship program is large and even Google and Microsoft consider the school good enough to recruit from. Even if I went to UNT, internships will likely be from that area, so I could find myself driving over there regardless. On the downside, the commute is 50 minutes compared to 25 to UNT―each way. Furthermore, the classes I'm taking transfer, but not as cleanly as it would into UNT. UNT also lets your GPA transfer into an overall GPA category sperate from their GPA, but it affects if you graduate with honors. UTD does not transfer GPA whatsoever, which is annoying because I have a 4.0 GPA. UTD seems to have a much larger CS program, which means more class offerings, which means easier to create a sensible schedule. UNT has less and I may find myself driving back and forth more often. I cannot tell if I'm being pedantic about the whole thing or considerate.

Of course I jumped at the chance and prepared as best I could on short notice.

Interview seemed to go well, was asked a simple function problem and abstract math problem.

Was told about the internships responsibilities, which was interesting. He said it would be 50% coding work and 50% research.

Allotted time was 1 hour. We finished in 30 minutes.

He said he would get in touch with me but would be out of town for the next 2 weeks (also needed to discuss with other people apparently).

Curious as to if that is a bad sign? (No immediate response and shorter interview duration than was expected)

I did bring a notepad so I jotted down a few areas I could improve, so I guess even if I don't get it, I still learned something."

I am a computer science fresher (UK) and I kind of expected my course to be very loaded and that I would barely have any time to do anything besides coursework. Turns out this is not the case, and I am going to have a considerable amount of free time. Since I am not the sort that goes around partying, I would like to do something useful when I am done with my coursework.

I guess I am using the word ""useful"" a little ambiguously here, but it's hard to be very specific in my third week of my first year, but generally I mean things that would benefit me when I graduate, i.e. stuff that's good for getting a job or continuing to a masters.

The only things that I've come up with are: Coursera courses (and other MOOCs),  competitions, attending career events organised by the university and other organisations, desperately trying to get internships (from what I've heard, it's pretty hard to get anything during the first year, but still not impossible) and doing some recreational coding the result of which you can actually show to people.

So, what are your opinions on this matter?"

This got me thinking about graduate students in STEM fields that generally have their tuition waived and get payed a meager stipend since they usually do some combination of teaching and research.  The stipend is usually low and there is often attempts to justify it with the social capital and upward mobility that a graduate degree is supposed to provide.  When I do the math for my own degree the number of hours I worked for my stipend I end up significantly under minimum wage.  Even when I add in my tuition waiver I'm right around, but still below, minimum wage.  What protections are there for graduate students in this situation?  What things could be done to ensure fair compensation?  Is this an important issue? Can graduate research/teaching assistants be unionized?  What other issues are there?  Maybe I'm naive but in my experience people do the best work and are most productive when there are valued, compensated appropriately, aren't ask to work too many hours, and are allowed to have proper work/life balance.  Most graduate students/recent graduates I know are miserable, broke, stressed, and not well adjusted."
1o8nca,6,2013-10-11,How to Choose a College or University,steve_nyc,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/1o8nca/how_to_choose_a_college_or_university/,"Choosing a college is a very personal decision. Only someone who knows you extremely well can suggest specific schools. And if you don't know what kind of school you want to go to, how can others make recommendations for you?

However, here are some factors to consider when evaluating schools that interest you:

&gt; 

**1. Cost**

How much is the tuition, room, and board? Public colleges and universities often offer significantly cheaper tuition for in-state students.

Can you get merit aid or financial aid? If so, how much?

To what extent can you negotiate with the financial aid office?

Also, don't forget to factor in the fact that if your school is far from home, plane / train fares add up quickly.  



**2. Academics**

What kind of degrees does the college offer?

How strong is the college in your areas of interest? For example, if you want to major in finance, how reputable is the finance program?

Are there any combined undergraduate and graduate degree programs?

How competitive is the student body?

What's the ratio of students to faculty?

What's the average class size?

How accessible are faculty to students (email, office hours, etc.)?  



**3. Career**

What kind of assistance does the career services office offer?

What's their success rate with placing students in jobs and internships?

What kind of employers typically come to campus to give workshops?

What kind of employers have special relationships with the college for internship programs?  



**4. Extracurriculars and Social Life**

What kind of student organizations are there?

How prominent is the Greek life (fraternities/sororities)?

How strong are the school's sports teams? How strong is school spirit?

What percentage of students live on/off campus (dorms vs. apartments vs. living at home)?  



**5. Student Body**

How diverse is the student body (race/ethnicity/religion/national origin/gender etc...)?

What's the average age of an entering freshman?

What percentage of students transfer in (and out) of the college?

A little background on me: I originally went to school as a bio medical engineer but saw I would have to take more and harder classes than a premed student. So after a year of being indecisive and trying to find a major I chose finance, my parents to an extent pushed me into something practical. I have a few extra curricular activities but nothing spectacular that don't make me stand out. After graduation I had an internship with Toyota doing operations. In school I had taken a few higher level operations classes 6 sigma type stuff. I had enjoyed those classes and thought what the heck. I found out quickly that is wasn't for me. So it has been a month since I have finished that internship, I feel that I am just wasting my time (which I am). I have heavily contemplated going back to school for medicine, I know 3.3 is low but I would have to take another 2 years of undergrad just to take the MCAT so i can bring that up. My reason for this is medicine will give me a solid upper middle class income (I believe even with the affordable care act this still will be true, also both parents are in the medical field so they know some people whereas they know no one with finance), where as with finance I feel that statistically I will only top out at around maybe 100k (with an MBA in the future). So I was just wondering if anyone has advice or guidance for me on what to do about this. "

1o704f,1,2013-10-10,She (F 24) has delayed moving out to Utah with me (M 25) by 4 months amid constant fighting. Is this it for us?,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1o704f/she_f_24_has_delayed_moving_out_to_utah_with_me_m/,"She and I have been in a serious relationship for a year and several months before I decided that I would move to Utah for graduate school (and skiing, naturally).  When I first moved out here I was incredibly down on myself for leaving her and my friends.  I knew I made the right choice career-wise and hobby-wise to move 1800 miles away, but I was very reluctant to leave my friends and her.  She, on the other hand, was incredibly supportive- she was just going to finish her Psychology degree this Summer and move out there as soon as she could.  Despite her track record of being disorganized and not knowing what she wants to do with her life, I took her work on it and put plans in motion to move.  Then she found out she had to take classes this Fall.  No worries- we'd go long distance for a semester!  She had full intentions of moving out here in January.

We're now two month in to the LDR and this last month has been a battle.  First, we had a full fledged pregnancy scare that put us both on edge (I've been able to visit once a month), followed by her discovering that she has to retake a class next Spring to graduate.  Combine that with her not having a job right now nor money and owning a car that wouldn't be able to complete the drive without a $2000 repair and it's not looking good.  Because I love her and she's an amazing person, I've tried to accept all of this and have tried to steer her in the right direction- ""Get an internship, make some money, I'll pay for half""- but this usually results in her being furious at me because I'm never sensitive enough when we're talking about her situation.  Every time we fight about this I keep telling myself that this is a difficult situation for her too and that she will eventually figure things out.

So I think I'm approaching my limit.  I'm nearly convinced that when she's supposed to move here next May, something else will come up, just like it did this summer for Fall classes and right now for Spring classes.  I'm incredibly homesick and miss her but with the high ratio of arguments over the phone vs having a good time on facetime, its becoming more and more difficult.  I'm not sure I can last seven more months like this.  Fortunately, I've met some guys that are practically man-whores so if I stick with them, meeting women shouldn't be a problem, supposedly, but I don't really want to pursue anybody but her.  Moving back to where she lives isn't an option either because I'm in a really good situation for my career and it would be a bad move to throw all I've achieved to get to where I am today.

We were amazing in town together and I probably did this to myself by moving.  She's beautiful, has a great personality, and the most caring person I've ever met.  However, she's very immature when it comes to planning and careers and I'd hate that to be the reason we're over.  But at this point, I'm nearly too strung out to continue.  

What should I do?

TL&amp;DR:  Moved away, decided to go long distance with my amazing GF.  Things keep coming up which delay her moving with me and we keep fighting.  Where do we go from here?

At the end, I believe I will have about 12k-15k saved up. 

I've been lurking around r/investing and the other related subs recently.  I would like to set aside 1k into a trading account to experiment with, doing my own research on companies.  I have been fooling around with simulators for the past year, and I can do okay.  Is this a bad idea? 


I don't know much about investing, but I have been trying to learn by looking through these boards, reading investopedia, and all that other good stuff. 

I don't have a Roth IRA... I know its good. I should start one?

I've read a bit about mutual funds. Would that be my best bet as far as investing?

What about paying off student debts? I think I'll be in the hole about 40k by the time I graduate. I've seen some people on here saying that paying off debt is the best investment.  However, assuming I get a job in my field when I graduate, I will be making more than that in one year.

I saw the post earlier today by /u/corgisaurio and I thought that you guys might be able to help me out with my situation too.

My dream has always been to get into the film industry. Originally my plan was to go into a film school right after I graduated high school but due to some personal reasons I ended up at a cheaper in-state school where I won't be able to do anything film related (aside from the once-a-week, kinda crappy film club). 

My new plan was to spend two years at this place and then transfer to a university with a good film program but lately I've been thinking that maybe it would be better for me to drop out of college and try to get film/video internships or jobs back home. I hate it here and I feel like I'm wasting my time. I feel like I'd have a better chance if I just started working now instead of waiting around taking unrelated classes. 

I've taken video classes and have made plenty of short little movies (shot for local film festivals, competitions, and even a private company once) so I'm not exactly starting from rock-bottom, and I know people who might be able to help me find work but I also know that this would be a serious gamble for my future. 

So I'd really like some advice. What would you do in a similar situation? Is it better for me to hold out in college or should I take the risk and drop out?

So. I am currently in Sydney and I am really enjoying my stay. I am an intern for an IT company and I am going to be here for roughly 6 months. I am currently on a WHvisa (subclass 417) and I am not allowed to work more then 6 months with the same employer.

Now I've sat down with a coworker of mine and we looked over the visa requirements and found that there's 3 different types of employer - employee relations
* Unpaid experience
* Intern
* Paid employment

My question is, can I work as a intern for 6 months for the same company and as a unpaid at the same company for another 6 months?

Thank you"

Has anyone had this happen to them or have any advice? 

Thanks!

PS the email said rescheduling can happen if one has a personal emergency but it doesn't look like it happens otherwise.

1oazt9,33,2013-10-12,How I Fucked Up 3 Film Interviews,zeltrine,Filmmakers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Filmmakers/comments/1oazt9/how_i_fucked_up_3_film_interviews/,"We've all been nervous at interviews. Some of us choke, or forget our rehearsed lines, or we say something that we regret and can't seem to get out of our minds. Well, I've had my fare share of those moments, and I'm going to share them with you now. Hopefully you can learn a thing or two from my mistakes.

1. The F Word

I had the internship in the can. I was interviewing for an assistant position at a management company. All I had to was not mess up the interview. I knew the guy who was running the company, I had worked with him a few times for seminars at USC. All I had to do was be nice and answer the questions.

The guy I knew had to run, so his partner had to interview me. He looked look maybe only a few years older than me. He started asking me questions and for some reason I felt really comfortable talking to him. He was not that much older than me, and I really wanted to connect, so I let my guard down. That's when it just left my mouth, I said the F word. Fuck.

However, it didn't register in my mind that I had ruined this interview. I thought I was doing great. It just slipped and I played it cool, like we were equals or something. Suddenly, his body language changed. He got up from behind the desk and moved closer to me. In retrospect, he actually was moving to the door because in his mind this interview was over and he just had to kick me out. However, he was so smooth that I the time I thought he was just getting close because he became more comfortable. He was still polite and kept asking me questions. It was only until later that I realized that he was mumbling and thinking of questions. He really wanted me to leave, but I was too dumb to realize it. I thought the interview was still doing well.

Then he started mentioning that he has a few other interviews, and that I'll find out by next week if I got it or not. It was time to go. I shook his hand and left. It was only until I got to the car that I realized that I had screwed up the interview. I never heard from them again.

2. Jingle Balls

The job was basically mine. As long as I didn't fuck it up, it'd be mine. It was an interview for a full time production assistant position. A few months earlier I had worked with this production company for about 12 days, so a lot of people knew me. Even though I knew I had a good chance, I was still nervous. I was in the lobby and they called me in.

We went to a meeting room and I sat on one side while the three other producers sat on the other side facing me. It was go time.

They asked me basic questions, and asked me what I wanted to do, and why I wanted to join their company. I said I wanted to learn how to be a better producer, which was true. There was a cynical producer he said ""Why are we even interviewing him? Just hire him already!"" We all laughed. The interview was coming to a close, almost home. Then suddenly, the bald producer said, ""Can you sing the Call Me Maybe song for us?"" In my mind, I was like What the fuck? Why? What for? Is this a joke? I'm sure he were just kidding around but it was such a weird request, and it was three dudes interviewing me, so I just went with the first friendly dude answer that popped into my mind: ""Sure, I can sing it, but I'll have to squeeze my balls to reach the high notes."" Everyone laughed. I thought ""I got this!""

They said, ""We'll let you know in about two weeks."" I said thanks, shook their hands and left. They didn't contact me until almost a month later, but it wasn't for the position, it was just to help out for a day or two on a spec project. However, that fell through and they never contacted me again.

In retrospect, I don't know and I still don't know if it was my stupid comment that ruined me. It was only until later that I thought of the perfect response: ""Well, I could sing it for you, but I don't want to make your ears bleed."" It was short, sweet, and unoffending. If only my brain had thought of it first.

3. Coffee 

After the Jingle Balls incident, I didn't need to work since I had saved enough money. However, after I shot my first feature film The Grotto, I was out of work for a few months and I had to get back into making money. I had worked for this other production company shooting behind the scenes footage for a new movie coming out. I shot the interviews with the director and he was a really cool British guy. After the third day of shooting with him, I asked him if he knew of any positions opened at the production company he worked for a big commercial production studio. He said ""Well, let's set up a date and we'll grab some coffee to talk about it."" I was ecstatic. I didn't think he would offer such a thing - I just thought he would recommend me to to someone else so he could get rid of me.

We finally locked down a date for a Monday, which was a week from when we set it up. However the Thursday before, the secretary emailed me and said ""Are you available today at 2pm?"" I hadn't rehearsed or prepared mentally. It was Thursday at 11am - I had only 3 hours . I said ""Yes!""

I arrived at 2pm exactly, and entered the Commercial Studio air hangar building. It was their third one, they were expanding rapidly. It was a beautiful set up with minimalist design everywhere. I waited patiently for the British director to arrive. He came out in a rush, ""Sorry mate, I don't have much time. You wan't some tea?"" I wasn't expecting that comment. He doesn't have much time? Well, what was I thinking? That he'd give me an hour for free? I probably had 20 minutes of his time, tops. I was totally not prepared.

He made some quick tea for me, and we stepped into his office. It was sparse, just a desk, a couch, and a coffee table. I sat at the edge of the couch. He slid out his chair and crossed his legs. He looked at me and said ""Okay, for the sake of time, tell me what you're looking for. Let me know what you're thinking."" Straight and to the point. This was the complete opposite of when I was shooting his interviews. He was laid back and relaxed, the epitome of chill. Work must have transform him daily with stress and anxiety.

I asked him if there were any assistant editing or production assistant positions available. ""Mmm, no, sorry mate, I don't do that kind of hiring. But listen, I want to help you, I really do! Maybe if you tell me more about yourself, I can do my best to help you.""

I went into my rehearsed diatribe of how I went to USC and created my own production company. I told him how we had shot a few films, and we recently did some shooting for ABC Television's HR department. He was surprised and confused, and asked me why I was looking for a job. I said I needed something more consistent. He said, ""It never is, you always gotta hustle. It's a constant hustle.""

I then went into how I was becoming more of a writer and how I wanted to be a screenwriter. That's what confused him even more. He said, ""I don't understand, are you looking for a job, or do you want to be a writer? If you want to write, go write! And listen, I like you, I really do, but how you came in? It's not good, you have to be more prepared. So what do you want?"" I said point blank I was looking for a job.

""A job? Okay, I'll see what I can do about that."" He quickly rolled his chair over to his laptop and started typing. ""What's your website?"" he asked. I gave it to him. He started watching our reel, but impatiently skipped through most of it. ""Good stuff, not bad."" He then started watching really old shit that I didn't want him to see. He kept skipping through it and commenting. ""Hmm, some music would have done it some good."" He kept going through our old stuff in our vimeo account and it was getting me angry, not at him, but at how disorganized our company vimeo account was. I decided to revamp the company website so it wouldn't happen again.

I really wanted to show him my favorite commercial, Dibs, but the vimeo search is horrendous. I couldn't find it. He kept selecting crappy old videos. I HAD to show him my best video. The director suggested he go get his friend because he was a screenwriter. He left the office to go get him. I was determined to show it to him. I went on my laptop but I couldn't connect to the internet. So I did the dumbest thing I could do that moment: I went over to the director's laptop while he wasn't there.

I searched and still couldn't find it. I turned around and he saw me on his laptop. ""HEY! What are you doing!? Jesus, you're definitely earning points today."" I instantly regretted my decision and felt ashamed. My ears turned hot red from embarrassment but I now had to talk to his screenwriting friend. At that point, the director clocked out of the conversation and focused on writing work emails and messaging through iChat. Talking to the screenwriting friend was a lot easier. He was definitely cool to talk to, bringing up similar movies that we both liked. I told him that I've written 3 feature films, and he said I should send them to him, and that he would respond in about a week. I was once again hopeful. No one had ever asked to read one of my scripts, maybe something good will come out of this!

The conversation turned to my age, and I said I was 26. The screenwriter turned to the director and said, ""Hey, what were you doing when you were 26?"" The director responded by saying, ""Uh, let's see, I was earning $300,000 a year, working as an assistant director to [insert famous British director]."" My balls shrank. ""So, you gotta get to it!""

The screenwriter left after giving me his email. The director then got on a phone. I still wasn't done with my tea. The director looked at me and said ""Okay, goodbye!"" He was kicking me out. I hated myself. I said ""I'm really sorry about the laptop."" He said ""Don't worry about it, talk to you later.""

I never heard from either him or his screenwriting friend.

In retrospect, it's always when I do something spontaneous when shit goes awry. My emotions overtake me and I lose control. I tried really hard to make the interview with the British director work, but I just had to go ahead and do that stupid move of looking at this laptop without his permission. Had I only thought about my next move a little bit more, I would have prevented that disaster.

TL;DR: Fucked up three interviews by saying/doing stupid shit. Learn from my mistakes.

first I would like to introduce myself. I am a 3rd year(and final) IT/Programming college student from europe. My programming skills for now revolve around:  
* Java - was taught in college since day one, somewhat dislike it.  
* SQL,html,css - had few classes in college, know the basics, not a big fan.  
* Python - been learning for quite a while and I really love the language so far. Regarding the knowledge level I would I'm entering the advance seas currently.  
* Going through codecademy.com courses for java-script(not a big fan) Ruby (like it quite a bit), finished Python long time ago(loved it). Did a bit of HTML,css,js,jquary there as well, was quite fun.  
* Did WYSIWYG drag and drop programming with middleware software during my internship(found it quite fun) with this tool in particular [Transform](http://www.bottomline.com/document_process_automation/transform.html)  

Now since we're pretty much learning documentation and other forms of paperwork in college I don't have much programming to learn and I don't know how to further develop my skill for my upcoming career. Currently I'm doing 100 Project Python exercises(https://github.com/thekarangoel/Projects) and I would really like to have Python involved, but I don't think knowing Python alone will be enough.

So I'm looking for advises on what to do? how to improve my skills further so I could land at least an entry position or a decent internship once I'm done with college. Could anyone recommend me something or books, tutorials, anything that would help me out with my problem?"

1oa7rz,7,2013-10-12,"My mum lost her trust, how can I help her ?",[deleted],cancer,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/1oa7rz/my_mum_lost_her_trust_how_can_i_help_her/,"My mum was diagnosed with both ovarian and colon cancer in December 2011. She had surgery (posterior pelvectomy) then adjuvant chemotherapy (6 cycles) and was considered in remission for 6 months, before discovery inguinal adenopathy and small lung and liver metastasis. So she started chemo again this spring.

She has suffered from depression for years, but would always refuse to see a doctor. When she was first diagnosed, she went through a ""just let me die, I don't want treatment"" phase. And again in spring 2013. 
The thing is, she actually responds well to treatment. Apart from being real tired and some diarrhoea, she has few secondary effects of the chemo. Each CT-scan shows a very good response, with some metastasis actually disappearing and all the others shrinking.
But she won't believe it. She spends her time on conspiracy-like websites, believing instead that doctors are using her as a test subject, all because an oncologist told her her particular form of cancer was uncommon. 
Where it gets even more complicated is that I'm a doctor myself, and work in the same hospital she is treated (though thankfully in another unit). So she used to ask me lots of questions she wouldn't ask her oncologists, and I'd answer to the best of my abilities, although I always told her they would be way more competent than me for that. It wore me down, but I still answered. I fact-checked these bullshit websites she sent me, debunking the fluke studies they cited.
Until a few weeks ago she stopped, after I told her pursuing or not chemo was her own decision, that I would support either way, but that no one could take for her. I was stupidly relieved. She would still talk of the everyday life going to the day-hospital, of how one intern was young and blundering, of the nurses and etc, but not of the treatment itself. I felt this was healthier and was glad. I was stupid.
Yesterday, I got a call from my aunt, her sister in law, who was very worried. She lives in another country, is a 10 year survivor from breast cancer. My mum sends her so many emails asking for counsel, because she stopped trusting her oncologists, my dad and me. She thinks we're all in a conspiracy to use her as a lab rat, that cancer doesn't kill but chemo does, that cancer is a fake disease created by evil doctors... She refuses to see a psychologist, or to meet other patients to share experiences. Threatens to kill herself if she has to see one more doctor.
My aunt seems to be the only human being she still trusts, and it lays a very heavy burden on her. We're at a loss.

I phoned a friend of mine who's part of the team that cares for my mum. She said no problem, my mum can take all of her medical file and go to another cancer center to ask for a second advice, and that even if it's the week end she'll prepare everything so that by monday my mum can get an emergency appointment somewhere else. If she wants, that is.
I just hesitate to tell my mum that it's all right if she wants to stop the treatment, it's her decision and she doesn't need pseudo-scientific rubbish from the Internet to justify that. But even without the chemo, she'd still need psychiatric care, and she refuses to get it, and even to acknowledge she might have a problem there.

People who have cancer, what could you advise us to do ? What to say ? How to act ?

Sorry for the long rant, I needed to get that off my chest. Thanks for reading anyway."
1oa1eg,3,2013-10-12,Depressed? Lovesick? Drugged,UnknownAbuser,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1oa1eg/depressed_lovesick_drugged/,"I was an extremely successful student in high school. I went to college where I knew noone. I made some friends. Couple months in, I got a call that my dog died and my mom had cancer. I got heavily addicted to robitussin then coriciden. Also I started smoking a pack a day. I fell in love with a girl back home, and quit robo after about 6 months of almost daily abuse. Lots of crying and sadness I kept to myself. I started abusing my adderall scripts monthly. Over the summer my parents expressed a lot of disappointment in me. Meanwhile I was putting on a lot of weight. 
     When I returned to school for year 2, my mom was cured, things were looking up, I quit smoking cold turkey for about 3 months. Went home for winter break, my dad expressed even more disdain for my lifestyle, even though I had drastically improved. On my return to school I started smoking cigars daily, began being broke every day again. I was gaining even MORE weight. I started skipping classes. I would lie in bed and sleep an entire week just to get to the weekend if I had the chance to go see my gf. I felt pathetic that I had screwed up my classes so much, especially since the year before I had pushed through much adversity. I wore one pair of pants the entire winter. I stopped doing laundry, and stopped brushing my teeth. I was freezing the entire winter. I blamed all of my problems on the terrible sleep patterns I had. I lost all motivation, I wanted nothing to do with my major, and gave up on getting an internship because they always rejected me. I ended the semester with terrible grades, taking a withdrawal and finding myself in academic probation. 
Over that summer I started volunteering, getting better sleep, and was even able to function without my adderall. I started doing standup and felt validated for the first time in a long time. I came back to school this semester with motivation back, but as has been the case, about 3 weeks in I shut down. I still haven't changed shorts the entire summer and fall. I can't save money for more than a day, I'm smoking cigars all the time, and blowing through my addy scripts in two weeks. I can't ever sleep when I want to, I stopped brushing my teeth entirely. I spend half the week eating fast food and half eating loaves of bread cause I'm too broke from the fast food. I can barely convince myself to go to class and sometimes I'll even go there but be too afraid to go in and have people ask me where I've been. I'm terrified of phone calls, and interviews. The only motivation I have is comedy, but writing has forced me to look at some of the parts of my life I've been shutting away. 
I don't know if my problems stem from loneliness,
If they stem from my drug abuse,
Or if I'm depressed but I've only recently begun to consider the fact that maybe the reason I lose my motivation, feel lonely and worthless and guilty out here is because I might actually be depressed whenever I get out here. I really pick myself up when I go home, but when I come out here I just hate everybody and everything about my life and where it's supposed to be going. 

I really felt like I was almost out of that funk a couple weeks into the semester but it's almost like one or two things happened and I just shut down. Going to 1 or 2 classes the entire week. I just want the week to be over and I'll sleep as much as I can all week.  The next week, I'll get a maximum of 5 hours a night. These aren't even nightly sleeps, just sporadic naps. I lowered my adderal script over the summer, cause I felt like I could ween myself off.  My abuse has gotten even worse out here. I feel trapped in a program I don't want to be in at a school I don't want to be at. 

I can't say however that I've been sad. That's why I never considered depression. It seemed to me my problems were too petty and all saying I'm depressed would do would put me on more pills. 

I can ramble on about other reasons but I'll stop there. I've come to realize something about me just doesn't function in my current lifestyle. I've been given the option of going home or switching majors. I would love so much to go home, but I fear I will return and be a failure there too. 


So am I just lovesick/lonely? 
Should I consider that I am mildly depressed?
 Or have I burned through my serotonin receptors after a couple years of dxm abuse?

Thanks"
1o9zm7,2,2013-10-12,Am I screwed?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1o9zm7/am_i_screwed/,"Just to give some background information, I'm currently 20 and will be transferring to Stony Brook University (starting as a junior) this spring to complete my degree in computer science. I am planning to graduate in 2016 hopefully. I want to find an internship or some type of work experience as soon as possible but I'm really worried that I won't be able to find anything because: 

1. I have absolutely NO WORK EXPERIENCE at all. I've never held a single job in my life, not even one at McDonalds flipping burgers. 

2. I go to a community college right now. I know there is a stigma associated with CCs and I think once employers find out I went to one they will think I'm stupid/lazy/unmotivated and this will significantly hurt my chances. 

3. I have really bad social and communication skills, I'm kinda socially awkward and speak with a mild stammer and sometimes I also talk a bit too fast. 

4. I have absolutely no experience with either phone or in-person interviews so I have no clue what to expect when I do get one. 

5. All the resumes I have sent out so far have received absolutely no responses at all, even for part-time IT jobs that pay $10 an hour. I've sent out ~20 resumes so far and have gotten nothing. 


Basically I'm really worried that I won't be able to find any job. I'll be graduating at 23/24 which is 2 years later than most people graduate, which means I'm 2 years behind in the workforce. 

The only advantage I do have is that I work on some hobby projects in my spare time, but they are TINY and they absolutely suck.. most of them are rails and php applications. I also know C and Python but don't really use it for much. But combine this with the fact that I have no ACTUAL experience and seems like this won't help me much.

1o9u81,45,2013-10-12,I survived PUA. AMA,AlphaBaller9000,TheBluePill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheBluePill/comments/1o9u81/i_survived_pua_ama/,"Longtime lurker, first time poster. I know every few weeks a former TRPer posts an AMA, and at the risk of boring anyone I want to do the same.

Back in 2009, a long-term girlfriend cheated on me and broke up with me. Before and through the time I was with her, I was unambitious, in poor physical shape, and had “nice guy” tendencies. The breakup was particularly devastating and unprecedented. In retrospect, I see that she was too young (still in college) and I was too immature for that relationship to have a future, but it was humiliating nonetheless. 

About two months after the breakup, I stumbled on a copy of The Game at a friend's house, and thus began my bizarre odyssey into PUA. For the first year, I didn't study it systematically, and couldn't even finish Strauss's book (it's overlong and quite dull as you may know). I was a mess at the time and couldn't have come across something worse for me. 

A little over a year after the breakup, I started dating a girl I met through a friend. Although I wasn't over the breakup, I had gotten into decent shape and was projecting a lot more confidence, partly because of what I'd learned from PUA—but I treated her like a gentleman and didn't game her. After three months, she broke up with me. In spite of great chemistry we just didn't get along. I smelled the smoke in the breeze a week beforehand and started having sex with another woman who I had a great connection with. I had never cheated on anyone before, and it made me feel powerful and proactive. She was leaving the country in only a few days, and I didn't want this girlfriend who yelled at me all the time to rob me of the opportunity to be with someone else I liked. From all this, I realized that I liked being kind of sleazy. A week later, with both women out of my life, I sat down and read the Mystery Method cover to cover, twice. 

For more than a year afterward, I started keeping score of my romantic life and analyzing every encounter. I never went to a bootcamp, rarely read forum posts, and besides the four PUA books authored by Strauss and Mystery, I never could get far into any other books. I became fully invested in PUA thinking but remained deeply ambivalent to it—I knew it was mostly  ridiculous and occasionally odious, but there were certain kernels of truth to it. I needed to stop being a “nice guy;” get out there and actually talk to women; and actually try to elicit the interest of women rather than being aloof, boring, random and constantly talking about myself. 

I only knew one other PUA, who I eventually lost touch with after moving. I spotted him at a coffee shop wearing ridiculous clothes and reading cosmo and said ""hey, I need a wingman, are you good?"" Turns out he had done a brief internship with Neil Strauss's ""Stylelife Academy"" and concluded that while Strauss and his groupies were all just out to make a buck, PUA still held water. He did okay with women, I'll give him that, but his confidence and ability to approach strangers was kind of awe-inspiring.

My own results were mixed. Ostensibly a success but ultimately maybe not worth the cost. I'm 5'9” and reasonably handsome, but not terrifically masculine. In the year and a half after reading Mystery's book, I had sex with 15 women, more than doubling my lifetime sex partner count. I don't know if it was “game” that led to this outcome, because I was going out much more than ever before and really trying much harder as well. I hit a stride about a year into it where I totally stopped thinking as a PUA (the fact that everyone else in my life thought it was ridiculous helped with that), and even stopped quantifying and self-monitoring my romantic endeavors. 

I don't know how I ultimately lost interest. Maybe I just had enough sex. Perhaps I felt remorse for some shitty things I did during that time. I was tired of drama and constant ups and downs. I genuinely didn't like disappointing women and hurting their feelings. Around this time, I revisited the PUA community online—as I mentioned, I never got much into forums—and was troubled to see its metastasis into TRP.  If Strauss or Mystery's books, silly and creepy as they are, had even a fraction of the malice of people like Matt Forney, Roosh, or Heartiste, I simply could never have gotten into PUA. 

I've been reading Blue Pill and Manboobz for months, mostly for entertainment but probably also as some kind of catharsis. I haven't had sex in months either—I'm not seeking it out, and when opportunities have arisen, I've just felt some strange aversion to it. I've been seeing a woman for a couple of weeks now and although I like her and she is attractive, I just have no desire to sleep with her. Even before PUA, this would have seemed unimaginable to me. 

What I realize now is that for me, PUA was never about getting laid. My sex drive is pretty so-so. For me it was driven by: 
1. Desire to have mastery over my relationships with women and be incapable of being hurt
2. Anger and resentment towards that girl that broke my heart
3. Deep-seated misogynistic beliefs 
4. Envy of guys who got laid more than me

I never denied these things for a minute when I was into PUA. I knew these were my motivations and realized how pathetic they were, but the feelings were real so I pressed on anyways.

To the issue of misogyny: shedding these beliefs can be kind of hard. Some of them you just realize aren't true. Others are much more insidious. I had to ultimately use cognitive behavioral therapy techniques to ask myself why I felt upset about women at times, then write down those feelings, interrogate potential reasons why I had them, arrive at the underlying belief, and finally write down a list of reasons why it isn't true. 

The other day, one of my girlfriends from my year of living shamelessly asked me, “can you still love a woman?” I said I know I could as a human being and a friend, but romantically, I don't know. 

I feel like I escaped from PUA with some dignity, but it's so embarrassing to even contemplate. At least I'm finally moving on with my life. AMA

1. What are the differences, exactly? A lot of apps seem to require it to function fully, but beyond superior support and the 10-user limit, I'm not sure what we're getting over Google Apps for Poor People. 

2. When signing up for Google Apps for Business, it asks for a domain name. My employers work for a realtor that provides everyone an insertname@franchise.com e-mail. I have no desire to interfere with corporate process, but given that I know nothing about webmastering, can someone fill me in on what's going on? 

3. Both users have corporate accounts (which aren't used much) and regular unpaid gmail accounts (which are). What's the best way to get everything combined neatly into one inbox?

I don't enjoy the traveling, long hours, and I really don't see myself in this career/industry in the future. What I currently make is about average for fresh graduates in the area I live.

I have the opportunity to get back into embedded systems which is where my interests are. I was offered about a 14% paycut, not including the new company does not offer a 401k match. I worked at the company as an intern and loved the work. Really interesting and exciting projects come through there. I know I would enjoy my job there, would also be learning a lot more than I currently am and have much more responsibility. In the future I will definitely be a much more marketable engineer in a career field where I want to be. Money aside it's a no-brainer.

I'm really struggling with the paycut. I know ""life isn't all about money"", but it seems like a significant amount of money to me. Have any of you taken a paycut? Did you have regrets or was it the right decision?

I recently expressed interest in moving to a software position at my current company (I'm a QE dealing with HW atm), and I'm pretty sure I'm going to be offered a position in the coming weeks. The manager who is offering the position knows I do not have any real SW experience. He also knows that I am extremely hardworker and should have no problem quickly getting up to speed for the position. 

The gist of position is building custom modules (mostly with C#) that interface with our hardware in a way that could not be solved with our traditional programming methods (proprietary language) used to control our hardware. It's not a FW position.

My question is what is a reasonable salary to expect? I'm pretty much going to take the position regardless of salary because it's going to move me in the right direction career wise, but I don't want to sell myself short. I also don't want to sell myself high because I know my true software development experience is zilch.

The company is in the Greater New York area I currently make a little over $50k. If it matters, I graduated with a very high gpa but didn't do any internships so was forced to take a lesser job.

1ocjl5,1,2013-10-13,My boring life story.,sad_ninja,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1ocjl5/my_boring_life_story/,"I guess I'll start after I moved schools in 5th grade. The reasons aren't important, but my parents moved to a completely different city halfway through my 5th grade and so I switched schools. I met my first real friend there (M). When sixth grade came about, he went to a different school than me. I was sad, but come the next year he transferred to my school. We were inseparable. I trusted him with everything and wasn't afraid to talk to him about anything. Things went bad though, and fast. When it came time to choosing a high school, he didn't want to go to the same school as me. The worst part is, he wouldn't tell me why. He would always avoid the conversation. We ended up fighting about it and once we switched schools, he never spoke to me again.

It was that summer that my sister was also moving away to college. We would usually fight, as siblings do, but aside from M, she was the only other person I would talk to and play games with.

I was literally (I actually mean literally) the only person from my middle school to go to a different high school. This high school got fed most of its students from the local middle school. Everyone already had their group of friends and weren't very friendly to new people. I ended up spending most of my free time in the library, reading. I managed to make one good friend on the bus. We actually became really great friends. However, when he got his first girlfriend, he began hanging out with only her. Of course I understand things change but I rarely saw him after that. They dated all throughout high school.

About the time they started dating was the time I got had a big fight with my only other friend from middle school. The details aren't very important but it was for an extremely ridiculous reason. She was so pissed off at me that she stopped talking to me.

That was my last friend until senior year. As usual, I had nothing better to do than read, play video games, and do my homework.

Starting my senior year, I decide to change things. I joined an after school club. This club started in the summer and ran until 5-7pm after school. The club focused around studying multiple subjects and then competing on who could score the highest near the end of the year. I met a couple of people there who I guess you could say changed my life.

The first person I met there was a guy who introduced me to a group of people who I can call my ""friends"" (more on this later). The second was a girl.

Ever since we met, she treated me differently. We would spend the whole time studying together. She would write on my notes, hold my hand, draw on me, sing to me, and even had a pet name for me. Now, I didn't like her. At least, I didn't like her when I first met her but when you spend 6+ hours a day with someone everyday, you get to know them. 

I finally accepted that I had 'fallen in love' with her 5 months after we first met. This was also around the time she and her boyfriend had broken up. However, things continued as normal with us. I didn't want to confess. I think I was scared because deep down I felt like she didn't feel the same way but the way she treated me said otherwise.

Eventually, I decide to confess. I didn't realize it until after but, I chose a very special day in February (take a guess). I said it, and she rejected me. Why? I never found out. Things took a 180 after that day. She began ignoring and avoiding me. I tried to get things to go back to normal but it just didn't happen. There were 4 months left in the school year. This went on for the next 4 months. 

I don't really remember much after that. It was boring, that's all. I took a pillow to school and slept the whole day. The summer was also pretty uneventful. I stayed home and just played video games.

I only got 1 good thing out of high school, and that was the other friend I made in that club. He introduced me to a group of people he knew online through games. I've been in that group ever since that day. I can't call them real friends though, because even though we've been through a lot, I haven't met most of them in person because of the huge distance between us. I would like to some day meet them...

So then college started. I didn't get into the university I wanted. In fact, I got into my last choice school into a major i didn't want. I really wish things would have changed in college, but in fact they got worse.

My dorm experience wasn't horrible. The only thing I really did not like were the bathrooms and the fact that everyone was alcohol crazy. My roommates were nice people but they were usually out drinking. I only lived there for a quarter before I was somewhat guilt-ed into living with my sister by my parents.

The education at this school sucks. It is suppose to be one of the best schools in the country for my major but the professors are terrible. They can barely speak English. Most of them are also assholes. I stopped going to most of my lectures.

Just like that, first year flew by. The only somewhat positive thing was that I was offered an internship for the spring/summer.

The internship is best thing that happened to me for a while. I got work experience, learned a lot, and got paid. However, I did spend my whole summer at school. Now, my body type is average (not fat/skinny), but I lost 20 pounds during the summer. I was working 30 hours a week and taking classes for 20 hours. I barely had time to eat. I think was worth it overall. I really did like this summer, at least up until September.
 bu
I skipped over a somewhat important detail. At the beginning of this year I met someone through a friend. It was kind of odd how we became friends. We met through a game and we had fun. Before I knew it, we were playing all day. Very quickly she asked for my number and she would call me almost every day. This went on up until the summer started. This is where I fuck everything up.

The details matter, but I rather not go into them. It was fault though. When I think about now, she really did care about me but I didn't want her to. I pushed her away. I ignored her. I was mad at her. I did everything I could to keep her out and I did. I succeeded. Near the end of the summer, we were no longer friends.

It hurt a lot. I didn't want that. She was one of the very (very) few people that actually cared about me. No one had ever really shown interest. They had all left but she hadn't. That was strange, so I pushed her away. I regret that everyday I wake up now. I apologized a million times but it isn't enough.

School started again and I realized I really hate it. Same shit I dealt with the past year; professor sucks, classes are boring, and I'm not given the classes I want. I'm forced to take classes I took in high school again. They don' let me take certain classes even if there is room because it is for 'X major only'. You know what? The people in that major are FAILING those classes but you won't let me take them? College is a big waste of time and money. Why am I still here? Because I have a really great research job. If it wasn't for that, I would have dropped out.

What's the use though? If I drop out what would I do? There are two jobs I think I want. One requires 6 more years of education. The other is a giant gamble.

This is my story so far. I felt the need to share this just because. Writing it makes me feel somewhat better. No one has heard this story. No one has ever really wanted too... I guess that's why I wanted to post it. Maybe someone will read it.

TL;DR: So here I am today. The people I consider to be my real friends are people I have never met. I hate going to college but I don't have any other choice. the only human interaction I have is with my sister but we barely say a word to each other (long story). I don't know if I hate my life, but I think it's boring. It has been for a very long time and I'm getting tired of it. No, I am not suicidal. I think life should be worth living. So why isn't there any worth in mine..."
1och1m,12,2013-10-13,At what point is my (25/F) relationship with my fiance (27/M) none of their business? (50'sM/F) My parents are growing more and more intrusive.,helicopterparentsugh,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1och1m/at_what_point_is_my_25f_relationship_with_my/,"My parents do not trust my fiance. At all. Since the moment we became serious, they have been seeking out reasons to find him ""suspicious"" or ""hiding something"". At first it was the fact that he didn't finish college. His explanation to me was that it was due to financial reasons, and he does intend (next year, actually) to return to school and finish his degree. I have zero reason to find any of this to be untrue and I trust him 100%. My parents have never said what they believe the actual reason to be, but the way they talk about, it's like they expect to find that he assaulted another student or wrote a bomb threat and got kicked out or some ridiculous shit like that. After sitting down and having a long conversation about it, they then found something else to be worried about. At this point, it's been things like his reasoning for living where he's lived (they seem to think he was on the run from the cops for who knows what reason.. the actual reason was he moved for a change of pace) to a facebook message he apparently posted four years ago about doing drugs (my mom stalked his entire facebook, and I mean read EVERY LITTLE BIT.. by the way, I looked and couldn't find the status, then asked my fiance and he was equally confused and couldn't find it either.. we think she was confused and on somebody else's facebook, plus he doesn't do drugs anyway), to.. other shit I don't even remember, it's all so stupid. I'm fucking tired of their shit and I don't want to deal with them calling me anymore, with my mom in tears, freaking out and worried that I'm in love with a serial killer or something.


Some important information:

1. I am somewhat financially dependent upon my parents at this point in time, which makes things complicated. They have been giving me money in order to assist with finishing grad school since I only have time to work part time due to also having an unpaid internship and classes I have to attend. I am done in December so this is coming to an end soon. This makes things complicated because I'm scared I may piss them off so much that they'll end this. I guess at this point I could make do but I have so much freaking debt that I'd like to avoid this if possible.

2. This is not my first serious relationship. My parents were not like this with my exes. This is, however, my only engagement. 

3. My fiance is slightly unconventional, I guess you could say. He has tattoos, used to have piercings (still does technically, but does not wear any jewelry in them). He grew up in a family with a lot of financial difficulties so he's really had to work to get where he is today since he has had zero support from his family. He works at a job and is saving to finish his bachelor's degree. In comparison, my parents are very conservative, straight-laced, Christian types who are well off, and have been able to give my brother and I anything we need. Because he comes from a different background and appears the way he does, I think this is part of why they are the way they are. The lack of a college education is a huge thing for them, seriously. 

4. I live with my fiance. I trust him 100%. I'm not sure where they're getting these ideas from. I have no reason to not believe him. He has never been anything but amazing to me and I love him with all my heart. I can't even begin to explain how much it hurts me to hear them suggest these horrible things about his past. 

5. I have brought all of this up with my fiance. He's been nothing but open with them, even giving them his email and inviting them to talk with him, though it is really beginning to piss him off since being accused of this shit is pretty upsetting.

6. When I've asked my parents WHY they are so worried about him, their responses included:

*""We barely know him""*. Ok. Well, fiance and I live 12 hours away so that makes things difficult. They've met him only a handful of times. I rarely see my parents (maybe once a year) so it's not like they could expect to see him every fucking weekend or something. I'm not sure what to do here.


*""We have much more life experience than you.""* Not sure about a good rebuttal for this one since I can't deny it, but at the same time, I think they're misguided as fuck. 


*""Mom's depression and anxiety cause her to worry a lot.""* I'm sympathetic to this, but it seems I've become her scapegoat. Apparently my life is the reason my mom is in therapy (worried about not just my relationship, but things like my career prospects, finances, etc). While I'm not 100% optimistic about my career due to the economy right now, I'm not freaking out about it like she is either. I have a job waiting tables and I'll be able to up my hours to full time when I graduate anyway, so it's not like I'm totally screwed. 



It's 5 am, I have to work in the morning and I can't sleep, and I feel like I'm going to cry. I realize that it's necessary to put an end to this, but I'm looking for insight into their craziness and possibly a good way to approach them about everything without seriously affecting our relationship. It seems every time I end one of their worry sessions about some aspect of his life, something new crops up. 

---

**tl;dr**: My parents are incredibly nosy about my fiance due to a sense of mistrust that I don't understand. It's causing a lot of stress and I want to put it to an end. "

CMV.,CommaInTheAir,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1oc7zp/i_believe_that_recent_college_graduates_who/,"I majored in Computer Science at a large public university. Upon graduation, I had job offers from multiple large companies, and I accepted one for $60k/year to start working within a few weeks of my graduation. Within 2 years, I was able to buy my own home (with a mortgage, to be clear), which I now operate as a rental property. I have remained gainfully employed since, and have increased my salary significantly in the intervening years.

Things have not changed that much since 2006. All of these things should still be possible today.

I worked hard in high school to gain admittance into a good university in a competitive major that would guarantee me a job upon graduation. Then I worked hard through university to get good grades and build a strong professional network through internships. Now I work hard at my job to continue moving up.

I believe that students who have trouble finding jobs when they graduate either did not work hard enough to be competitive in the job market, or chose a major that would not offer strong job prospects upon graduation, and are now experiencing the consequences.

Sports:

1. Football = I played for one year (Team MVP), but fractured my spinal column while training for sophomore year, so unfortunately I cannot play anymore.
2. Track = Sadly, the same situation as above.
3. Bodybuilding = After rehabilitating from my injury, I’ve gotten extremely involved in bodybuilding. I lift before school 5 times a week and do a little bit of personal training for people in my local community.

In School Extra-Curricular Activities:

1. National Honor Society = The work I’ve done while a part of NHS fits better in the “Outside of School EC” section.
2. National Spanish Honor Society = I take the National Spanish Exam (NSE) each year and screen experimental tests for my school district. For my NSHS service project, I taught English to dozens of Spanish-speaking elementary school kids at my high school while their parents were taking night classes.
3. Chemistry Club = I’ve taken groups of other students along with me to take the American Chemical Society’s (ACS) Exam and received the highest score in my district for two consecutive years.
4. Student / Board Liaison = Honestly, I was a little bothered that the Student Council kids didn’t actively participate and instead use their positions for résumé padding. So, I created (with the district’s help) three positions that act as conduits for student voice. We’ve had a lot of fun and have introduced new, experimental curriculum that teaches through application of knowledge, as well as internship connection outlets for students to find what they’re interested in. I hold the founder’s position and will pass the torch when I graduate. 
5. “Student Aperture” = Building off of the last thing I mentioned, I decided to build an official academic organization at my HS (not an interest group since they have no power really), as a centralized hub for all of the awesome stuff coming out the student / board meetings. I coded a website, made podcasts, wrote papers and short articles, created a blog, and got featured in my city newspaper to help spread the word about what we thought was wrong with traditional education methods. If anyone is interested in knowing more, PM me and I’d love to tell you as much as I can!
6. Ultimate Frisbee Club = Just as a fun way to blow off stress, I helped create a club with about 100 members that meets weekly to play. I know it seems silly, but it has totally been worth it.
7. Academic Decathlon = I have been the team captain of my school’s decathlon team for all four years, where I’ve raised funding for each season, coordinated team study sessions, organized pre-season debates, and won several medals like, Team MVP (Region), 1st Interview (Region), 1st Speech (Region), and 1st Science (Region). As a team, we’ve gone to region twice and state once – and we’ve got a strong team this year so I hope we’ll be fortunate enough to go back!

Outside of School Extra-Curricular Activities:

1. 3-Day-Start-Up = I’ve competed for two sessions in a 72-hour, hyper-condensed entrepreneurial start-up program in my city. Here, I’ve won team MVP twice, built a company (elaborated on later), and have made several amazing professional relationships that will definitely help me after college. My business pitches are all online as well.
2. Molecular Pathogens Research = Last summer, I spent 60 hours interning in the oncological ward of a pathogen’s lab. My responsibilities included DNA extraction, biomarker reading, scheduling and interacting with patients, and general solution preparation. I loved being able to work with gifted individuals in the field as well as learn more about the disease affecting my mother (thyroid cancer). 
3. Pre-Clinical Research = The same summer, I spent another 60 hours learning how medicine goes from lab bench to patient bedside. My responsibilities included incubation, in vitro testing, and drug effectiveness testing. This job was especially valuable for me because I worked closely under a PhD who has helped me immensely with proper lab procedure.
4. “Spark Education” = Last summer, I, along with several other friends, built a community organization to teach STEM to underperforming middle school students in the impoverished portions of my community. We contacted over a dozen schools, hosted 10 weekend-long sessions with over 50 kids each time, and saw massive increases in their grades back at school. During the sessions which took place in a local co-working space, we split the groups up into teams, taught them Programming, Web Design, Entrepreneurship, and Robotics, and had them present to their parents. Honestly, getting to see them go from dejected to engaged was the most fulfilling thing you could imagine. At the end of the day, I’d like to say we inspired a new wave of local entrepreneurs and engineers!
5. Start-Up Venture = After the second 3-Day-Start-Up session, I kept in contact with my team and founded a new (yet-to-be-named) company that deals with severe problems affecting the academic publishing community (I’ve had to be vague because of intellectual property contracts). I hold the CFO and co-founder position. We’ve gotten 50,000$ of funding from investors, hired a team of 5 amazing programmers, established a primary market to test our beta, and garnered the attention of many philanthropists. Hey, now I can afford to go to college! Potentially, this project could be huge and I’m excited to see where it takes me. 

Recommendations:

1. I have a humanities teacher and my district superintendent (I’m actually very close with him, so don’t worry, I’m not just “name dropping”) writing my two letters. I know how important these are and I’ve taken careful measure to make sure they are both very personal, intimate recommendations that focus on my as a person and not just a student.

Essays:

1. For my essay, I’ve chosen to write a short, metaphorical piece that relates lessons learned in the gym to lessons learned from real life. Honestly, I felt very passionate about it, especially after my back injury. The way I approach problems and deal with failure all comes from underneath the squat rack. So, I’ve spent months writing as openly and as personally as possible to help convey my voice and be as unique as possible. 

School List:

1. Early Decision = Johns Hopkins University
2. Early Action = Northeastern University, UC San Diego, and UC Berkeley 
3. Regular Decision = MIT, Tufts, Carnegie Mellon, UT, Texas A&amp;M, Rice, and Boston University 

Thank you so much and I truly value each of your opinions and thoughts!

I may have forgotten some things, so I’ll edit and add as needed. Feel free to ask or message me if I forgot something obvious, I know I probably did.

1obtjd,70,2013-10-12,"A 20-year-old knocks up his 35-year-old, birth-control-taking, gainfully employed FWB. Clearly she's a lying succubus after that sweet, sweet child support!",thedictatorscut,openbroke,https://www.reddit.com/r/openbroke/comments/1obtjd/a_20yearold_knocks_up_his_35yearold/,"If you've spent much time at /r/askmen lately, you've probably noticed that said sub has more or less turned into /r/asktheredpill, with a healthy dose of blatantly fake posts designed to illustrate how men are always the victims of lying, cheating, scheming wimmenz. There was the saga of the guy who figured out his wife was cheating on him after catching an episode of Maury about cheating wives, the guy whose girlfriend convinced him to marry her after she cooked him a bunch of Polish food and promised to become the perfect Polish wife, and now [this guy, a 20-year-old college student who got his 35-year-old fuckbuddy pregnant after having sex with her sans-condom](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/1o8tl2/i20m_got_a_former_coworker35f_pregnant_i_dont/). According to OP, this woman is well-off, fully employed, and drives a BMW. She supposedly told him that she was on birth control throughout their relationship, and said that she didn't want kids. So, of course, he decided to have sex without a condom, and now that she's pregnant, none of this is his fault! 

Now, experiences tells me that there's nothing the commentariat of /r/askmen enjoys more than a big jerk over ""men's reproductive rights,"" how women are lying liars who lie, and how child support is literally rape. A story that involves all of the above? GRAB AN UMBRELLA AND HOLD THE FUCK ON, BECAUSE THE WEATHERMAN IS PREDICTING A 100% CHANGE OF MRA JIZZSHOWERS STARTING **RIGHT NOW**.

&gt; Wow. OP you got fucked over hard. She isn't going to get an abortion she wanted to have a baby that's why she lied about the Birth Control. **+106**

&gt;&gt; Exactly. And now she's going to have a Rich Asian Husband. **+21**

&gt;&gt;&gt; Bam. She met you and thought to herself - young man with bright future. Let's bag him with a pregnancy and live the perfect life. She's probably going to pay for the baby now, then once you graduate and get a job she will be looking for the payout. **+20**

Yeah! Nothing more appealing to a lady with lady hormones than getting knocked up via a 20-year-old intern who lives with his parents. Ooh, yeah, gonna get me some of that nectar of the gods, manna from heaven... **motherfuckin' child support, bitches.**

OP, obviously concerned with the tone this thread is taking, asks the important questions:

&gt; I don't have any wealth of my own. Can she get money from my family if I can't pay for child support?

&gt;&gt; Oh, you're paying. Or you're going to jail. **+41**

Cue the jerk-within-a-jerk (ourojerkos?) about how they all totally know a guy who went to jail for not being able to pay child support, therefore child support laws only exist to ruin the lives of unsuspecting fathers and prop up lazy feminazi single moms, because their anecdotal evidence is totally representative of the court system across all fifty states. Christ's sake, guys. By that logic, I could say that no man has ever paid child support because they all ran off to Russia to escape paying the back child support they owed, because that's what my dad did that one time. But that wouldn't make it *universally true* or anything.

Oh, speaking of which, it wouldn't be a child support jerk without that useful suggestion! 

&gt;...he also has the right to leave the country... just saying... OP, get your degree and take a permanent vacation to Europe? **+7**

Oh, and while you're at it, have a redpillian ""I just want a traditional Asian wife, not a slutty slut who sluts!"" jerk, courtesy of OP:

&gt; She has a somewhat new BMW; and lives in a town house by herself. I don't know too much about her finances. I am just terrified right now not just because of the child support. But because this fucks up my chances of ever getting a respectable Asian wife.

And then...

&gt; I want to marry a girl that shares my same culture and values. I'd like my children in the future to know about their heritage and language.

Luckily, a few other commenters laid down the truth with regard to this line of thinking. That said, the entire thread is just a trainwreck. While I have my reasonable doubts with regard to its legitimacy (it seems like half the long story posts on that sub are just pot-stirring bullshit made up to fan the flames of bitter misogynists' Cheeto farts), I'm certainly going to be following its inevitable updates."
1obr1u,2,2013-10-12,I think I hate all my friends because I am more mature than them.,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1obr1u/i_think_i_hate_all_my_friends_because_i_am_more/,"This is going to sound vain and I know Reddit hates overly-confident people, or confidence in general, but I need to write this out because I really can't tell anyone else. In fact, I have no one else to tell because I have lost so many friends.

I like my friends on the surface. But honestly, I feel like I am ages ahead of them in maturity. I'm 21 years old and go to a community college...I'm at home with my parents and am saving for my own car. This description makes me sound like a burnout, but let me further explain what got me here.

The year after I graduated high school, I spent in Europe and lived in Scandinavia as a foreign exchange student. At 18 years old, this alone made me grow up and when I got back nothing was the same. Yes, we had both gone off and done different things, but I was away from America while they were in their freshman dorms able to go home for the holidays, text their parents at free will, etc. But when I got back, my friends actually treated me as an inferior, because I hadn't gone off to a 4-year university...I felt incredibly judged and singled out because of it. I guess it could have been because they couldn't relate or something, I don't know.

Upon coming back, I  went to community college for a year and *then* I went to Disney World, again, on my own for a 7 month internship. With Disney on my resume, a month after coming home, I am now working 2 professional jobs and interning for an NFL team and also work for a blogging site. I will have my Associate's in Arts done by January. I feel pretty accomplished, but I still feel like my friends consider me a burnout.

I have completely lost contact with most of my friends, and when I text them, they don't really ask about me and I carry most of the conversation. They figure that I'm a burnout, when in actuality, I think that our interests are just polar opposites because our lives have just turned out differently. I get along great with older people. I understand their humor and I can continue a decent conversation without fault, whereas my friends treat talking to adults like it's a chore. I don't find my friend's humor funny anymore, and in fact, I find it kind of childish.

No, I didn't go to a 4 year university, but with my life experience I feel like I have taken 2 giant steps ahead of my friends on the maturity scale and I sort of hate it. I have moved into a professional world rather quickly, while they are graduating with their degrees.

I guess I should just say I don't relate to them anymore. And now I'm living at home, working, literally with no friends. I don't like the few people left in my town and I don't connect well enough with my friends anymore to visit them comfortably. I want to go back to Florida for school, but right now I am stuck in a rut, sitting on Reddit, thinking way too hard about shit.

So yes, this came across as bitchy. I'm aware of it. But I hate sitting here knowing that I lost friends over wanting to achieve different goals that did not fit the general hivemind we were fed as high schoolers.

If you read this, thanks for reading. If you've experienced this and have advice, I would love for you to share. If you think I'm a bitch, you're right, and please feel free to tell me that, too. I just won't really care that much because, well, I am a bitch :)"
1ogmtf,15,2013-10-14,Screw this. WTF do employers actually want?,[deleted],Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/1ogmtf/screw_this_wtf_do_employers_actually_want/,"I need to vent, as the title says.  I'm not necessarily looking for advice (although if you have any unique advice or specific pointers they'd certainly be appreciated) but any similar experiences please share, because right now I am more discouraged and angry than I ever thought possible.

I've been turned down for ALL the internships that I interviewed for in the past couple of weeks..  Please read on before making any comments.
I'm a senior accounting major at a top-20 ranked public university.  My GPA is a 3.2 cumulative and just under 3.5 considering just the accounting classes.  

I spent the past year studying for the CMA, I passed Part 1 no problems, currently awaiting results of Part 2 (almost certain I passed).  I am preparing to submit all my paperwork to start sitting for CPA portions next year.  I have the 150 hours as I am prior military (was a marine), and am starting the graduate program in the same university in the spring.

My resume covers ALL of this.  I also tutor the entry-level management accounting class and have done so for more than a year.  I also spent time working at the campus' military service office, helping other vets get their GI Bill stuff set up.

I'm trying to say, I have a lot of experience and good stuff on my resume.

How many undergrads can say they've passed a professional-level cert portion??? I have met none.

I know my GPA is less than perfect.  I know the Big Four are very unlikely to consider me (Crowe dismissed me outright as well).  I'm ok with that.  I interviewed for some big industry players though.  They all turned me down.  One didn't even give me a second interview.  The worst part is, a couple of the interviewers were CMA's!!! And they barely acknowledged that I've passed a portion of the damn thing.

I know you're probably thinking I blew the interview.  I don't think that's the case though.  I made plenty of eye contact, I stayed calm (I very rarely am unnerved), spoke clearly, was on time, polite, thanked them for THEIR time, etc.  I was knowledgeable about the companies as well.

The internal audit internship?  I EVEN ASKED IF THE HEAD OF INTERNAL AUDIT REPORTS TO THE AUDIT COMMITTEE!!! The golden question in considering an employer for internal audit.  Ugh.

So I don't have a 3.8 something GPA, fuck me right?  I'm untouchable?

Anyone else out there ever been this frustrated?

She has said it is okay for me to hang out with our mutual co-worker (we work at the same place) so I am not worried/going behind her back. Just getting this out of the way.

So I have been hanging out with our co-worker/friend and lately I have really opened up to her about things I haven't even told my friends of many years. She and I are very similar in a way so I think that helps. Here comes my question and slight problem:

I like her as a friend, I do not think she likes me anymore than that either. However, I am scared that because of how plain and boring I am with my conversation and constant low energy level that she is only hanging out with me due to sympathy or pity about my girlfriend being gone for so long.

So, r/askseddit, while I am not trying to get tips to seduce and take her home, I would like advice on how to be fun, funny, provocative and someone she would genuinely like to hang out with. Remove all doubt from my mind about it as well.

Thank you!"
1oge7y,2,2013-10-14,[Linear algebra intro-ish] Checking if something is a vectorspace.,The_Big_Bear,learnmath,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnmath/comments/1oge7y/linear_algebra_introish_checking_if_something_is/,"Alright so what if I get the following assignment:

A is some set which is defined as all the elements of something I know is a vectorspace with some condition bounded to them. The summation and scalar product is defined just as it is for the vectorspace in question.

Is it enough to check wheither the summation and product are intern in A to know that it's a vector space? It is on a intuitive level.

Specific example

A= [ vectors of R³, condition blabla ]

Summation and scalar product for A are defined just as for R³.

So let's say I start checking the definition of a vectorspace. Is the summation intern in A?

I find yes.

I go on, next is that it has to be commutative. But I'm not sure how to check that, I know that it is commutative for R³, so is that argument enough for that?

What I'm trying to say is that intuitive I feel that the extra added property could only be a problem for it being intern in A, I know that all the other properties of R³ are fine. 

So am I correct?"

Between my internship hours and my hellish class schedule, I barely have time to eat and think anymore.  I know I've been especially on edge as of late due to the first wave of midterms, and I'm so sorry if I've made you upset by snapping at you for the smallest things because of that.  Our long distance relationship has been hard on us before, but it's really hitting me hard this semester.

To be completely honest, I feel like I've been losing myself to classwork, and because of that I feel like we're slipping away from each other.  I feel like I'm not doing my job as a boyfriend, and I hate myself for it.  I haven't been supportive enough of your athletic career, nor have I been supportive enough of your graduate school endeavors.  Even though you tell me that it's okay for me to focus on myself and the pressing issues at hand, I feel that I cannot continue to go on working my hands to the floor like this.  You are an intrinsic part of my everyday life, and because of that, I need to be better for you.

I know over the last 4 and a half years our relationship ebbed and flowed a bit, and I know that it will become much harder over the next three years when you're going to be at graduate school, but I need you to know that I'll be along for the ride right there with you.  I'll find a career wherever you end up going to school.  I'll move out to Texas if need be.  If you end up having to pay in full for graduate school, we can pay off your loans together.  I'll be there for you every step of the way.

You mean everything to me... and I'm a fool for ever taking you for granted.  I love you so much."
1ofwu4,4,2013-10-14,The Narrows,[deleted],batman,https://www.reddit.com/r/batman/comments/1ofwu4/the_narrows/,"Hey guys, here is a story that I had to write for school. I thought you guys appreciate it. It's about the famous crime-fighting duo of James Gordon and Harvey Bullock, set around Year One time.


The Narrows


“If, on a winter’s night a traveller were to walk through these streets he’d go by unnoticed.” The Cashier snarled at us, baring his yellowed teeth.

“If you see this man please let us know.” Harvey replied and placed the wrinkled photograph on the counter. We flinched as we stepped out into the snowy streets that made up the Narrows. How could a man so infamous simply walk out of a lunatic asylum into the night? Who helped him escape? These questions were branded onto my mind while we scurried back to our car, like all the rats who call this place home. The familiar scent of day-old scotch clung to the walls. Harvey was silent on the way back to the precinct; he was always troubled by unfinished jobs. The road above us was illuminated by our Chevy; we were still as blind as the bats that roam this city unchecked. Thump. Harvey swung the wheel as we skidded across the ice; the rats ran to their holes. I grabbed my Magnum as the door clunked open. The cool air shattered my breath. There was a dent on the roof of the car, something, or someone had crushed it. There was no sign of anybody nearby.
 
“James, you can’t seriously think it’s him? We don’t have time to indulge your little obsessions, there’s a lunatic on the loose.” Harvey spoke calmly, but I could see his eyes twitching, searching for some evidence, something to let us know we were safe. The Chevy was warm and comforting, but I still couldn’t get the feeling that we were being watched out of my head. The adrenaline was wearing off by the time we reached the bridge. As we left the Narrows everything seemed brighter, even though the night was late. The thick orange glow flickered through the cables; I was going home to Barbara and my unborn child. I smiled, I could almost smell the biscuits warming in the oven, that scent of cinnamon all throughout the house, that perfume I got Barbara that she insists on wearing despite the fact that I know she despises it.

The Chevy sputtered into a space outside the police department, Harvey wished me a merry Christmas and left for home, we both know where he is really going. The doors were glistening with condensation as I pushed them open. The silence of the road was extinguished by the bustle of the building. Some men were putting up tinsel and decorations across the walls; I was greeted by the intern Dent. “Barry from Forensics says that there was no sign of forced entry or exit in the cell.”

That news does not make this job any easier. “Tell Barry I’ll speak with him tomorrow, I just have a couple of things to sort out tonight. Oh I forgot; how is Law School going?” I replied in the most cheerful voice I could muster. 
“Everything is going fine Detective!” the boy replied. Dent was filled with so much optimism, he always wanted to be a solicitor, guess that means he won’t be out there freezing his fingers off and living drunk like Harvey. At least this world has a little hope. I’m damned to hell anyway. My office was small and dark, covered in boards and newspaper cuttings. Harvey would tease me for them; they weren’t my cases, just my ‘obsession’. The cork was pierced by pins holding all the sightings of bats in this city. I was always intrigued by the Chiropteran order, now they had come to my city.

An hour later I climbed the cracked black steps to my home, awaiting the warming biscuits. The fragrant cinnamon. My family. All separate memories crossing at this one moment. Victor from next door asked me whether we’d caught the madman yet. I dreamed of bats that night.

1ofsqq,4,2013-10-14,Entry Level Software Engineer: Will I get stuck in Test? Does company size matter?,sw_career,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1ofsqq/entry_level_software_engineer_will_i_get_stuck_in/,"I'm a soon-to-be grad (BS) from a good school currently looking for jobs as a Software Engineer. I've had several dev and testing related internships, but they've all been at smaller companies.
So far the job search prospects are good and I'm currently in talks with a couple of companies.

One of the big software companies, the one I'm most excited about, is going to offer me a new-grad position in software engineering; now I must choose a location and a focus. The choices are embedded/os in Silicon Valley or automation/test in Georgia. This is problematic because I know I don't want to do test and I actually really want to do embedded/os. Unfortunately, I don't want to move to Silicon Valley due to high cost of living and various reasons for wanting to stay closer to where I currently study. Things I am trying to consider:

Will taking a testing position as my first job keep me stuck in testing, even if both titles are as a Software Engineer?

* I am told big companies encourage internal movement; would this be testing --&gt; testing or could this be testing --&gt; dev?
* If I were to take a development position at a smaller company, would it look as good as testing at the larger one?
* I'm told a lot of entry level devs end up doing testing for the first year, how different will testing and dev positions be early on?

How good for my career is a well-known large company vs a small company?

* How much difference in impact on a later job search will similar positions at a large and small company have?
* Would the position in Silicon Valley be worth the ~50% increase of cost of living with only a ~10-20% increase in pay?

Overall, I don't want to hurt my career right at its beginning, so the most specific questions I have here are:

* Will taking a testing over a dev position as my first job be detrimental to a career as a Software Engineer?
* Is large company testing &gt; small company dev for someone who wants to end up in dev?
* How much better is large company dev than small company dev for a career?
* Should I suck it up and not allow location to play any role in my decision? Is Silicon Valley a clear best option here?

Thanks for any advice!"

As I have been programming for a while (got interested in programming in middle school and it has evolved through HS) I am hoping/thinking it might not be impossible to get an internship for the summer of 2014.

I haven't done any big projects which can impress a recruiter, as I have focused on learning a lot of various technologies – also partly because of school work and depression. (Jack of all trades).  
I have tried to focus my résumé on being passionate about Computer Science, having a broad skill set as well as being willing to dig deep into a single area.

As far as jobs goes, I haven't had much. I've worked in a library in middle school, and as related jobs goes I had a 4 week internship while in HS.  
I've done a little freelancing for small communities (while in HS), but I don't know if that's worth mentioning as it's been pretty barebones HTML-websites with a simple PHP CMS as a backend.

Basically I don't have any jobs/projects where I can burst of my ""incredible"" conversion rates or how I have helped companies save millions of dollars. (But I am only a freshman after all).

I'm thinking of adding a link to my Twitter profile as well as removing 1–2 entries from the ""Experience""-section.  
Probably also change the ""Skills""-section. I know I'm not an ""Expert"" in any of these languages, but which level am I at? Basic, Intermediate, Proficient?

I am an International student who completed his High School from India &amp; is in Sheridan College right now &amp; will complete his 3 year diploma in Computer Systems Technology this year.

Well, as the question says, my academics have not been that great though I still try to keep my score around 70%. Moreover, my high school scores are not that great either. 

Well, for an international student, I think a diploma is not enough to get a well paid job even though at the same time I think that if one has skills, he can get a job he likes. I am good at the stuff I do &amp; been even appreciated for my efforts when I did my internship. Furthermore, I intend to get a Degree in Computer Science &amp; I would love to get into either UofT or UofW as they are well known their computer science program (though I will keep my options open).

Some of my friends have told me, that I can get into a University by completing the high school requirements from here (like taking courses from Virtual High School). Is it true?

Though I still have time for getting into University as I intend to get a residency here first, then join a University. But still I want to get an idea of 'how' will I get into a University if I have an average academic background."

But I know she doesn't want to break up...this is just her nature. She's always been closed off, but never to this degree.

I'll give her credit in that we are busy students with our own separate internships which keeps our schedules tough, but it's not like we're overly busy to the point where we can't afford **any** time.

EDIT: A few extra details when I think of them

1oen02,0,2013-10-14,Houston and Lua,ahuser,WildStar,https://www.reddit.com/r/WildStar/comments/1oen02/houston_and_lua/,"So, i'm a junior in computer science and i haven't really taken on many self coding projects like many of my peers and these are very important when applying for internships. I've been looking for something that would really catch my attention so i could make it something great instead of something mediocre. 

What i would love to do is start messing around with Lua and Houston until i'm comfortable and then spend about 2-3 months of free time creating an addon of sorts. I'm not worried about it already existing, or even a better version of it being out there somewhere. I just want a project i can work on, that will have some use somewhere in game. But i have not quite reached the stage where im ready to take suggestions or ideas. I am pretty comfortable with most of the lower level languages you are taught in college but i have not yet done any scripting. I was wondering if anyone knows a good place to find some tutorials on Lua, where some good information about the Wildstar API that is provided in Houston may be etc etc. I would be more than willing to accept help from anyone to learn, and if i can get up to speed in Lua it would be even cooler to work with some other people in coding! Especially since i'm concentrating in Game Development!

PS to Carbine - I am disappointed beyond words that you do not have an internship program. I went to your website today to check it out and found a nice one liner saying ""We do not have an internship program "" :(

tl;dr: Need a place to learn Lua. Would be awesome if someone would help me learn or learn with me and could work on future projects for Wildstar together. Also any information on the Wildstar API since i cant find much.

Thanks for any help!"
1oeck3,7,2013-10-13,1 1/2 years since my last post and things are going well,YTT1,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1oeck3/1_12_years_since_my_last_post_and_things_are/,"[Nearly 1 1/2 years ago I last used this throwaway to just write down why everything was going shit at the moment.](http://www.reddit.com/r/sad/comments/x5orb/everything_i_do_is_failing_at_the_moment/)

After that, things didn't get much better. Rather worse. I dropped out of university last summer and didn't know what to do afterwards. My parents were supportive, but since they didn't know what I wanted to do ( neither did I), I am pretty sure they felt helpless themselves. The next 6 months, I was just sitting at home playing videogames and going to sportstraining. Family matters got worse and worse. It got to the point where I was in my room for weeks without contact other than my internet friends. At that point I don't know what sparked my interest into becoming a teacher, but after talking with previous high school classmate who is going down that path and getting an internship at my local school, the deal was sealed for me and I had decided for myself. But it was mid December now and the next start for university courses was next Octobre. I applied for low-end part time jobs just to make my family a bit happier that I am still doing things with my life. The job was at a car rental return at an airport. I did my job and I did it okish. But I hated it. I felt so bad for people who had to pay thousands because of scratches and dents I and my coworers had to find on cars. I got more and more depressed again about my whole situation and the job, but didn't want to quit since my parents where happy about me finding something to do and accomplishing things. I took a 2 week break. I was considering quitting and was about to get into the circle of self-loathing as previous again, but somehow I didn't. I got back from the break, did my job to the best I could ( even though I still hated it), was happy and just probably a way nicer person than before and got recognised by the bosses. I got promoted into a special division for premium customers and so forth. I always had problems with establishing relationships with people because of being extremely shy and awkward, but in the break I realized that noone knew me at work and I could be who I always wanted to be or who I always was, but never could act on it, because I was put down by ""friends"" for behaving so different. Coworkers liked me, Bosses gave me quite big on the side bonuses. It was a decent time to be honest. I was popular for the first time in my life and that just by being myself. I never dreamt of something like that happening. I had a few people, who wanted my number just so we could hang out some time. This must sound so silly, but that was one of the greatest experiences in my life. But before I went to university once again, I wanted to broaden my english language skills and my just cultural knowledge, so I applied as an Au pair in England. Directly the first family accepted and a month later after quitting work and hearing the phrase ""We will miss you here at work"" quite often I was off to Colchester. Not much I can say about the time there since I was mostly occupied with the children, but it was great overall. Next interesting thing was back in Germany. The introductory phase for upcoming teacher. I attended with one of my coworkers from work also starting that semester. I talked to people, but was falling back into my old persona being shy and reserved. I went home nearly crying on the train, because I felt ashamed of myself and throwing everything I worked for down the drain. I have no clue how I cope with these things, but the next morning I was back to my ""new"" me. I found  one bloke studying the same thing hitting it right off and just became good friends with him. Over the next 2 days we somehow got pretty popular and liked, because we were there for everything. I even met a girl at a silly game and we had a crazy few days after only to find out that we were not made for each other, but that would not happened before in my life. People again were just asking for my number or facebook. Now it is 2 weeks after this event. 3 hours before I should get up to go to my ""first"" day of university again. But I could not be more happy and more excited and at the same time nervous about what to come, it can only go upwards looking at the progress I made over the last 6 months. For the first time in my life, I feel good about myself. I know where I want to go, but I want my path there be as crazy and fun as it can be. I now know who I am. See you again Reddit and thank you in some bad times with your fun and wit."

Can you tell me about the transition from learning accounting theory in school to applying this knowledge on the job? How much do you expect us to know when first starting (I know they will say ""nothing"", but it should lead to decent conversation)

Whats the most difficult part of transitioning from associate level positions to manager and partner levels?

Looking back, is there anything you learned during your time working at X that you wish you knew when you were a student?

What are some of the traits that successful interns have had in the past?

Looking back, is there anything you would have done differently in your career?

What kind of specific tasks are Summer Interns typically assigned? I know that my knowledge will be limited when starting my internship.

How do you manage your tasks and time when working on multiple client engagements?




Ideally I'd want these all to lead to conversation or have some non-work related conversation come up beforehand, but I don't want to ask ""What do you like to do in your spare time"", or ""why this firm"" at the end of an interview.

I rationalize this by the fact that UTD seems to be a good school for STEM type majors and the computer science department is better than my other choice. I also rationalize this by a possible pipe dream, and I'm wondering if I'm deluding myself. As many CS people point out all the time, don't be lazy, do projects and internships in order to get experience. Part of my rationalization of such a long commute is that the lion's share of internship jobs are over in that area regardless. I might find myself headed in that direction despite going to a college that's closer to where I live.

What I don't understand is how internships typically play out in software development side of CSE. Are most of them in the summer? Are a lot of students working part time internships while going to school? If that situation is the case, when and what days? I'm just wondering in general because I'm sure all these things depend on the job and the student.

In my deluded mind I'd like to see my self smoothly coasting into the UTD parking lot after a considerable drive, finding a parking spot without issue, and making it to class with time to spare. Then I see myself progressing through a sensible class schedule that leaves enough time for a part time internship. 

Trying to project more realistically into the future, I see myself punching the steering wheel after 20 minutes of driving around in the parking lot. Slowly traversing a schedule that takes up the whole day, and thus leaving no time for a part time job or internship. That would bother me, if I could find an internship in the first place. Despite not working, barely keeping up with course work and finding it hard to even commit to a personal project.
 
Speaking of course work, if I do transfer to UTD a lot of the classes that served a specific purpose for the other school and serve no purpose for UTD, end up taking up free elective spots. On top of that I'm pretty much done with humanities classes leaving me with math, physics, and a lot of CS courses to take. How likely would someone taking 15-17 hours of those type of classes be also working a part time job?

You're probably wondering why I don't just move. Well, I'm a 30-year-old non-traditional student with a house, so moving can be complicated."

1. Me. The business guy. I've been writing business plans and attempting to bootstrap projects for two years now. I'm very familiar with the initial licensing, validation, marketing, branding, seeking funding aspects.

2. The fraternity brother who I initially had the idea with. This man knows his way around fraternities (as do I). A social powerhouse and moderately business-savvy.

3. Our fraternity brother who is a web development genius. 

Together, we make a great team. Two CEO's and a CTO. 

Here's the problem. There's just so much to code that we won't make it in time for my proposed launch (for our first private beta). **We need to speed up the coding process.**


Options:

1. **I want to hire another coder.**

 I could work my ass off and pay them $10/hour. That would break the bank though and I'd probably sell some shit too. I do have a job though and I **could** do this. I don't think anyone would take $10/hour though. 


 ____________________________________________________________________________________
 
2. **We could ""hire"" another coder and give them equity.**

 I am against a 4 way split, we're already 33%, 33%, 33%. And I know how dumb it sounds to say you're going to give a coder 5%. I'm not sure what to do here.


 ____________________________________________________________________________________

3. **Outsourcing**

 I agree with our developer that this isn't worth it. He mentions that he would have to babysit and double-check their code and he doesn't feel comfortable with it. Same here.

I will be graduating this December with what I would consider a slightly above average Resume.

However I am looking for positions on the coast (Seattle / SF / etc), and am having trouble getting callbacks; even from the likes of Amazon/MS/etc.

Last week MS did on site interviews at my school and I was not granted one; two friends of mine (one with a lower gpa and zero internship experience) got interviews, and both commented on how I would do very well on them (I routinely do algo type stuff for fun, be it project euler, topcoder, etc.). But I can't do well on the interview if I am looked over on even the most basic phone screens. I was also rejected from Amazon for even a phone interview.

I honestly don't understand what I am doing wrong. Like many students I have hoped to work at one of these companies, and not even being given the chance (aka an interview) is very confusing and exhausting to me.


Does anyone have any advice? Besides the large companies I have been quasi randomly applying to other well known and Dice search companies and have not been getting any responses. 

Thanks all

I have a degree in mathematics and physics and I am 2 french courses away from a degree in computer science (I did all 3 majors concurrently). I'm beginning to believe that my education is next to useless in getting a job in CS. I have no work experience (internship was optional and I didn't realize how important it was). I've been looking for a job for about a month now. It's literally reached the point where I've applied to all the jobs that I'm even remotely qualified for on various job sites (stuff in the 0-2 years work experience range) and heard nothing back. I only feel confident in java since that's the language my CS courses utilized. I am confident in my ability to pick up other languages since I've dabbled in other things and not had any problems.

Having seen the popularity of [this comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1ogl75/should_i_negotiate_a_higher_starting_salary_with/ccrvc75) in the [Should I Negotiate with Google](http://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1ogl75/should_i_negotiate_a_higher_starting_salary_with/) thread
I thought it might be worthwhile for us to have an informal survey here in CSCQ
to get a better idea of what we should *really* expect when interviewing and
negotiating.

In the interest of making it at least semi-structured, I propose something like
the following format:

* Target School: Yes/No
* Level of Education: %w{Bachelor Master Doctorate}
* Major/Concentration: 
* Number of Internships: For the privacy conscious
* OPT: Interned At:
* Significant Personal Projects: Yes/No

and then for each offer on hand:

* Company: $name
* Location: 
* Position Title: e.g. SDE, PM, SWEII
* Salary: 
* Signing Bonus:
    * Caveats or Obligations: 
* Equity or Stock Grant:
    * Vesting Period/Earn Out:

To save you reformatting the above, here's the raw markdown:

    * Target School: Yes/No
    * Level of Education: %w{Bachelor Master Doctorate}
    * Major/Concentration: 
    * Number of Internships: For the privacy conscious
    * OPT: Interned At:

# EDIT/UPDATES

Glad to see such a large, positive response! To clarify a few things:

* **Target School**: I'd consider a Target for CS somewhere the top tier companies and VC firms recruit, e.g. UWaterloo, MIT, CMU, UW, Caltech, Oxbridge, Edinburgh. Essentially, be near the top for at least one computing discipline.

Additionally, some people have suggested adding:

* **Application Method**: How you applied to the company. Was it via on-campus recruiting, a career fair, internal referral, their careers page, etc...

* **Application Process**: Something as simple as a date range, e.g. `Applied: 9/25, Offered: 10/12` or a detailed explanation of the interview process. Whatever you feel works best!"

This last week she says she's been thinking about what she wants in someone she wants to spend a long time with.   

The thing is the distance has made her see that there are some things that aren't there in our relationship as much as she wants, and she feels like she's starting to push away. She says she doesn't feel that drive with us as much anymore, and to be honest it's tearing me apart.  

The part that is the worst is that she's always felt that she doesn't see us working in the long run, and it's not changing. It may have disappeared in the background, but with the space it has become more clear. Some of the things that attribute to that are our difference in religion, and our difference in maturity.  

She is a devote Christian, and I am still in the process of finding God's love, and I think it's one of the things distancing our relationship. On top of that, she feels that I've learned a lot more in our relationship that she has, which to her didn't feel all that even or equal.  

These last few days, I haven't slept a whole lot, but I have gotten closer to God. I guess at this point, I'm putting a lot of trust into something I am still learning about. But I also don't know what to do. I feel so hurt and lost. I've opened so much about myself, and I'm just scared that it was for not a whole lot.

I graduated from university in may and I've been looking for an entry level job relating to biochemistry for about sixth months now with no luck. Part of the problem is that I'm only applying to positions located out of state as I am trying to relocate to a warmer climate. Even still I've applied to over a thousand positions yet I've received only one real interview and zero offers. I have a bachelor of science degree with a major in biochemistry. My grades are absolutely terrible due to me being horrible at rote memorization. I have no professional experience, no internships, and no volunteer work. I really don't want the waste the money needed to get an unpaid internship or volunteer either (it costs money to buy a car and pay for gas/insurance not to mention the opportunity costs). I'm using a functional resume, It can't really get any better given what I'm working with. I have no references and I am not close with any of my professors or really any faculty at my old university nor am I willing to suffer the embarrassment of using my friends or family as references. I've spoken with various people from my universities career center and they have been completely useless. I have no 'network'. This in particular is a major problem as pretty much every recruitment company I've come across has turned me away due to lack of references. These companies seem to be the gatekeepers of entry level science jobs and it is incredibly difficult to find an entry level science positions offered directly by an employer. I'm not especially personable. I hate speaking in general and generally come across as rude even though I never try to be (I've been told my entire life I have an attitude problem, it's not something I can just change). I don't really have any passion for anything, nor am I particularly interested in any specific job. To be honest I don't really even care for life in general (I'm not suicidal or depressed, just apathetic). Due to my personality I don't really want any job that deals with people extensively. As far as I can tell I just don't think like most people do (I don't have a huge ego or think I'm a 'unique snowflake' or anything I've just sort of thought and acted differently from most people my whole life). I also have a very hard time lying and a low tolerance for bullshit so I can't really fake a more desirable personality during an interview or phone call. I'm really not interested in a job outside of a science related field either. I'm aware of how difficult it will be to find a job in my position and that I'm being picky. I don't need anyone to tell me how fucked or that I'm not alone.

Yes, I know, it is a pre-built, but don't be quick to judge brethren, I was simply too busy with my internship and a full class schedule, and unfortunately had no time to order parts and put the tower together myself. I have built many computers before, but this one was needed in a quick and timely fashion.

Core Specs:

CPU: i7-3770K Quadcore @ 3.50 GHz

HD: 1TB SATA-III 6.0Gb/s 32MB Cache 7200RPM

SSD: SanDisk 128gb SSD

GPU: EVGA GTX 670 SuperClock edition 4GB VRAM

RAM: 16gb DDR3

Standard liquid cooling system, a few fans here and there, etc.

Happy Birthday to my Peasant Annihilator, may she devour the souls of console peasants for many years to come.

1oh7vx,224,2013-10-14,Should I go back to school for computer science as a 38 year old?,Bald_and_beautiful,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1oh7vx/should_i_go_back_to_school_for_computer_science/,"Using a throwaway since my manager knows my username.

I work at a small tech company as a process engineer. During our first couple of years, I saw the need for a way to record our data and created a data driven intranet app (asp.net/VB.net) where we could record our process data and maintenance records, it processed text files and inserted that into a SQL database. This worked pretty well but it wasn't the job I was hired for and the faults started to show through. Eventually we just needed to hire someone to build an application to replace mine and they chose of all fucking things MS access. In a bit of schadenfreude, it runs slow as shit and I laugh at it every time I see them trying to use it.

Anyways, I LOVED the programming I was doing. I loved writing the code and debugging it or trying to figure out how to turn a real world problem into code. You could spend a day or two on a problem but with perseverance and enough research, you could figure it out and it felt so good. It was like every day was a new victory. It felt so great to make something that would save someone in the company time and that they would use.

So now, I work in another part of the company and I've been trying to find things to automate with code but there is only so much that needs to be done and my manager would rather pay a professional to get it done quickly than to pay me to sit at my desk and learn programming. The big problem is I'm not happy. I don't really like or enjoy my job as it is now. 

My goals would be to help small companies develop data driven apps similar to what I did at my company or perhaps develop mobile apps. I'm not the only fish in the pond. Does every Tom, Dick and Harry who knows how to code also want to do that too? It seems like it could be a tough market. I'm sure I'd probably enjoy lots of other jobs but those are at the top of my mind. 

I don't think I would want to work at a large firm doing a small part of a job but I have no idea what a programmer at a large company actually does. How much is actually enjoyable work?

With those goals in mind I'm trying to make the decision to either:

* Stay at my job and learn to program as much as I can by myself. Pick up side jobs to get more work and practice. What else would be a good way to proceed here? I feel like the weakness here is that I wouldn't learn the *best* way to program a given problem. 

* Keep working while I go to community college and learn some programming. I do well with formal training/education so I think I would do well with this option but what to learn. Definitely a database class I think. 

* Quit my job and go back to school full time? I live near a large public university where I went to undergrad. My wife is in her final year of her Ph.D. program and will do an internship next year. This could be tough financially but could be done. Would it be worth it with those goals in mind? I'm certainly open to doing something else other than what I've listed above but I don't really want to help write the next version of metro UI unless it was to sabotage it. I would probably have to take out some loans to do this for the first couple of years.

Am I crazy?"

1ogyjq,9,2013-10-14,Mid-20s looking for a change of pace,20sneedsadvice,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1ogyjq/mid20s_looking_for_a_change_of_pace/,"I am currently in my mid-20s living in a metropolitan area on the east coast. I make decent money as a consulting engineer (in the construction field) and really enjoy what I do. I have been at my current firm since I was an intern during college. We are a very small operation and have been doing very well during the three years that I've been here. In fact, we have grown more than 200% since I've been working with the company and at this rate, I have no doubt that we will continue to do so.

I am a generally adventurous person and enjoy traveling and experiencing new things. I have been in my current city for about 8 years and I am at a point in my life where I am eager to move forward and try a change of pace with my life, and I think my current situation allows me to do so.

My question really is this: How advisable is it that I leave my current job to find something else? 

My current plan is this: My lease for my apartment will end at the end of January. From now until then, I will continuously look for new job prospects (this is the step that I currently am on) while also try to save as much money as I can. I have no real destination set in mind, but I am very much looking for another metropolitan area, whether it be in the US or elsewhere.

My PF situation is as follows: I am currently single. I have no more loans of ANY type (hurrah!), no other financial burdens and have about $10k in my bank accounts. I drive an older reliable car that I maintain relatively well and that I think will last me just about forever. I live very simply and do not need many things. Fortunately for me, I am currently still under my parents' health insurance (thank you ACA) for another year.

For the most part, I think this question is PF related, but if not, if anyone could provide me another related subreddit that would be very much appreciated.

All in all, what do you think? Any advice, good, bad or ugly is appreciated. I'd like to hear the truth, and perhaps anecdotes (and even just general comments), and what I really should expect.

Thanks for your time, PF.

EDIT: I've taken out my option of heading out before I have a solid plan nailed down. I realize how unreasonable that is and perhaps my wanderlust was what was driving me in that direction. Regardless, I'd like the advice and criticism to continue whilst ignoring that option. "

1ogvp3,0,2013-10-14,Need help/advice on my career path. It is a little complicated but having an engineering degree should help right?,career123,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1ogvp3/need_helpadvice_on_my_career_path_it_is_a_little/,"I recently got some news that I would either lose my job entirely or would take a drastic pay cut so I am looking for a way out of my current position.

I have never had a traditional job. While i was in school i worked at a lot of bars. First as a bouncer, then bartender and by my senior year i was a Co-manager. The place i was working at got bought out by a local business man and i became the sole manager. As my senior year progressed they offered me enough money to stay and not pursue my engineering career. 

I graduated (from a decent school) with a 2.4 gpa (great test scores/terrible HW). I didnt apply for any other jobs before graduating. I had one 20 day internship in China but apart from that didnt do a whole lot.

So in the 2 years i have been the manager i have worked my ass off. I turned a failing business into a multi-million dollar a year business. I personally redesigned the interior (sketch up) and proceeded to build everything inside myself (literally one person). I remodeled/renovated a couple houses growing up and worked as a farmhand for about 8 years so everything was done quite well since i have some skills. As we grew we added more locations, I personally once again redesigned the interiors (using sketch up again) and completely gutted and remodeled 2 more locations.

I am currently the manager of 2 bars (capacity of 150 and 175), 1 bar/restaurant (capacity 400), a restaurant and i drew up the floor plan and design for another restaurant. Every business is self sustaining. I deal with approximately 50 different vendors, i have about 60 employees and 4 managers underneath me.

I currently make about 60-80k a year depending on business/bonuses and work anywhere from 0 to 100 hours a week (average about 20 hrs a week). I set up everything to be automated or par-systems to free up time when i was remodeling other locations so currently i work 12 hrs a week.

So what is the problem?

(ready yourself for a rant) The owners of the business made some bad decisions and had some shady dealings (all against my recommendations). They've squandered the massive amounts of money i made them and currently have to take out loans to pay employees. Instead of reinvesting in their businesses, like i did for them the first year, they've decided to live like rock stars while i watch the empire i created crumble. The whole thing should be collapsing by about December, if my math is right, and because of all the debt they racked up in the last 2 months i highly doubt there will be any saving it.

So my questions:

1) How do I apply any of my experience to an engineering career?
2) What should i call my current position on my resume? (ive never even had a resume)
3) I have a bachelors in civil engineering so what type of jobs should i apply for since i have zero technical design experience?
4) Do i say i ran a multi-million dollar a year business on my resume?
5) I probably will be leaving on bad terms since without me their business WILL collapse. So do i use them as a reference? or who do i use?
6) where should i be looking for jobs? websites? certain cities?
7) Am i going to have to take a large pay cut?
8) Im 24, does my age play any factor?

Im just generally lost and need some advice on places to start this process of getting a new job.

If you have any questions please feel free to ask. "
1olw6s,3,2013-10-16,Any advice for a CS student with limited keyboard capacity due to chronic illness? (xpost),DIE__BART__DIE,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/1olw6s/any_advice_for_a_cs_student_with_limited_keyboard/,"I'm a 23 year old man currently doing an MSc in CS.  I love computer
engineering, and maths and science in general. But, a serious problem
limiting my ability to work at the keyboard is making me very unsure about my
future in the work force. I hope you guys might have some input.

My problem is that coding is becoming increasingly difficult because of a
chronic pain condition. I've been suffering from this illness, which primarily
affects my hands and arms, from before I started my studies, but I've always
assumed that I would find some working treatment and get somewhat better --
and that I eventually would be able to take up a coding-heavy job. Now, on the
contrary, my problems have actually become worse over the last years, and I'm
currently very restricted in my capacity at the keyboard.

At this point, I'm deliberating whether to continue my MSc (assuming that it
is possibly), or whether I should switch my interest to some other field where
I could use my interest/skills in maths and computing without day-long
keyboard hacking.

That said, I still want to investigate a bit more what my career options would
be, assuming that I did finish my CS MSc, and that my condition did not
improve. I really do not know much about how the industry works, and what the
work days look like ...and I don't want to jump ship before I'm 100% sure it's
the best decision. As one step to figure out more, I'm asking you guys/gals:
**Do you know about any interesting career options for a talented computer
engineer with very low capacity for keyboard-smashing?**

One thing I've been pondering about is QA work. It appears to me that QA work
may involve a bit less heavy-duty programming, and more reading, verification,
and review than a typical programming gig.
    

**NOTES**

* One obvious suggestion is teaching. Teaching could probably be quite OK, but
  I really want to get some experience in the industry as well.

* Tips for treatment options / etc. are of course welcome. Note, though, that
  I'm already seeing some very good doctors, and do get quite good help with
  managing my pain condition.

* I can actually produce text using dictation software (the excellent
  Dragon NaturallySpeaking), so standard writing is generally not a problem.
  I have, however, not found dictation suitable for coding. (Though, it is a
  solution for many, and I could look more into it.)

* Beggars can't be choosers, but just to mention: I'm not that interested in
  the corporate/sales side of the business; I would strongly prefer to focus
  largely on the engineering side of things. My primary interests in CS lays
  in algorithms, security, and architecture.

* For what it's worth: i) I have very strong grades (top-3%), and have
  relevant development and research experience from high-profile internships.
  ii) I have, as of yet, no critical problems with my personal finances."

1ollek,2,2013-10-16,How my 3rd dui saved my life,syounit,stopdrinking,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1ollek/how_my_3rd_dui_saved_my_life/,"    I am 26 years old, and I have been drinking for 13 years on and off. I could always drink more than everybody else and I didn't really care to know why until I got my 2nd DUI in 2007. After that I was forced into recovery programs that I didn't want to be in. I met some incredible people, but i already knew that my drinking wasn't over yet at that point, bc thats what i had in my head. This is also the time I lived in a halfway house and met my friend Ali who was charged with a DUI homicide (her passenger who was an alcoholic passed). She helped me out so much back in 2007 and within the first week I knew I was going to be friends with her for the rest of my life. 

    After I got out of jail she was sentenced and went away for awhile. For the next 6 and a half years I took drinking head on and went through a journey that showed me why I am an alcoholic. I can't even tell you how many times I tried to quit drinking by myself over that time period, but it was so many times. I met my current GF back in 2009 and told her right away that I had a serious alcohol problem, and she said we can figure it out. Most of my attempts to stop have been while I have been with her. I've also learned that you cannot stay sober for somebody else. It sounds stupid but it just doesn't work, your alcoholism will convince you that the person you love is trying to ruin your life. Its disgusting. I put that girl through a world of pain with my alcoholism (emotional and mental pain, not physical). She drinks sometimes, and we have drank together, but I always take it to the next level. I always end up ""transforming into the monster"" as she calls me. We enjoyed drinking together at first, but as time passed, she began to hate me when i drank, and eventually she just wouldn't drink anymore because she didn't want to encourage my drinking, but that wouldn't stop me. I got so drunk on new years of 2011 that when we came home that night and got into a fight, i went to the kitchen and grabbed a knife, and handed it over to her and said, ""why don't you go ahead and kill yourself because nobody cares about you, not me, not your parents, not anyone."" She was incredibly upset the next day and I didn't know why until she told me, I didn't have any recollection of that happening and I still do not. 

    This is the point where I started to fear my drinking, or I should say fear myself when I drank. Was I becoming dangerous or was I just completely selling my soul to alcohol? This is the time that I started to experience longer and heightened periods of anxiety and depression after drinking. By this time I stopped going to see my friend Ali and had surrounded myself by people who were alcoholics, but had worse situations than myself, which allowed me to justify my own drinking. 

    I took care of my grandfather during this time because he was starting to have problems staying home alone at home and what not. My drinking still came first, but I did my best to take care of my papa, but even in his last days of being able to talk clearly, he still told me that my alcoholism was bad. He told me that he was happy my grandma died when she did back in 2005, because if she saw me today, it would kill her, because I was her favorite grandson with so much potential, and I was throwing it all away with alcohol. Eventually he needed more care than I could provide.

    I had been struggling with school because of my alcoholism, and it had almost cost me my relationship countless times. The one thing I can say though is that I have never cheated on my gf while intoxicated, or ever, i have never wanted to bc i knew what it took for her to put up with my shit. My family has helped me out through my troubled times, and have hoped for me to figure out my own plan for sobriety, but it hasn't happened up until recently. I went to detox after begging my dad to send me there because it came to a point that I physically couldn't stop drinking otherwise I would withdrawal. After I went through detox I kept myself sober by not drinking at all. That lasted for about 5 months until I decided to drink again. I didn't go to meetings or anything and told myself that all it took was my willpower. Eventually I gave into the screaming voice in my head to drink again. I remember that drink too, it was a Pacifico on tap with a lime at the Planet Hollywood Casino in Vegas. As I drank the beer, I remember how satisfied I felt to finally soothe that voice and how defeated and helpless I felt at the same time.

    As it had before after my periods of brief sobriety, my drinking picked up right where it left off. I tried to control myself as much as I could, my girlfriend and I even had a few times drinking together where we got along, this had not happened in years. This reinforced the thought that I was in complete control and that I was finally a normal drinker again, but sadly I was only fooling myself. For all the times I kept myself reserved around my girlfriend while drinking, I just hit it that much harder when she wasn't around. I began to lie again, hide my drinking, and fall into an endless pit of anxiety and depression. In the weeks leading up to my DUI, I finally saw my alcoholism for what it was. I wasn't able to function normally before that, but I had finally progressed to the point where I was able to maintain going to school, excelling at my internship, and maintain a normal sleeping schedule. 

    I had become a fully functional alcoholic and my sickness was exponentially degrading me as a human being, finally taking the bigger piece of myself away from me and leaving me more and more empty everyday. Relief finally came when I received my DUI. Finally I am forced to stay sober by having a monitoring bracelet, going to AA meetings, and going to counseling. Im facing harsh penalties, but thats okay. I've committed a crime and I accept that. I will go to jail and pay hefty fines, but I accept that. Today I can look at myself in the mirror and feel some control again. I can tell people that I am an alcoholic and I know and believe it with everything in me. I know now that I cannot do this on my own, and the people at AA are going to help me stay sober so long as I continue to go and want it bad enough. 

    Drinking is no longer an option for me, because it is more than just a DUI next time. It will cost me everything, my family, my girlfriend, my friends, my job, my future, and most of all I will loose myself entirely. My demon haunts me everyday but I am not longer willing to give into its demands. I am going to fight for my sobriety, and everybody is helping me now, and I am finally willing to accept it. My friend Ali has been sober for 6.5 years and she took me to my first AA meeting since my dui and i have never felt better. I am lucky to have the support of everybody around me, and I now realize my sobriety depends on who I surround myself with, how I live my life, and most importantly the maintenance and preventative measures I take (AA) to prevent a relapse. I realize that it essentially comes down to the point where I have the choice to take that first drink, and today I am doing everything I can to prepare myself to say no when and where that situation arises. 

    If your an alcoholic, you can do it too. Living in active alcoholism is the equivalent to living in hell on earth. I don't believe there is a God, I believe in myself and everyone around me. If you think AA is just about God, your sadly mistaken. I am finally free from alcohols strong grasp for the first time in years, and I cannot wait to continue on my journey. Theres nothing wrong with admitting to being weak and meaning it, because only then you can begin to heal. Thank you for taking the time to read this and to all the people that are in recovery, may everyday be better than the last. To those of you that are still stuck in the midst of your addiction, just remember that help is always out there, weather it be AA, rehab, or whatever else. Never give up because it is 100% possible for you to beat this, it all depends on what you want, if you can accept it, and what your going to do to free yourself."

1olfcv,39,2013-10-16,[Serious Discussion/Q&amp;A] Former Conservative Evangelical Propaganda Writer Turned Atheist Here. My Story After The Click... (crosspost from /r/atheism),nathanbweller7,DebateReligion,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/1olfcv/serious_discussionqa_former_conservative/,"I am a former ""intern"" for an extreme right-wing conservative evangelical ministry called Teen Mania Ministries. I went to their film, television and new media internship called Center for Creative Media after high school where as a 19-21 year old I made an estimated 200+ videos, wrote sermons, magazine articles, and helped concept/produce massive stadium events for indoctrinating tweens and teens.

The events I helped to produce were called Acquire the Fire and Battlecry. If you went to either of those events in 2007, I'm sorry, I wrote most of what you saw there. Ironically, it was during this time that I began to question my own faith as I encountered more and more challenges squaring reality with the talking points I was given to work with.

This questioning and disillusionment lead to some serious clashes with leadership. Unfortunately for me, I was on an isolated campus in the no-man's land of Texas with no vehicle, no money and now way to escape. Myself and many other ""interns"" were forced to work insane hours--sometimes 100+ a week--for months on end. This lead to intense insomnia, anxiety attacks, and a myriad of other health problems such as high blood pressure, nosebleeds and more.

I say ""interns"" because that whole ministry works on a sort of bait-and-switch program where they convince you that you're going there to learn. Once they have you there, they put you to work and say that your education is in figuring stuff out while they pile endless and unreasonable work on you. That's why a 19-21 year old kid was overseeing the media production of a 30+ city stadium tour. To say that the pressure was intense is putting it mildly.

What's worse is that as I began raising more and more concerns about the message we were expected to deliver (to kids no less) the tactics of ministry leaders to ""keep me in line"" became extreme. I was forced to work for days on end, getting no sleep for 48+ hours at a time. Then, I would be sent into meetings in a dazed and confused stupor to be told about God's expectations for my performance. My questions were met with disappointment and manipulative please to not ""betray"" someone who felt like a father to me, etc. etc.

The net result of my experiences at this ministry is that I've been dealing with PTSD for about five years. Experiencing this ugly side of a faith I thought was literally God's gift to mankind, forced me to take seriously the arguments against it. Once I gave those arguments equal weight, they easily made an undeniable case for the pernicious lie that religion is.

Which brings me to why I created this post.

I went to their film, television and new media internship called Center for Creative Media after high school where as a 19-21 year old I made an estimated 200+ videos, wrote sermons, magazine articles, and helped concept/produce massive stadium events for indoctrinating tweens and teens.


The events I helped to produce were called Acquire the Fire and Battlecry. If you went to either of those events in 2007, I'm sorry, I wrote most of what you saw there.

This questioning and disillusionment lead to some serious clashes with leadership. Unfortunately for me, I was on an isolated campus in the no-man's land of Texas with no vehicle, no money and now way to escape. Myself and many other ""interns"" were forced to work insane hours--sometimes 100+ a week--for months on end. This lead to intense insomnia, anxiety attacks, and a myriad of other health problems such as high blood pressure, nosebleeds and more.


I say ""interns"" because that whole ministry works on a sort of bait-and-switch program where they convince you that you're going there to learn. Once they have you there, they put you to work and say that your education is in figuring stuff out while they pile endless and unreasonable work on you. That's why a 19-21 year old kid was overseeing the media production of a 30+ city stadium tour. To say that the pressure was intense is putting it mildly.


What's worse is that as I began raising more and more concerns about the message we were expected to deliver (to kids no less) the tactics of ministry leaders to ""keep me in line"" became extreme. I was forced to work for days on end, getting no sleep for 48+ hours at a time. Then, I would be sent into meetings in a dazed and confused stupor to be told about God's expectations for my performance. My questions were met with disappointment and manipulative please to not ""betray"" someone who felt like a father to me, etc. etc.


The net result of my experiences at this ministry is that I've been dealing with PTSD for about five years. Experiencing this ugly side of a faith I thought was literally God's gift to mankind, forced me to take seriously the arguments against it. Once I gave those arguments equal weight, they easily made an undeniable case for the pernicious lie that religion is.

1ol907,3,2013-10-16,Advice for a CS student with limited keyboard capacity due to chronic illness?,DIE__BART__DIE,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1ol907/advice_for_a_cs_student_with_limited_keyboard/,"I'm a 23 year old man currently doing an MSc in CS.  I love computer
engineering, and maths and science in general. But, a serious problem
limiting my ability to work at the keyboard is making me very unsure about my
future in the work force. I hope you guys might have some input.

My problem is that coding is becoming increasingly difficult because of a
chronic pain condition. I've been suffering from this illness, which primarily
affects my hands and arms, from before I started my studies, but I've always
assumed that I would find some working treatment and get somewhat better --
and that I eventually would be able to take up a coding-heavy job. Now, on the
contrary, my problems have actually become worse over the last years, and I'm
currently very restricted in my capacity at the keyboard.

At this point, I'm deliberating whether to continue my MSc (assuming that it
is possibly), or whether I should switch my interest to some other field where
I could use my interest/skills in maths and computing without day-long
keyboard hacking.

That said, I still want to investigate a bit more what my career options would
be, assuming that I did finish my CS MSc, and that my condition did not
improve. I really do not know much about how the industry works, and what the
work days look like ...and I don't want to jump ship before I'm 100% sure it's
the best decision. As one step to figure out more, I'm asking you guys/gals:
**Do you know about any interesting career options for a talented computer
engineer with very low capacity for keyboard-smashing?**

One thing I've been pondering about is QA work. It appears to me that QA work
may involve a bit less heavy-duty programming, and more reading, verification,
and review than a typical programming gig.
    

**NOTES**

* One obvious suggestion is teaching. Teaching could probably be quite OK, but
  I really want to get some experience in the industry as well.

* Tips for treatment options / etc. are of course welcome. Note, though, that
  I'm already seeing some very good doctors, and do get quite good help with
  managing my pain condition.

* I can actually produce text using dictation software (the excellent
  Dragon NaturallySpeaking), so standard writing is generally not a problem.
  I have, however, not found dictation suitable for coding. (Though, it is a
  solution for many, and I could look more into it.)

* Beggars can't be choosers, but just to mention: I'm not that interested in
  the corporate/sales side of the business; I would strongly prefer to focus
  largely on the engineering side of things. My primary interests in CS lays
  in algorithms, security, and architecture.

* For what it's worth: i) I have very strong grades (top-3%), and have
  relevant development and research experience from high-profile internships.
  ii) I have, as of yet, no critical problems with my personal finances.

1ol5pn,1,2013-10-16,"Submitted by background check information last Wednesday, completed a drug test and fingerprints last Thursday. Still haven't heard back.",[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1ol5pn/submitted_by_background_check_information_last/,"I was offered an internship position last Wednesday immediately after an interview. I was emailed a contract, along with instructions to schedule a drug test and consent to a background check.

I immediately signed the contract, scanned it and emailed it to the Hiring Manager, and I provided the information necessary for them to complete a background check. The next day (Thursday) I completed a drug test and my fingerprints were taken in the afternoon. I received an email from the Hiring Manager letting me know that he would contact me when the background check clears.

So this is almost the end of the fifth business day since my background check was ready to start and I've yet to hear back. I've read some varying accounts of how long it can take but I've mostly seen 2-4 days. I'm a little worried that it's been this long, especially because I'm 20 years old and don't have a lot of education history, work history, etc. 

I know nothing would have come up on the drug test and I don't believe anything would have come up on the background check. The most trouble I've ever been in is a speeding ticket so I doubt anything there gave them pause. Does anyone have experience with background checks taking a little bit longer than they are expected to? Or worse, having an offer rescinded after a clean background check?

I'm a little concerned that they might have decided not to go forward with the internship position. "

My girlfriend of two and a half years is studying to be a dietician. To help network for a certain hospital's internship, she applied to volunteer there.

Anyway, she couldn't figure out when or where her orientation was, only that it was today. Neither of us could get anyone on the phone. After about 30 to 40 minutes of answering machines, I left a voicemail saying someone could ""call me back and subject themselves to a relentless tirade of verbal insult or grow some balls"".

It took a lot for me to write that out, as it may have seriously altered my life and my girlfriend's.

Anyway, within 20 minutes I get a phone call from their Human Resources department. My girlfriend's volunteer position has been deactivated/delayed for the next 6 months. She can reapply after that.

The weird part is, I don't remember thinking ""okay, this would be a good thing to say right now and leave as a message,"" I just remember saying it. Almost like I slipped.

I'm in a pretty bad place right now (I was an even worse place a half hour ago). Can I trust myself? Do I have no judgment or sense of consequences? Am I going off the deep end here?

My girlfriend has said I need to demonstrate that I have self control and that I can judge the consequences of my actions. Basically that I'm not a ticking time bomb that could hurt her, her family or her career. I'm a little bit surprised she hasn't left me.

Thoughts?"
1ol1ad,4,2013-10-16,Where to start.,throwaway711117,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1ol1ad/where_to_start/,"I really have no idea where to begin. I just don't know who to go to at this point. 

I hate my internship, which yesterday I got written up for being sick even though I work with food they still think that I should come in sick. Whole mess of that made me want to leave and fly back home to my parents.

I hate myself at this point. Exactly one year ago today I found out I was pregnant. I stuck my head in the sand because I was only 19 I didn't know any better (still don't know that much) and eventually got my big girl panties on and told my exbf. He made it clear I wasn't having a kid with him and was forced to do the unspeakable. After I got the abortion I had instant regrets and ended up in the ER for complications, can I have kids after the whole procedure? I'm not sure but will probably kill me if I can't have kids of my own.

Currently have a new bf who I really really like but sometimes I just don't know whats going to happen. I'm sick of just being another girl to someone. Everyone I know is married or having kids and I know I'm not that old and it will still happen but I just don't want an uncertain future anymore. Yeah, it seems dumb but deep down I want to be engaged and  have a day just about me. I've never really had that before.

I don't really know what to do and not really sure what I WANT. Just for all the stress to go away :/"

We finally found a place that is run by a pair of sisters-in-law in one of their homes.  They are nice, it's clean, and they're willing to take her at last minute notice.  A couple weeks ago, dad would drop her off and she was fine.  She said bye and went to playing.  She took naps for them without a problem and seemed to enjoy going. 

All of a sudden she hates it.  She went 4 days last week and threw a fit the last two days.  One day, she even made herself throw up and dad ended up going and picking her up.  They have said she has been crankier than normal and whiney throughout the day, recently.  I thought she might be sick last week, but it happened again today and she doesn't seem to be sick at all.      

The problem is I don't *have* to work and am not really even making any money from it.  I was hoping it may lead to a long-term position and thought it would be good for her to interact with other kids, too.  I do, however, have a month-ish long internship coming up in January for grad school that I have to do to graduate.  During that time, she will be at day care everyday so it's basically inevitable that she goes.  

I don't know what to do.  Do we keep sending her to daycare where she seems to be miserable?  What can I do to make it easier on her?  Why might she all of a sudden be freaking out?! "

The other part of the equation is that I just had an office visit for a Tax internship and I LOVED the office/people and I thought it all went well. If I do receive an offer, I will most likely accept it. 

Now here comes the main question, should I stay in this tax class and try to salvage a B-? Or should I take the WP (doesn't affect GPA) and try hard to get an A next semester? I currently have a 4.0 Accounting GPA so getting a low B would affect that significantly, but I feel like a WP in Tax I would look terrible when trying to get a Tax internship. I feel like that would get my offer rescinded. Do firms (this is a National firm) normally ask for transcipts?

1okuwl,7,2013-10-16,My 3rd DUI saved my life,syounit,REDDITORSINRECOVERY,https://www.reddit.com/r/REDDITORSINRECOVERY/comments/1okuwl/my_3rd_dui_saved_my_life/,"I am 26 years old, and I have been drinking for 13 years on and off. I could always drink more than everybody else and I didn't really care to know why until I got my 2nd DUI in 2007. After that I was forced into recovery programs that I didn't want to be in. I met some incredible people, but i already knew that my drinking wasn't over yet at that point, bc thats what i had in my head. This is also the time I lived in a halfway house and met my friend Ali who was charged with a DUI homicide (her passenger who was an alcoholic passed). She helped me out so much back in 2007 and within the first week I knew I was going to be friends with her for the rest of my life. After I got out of jail she was sentenced and went away for awhile. For the next 6 and a half years I took drinking head on and went through a journey that showed me why I am an alcoholic. I can't even tell you how many times I tried to quit drinking by myself over that time period, but it was so many times. I met my current GF back in 2009 and told her right away that I had a serious alcohol problem, and she said we can figure it out. Most of my attempts to stop have been while I have been with her. I've also learned that you cannot stay sober for somebody else. It sounds stupid but it just doesn't work, your alcoholism will convince you that the person you love is trying to ruin your life. Its disgusting. I put that girl through a world of pain with my alcoholism (emotional and mental pain, not physical). She drinks sometimes, and we have drank together, but I always take it to the next level. I always end up ""transforming into the monster"" as she calls me. We enjoyed drinking together at first, but as time passed, she began to hate me when i drank, and eventually she just wouldn't drink anymore because she didn't want to encourage my drinking, but that wouldn't stop me. I got so drunk on new years of 2011 that when we came home that night and got into a fight, i went to the kitchen and grabbed a knife, and handed it over to her and said, ""why don't you go ahead and kill yourself because nobody cares about you, not me, not your parents, not anyone."" She was incredibly upset the next day and I didn't know why until she told me, I didn't have any recollection of that happening and I still do not. This is the point where I started to fear my drinking, or I should say fear myself when I drank. Was I becoming dangerous or was I just completely selling my soul to alcohol? This is the time that I started to experience longer and heightened periods of anxiety and depression after drinking. By this time I stopped going to see my friend Ali and had surrounded myself by people who were alcoholics, but had worse situations than myself, which allowed me to justify my own drinking. I took care of my grandfather during this time because he was starting to have problems staying home alone at home and what not. My drinking still came first, but I did my best to take care of my papa, but even in his last days of being able to talk clearly, he still told me that my alcoholism was bad. He told me that he was happy my grandma died when she did back in 2005, because if she saw me today, it would kill her, because I was her favorite grandson with so much potential, and I was throwing it all away with alcohol. Eventually he needed more care than I could provide. I had been struggling with school because of my alcoholism, and it had almost cost me my relationship countless times. The one thing I can say though is that I have never cheated on my gf while intoxicated, or ever, i have never wanted to bc i knew what it took for her to put up with my shit. My family has helped me out through my troubled times, and have hoped for me to figure out my own plan for sobriety, but it hasn't happened up until recently. I went to detox after begging my dad to send me there because it came to a point that I physically couldn't stop drinking otherwise I would withdrawal. After I went through detox I kept myself sober by not drinking at all. That lasted for about 5 months until I decided to drink again. I didn't go to meetings or anything and told myself that all it took was my willpower. Eventually I gave into the screaming voice in my head to drink again. I remember that drink too, it was a Pacifico on tap with a lime at the Planet Hollywood Casino in Vegas. As I drank the beer, I remember how satisfied I felt to finally soothe that voice and how defeated and helpless I felt at the same time. As it had before after my periods of brief sobriety, my drinking picked up right where it left off. I tried to control myself as much as I could, my girlfriend and I even had a few times drinking together where we got along, this had not happened in years. This reinforced the thought that I was in complete control and that I was finally a normal drinker again, but sadly I was only fooling myself. For all the times I kept myself reserved around my girlfriend while drinking, I just hit it that much harder when she wasn't around. I began to lie again, hide my drinking, and fall into an endless pit of anxiety and depression. In the weeks leading up to my DUI, I finally saw my alcoholism for what it was. I wasn't able to function normally before that, but I had finally progressed to the point where I was able to maintain going to school, excelling at my internship, and maintain a normal sleeping schedule. I had become a fully functional alcoholic and my sickness was exponentially degrading me as a human being, finally taking the bigger piece of myself away from me and leaving me more and more empty everyday. Relief finally came when I received my DUI. Finally I am forced to stay sober by having a monitoring bracelet, going to AA meetings, and going to counseling. Im facing harsh penalties, but thats okay. I've committed a crime and I accept that. I will go to jail and pay hefty fines, but I accept that. Today I can look at myself in the mirror and feel some control again. I can tell people that I am an alcoholic and I know and believe it with everything in me. I know now that I cannot do this on my own, and the people at AA are going to help me stay sober so long as I continue to go and want it bad enough. Drinking is no longer an option for me, because it is more than just a DUI next time. It will cost me everything, my family, my girlfriend, my friends, my job, my future, and most of all I will loose myself entirely. My demon haunts me everyday but I am not longer willing to give into its demands. I am going to fight for my sobriety, and everybody is helping me now, and I am finally willing to accept it. My friend Ali has been sober for 6.5 years and she took me to my first AA meeting since my dui and i have never felt better. I am lucky to have the support of everybody around me, and I now realize my sobriety depends on who I surround myself with, how I live my life, and most importantly the maintenance and preventative measures I take (AA) to prevent a relapse. I realize that it essentially comes down to the point where I have the choice to take that first drink, and today I am doing everything I can to prepare myself to say no when and where that situation arises. If your an alcoholic, you can do it too. Living in active alcoholism is the equivalent to living in hell on earth. I don't believe there is a God, I believe in myself and everyone around me. If you think AA is just about God, your sadly mistaken. I am finally free from alcohols strong grasp for the first time in years, and I cannot wait to continue on my journey. Theres nothing wrong with admitting to being weak and meaning it, because only then you can begin to heal. Thank you for taking the time to read this and to all the people that are in recovery, may everyday be better than the last. To those of you that are still stuck in the midst of your addiction, just remember that help is always out there, weather it be AA, rehab, or whatever else. Never give up because it is 100% possible for you to beat this, it all depends on what you want, if you can accept it, and what your going to do to free yourself."

""Eight years ago, I was an intern for a sports writer, covering my first Knicks game. There's an area at MSG where the celeb fans go after the game if they are willing to give an interview. There were two that night: New York Jet Keyshawn Johnson, and Hanging With Mr. Cooper star Mark Curry. 

I approached Johnson and asked him politely for an interview. He replied 'nah, kid. I'm good.' 

I was crestfallen. My first attempt at a big interview and I was shot down and belittled. By someone who was standing in the interview area! So I sheepishly approached Curry - and he couldn't have been more kind, classy, and helpful. He was awesome and engaging, and I was able to write a great story.

There are two lessons to take from this story. One, be nice to everyone - you never know who will be introducing you 8 years later. Two, Keyshawn Johnson is a dick.

Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Mark Curry."""

[As someone in between the psychology and criminal justice fields, do you feel that there is a workable solution or path to help stop the mentally ill from committing mass shootings through gun control? And do you feel that the suggestion you have is applicable with the second amendment?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oiv73/iama_forensic_psychologist_im_an_expert_on/ccseqtl?context=5)|If you dont want to have people commit crimes with guns, take away everyone's guns. But that's not constitutional, practical, or reasonable.
 |One: DESTIGMATIZE mental heath difficulties and increase education population-wide regarding the subject.
 |Two: increase the amount of quality, effective treatment options while at the same time reducing their cost. There are a lot of treatment providers out there who just coast on poor treatment practices just so they can collect medicaid money and they do more harm than good.
[Hello! Thank you for the AMA! I heard IQ test is not the best method to determine someones intelligence. What is your opinion about it, is the test trustable and is it ok to label people according their IQ?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oiv73/iama_forensic_psychologist_im_an_expert_on/ccscjed?context=5)|That's a big question.
 |IQ is just a proxy for someone's general cognitive abilities. It measures a vague concept that seems to be a decent predictor for a lot of outcomes, but it's not the be-all-end-all of factors (It doesn't tell you how well you'd do on Jeopardy, is what I tell people).
 |The example I like to give is that if you know someone's mile time,  bench press max, resting heart rate, and weight, you'll have a good idea as to how fit they might be, but as far as how they'd do in any specific athletic event, you really can only guess. IQ is the same thing, but for brainpower, so to speak.
 |So yes it's ""trustable,"" but it doesn't mean what most people think it means.
 |As far as labeling people because of IQ, no, that's either a bad idea or a useless practice. The only labels you could accurately apply wouldn't be very useful.
[How do you handle the issue of deception? Do clients often put up a ""defensive"" mental barrier because of the nature of your work, hold back, etc?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oiv73/iama_forensic_psychologist_im_an_expert_on/ccseblo?context=5)|Deception (or Impression Management, or Disingenuous Responding) is one of my most favorite topics. =)
 |People are almost always deceptive to some extent, doubly so during forensic evaluation time.  And there's useful information in that. What I always tell people is that it's not my job (nor within my ability) to determine the Truth-with-a-capital-T. I just collect information from all parties and that they can expect to be questioned further on any discrepancies that turn up.  
[I had two IQ tests as a child, one at age 11 and one at age 15.  I scored 113 the first time, 96 the second.  I attribute the lower score due to my mental health.  I was sleeping 3-6 hours a night and often I would just use one hand, as I rested my head on my other hand.   I was depressed and going through abuse at age 11.  I guess my question is, if someone is suffering from a mental illness, are the results  always accurate?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oiv73/iama_forensic_psychologist_im_an_expert_on/ccsdvvf?context=5)|Well the results, in a sense, are always pretty accurate because that's how you might have been functioning, cognitively, at the time, keeping in mind the fact that cognitive functioning is ABSOLUTELY effected by stuff like depression, anxiety, trauma, extreme nutrition, sleep imbalances, etc etc. It's important for the tester (and most importantly, the results-interpreter) to take into account information such as what you were going through when they interpreted the report. The number is almost always accurate, just like the number on a speedometer is almost always accurate... it's what causes the reported number to change that's often the most important.  Which gets to your second question... because context is so important, no, online IQ tests aren't very useful. Also, copy-pasted from another response...
[ question:  Are there any IQ tests online that are anywhere close to accurate?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oiv73/iama_forensic_psychologist_im_an_expert_on/ccsdvvf?context=5)|&gt; There aren't any I'd put any stock in, unfortunately. A big BIG part of why psychological testing 'works' is because they're developed with a particular protocol for their administration, and they're all designed to be administered by a human being as they require on-the-fly and organic decision making during administration.
[Edit: Ignore second question, I have my answer.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oiv73/iama_forensic_psychologist_im_an_expert_on/ccsdvvf?context=5)|&gt; IQ isn't something like blood pressure or cholesterol count, or any other empirically definable trait or quantity or substance. It's a proxy number for a proxy concept. 
[What is one thing you may have to testify about that isn't quite 100% verifiable? in other words, something that isn't so cut and dry as the public may think?  What is one misconception about forensic psychologists that movies, TV and media popularize about your profession?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oiv73/iama_forensic_psychologist_im_an_expert_on/ccsi4n5?context=5)|I would say the one thing that I have to talk about again and again is this: one's IQ doesn't affect one's competence in any given area, just like a psychiatric diagnosis doesn't pigeonhole someone in a particular category. IQ and diagnosis suggests a particular collection of traits but it's how those traits effect one's day-to-day functioning that REALLY matter.  Oh, also, the idea of an FBI profiler isn't what movies make it out to be.
 |As far as misconception, I'd say that psychologists don't go around automatically analyzing people all the time. We don't know what you're thinking. =)
[What's the most difficult evaluation you have ever done? I worked with a few patients who tortured animals, and those diagnostic sessions stick with me today.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oiv73/iama_forensic_psychologist_im_an_expert_on/ccsgbax?context=5)|The ones that always get to me are the ones where kids themselves are accused of child abuse (""Crimes against nature,"" they call it here). The kids are just doing the best they can with the rules they think the world is run by.
[Also, what's the best outcome you were ever involved with? I've had patient success stories, so I know they are out there!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oiv73/iama_forensic_psychologist_im_an_expert_on/ccsgbax?context=5)|I think the best outcomes I have are the ones where I can recommend treatment and visitation schedules with disaffected parents that allow them to not so much spend more time with their kids but BETTER time with their kids. Parents do their best but sometimes they need extra help.
[What has been the hardest thing to overcome?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oiv73/iama_forensic_psychologist_im_an_expert_on/cctaysb?context=5)|Hardest thing to overcome? Getting to the point where I can appropriately manage the effect my empathy has on my psychological well-being.
 |I work for a governmental agency. Any level of government that runs courts will have need for a forensic psychologist. So county, state, possibly fed, but it's rare to have staff psychs. Just so happens where I work it's in the agency budget. There's also room for forensic psychologists in private practice but because the evals are so time consuming the most work in that field is in family court which is very VERY exacting work.
[Now, she had talked to me when the office was closed, and nobody was there. The following day, I had another question, so I called her. This time, everything was different. She acted like the conversation never happened, and now I feel crazy. Is it possible that she believed I was officially released from my dependency court order from the fact I knew information about my radiation therapy, but my court order isn't actually done processing? It seems like a huge error on my part, but I am in trauma. I know trauma can cause issues with taking in information. What are the legal aspects to abuse cases, and childhood dependency records?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oiv73/iama_forensic_psychologist_im_an_expert_on/ccsvrew?context=5)|What my advice to you WOULD be, in this case, would be to find a therapist with whom you feel a connection (most good therapists  will meet with you for 5 or 10 minutes between appointments free of charge to see if you get along) and discuss this with them. Preferably find someone with experience working with adult children with a trauma history. They can guide you through the issues of getting old records, going through them, and helping you decipher just what they might mean.
[How accurate are IQ tests? I was evaluated by a psychiatrist (long story, but anyway\), and in the copy of a fairly lengthy report, he pegged my IQ at X (I won't post it, over 100 though\). Is this accurate, and what exactly does this mean? Is it possible for this to vary by test etc.?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oiv73/iama_forensic_psychologist_im_an_expert_on/ccsm329?context=5)|First, psychiatrists don't usually administer IQ tests, so I'd guess that if the person in question was a psychiatrist then they were just making an educated guess as to what your IQ might be... and that's all that it is- a guess. I'm at the point now (it's a fun game I play) where I can usually guess within 5 points what a person's IQ is before I test them, provided I've had some time to talk with them.
 |And, yes, reported IQ scores can vary significantly from test to test, from administration to administration, from administraTOR to administraTOR, etc. Built in to each IQ test that's worth anything, though, is something called a confidence interval (CI; think: margin of error that you see on political polls). The only real, defensible way to report an IQ is in terms of its CI. If I meet three people  with IQs measured to be 97, 100, and 103, it would be professionally irresponsible for me to make any claims as to my ability to rank-order them on their intelligence. There's a fair amount of slop in the measure of IQ, which is accounted for by the instrument in the form of CIs, and should be commented on by the individual doing the actual test interpretation.
[What is the most common trait or attribute that criminals have ?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oiv73/iama_forensic_psychologist_im_an_expert_on/ccsrj3p?context=5)|Lack of stability/support/security as a child that has ill-prepared them to function as an adult.
[What do you do for self-care? I am in an MSW program and am getting burned out with my internships. I'm starting to think the world is just full of wicked and cruel people. I am in therapy and it's helping.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oiv73/iama_forensic_psychologist_im_an_expert_on/cct522l?context=5)|Therapy can be excellent. I also am associated with two or three dozen AWESOME clinicians in my area and we're excellent friends who hang out all the time. It helps to know people who go through similar stuff as you do.
[How do you help the overly empathetic? My husband has asked me not to bring home any more homeless people. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oiv73/iama_forensic_psychologist_im_an_expert_on/cct522l?context=5)|I'll tell you, my experience with getting overwhelmed with wicked/cruel/sadness... that happened a lot, but you progress through it. You don't have to lose your empathy, but you learn how to open/shut the floodgate over time. It seems similar to exercising. You know how when you first start a workout regimen your muscles ache for days and can't walk, but then after doing the routine for a few weeks that goes away, even though you know you're still working out effectively? That happens emotionally, too. Another big part for me was realizing my limitations and that I can only help so much.
[How do you feel about the DSM-V?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oiv73/iama_forensic_psychologist_im_an_expert_on/ccshd2z?context=5)|I actually like it. I feel like it does a good job of trying to put human suffering into meaningful categories. Such a vast undertaking is always going to have its faults, but I feel like the APA did a good job moving the field forward.
[What exactly did they improve on from DSM-IV?  The DSM-5 has many serious broadenings of what is considered a mental illness.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oiv73/iama_forensic_psychologist_im_an_expert_on/ccsj59v?context=5)|Well, for example, I personally agree with the removal/attenuation of the Childhood Bipolar Disorder diagnosis. And I also like how they removed the five-axis diagnosis system.
[ create human suffering, by categorizing people.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oiv73/iama_forensic_psychologist_im_an_expert_on/ccss8q0?context=5)|While I totally get where you're coming from, my response to that would be: the DSM doesn't categorize people, it categorizes symptoms. It's up to clinicians to decide how those symptom-based categories fit, and it's usually bad diagnosis that creates categorization-based human suffering.
[They added other troubling childhood disorders.  Now having temper tantrums can be considered a mental disorder.  They've added many other new conditions as well which will increase the rate of mental illness.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oiv73/iama_forensic_psychologist_im_an_expert_on/cct3f30?context=5)|That's why it'll always be important to see a qualified and competent clinician. For example, if a child is throwing temper tantrums to the level that it is severely impacting life above and beyond what is usual, then maybe that SHOULD be considered a disordered set of symptoms.
 |There are a lot of people opining on the DSM who don't really understand how it should be used. I'm not saying it's perfect, I'm just saying its quite easy to attack in a hyperbolic fashion, rather than from a reasoned and scientific point of view.
[The way I see it, the DSM 5 makes it even easier to be considered mentally ill.  With the tremendous amount of people on psychiatric drugs, this is not a good thing.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oiv73/iama_forensic_psychologist_im_an_expert_on/cct4fzw?context=5)|What's your professional background?
 |If misused by irresponsible or undertrained clinicians then yes it can have that effect. But that was just as true of the prior versions of the DSM. Maybe even moreso.
[4\) What are some common misconceptions regarding you job compared to the reality?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oiv73/iama_forensic_psychologist_im_an_expert_on/ccsxbm5?context=5)|Writing up my conclusions and recommendations. The best analogy I can come up with is those magic eye posters. From a distance all the data I collect looks like random noise but when I think about it and think aboout it and focus it and play with it in my head, eventually it resolves into a clear picture (hey, it's a sailboat!) and I know where to take the report.  That we have some magic power of intuition that allows us to sense thoughts. Also- tell someone you're a psychologist and I guarantee you you'll be asked quite frequently, ""are you analyzing me right now?"" My response is always- no way. that takes too much work and I'm not that interested anyway.
[What are the general rules, guidelines for competency for which general areas of the law. Have or do you feel they are unjust in any way? How has this line of work changed your thoughts on this, if it has at all? And really anything else you'd like to add on the applications of this notion.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oiv73/iama_forensic_psychologist_im_an_expert_on/ccsl9ln?context=5)|As far as guidelines for competence, I'd check out the Dusky standard... it explains what is required for an individual to be deemed adjudicatively competent, and I think it's a beautiful piece of law. I love the fact that our justice system takes into consideration stuff like that, and that serves as SIGNIFICANT protection for people who would otherwise be railroaded through the system.
[Oh and what's the one thing from your line of study and work you wish everyone knew or understood? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oiv73/iama_forensic_psychologist_im_an_expert_on/ccsl9ln?context=5)|I guess if I had to come up with one thing I wish everyone knew/understood, is this: everyone out there, from the sweetest old lady to the worst possible parent, they're all doing the best they can with what they have available to them. This fact certainly doesn't excuse reprehensible behavior, but once you understand that their behavior comes from SOMEwhere, that they're the product of their own upbringing, it suddenly becomes a lot easier to have hope for humanity.
[What are some free and reliable online tests one can do in order to determine IQ?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oiv73/iama_forensic_psychologist_im_an_expert_on/ccsdkrb?context=5)|There aren't any I'd put any stock in, unfortunately. A big BIG part of why psychological testing 'works' is because they're developed with a particular protocol for their administration, and they're all designed to be administered by a human being as they require on-the-fly and organic decision making  during administration.
 |IQ isn't something like blood pressure or cholesterol count, or any other empirically definable trait or quantity or substance. It's a proxy number for a proxy concept.
[Has there been much research done regarding the correlation btwn IQ and financial success?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oiv73/iama_forensic_psychologist_im_an_expert_on/ccsd9f2?context=5)|As far as actual research I can cite, I don't really know. I do know that as an educated professional my guess would be that yes there's some correlation in that IQ tends to hang with academic achievement, and that academic achievement hangs with financial success, but that needs a big ol' Barry Bonds-style asterisk next to it as there are sooo many other variables that play a part (e.g., temperment, interests, original socioeconomic status, environmental factors, etc etc).
[Are you the guy they go to when people want to plead insane? Or am I thinking of the wrong kind of psychologist?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oiv73/iama_forensic_psychologist_im_an_expert_on/ccss8g6?context=5)|While I don't do those types of evaluations, yes, a forensic psychologist or psychiatrist is involved in that determination.
 |Fun fact- Insanity is not a psychological or psychiatric term, it's a legal term. There's no ""insane"" diagnosis in the DSM.
[Do you enjoy being a forensic psychologist? What major/degrees did you obtain? Do you find this career to be satisfying? What's the most interesting case you have been involved in so far? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oiv73/iama_forensic_psychologist_im_an_expert_on/ccso77s?context=5)|I love it and find it satisfying, even though it's very challenging emotionally. I have a BA in psych and a Ph.D. in psych (School Psychology, actually), with a lot of specific training in forensic psychology.
 |I'd say the most interesting case was a custody evaluation that got national media attention. The media took our findings to be ""X parent can't be a parent because he has X medical condition,"" when in reality there was a LOT more going on that wasn't reported. Sure the implication of the condition was significant, but it was how the parent was handling the diagnosis and treatment that was what affected the judge's findings. It was interesting to me because it showed me what non-Forensic Psychologists will latch onto in a report, and to adjust my reports accordingly.
[I'm a junior in college right now in order to become a forensic psychologist. Could you please explain your educational background more for me?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oiv73/iama_forensic_psychologist_im_an_expert_on/ccsf45n?context=5)|Sure. I have a BA in psychology and a Ph.D. in psychology. Make sure you go to an APA-accredited graduate school that offers PRACTICUM experiences in forensic psych. Coursework doesn't really matter much on a CV/Resume.
[Is a Ph.D mandatory and/or would be beneficial to obtain? I've read mixed things about it.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oiv73/iama_forensic_psychologist_im_an_expert_on/ccsg7al?context=5)|For forensic psychology, yes without a doubt. The reason is supervision. If you don't have a Ph.D. then your work needs to be supervised, which blurs the line in regards to who is ultimately responsible for the submitted report.
 |For other fields, maybe not so much, but a Masters level forensic psychologist will find him/herself pretty limited.
[I see, it makes complete sense. Thank you so much for answering my questions, I appreciate it.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oiv73/iama_forensic_psychologist_im_an_expert_on/ccsgsg6?context=5)|You betcha!
[Not sure if i'm late to the party, but can you describe a normal day/week for you? also, what was your dissertation on, broadly? and what are the requirements to become a forensic psych? i'm assuming you have a phd in clinical psych, but how do you specialize?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oiv73/iama_forensic_psychologist_im_an_expert_on/ccsjcfv?context=5)|Sure- let's see... for the most part, to practice forensic psychology you should have a doctoral level degree from a clinically-oriented psychology program (School Psychology, Counseling Psychology, Clinical Psychology) that is APA accredited. Also it helps to have formal forensic training through practicum experiences or from a forensic oriented post-doctoral experience.
 |My dissertation was completely unrelated to forensic psychology... it was more closely related to neuropsychology/educational psychology. It was very freeing to realize that one's dissertation  has VERY little to do with one's post-doctoral career options.
 |My weeks are probably spent like this: 15% psych testing, 15% interviewing, 5% phone calls to collateral references. This is all considered ""face-to-face time.""
 |15% scoring and interpreting tests, 15% writing up reports.
 |The  remainder is spent researching, speaking with stakeholders (e.g., judges, the DA, public defenders, Guardians ad Litum), and regular ol' boring meetings associated with government work.
[How did you get interested in this line of work?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oiv73/iama_forensic_psychologist_im_an_expert_on/ccsco7y?context=5)|I went to grad school thinking I wanted to be a research scientist, but ended up having an opportunity my 4th year to work with an AMAZING forensic psychologist. I spent two years in her clinic and learned a ton. I find the work challenging as it requires me to be entirely open with my work and to be willing to hold it up to the light, so to speak, of public scrutiny. Also I like it because it allows me to apply the benefits of psychology to individuals who do not come from means, and who would not otherwise (likely) have a chance to benefit from it.
[What do you, well, do? What is the purpose and day to day work of a forensic psychologist? I guess my main questions are: why would you be called in; what sort of work do you do with clients; what is your goal in seeing them; what do you report on in the end?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oiv73/iama_forensic_psychologist_im_an_expert_on/ccspvh7?context=5)|Why I'm called in? The judges or attorneys suspect a person's disabilities or emotional/mental functioning are so outside the norm that they need substantiation from a mental health professional as to their level of impairment. (e.g., ""this guy can't remember what day of the week it is, he probably isn't fit to stand trial, let's get a psych to help substantiate that,"" or ""this teen has committed several sexual offenses. We need someone to come in and estimate the risk of him doing so again and the likelihood he'll benefit from treatment."")
 |What Do? Interviews and testing, LOTS Of interviews and testing, and reviewing records and making contact with collateral sources of information. The goal of this is to answer specific legal questions (aka Psycholegal questions) posed by the court.
 |Report on? SPECIFICALLY on the psycholegal questions. A court order has specific questions in it and it's  not ethical for me to evaluate or investigate functioning outside the scope of those questions (a client has a right to privacy). But in the end I only make recommendations. It's up to the judge to make determinations.
[Where is a reliable source to get an accurate personality test? Iq test?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oiv73/iama_forensic_psychologist_im_an_expert_on/ccso03u?context=5)|A trained and licensed psychologist.  Half the battle is finding someone who can administer the tests in a manner so as to ensure a valid result, and the other half is finding someone who is competent in their interpretation.
[What are your thoughts on EQ/EI assessments? What about those assessments v. IQ when its comes to determining competency (to stand trial, parental rights, etc\)? In other words, could there be some use for EI testing in the legal system?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oiv73/iama_forensic_psychologist_im_an_expert_on/ccslc7a?context=5)|There really isn't a lot of research connecting the concept of emotional intelligence to various competencies.  It's interesting to think about, but HOW EQ is measured will need to be advanced quite a bit before it's worth even researching associations between competencies and whatever it purports to measure.
 |The thing about assessing for parental or adjudicative competency is that they are usually defined by statue and statue doesn't reference specific tests or test scores. It's up to the psychologist to integrate research with professional competency to justify just how closely his/her work comes to supporting/disconfirming the presence of the various statutory prongs of the relevant areas of competency.
[I do admit though that narcissists arguably possess psychopathic traits - so that's another bucket for our hypothetical subject - but from what I can tell it's relatively rare for them to demonstrate that complete lack of guilt associated with psychopath.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oiv73/iama_forensic_psychologist_im_an_expert_on/ccsor4p?context=5)|Lack of empathy (or a lower amount of empathy than is usual) can be problematic, yes, but only really if its in the presence of other troubling characteristics, behaviors, or circumstances.  And, yes, knowing results of psych assessments absolutely can influence their lives (else why would we even bother doing such testing?). It can go one of three ways, though- they can take it to heart, use it to make efforts for improvement and better themselves with it; they can ignore it; or, and this is the worst, in my opinion, they can internalize it and become despondent or bitter or disaffected and become worse off because of the information. It's because of that third possibility that I never release a psych report without having a chance to sit down with the client and go over the results in person.  One thing I always make a point of explaining to clients  is that a psych results just describe one's functioning AT THAT GIVEN TIME. You might be a different person one day, week, month, or year from now, and at that point your assessment results might be pretty different. It's up to them to decide whether they want those results one day, week, month, year from now to show worse/better/equivalent functioning.

Your client is the court or referring agency and they are very much interested in making use of my results to influence lives.
[You know you're doing great work and I mean that sincerely. Most professionals wouldn't care to given their subjects such deliberation and care. Obviously they won't be the other extreme i.e. callous in their treatment of the subject, but they probably won't go to such lengths.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oiv73/iama_forensic_psychologist_im_an_expert_on/ccswzts?context=5)|Pretty frequently. Being overly sensitive to others is just as problematic as being under-sensitive to others (by definition, I suppose... otherwise it wouldn't be called ""overly/under""). Overly empathetic people often perceive the world as a giant, cruel place that seems to be largely out of their control.
 |Thanks for the kind words! And in my private practice I see a lot of the same types of cases but usually they're clients with the means to pay for the services themselves. Generally, though, they're coming from family court and not drug court or the adolescent courts.
[I wasn't here for the AMA but have a question. Have you had any cases of PAS(parental alienation syndrome\) and how do you go about evaluating those types of cases? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oiv73/iama_forensic_psychologist_im_an_expert_on/ccsuoum?context=5)|PAS is a tricky thing. It's not even  agreed upon by in the field that it exists. But if it does, I've come across it. Evaluating it is tricky, but some researchers have outlined criteria for its existence that you can use to substantiate. In the end, though, the real reason for doing so is that it suggests a course of treatment to help repair relationships between children and their parents.
 |High conflict custody disputes are just terrible. They feature some of the most insidiously maladjusted people I've come across.
[Hello! I'm currently studying for my Masters degree in Forensic Psychology, with just my dissertation outstanding. I just wondered if you could give me any advice on how to make myself stand out when applying for psych jobs. My degree only covers stage 1 of the training and I currently can't afford the stage 2 training to become a fully qualified forensic psychologist. However, I do volunteer with my local probation trust. What else could I do to put myself above other candidates in the running for jobs? Thanks!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oiv73/iama_forensic_psychologist_im_an_expert_on/ccsej7f?context=5)|Hmmm sounds like you might not be in the United States.
 |Here in the states licensing is done on a state-by-state basis, and if you're not licensed at the doctoral level you need to work under the supervision of a doctoral-level psychologist or a medical doctor. Additionally, not ever state grants field-specific doctoral licenses.
 |But to make yourself stand out get yourself actual on-the-job training. Volunteer and do it for no pay if you have to. And get very VERY good at writing.
[When meeting somebody, on your job, what is normally the conditions, and what do you talk about? Also, are you employed by the state you live in?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oiv73/iama_forensic_psychologist_im_an_expert_on/ccse8y3?context=5)|I am employed by the local government agency, yes, but I also maintain a small private practice for evening/weekends work.
 |People I assess are always done via court-order. A judge or a pair of attorneys somewhere did the law equivalent of throwing their hands up in the air and saying ""We have no idea what's going on"" and then they order an individual to forensic evaluation to answer specific questions. My to-be clients are usually not happy about that, and can be reluctant to talk to me, but I can deal with that.
 |My job at that point is to find out as much as I can that's relevant to the question(s), which is usually done through extensive interviewing of the individual and third parties as well as through testing. Interviews tend to be focused on collecting information about their social, work, education, medical, psychological, etc history.
[What is your IQ score? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oiv73/iama_forensic_psychologist_im_an_expert_on/ccslpre?context=5)|I don't know. I haven't been tested since 3rd grade. And now with my knowledge of most all of the major IQ tests, any score obtained from administration of such a test would be invalid.
[Interesting... It sounds very similar to what happens when somebody is admitted to a  hospital. Thanks! Also, are you able to tell me specifically what you do/say to have reluctant people speak?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oiv73/iama_forensic_psychologist_im_an_expert_on/ccsei15?context=5)|It's all about setting the relationship. I tell them (honestly) that I don't work for the defense, and I don't work for the prosecution, and I don't work for the police. I work for the judge and my job is to collect information and present it so that he/she can make an informed decision. I also make sure to emphasize that their own input is very important and that in order to make sure the best help is made available to them and/or their children, they need to make sure they are honest about both their strengths AND their difficulties.
[Do you work with guardian ad litem, in regards to your findings on parents?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oiv73/iama_forensic_psychologist_im_an_expert_on/ccswe76?context=5)|Oh yes, GALs can be quite helpful.
[How bad do parents have to be before you guys remove a child?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oiv73/iama_forensic_psychologist_im_an_expert_on/ccsnfs9?context=5)|Well it's never me that removes a child, thank goodness. That's ultimately up to the judge. It's called a Termination of Parental Rights (TPR) and it's very srs.
 |Usually if my services are requested, they're requested in a confirmatory, rather than exploratory, fashion. DSS has been involved for a long time, multiple case plans have been created and not followed-through on, and reports of abuse and/or neglect have been well-substantiated.
 |It's tricky. You don't want to TPR to soon, not at all... these parents have the right to have children and have a right to try to parent the best they can, but you can definitely TPR too late (which I kinda think happens more often than not) and end up subjecting children to horrible, horrible conditions for far too long.
[Based on your experience in the field would you say its better to TPR too soon or too late? (I get that its horrible either way but in which case would to child suffer less\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oiv73/iama_forensic_psychologist_im_an_expert_on/cct32wj?context=5)|It really depends on specific variables in each case, which makes that question difficult to answer. If you remove a kid too early  you're violating the rights of the parents and if you remove a kid too late you're violating the parens patriae obligation of the state.
 |I would bet that if you did a file review of all TPRs it would have been better for the majority of the kids to have been removed earlier than they had been, but that's hindsight.
[That... wow. I think in your place I'd have trouble sleeping.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oiv73/iama_forensic_psychologist_im_an_expert_on/cct5jg6?context=5)|There are definitely points in the assessment process where I have trouble sleeping.
[How effective do you think standardized psychological testing is? Can you share any experiences in which traditional testing methods render unsuccessful, and how did you proceed in other to reach your conclusion. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oiv73/iama_forensic_psychologist_im_an_expert_on/ccsdarm?context=5)|Excellent question. In forensic psychology generally the best way to proceed is through the idea that you're either engaging in hypothesis generation or hypothesis testing.
 |A good psychological assessment (fun fact: a psychological assessment, by definition, is a collection of tests administered for a specific purpose)... a good GOOD psychological assessment will use many disparate sources of data to generate and test hypotheses. Quality psychological testing can certainly help. The only psychological instruments I use pass the Daubert and Frye standards of expert witness admissibility... they need to be adequately standardized, have clear normative procedures, and hopefully have built-in validity measures. If they have all those things then they're solid instruments and if they're not completely irrelevant to the referral they're quite helpful.

1okj7x,19,2013-10-16,Not sure if marijuana is alleviating or causing my anxiety.,[deleted],Drugs,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/1okj7x/not_sure_if_marijuana_is_alleviating_or_causing/,"I'd like to preface by saying that prior to consuming cannabis I was already suffering from social anxiety and nervousness. Without marijuana it was really easy to fake pretend being myself and essentially be an actor throughout high school to fit in.

Weed flipped a switch I guess and made me see how stupid I looked objectively (e.g wearing trendy clothes, listening to shitty rap...ugh). I stopped pretending and started being the real me.

So from then on I smoked marijuana daily and pretty much until now because it seemed to resonate with my energy. It's been 3 years and I probably haven't gone a week without a smoke. That said, its never caused me to go into full blown panic mode. Instead, it acutely increases my awareness to the point where I start seeing myself objectively, which in turn leads anxiety in social situations. You see, I am a guy with pretty bad cystic acne who has tried everything short of accutane. Marijuana makes me realize that people can probably notice I covered my red gashes in concealer, which is like my biggest secret as a guy. Ultimately, its not the weed that causes my anxiety, its the heightened awareness that makes me see im pretty hideous and look unhealthy (due to cysts) despite drinking only water and eating more healthy than my friends. 

Anywho...I'm pretty tired of this awareness. It drains me so much to the point where currently socializing once a month is more than enough for me.

I kind of want to not care about my appearance anymore. I dont want to notice people from 100 yards and go into defense mode. I just want to excel at my internship without feeling like I am being watched, or ridiculed, or thinking I spoke way too loud because I was nervous. My brain is tired from overdrive mode.

Conversely, marijuana makes me feel good and alleviates my back pain after a day at work. It also stimulates my appetite and makes me happy to play with my pets.

Im at a crossroads with cannabis, Druggit. I've been considering trying Xanax for work days or something."

Prior to this job I had a year long internship doing software development.  I currently work as a temp for a state agency.  I am part of the 3 man ""network services"" team however my job is really internal helpdesk (desktop support), software support for proprietary software (external users), light Active Directory, light SCCM, computer imaging, workstation migration, etc.  Most of my work is ""tickets"" (we don't even really use our ticketing software, but I do have some project work too.

Anyway, my direct line is the helpdesk line.  I have no procedure, script, or any type of manual to follow.  Basically, here is how I answer the phone 

""Tech support""

Then they respond

My next question is usually ""Have you restarted your computer"".  If the answer is yes I say can ""Can I remote in?"".  I then remote in, ask them to show me the problem.  I poke around for about a minute.  After a minute if I haven't figured out the issue I put them on hold for up to 10 minutes.  If I still haven't fixed the problem I take them off hold and tell them I will look into the issue and call them back.

Does this seem like an ""ok"" procedure?"
1okf7d,5,2013-10-16,I just don't know anymore.,Bcadren,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1okf7d/i_just_dont_know_anymore/,"I can just plain warn people ahead of time; this is going to be long and vulgar for a little bit.

I am a game designer; I am an artist; I am a programmer; I am a performer.

 I am driven by the desire to bring meaningful change to the world through my artistic medium; to innovate within the medium; to paint and I've see in my dreams; and moreover to make lasting works that people will enjoy and remember me for.

I've seen myself that way for at least the last six years. I went to traditional 4-year college to better prepare myself to go out and do it. And, what I want most is to succeed as an independent, either completely by myself or with a small team.

But...I've never really finished anything. I have to levels that were satisfactory to my professors in school; but never to my own levels and more importantly, never to a level that I could actually go out and publish and have people play the game. And, for the last few months, I feel like I've completely lost my way.

See, honestly, I'm most the way through the program; finished upper level credit and literally -just- need an internship to finish; but I haven't found that. Honestly, this is out of not really putting all of my best foot forward and I'm aware of that. See after I finished everything; I ended up stuck back with my parents and the plan was over the course of a few weeks to a month I'd get what I have at least presentable to the public and set up a nice portfolio online in order to get something. What actually happened was after about three weeks of being out here my self-esteem had eroded enough that I never finished the portfolio and all I could manage were some really half-assed attempts to get some attention.

I do want an internship; especially in something that isn't currently my strong suit, like network programming; but I'm not a lifer, I don't want to be tied to a company for a very long time. I just want to be trained well enough so that my general education of all things game is enough for me to be able to be autonomous, should the need arise.

The real problem arises in my lack of support. You see; since I've been out here with parents; which are literally the only people in the world I'm not comfortable talking to, I haven't had anyone to give me direct feedback on the updates to/creation of a more complete portfolio and more importantly; I haven't had a social life in the slightest. See we live in...well, the complete middle of nowhere and since the middle of high school; I've gotten some level of cabin fever or depression during summers; due to the lack of human contact outside of my parents. 
Then as soon as I stopped working; which happened about twelve weeks ago, now. I just got completely stuck in this loop of ""I'm depressed because I'm not working."" followed by ""I can't manage to concentrate, because the depression is getting to me."", eventually snowballing into ""what exactly is the point of working anymore? I never get anything done and even if I did i have no idea if it'd make money or anyone would even care. Besides, I'm by myself and one person can't possibly make a game worth playing without some help and support."" which now with the additional stress of the student loans entering their repayment period turned into ""What's the point of doing anything; I'll never make the money to get out of this debt; I'm a worthless sack of compost and I wasted my parents money and I'm too shy around them to even talk to them about this.""

I think about potentially getting some kind of scab job; just something shitty in order to try to not default on the loan or something; but then I realize that it's only going to make it worse. It'd turn into ""I went to college to get into debt and work a shit job I could have gotten even if I fucking dropped out of high school.""

I used to have ideas; I used to have faith that something I could make even completely by myself could be relevant and enjoyed by thousands of people. Now, I can't even fucking manage to work for an hour without thinking 'what the fuck is the point, anymore?""

I have such a huge collection of ideas and projects that were done enough for school but halfdone or less as far as actually publishing goes and hell most of those, I'd need considerable seed money to pay for licenses in order to legally publish.

Occasionally for a few minutes to hours; I'll start sounding like my old self. Say I'll put out a free prototype and we'll get a kickstarter up to pay for the costs of actually publishing for profit and see how it goes; but the feeling is too damn fleeting for me to actually get shit done. I start delving back at the last point I was intelligently working on the project and maybe add a few more lines of code before going crisis again.

The situation lead to a game addiction for a bit. Playing video game, less to enjoy the game or study how it was made and more just for the escapism; to try to stop thinking about the rest of the world at all. But, it's getting so bad that I've lost the ability to emotionally hide in that anymore.

As I said earlier, my parents are very literally the only people I'm not really comfortable talking to about this. Honestly, I'm not quite sure as to why. I suppose it's because judging by the menial labor job my dad still has in his 50's and the obvious toll that it's taken on his body it feels like they've given up so much over me and given how content they are in the middle of nowhere; I don't think they'd understand how much the isolation afflicts me anyways. Every time I make an attempt to talk I wind up watching television. This isn't even really me hiding from talking in the television; this comes from the fact that when my father isn't working he's watching tv. He stays too tired to do much else and I, not really being able to talk to him, but wanting some form of emotional support, usually wind up joining.

I don't hate them; I have never really had much against them; I just -can't- manage to talk to them.

My Myer-Briggs type is ENTP, often described as 'the inventor' or 'the visionary'. At the beginning of my last semester. I took off on a journey to try to bring one of my weirder ideas to a reality. It's probably too technical for a lot of people and I like to keep my ideas secret so I won't say what exactly. I had a less than productive relationship with my adviser and never really finished what I was trying to do. On some level I feel like I owe it to myself and the school (since I did go through an undergraduate grant program) to make more prototypes (I have since had a completely different idea; that I never tried during that period; that in theory would accomplish the same thing), but honestly, every time I even start it goes back to the same thing; though even worse than the games. I -don't know- if this will work. I -don't know- that anyone would care or use it if I made it. I -don't know- if I could make any money off the technology. All I really do know is putting myself on 80-hour work weeks I'd be looking at 6-8 weeks of work, minimum...and then that's a prototype and I'd really need experts from multiple other fields to finish it. 

My self esteem and faith in my design is too low to take that path. It's just that way with everything right now. I feel like shit; the designs in my notebooks are shit; even if they did work no one would care. What it boils down to is; I only stay confident in my ideas when other people are confident in my ideas. I'm really strong at pitching things in person; but I need someone else there with me who trusts in my idea in order to really push it forward and...Out here my support is very limited to non-existent. There's just so much I have half done; though that one seems like it will remain the most important to me. 

What's really pathetic though is on the basic level; the stuff that should just be sprucing up a portfolio, should have taken a hours to days to do and I've been unable to touch for months.

I feel like I'm repeating myself now and I'm sorry.

I could talk about relationships and my past; but honestly, it's not that much of a concern right now and 'lack of dating' is very implicitly true in 'middle of nowhere' with little to no social contact. Thank you to anyone who made it this far. It's honestly helped just to bloody get it out. The only way it even comes out is times spent looking at acquaintance's FaceBook pages, wondering if my life would be different if I was in a relationship with them and started that earlier in my life. But, that's an irrelevant regret and I'm aware of that. Such thoughts only really show that I'm so currently devoid of hope that I look to hopes I could have once had in the past."
1ok3mh,6,2013-10-16,My Paranormal story (Clock),Tip14,Paranormal,https://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/1ok3mh/my_paranormal_story_clock/,"Here is a story for all the paranormal reddit people out there. First off if you don't believe it I don't care at all... There are going to parts in this story where I use (...) to explain the situation or provide detail. I am not a great lit / writing person so I am just doing the best I can to explain things, and hope that it makes sense in the end. Overall I am just posting my story no more no less. I am not seeking pity or glory. I am just posting the facts about what happened to me, and hopefully I can give some sort of advice to anyone else who has experienced this type of situation. 

(STORY)

When I was around the age of 14 my mother (whom was adopted) happened to inherit a rather ordinary clock passed down from my grandfather. My grandfather bought the clock from a yard sell 5 years before his passing. The clock sat upon his mantle for years after he purchased it, but sometime after the purchase the clock stopped working, and it was set there as pure decoration. Anyway my grandfather died of a heart attack which were deemed natural as he had already had a stroke before. My mother was upset as one would be, but after a while the heart ache died down. 

Anyway my mother went through the estate divided up all the belongs between sisters etc, and thought that having the clock would be a great piece to remember her adoptive dad by. Not long after the clock was in my mothers possession strange things began to happen around our home. It started as just simple things. For one the clock would suddenly chime around 3am (despite the fact there were no batteries in it, and it had not worked for years). This was just minor compared to what happened next. This went on for a couple of weeks, and despite the high strangest about it we just shrugged it off. After a while my mother started to complain about a presence in her room / home that seemed as if it was watching her, or was trying to do her harm. 

My mother immediately took the clock of the mantle and put it in a storage compound a few miles down the road. All paranormal activities stopped etc after the clock was removed (but for the recored if there was more going on I had no idea of it as my mother only told me these few things once I was older). Anyway fast forward several years. I was junior in college and my other passed away at the age of 45. She died of CHF (Congestive heart failure) when I was 22 (I started college late so the ages do not match up) Being the oldest of 3 brother, and the main executer of the estate I was charged with gathering all my mother's possession and bringing them back to where I lived, and then going through them (My mother had moved to Pikeville NC when I was in college, and was staying with her boyfriend, I lived in Kannapolis NC at the time, and was doing my internship for school while staying with my grandparents). So I went to Pikeville and gathered all my mother things (cars, jewelry, china, clothes etc). 

I took them back with me to my current home and only home now (my brother came with me, but my step brother went home to his real dad which my mother was in the process of divorcing). 

Form this point on of this story my brothers will be renamed so they do not warranty any attention. My brother that is blood related will be named J, and my step brother N, also my friend will be named P. 

When I went through a pile of papers my mother had I found a bill detailing a storage unit she had in Kannapolis (where i lived) she was behind on the payments, and the owner of the storage unit was going to lock it off, and sell the items inside. I thought that it would be a good idea to get to the unit and remove what was inside before all this happened. So I went to the lot smoothed things over with the owner and retrieved the items. When I first opened the door to the lot there were cobwebs every where. It looked as if no one had opened it in ages. I rummaged though all the items and retrieved what I thought were important items. I found the clock amongst the items and threw it all into the car I had, and took them back to my grandparents place. 

The clock was then placed in the basement (which me and brother now lived) at my grandparents house. Not long after the clock's arrival it would do the same thing it did before which is ding at 3am. I inspected the clock, and found that there were no batteries inside, and that the clock was fully non operational. Me and my brother J determined that it was strange what was happening, but it wasn't a big deal, and continued on with our lives. Shortly after (maybe 2 weeks) me and my brother had some strange experiences. 

First off my brother slept upstairs in a room that was empty at my grandparents. I slept downstairs in the basement with the clock because it was the only room left available. At random times when you where in the basement it felt as if something was watching you. Me and my brother J along with P felt it. We would occasionally stay downstairs, and play BO1 till late hours of the night, and well all felt this strange presence. After everyone left I would go to sleep on the bed that was in the basement. 

Sometimes I could feel this presence as I went to sleep, but being the person I am I just threw it off as being paranoid, or stupid so I would go to sleep. One night I went to bed as usual and during my sleep I saw the door to the downstairs bathroom open, and then violently shut. It scared the crap out of me multiple times, so I decide to start sleeping upstairs with my brother. On other occasions (and much more common) me my brother J, and friend P would hear footsteps echoing above us in the upstairs this freaked us out also. I remember asking my grandparents multiple times if they where awake at 3am, and were walking upstairs. 

They both said no, and it made me and my brother scared. So after several weeks of dealing with the door slams, and the footsteps we took the clock, and all my mothers belongings to a storage place he had. All the paranormal activity stopped the next day. We had moved all the items of my mother along with the clock to the storage unit. 

(5 months ago)

Fast forward to the present day. One day my Uncle called, and said that we needed to remove the items from storage, as the area we had them stored was for sale, and he needed the items out for the future owners. I was married then and I had just gotten a new home in Concord NC with my wife. Me and my Uncle never had a good relationship to begin with, and so removing the items from his storage was just a way to keep things peaceful. So me and my wife, and my father law went to the storage area and removed all the items. The clock was one of the times. 

We stored all the the things inside our garage. The strange thing began to happen the moment we brought the clock home with us. The first thing was that my dog (mini pin) would not go near the clock. She hated it barked at it any chance she got. Even when it was stored in the garage she would sit beside the door in a aggressive stance as if someone, or something was outside our home. This was rather unusual the dog never was aggressive towards anything or anyone since we had it. 

We decided that it was merely because the items stored in the garage had a strange sent she did not know. A week after having the clock it would ding again like it did before at 3am. Since it was in the garage I could barely hear it, but it was loud enough that one night I noticed it. Once agin this scared the hell out of me, and my wife as we had no idea what was going on. Weeks later the same feeling I had before came again. 

Me and my wife both felt as if something was watching us. We felt it during the day, and night. It was a constant feeling as if something was in our home. We had no idea what was going on. We were scared, and at that point I HAD to tell my wife the story behind the clock. 

She was at first doubtful, and worried that we had some how let something in our home we couldn't deal with so I promised her that after the end of the week if things did not get better we would remove the clock, and attempt to destroy it. Well before the week was out it got to the point we couldn't wait. I was sleeping one night and I felt this weird presences that someone was watching me. I couldn't put it on my mind what, but I knew something was in our bedroom, and wanted ME. All of the sudden I felt paralyzed. I couldn't move, or do anything at all. I was half way asleep, but awake fully in my mind (I can't explain this) so doing the only thing I could do I prayed. I tried to utter the name of Jesus multiple times, but my mouth just trembled. After multiple minutes of being in this state I finally was able to utter the words of ""Jesus help me!"" immediately my wife woke up, and the paralyzing effects stopped.

I was free! Whatever tried to attack me had fled, and I was now able to move, and talk with my wife. We were scared, and hurt. We had no idea what was going on, but we both knew what we had to do. The next day I put the item up for sale on ebay. It was my hope that the item would be sold to someone that could handle whatever was attached to this clock. We knew the clock was the item behind all the events going on in our home. So to make a long story shorter I sold the item on ebay for the grand sum of $10, and attached a note for the seller detailing the story, and events behind it. Below you will find the note I sent to the buyer.

(Note)

Dear Buyer,

First off I would like to thank you for purchasing this clock from me, and my family. This clock has been a burden to me, and my family for sometime. Although I do not outright believe in the paranormal there is indeed something not right about this clock. Please whatever you do with this item be careful, and I hope the things that have bothered me, and my family will not bother you.  In the box you will find the clock, and the broken part that goes inside it. I’m sorry for not cleaning it, but I felt it would be best to leave it as it is because I do not like being near or touching it much. 
As a word of caution remember that in my auction I said that I will not accept returns, or will not take the clock back it is now YOURS, and whatever comes with it. I will say that I will if you have any questions I will do my best to help you if you feel so inclined below you will find my email address as well as phone number please contact me via email first rather than phone, as I usually do not have my phone with me. I would also like to point out that if you are a paranormal investigator, or something of that nature I do not want to be part of an investigation. Please do not contact me with those requests. I will however answer questions if needed be, but my family and me want no fame, or interest from this clock.  We are just happy it is out of our possession. 

PS: As I stated in the auction I did not guarantee that you would experience paranormal activity from purchasing this clock. If you haven’t then I’m sorry, but please do not file complaints, or false advertising about the clock as I do from time to time sell items on ebay and I care about my reputation. Once again I hope that with this clock you find whatever it is your looking for, or whatever experience you are hoping to have.

Sincerely,
The Tipton Family

(PS)

So there is my story it maybe strange, and it my seem unlikely, but it is MY story. I hope that anyone who reads this will be able to cop with the paranormal. There are strange things that happen in this world there are things that we do not fully understand my hope is that one day someone comes across this posting, and can re assured that there is a way out, and you can with faith remove whatever is haunting you with a strong faith in God, and Jesus. 

Sincerely, 
Tip14

1ojw2f,5,2013-10-15,Chem Grad School Advice Needed,DeltaZeta9,chemistry,https://www.reddit.com/r/chemistry/comments/1ojw2f/chem_grad_school_advice_needed/,"I am struggling with the decision to attend grad school and would greatly appreciate any words of advice from current students, prospective students, or alumni. Here is where I stand:

* 5th year undergrad, Specialization Program (finished April 2014)
* Completed Industrial Internship in Analytical Chem (Oil and Gas)
* Interested in nanoscience, alternative energy, oil and gas, materials chemistry.
* GPA ~ 3.6

However, there are a few things I must also consider: 

* I'm 24
* I have a guaranteed job with my internship company when I'm finished. Currently working there part time.
* My GF also works there (graduated April 2012, BSc Biology)
* She wants to move our relationship forward. AKA move in together, make money, house, pets, etc.
* Few chem PhD positions within company.
* Do not want to stay in academia long term. Industry is favourable.


So I ask: Would it be more beneficial to go on to grad school (MSc or PhD), delay starting my life, miss out on 3-5 yrs of wages, put off our future in order to secure a better life later?

Or

Stay with the company, continue to be promoted (cannot reach PhD ceiling), obtain P.Chem, start life and enjoy more freedoms while I'm young?"

Questions|Answers
:--|:--
[What is the most creative way that you've punished a student?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oi73o/iaman_assistant_principal_ama/ccs5cdl?context=5)|Last year, a student used Chrome's dev. tools in class to do a mockup vandalized version of our school's home page, using lots of awful language (the kind of dumb stuff you see on Xbox Live). He freaked out his teacher, who thought he was editing the live site. I had him create an online resource guide -- basically an annotated bibliography -- about appropriate classroom tech. use, ways not to use ""gay"" as a pejorative, etc. There were a few other things, but that was the big one that seemed to work out okay.
 |Edit: (removed a) typo.
 |Edit 2: clarified time/setting.
[Why was he punished if he was working on his own fake site?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oi73o/iaman_assistant_principal_ama/ccs8gc0?context=5)|It was on the classroom laptop during instructional time. He also was distracting other students with his haha-funny work. The misuse of the computer violates the Acceptable Use Policy covering use of technology. His behavior was a disruption to other students. And the language was inappropriate for a school setting.
[Whats your stance on religious in schools? Do the kids in your school do the pledge to the flag every morning like in the movies? I always wondered if this was real as it seems like the kind of thing you would see in North Korea or anywhere with an ultra-nationalist, over controlling government. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oi73o/iaman_assistant_principal_ama/ccs5fto?context=5)|In one school district I've worked in, yes, they do the Pledge every morning at the beginning of the TV announcements; they don't in the other. Some students actually enjoy it, and that's swell; others are smart enough (and/or cynical enough) to wonder themselves why they do it.
[What do you think about the school that recently banned all balls from recess to prevent further injuries? Do you think PTAs and parents should be able to push their influence onto the schools and all the children in them?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oi73o/iaman_assistant_principal_ama/ccs6ofa?context=5)|I haven't heard that story -- where'd it happen?
 |I think parents, individually in groups and as a whole, should have input into what happens at a school, and that administrators should seriously listen. Parents have eyeballs on children outside of school, in a totally different context than we see them; 99+% of parents I've communicated with have been tremendously helpful and communicative in trying to help their kid and the school.
 |I do get concerned, generally (i.e. I haven't had to deal with this first-hand) of a PTA or parent group having a skewing influence on the school. An issue that gets the most or loudest attention is not necessarily the one that is most pressing for the school as a whole. But sometimes that disconnect comes from a lack of communication between a parent group and the school leadership, and not parental cluelessness. Most parents seem pretty well informed and reasonable about the things they know to be informed/reasonable about.
[It was in Long Island, NY. Link to www.cnn.com.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oi73o/iaman_assistant_principal_ama/ccs72z0?context=5)|Huh. Sounds like there's an immediate set of circumstances that led to the change. The district's press release ([Link to www.portnet.k12.ny.us](http://www.portnet.k12.ny.us/site/default.aspx?PageType=3&amp;DomainID=1&amp;ModuleInstanceID=1781&amp;ViewID=047E6BE3-6D87-4130-8424-D8E4E9ED6C2A&amp;RenderLoc=0&amp;FlexDataID=13302&amp;PageID=1) says this is tied specifically to construction. The school has also provided softer balls so kids can still muck about. There are also other hardball games available at other times/venues. Having gone through a couple of school renovations, I can easily imagine -- heck, recall -- circumstances when we were concerned about students' unstructured time/running near equipment and uneven ground.
 |Be sure to check in again once the construction site is cleared out and the space returned to the school.
[Many places seem to have a lot of the ""Bystander Effect"" going on when the most shrill and neurotic members of the group dream up some new shortsighted or hairbrained policy.  Link to demotivators.despair.com.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oi73o/iaman_assistant_principal_ama/ccs93lf?context=5)|There's some of that, plus I think some eyerolling. The parents I perceive as whackadoodle tend also to be on PTAs' whackadoodle lists, too.
[Are you in a district with zero tolerance policies, and what do you think of policies of that nature and what do you think of the common core curriculum? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oi73o/iaman_assistant_principal_ama/ccs60jl?context=5)|A primer on my thoughts re. ""zero-tolerance"" policies: [Link to www.reddit.com](http://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/1of5ni/honors_student_tries_giving_drunk_friend_ride/ccriul2)
 |I don't quite know what ""zero-tolerance"" actually means vis-a-vis school discipline. There are, however, lots of instances in which a school is compelled by state law to respond to student behavior with a particular set of consequences -- akin, I suspect, to mandatory minimums. Policies like that can help reduce inconsistencies between schools and reduce inconsistencies between student populations. I suspect legislators focus also on ""sending a message."" These can also help reduce inconsistencies between administrators within a single school, but I think that's a need better addressed internally that by state law.
 |The flip side to mandatory sanctions in school discipline is that you will encounter circumstances where the mandated sanction isn't the best fit for the misbehavior. They don't take into effect history, context, or other circumstances that might make you inclined toward an alternative consequence.
 |Regardless, every state's constitution identified free and appropriate public education as a right; students and families have a property right to education, with commensurate due process protections when a school system decides it wants to take it away. A one-day suspension has a chain of appeal, and so, too, does a school's recommendation for expulsion.
 |I think the Common Core Standards look pretty decent in the content areas where they are developed. There is no ""Common Core curriculum,"" despite what some publishers might think: the standards are essential skills and knowledge, but I think schools and teacher-teams are often in the best position to decide the curriculum (i.e. the delivery device -- texts, pedagogy, labs, etc.) they use to help students achieve mastery.
[How does one become an assistant principal? Not asking in that condescending way Bender asked the janitor in The Breakfast Club, either. It's a job I'd genuinely like to do. What degree do I need? What internships? What kind of jobs should I do prior?  PS: Eat my shorts. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oi73o/iaman_assistant_principal_ama/ccs831n?context=5)|You should start off as a teacher, and being a good, credible one. From there, most folks will pursue a degree program for administration. Look for one that has a strong focus on developing a small cohort, is taught by current practicing administrators, and will connect you with a meaningful internship. Some of the best admin. prep. programs are geared toward the school district building their own: they identify folks internally, partner with a nearby university, and have their own current admin. teaching, setting the students up to intern in their own schools, and then they usually get vacancies left by retiring/moving people. A lot of being a good administrator is knowing whom to call outside your building when you need help, and programs like that help you build relationships with those people.
[What do you actually do?  What is your typical workday like?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oi73o/iaman_assistant_principal_ama/ccs5ndp?context=5)|School starts at about 8:15; I'm in by 7, looking at emails that've come in overnight. Try to finagle my calendar and figure out where I'm going to be when I have holes -- usually, that means blocking off time to drop into classrooms.
 |About 10 minutes before the bell rings, I head out of the office and check out the bike cages and the drop-off areas, just to wave at kids and parents and make sure folks aren't crashing into each other. Occasionally, I get a call to cover a class while a teacher is caught up in traffic.
 |During the day: it varies. Two days a week are heavily dominated by meetings. The other days, I'm usually in classrooms, chatting with teachers about what they're doing, or walking the building with my eyes on infrastructure/maintenance (I supervise custodial and technology needs).
 |When students get into trouble, I sometimes get called down to address it. Depending on what's going on, I might send a student back to class until I can investigate further; other times, I'll start to address it immediately. It depends.
 |End of the day looks pretty similar to the beginning of the day.
 |Afternoons, catch up on all the emails I missed walking around the building. Start to figure out what my priorities are the next day.
 |This is kind of a skeletal description. My biggest responsibilities are safety &amp; security and supervising/coaching teachers; I spend most of my brain power thinking through those. I have sundry other areas of responsibility: technology, custodians, plus other acute projects/responsibilities as the need arises.
[Thanks.  Sounds like a lot of work.  I like (and I am guessing you like\) that you are still involved in the teaching aspects and that it's not all ""driving a desk"" so to speak.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oi73o/iaman_assistant_principal_ama/ccs68zj?context=5)|Some of the most fun I have as an administrator is stepping in to cover a class. Just doing a little warm-up and asking about what they're learning is a highlight.
[Assistant Principal or Assistant to the principal?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oi73o/iaman_assistant_principal_ama/ccsb6ax?context=5)|Yes.
[If school staff were allowed to obtain and use a concealed handgun permit while working at the school, would you encourage your staff to carry a concealed handgun at the school?  Do you think that doing so would reduce or increase gun-related school violence?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oi73o/iaman_assistant_principal_ama/ccs8d76?context=5)|I would not encourage staff to arm themselves. I don't have any notion of whether there'd be an impact on gun-related violence in schools -- such violence is so rare that even one or two tick marks in one direction or another would be a huge influence on the statistical bottom line.
 |However, I would be concerned about teachers', students', and parents' anxiety about whether there is a weapon in the classroom. I don't think any of the parents I've met would feel comfortable with a weapon, even in trained civilian hands, in the classroom every day.
[What is your stance on standardized tests and our current education system? In my opinion, it is a failing system and we should take a look into the Norwegian education system as a model for ours.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oi73o/iaman_assistant_principal_ama/ccs6trs?context=5)|I've seen teachers develop and use common assessments across their classrooms, then bring the scores back to share instructional and re-teaching strategies -- that's very cool and an effective practice. However, the bigger district, state, and national standardized tests aren't there yet: score-reporting can be slow and per-pupil performance data is vague. We do have too large a focus on these individual assessments. (Unfortunately, too often the local measure of performance -- students' grades -- are fluff and inconsistent; they're not always a reliable or valid measure.)  I hadn't heard about the Norwegian model, but it looks interesting. Florida's legislature a few years ago proposed the notion of high school students picking a ""major"" as a course of study, e.g. if you plan to study engineering, you can be exempted from a language or phys. ed. requirement. Not sure where that went. Plus, it was Florida, which is pretty much the boondocks of anything K12-related.
[Do you think you'll work in education for the rest of your life?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oi73o/iaman_assistant_principal_ama/ccs63f6?context=5)|I think so. I haven't yet made up my mind about what route interests me: I have aspirations for the principalship, but I'm also fascinated by ed. tech. and am curious about opportunities there. I have a longer-term desire to get my doctorate and re-invent teacher education, but that's a ways off.
[You said u have high school experience so what is your personal advice for teens in high school who want to be successful?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oi73o/iaman_assistant_principal_ama/ccs6jh8?context=5)|Try to find balance: you don't need to be a triple-varsity athlete with six AP classes and serve as editor of the newspaper to be successful. ""Success"" also requires health and happiness.
 |Don't let your parents live vicariously through you.
 |There's no shame in not being college bound, but push yourself to do well academically so it remains an option for you later.
[What is the craziest thing a student has been caught doing?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oi73o/iaman_assistant_principal_ama/ccs68kb?context=5)|I caught a kid once writing in Sharpie on a bathroom shelf. Not the biggest thing from my perspective, but for this particular child to get caught doing something even remotely bad was ... crazy.
 |I'm struggling with this question. I've had students punch walls and threaten police officers, come to school high, destroy their own property, and fight their grandmother (I got bruised stepping between that one). They were all frustrating and upsetting, but not quite crazy: all of them with anxious, angry, and desperate.
[As a student...I hope you realize A LOT of students come to school high.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oi73o/iaman_assistant_principal_ama/ccs99ps?context=5)|Yes, and a few drunk -- and that's just the school day; games and other events are a whole other mess. I really wish, particularly at the high school level, our teachers were consistently engaging enough that students wouldn't want to come in under the influence. And also that for the kids who are self-medicating because of how despondent they are about X, we were all better at identifying and responding to it.
[You have to tell us the grandmother story.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oi73o/iaman_assistant_principal_ama/ccs96p2?context=5)|Grandmother was the kid's legal guardian. We had a meeting at the beginning of the year, just to touch base: I had a good relationship with both, but there was some stress between the two of them. At the end of the meeting, grandma handed the kid his phone, which she'd confiscated a couple of days before. However, the lock screen code didn't work, and he thought grandma had changed it. He stepped close to her, got in her face. She pulled a hand back, and he grabbed her wrist. Then she whacks him with her *other* hand, and kicks *me* right in the shin as I try to wedge them apart.
 |School resource office stepped in, had a talking-to with her, and then him. Even with their normal level of straining, it was pretty aberrant for both of them; they were both weeping in each other's arms about 15 minutes later, while I was showing off my bruise to the other administrators.
[I'm a substitute teacher in an area where teaching jobs are very competitive, what are ways that I can stand out against the other subs? What types of traits do you like to see in a sub?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oi73o/iaman_assistant_principal_ama/ccsbssi?context=5)|Show up on time, for one. You don't want a reputation for being a sub. the AP (who probably hires for that department) needs to cover for.
 |Try to meet the teachers in a school or two where you frequently sub; attach a face to your name. Make your desire known in the department/content area you're interested. Have lunch with them. Ask them for some short lessons/activities to keep in your back pocket so that if a sub lesson plan runs short, you have something you can lead with the kids.
 |If you have a good relationship with a teacher or two, work with them on their sub plan, and perhaps something instructional that you can do with the kids. After you do that a couple of times, ask the AP to observe.
 |Hopefully, you can get to the point where a teacher or administrator can write a good letter of recommendation for you for grad./certificate school or for a teaching position.
[Student here, I know that you guys are just doing you job most of the time, but do you ever feel pleasure at the fact that you are punishing a bad kid?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oi73o/iaman_assistant_principal_ama/ccsb7wu?context=5)|I haven't met too many ""bad"" kids -- maybe one or two. It is frustrating and sad to dole out *punishment.*
 |Sometimes ""punishment"" is kind of fun: NB the note elsewhere about a kid's annotated bibliography. Other times, punishment is a lunchtime detention...with me. And then we talk about video games and life and the kid leaves knowing there's at least one adult he has a decent relationship with.
 |Dealing with student misbehavior is a huge time suck. It can take an hour+ to conduct an investigation and contact parents, and then many hours beyond that if I'm assembling a packet of information for a recommendation for expulsion or have to participate in a manifestation determination review for a student with special education needs. Imagine, instead, I spent that hour working with teachers on strategies to calm students down or redirect their energy, or how to identify a student in emotional distress before they become disruptive. I'd much rather invest time in the preventative end than the ""autopsy-data,"" after-the-face end.
[Have you ever worked with a colleague who didn't care, didn't like kids, or otherwise made you question why they were working in education? How would you as part of the administration address such an issue?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oi73o/iaman_assistant_principal_ama/ccs8tmy?context=5)|Yes. One of them was so regimented and structure-focused that she had no flexibility with students and was draconian in her classroom management. She wound up transferring to a smaller alternative program where she teaches one-on-one with students who are often going through the criminal justice system. Last report I got from her supervising administrator over there is that it is a good fit, and that working with very small groups of kids has made her soften up just enough that the students feel comfortable approaching her. Her attentiveness toward structure and predictable routines is a boon.
 |Here's another one: my first year as an administrator I had a teacher who just was not a good fit with the department and who seemed not to like kids. Had a big chip on his shoulder. Most damning, he was not receptive to feedback and support from me or his colleague. But, gosh darn it, he liked his job. It took me a year-and-a-half of documentation, communication, and trying time and time again, but he ultimately resigned.
 |Most teachers, though, are awesome. Some of them lose sight that what they intend students to learn, or that what they intend to convey to colleagues, isn't always what comes across. And almost everyone loses steam at some point. And almost everyone says something really really dumb they wish they could take back. And that's why I'm around. I see myself as a coach for teachers. And occasional cheerleader.
[Did you have to have your parent call the school telling them you are out sick?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oi73o/iaman_assistant_principal_ama/ccs9sce?context=5)|My parents are DEAD ... *SLAP*
[In our school district there seems to be an adversarial relationship between teachers and administrators.   There seem to be constant battles over working hours, student discipline, required meetings and training, etc.  Is that true in most districts?  Or is that just unique to California? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oi73o/iaman_assistant_principal_ama/ccs8p8a?context=5)|My understanding is that California in particular struggles with issues like this. I've worked in both strong- and non-union districts, and that is one of the big culture differences between the two. I've found that a good principal can help alleviate some of that friction, either through clear and deliberative planning or, failing that, a great smile.
 |However, even in my non-union system, teachers would balk at last-minute meetings, useless trainings, inconsistent discipline. I can totally understand being frustrated by all of these. I posted earlier that part of my normal day includes a ton of meetings two days of the week: at both this and my last school, much of that meeting time was to check on whether we were using teachers' non-classroom time effectively, communicating well, etc.
[What salary range are you in as an assistant principal?    What qualifications did you have to become an assistant principal?    How old were you when you became the assistant principal? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oi73o/iaman_assistant_principal_ama/ccsmo8u?context=5)|Assistant principal salary ranges are ... ranges. An AP in some parts of the country will pull the real-dollar value equivalent of a principal or superintendent elsewhere. But, adjusted for cost of living, I don't think there are too-huge discrepancies. When I became an AP, my salary went up by about 25% over what I'd made as a teacher. Part of that, though, was due to going from a 10-month to an 11.5-month contract.
[Is the salary 6 figures?  Just trying to get an idea ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oi73o/iaman_assistant_principal_ama/ccso6r0?context=5)|Yes, some AP salaries, particularly in highly affluent districts, are $100K+ (but not much more +).
[What kind of student were you? Did you have many discipline problems?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oi73o/iaman_assistant_principal_ama/ccsd3a6?context=5)|The only discipline issue I was busted for was in elementary. Senior year of high school, I and the other student newspaper editor released a jerky underground newspaper right before graduation.
 |Academically, I stunk at math, did great in English, and was meh elsewhere. I took a few AP classes but didn't get bogged down. Did a few clubs, most notably student newspaper; got a few big awards for that. Did school well enough to get into a solid out-of-state state school.
[No offense, but why is the *assistant* principal always the asshole, as opposed to the principal?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oi73o/iaman_assistant_principal_ama/ccshuut?context=5)|I tend to see that at high schools, the principal often has a broader, strategic view of the school and is more heavily involved with behind-the-scenes issues (finance, student activities, special programs). The mass of Things To Do in terms of day-to-day operations -- including handling student discipline -- lands with the APs. I'm sure there are plenty of folks older than you who knew your principal when he/she was an AP, and they might've though he/she was an asshole then.
[My last assistant principal put me in jail for using sidewalk chalk at school.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oi73o/iaman_assistant_principal_ama/ccshuut?context=5)|For what it's worth, my last principal a couple of times was receptive to me convincing him that a student deserved a diminished punishment for misbehavior -- or, hearing my update, he would convince me to cut it back. Regardless of who pushed it, he always told me to tell the kid and the parent that he was the one asking for a more severe punishment and that I was the one who talked him down: precisely because the high school APs have more day-to-day relations with kids, he knew that that kind of message might get me a favor, or at least some compliance, down the road.
[I'm interested in potentially becoming a school psychologist (ideally doctorate level in California\). I've heard conflicting opinions on the job outlook and description -- e.g., difficult market, high burnout rate. Do you have any thoughts on the nature of the career?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oi73o/iaman_assistant_principal_ama/ccsbnk4?context=5)|At my current and last schools, I've worked with amazing school psychologists; I've adored both, and their support with students at, or nearly at, a cliff's edge was tremendous.
 |I don't know the various routes of endorsement/certification for school psychology. The position itself involves a lot of time working with students with emotional needs, and it also usually means administering and scoring psychological testing as part of the evaluation process for special education services. Both of those I'm certain are emotionally taxing. The psychologist is often part of the IEP team for students who receive special educational support, and as an expert in the room, I've seen the psychologist sometimes become the focus of different-minded parents and advocates target the psychologist specifically -- again, taxing. So, I can understand reports of burnout.
 |As for the market itself, again, sorry, I don't know much about the outlook.
[I once had a teacher who despised and picked on me in middle school, wrote me up and whatnot for no reason. A lot of the time my Assistant Principle for that grade who I was really close with would throw out the referrals. I was just wondering how much authority you have to decide if a student gets punished or not?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oi73o/iaman_assistant_principal_ama/ccs9cbb?context=5)|I have a lot of authority with that: unless the principal overrides me, or I get additional relevant information, my decision about addressing student behavior for a student on my caseload stands.
 |If the teacher is writing superfluous referrals, I need to speak with the teacher about the volume/triggers for writing up the kid. At my last school, about five teachers (out of 100+) were responsible for ~35% of all discipline referrals. With one teacher I supervised, I required him to write his referrals with me; often, we decided it was an issue the teacher himself could handle.
 |I'm curious as to whether your AP ever went back to the teacher, and I wonder whether the teacher was trying to ding not just you, but also to irritate the AP who never did anything to squash you like a bug.
[In your professional experience, is bullying ignored or is something actually done about it on schools? I know that bullying at school is a small part of it but school is where it begins. What say you..](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oi73o/iaman_assistant_principal_ama/ccs89w9?context=5)|In my experience across several schools, as a teacher and administrators, when we hear about it, we do something about it. I've found teachers to be pretty good about reporting up their concerns around bullying and harassment, and as administrators, we in turn respond pretty quickly.
 |We're sometimes stymied, though, by lack of information from or follow-up at home. I've had a few students report to me that they told their parents weeks/months ago about being bullied, but the parents did not share that information with the school to do something sooner. I've also had some parents commit to take action at home -- such as calling a cell phone provider to block a number or to contact Facebook to report an offending post/account*, and then heard later that they didn't. (*Facebook has been very good in my experience about responding to parents/families when they raise the flag about harassing content -- and they've also been very consistent that they will only take action in response to a parent/family request, and not in response to a school request.)
 |For anyone interested, I highly recommend ""Sticks and Stones"" by Emily Bazelon ([Link to www.amazon.com](http://www.amazon.com/Sticks-Stones-Defeating-Rediscovering-Character/dp/0812992806).)
[Im a junior and I don't really get in trouble or anything. I actually kind of fly under the radar and my school is pretty nice. I always wondered what teachers thought of kids like me. Are we as fun or as annoying as the troublemakers? Are the honors students the clear favorite or does being a teachers pet make them less desirable? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oi73o/iaman_assistant_principal_ama/ccso5s8?context=5)|Teachers are pretty good reads of personality; some knuckleheads always getting into trouble are nevertheless staff favorites, and the opposite can be true for some great-grade-getters. Teachers can be frustrated when a student seems to be apathetic or to have no affect -- beyond that, though, if you're a nice person who does honest work, we think the world of you.
 |I'll put it this way, too: I taught probably ~1,500 students as a classroom teacher or program director before I became an assistant principal. Probably every single one of them was, for at least a moment, my favorite kid in the class. They answered a question right or helped a kid out or reminded me to do something, and I was grateful. Chances are, even if you're an under-the-radar kind of person, you've been someone's absolute favorite student at least once, even if only for a moment.
[What do you think of National Board Certification?  Does it make a difference in your hiring decisions?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oi73o/iaman_assistant_principal_ama/ccs9bv2?context=5)|I did not get my Board certification, but I helped a friend and I was floored by the process. A lot of it seemed whacko, but I suppose that's what you need for a nationwide portfolio submission.
 |It might help move a resume into an interview pile, but on the whole it has not been a big hiring influencer for me.
[If you could have any job aside from assistant principal, what would it be?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oi73o/iaman_assistant_principal_ama/ccs7wyl?context=5)|That's a tough one. I'd enjoy working on the policy/logistics side of ed. tech.
[I want to become a teacher. I am a UCSC undergrad, going for a Latin America Studies Major, with a minor in Sociology. Any advice? I plan on applying for CITY YEAR, TFA or the Masters Program here at School.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oi73o/iaman_assistant_principal_ama/cct14ff?context=5)|I don't know anything about City Year, and I'm hugely wary (and that's an understatement) of TFA. For a while, I thought TFA might be a good stepping stone for people who need ""teacher cred"" before shifting more toward ed. policy things; now, though, there's so much baggage around TFA, and the TFA experience is so wonky, that I don't think it even carries that much cachet among wonks outside a particular political sphere.
 |My best advice to become a teacher is to go through a master's program. Look for one with a nice, long field experience, preferably with partnerships with nearby school districts that themselves put in resources toward teacher training and support. You will need to have undergraduate or grad. credit hours relevant to your content area (at least at the middle or high school levels; I don't know what the specific course area requirements for ""highly qualified""ness is at elementary), so you might start jumping into those now.
[Do you believe that schooling has become increasingly revolved around test scores rather than content comprehension?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oi73o/iaman_assistant_principal_ama/cctaqgy?context=5)|I think even ""content comprehension"" is an insufficiently high bar. As a teacher first and now an administrator, I want students to be able to apply their skills and knowledge *beyond* the content I/teachers provide, and make connections with novel material.
[Junior right now.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oi73o/iaman_assistant_principal_ama/cctaqgy?context=5)|There is too strong a focus on test scores. Data can be useful to start a discussion or in making decisions, but it is not an end-all snapshot of student or teacher performance. No scientist, after all, just publishes a spreadsheet of statistics and says, ""Here ya go; science done"" without reflection, commentary, interpretation, notions of what happens next, etc.
[How do you protect children from each other?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oi73o/iaman_assistant_principal_ama/ccsngko?context=5)|Most of it comes down to kids' relationships with teachers, and teachers being good observers of their students. Kids sometimes are also good advocates, either for themselves or their friends, when need arises. When students do harass or harm each other, there are a few things we might do: behavior contracts, schedule changes, escalating consequences for violating personal space, referral to outside counseling, or any number of other things I'm not thinking of.
[How is your school behavior and test score wise? I am a student at an extremely good public school and am just curious.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oi73o/iaman_assistant_principal_ama/ccsmwh9?context=5)|At one school where I've been an AP, behavior could be pretty egregious: fights, a few assaults, twice having the school resource officer handcuff a student (to keep them safe: they were punching the walls hard enough their knuckles bled). At another school, behavior is much less intense. Testing wise, the schools where I've been have all done pretty well.
[I teach arts in an after school program in a reputable school in NYC with kids K-5 and I graduated HS not long ago. From my own experience as a student and observing young children,  I can't but to notice how our nation's education system makes schooling no different than -say- Ford or GM's assembly line. They're just being pushed from station to station and treated as if we all learn at the same pace and using the same methods. With this in mind, from your experience, do you think that our current education system works for the children of today, and do you have any thoughts on how could it be improved, at least in your district? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oi73o/iaman_assistant_principal_ama/ccsdl7f?context=5)|I think it's remarkable, in a bad way, that education is still anchored the Carnegie units of seat time for instruction. The tick-tock timetable probably does an okay job for a lot of kids, but it vastly underserves both struggling students and students who are ready to learn at a faster pace.
[Would you identify more with South Park or Simpson principle? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oi73o/iaman_assistant_principal_ama/ccsxi2p?context=5)|Simpsons. His heart is in the right place.

How do you deal with something like this.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oi73o/iaman_assistant_principal_ama/ccs8d70?context=5)|I've met lots of students with Autism Spectrum Disorder as a teacher and administrator. Some fit in great, and others really struggle. For the latter, we pay particular attention to whether they are identified to receive appropriate services in school -- some students with autism benefit from a 504 plan (so named after the relevant federal code) for general education or an individualized education plan for special education. (And lots of kids with autism don't receive either.) If folks are concerned about making friends, we might try to coach them into joining a club, showcase some of their work...there're lots of options. It depends.

1oogy8,5,2013-10-17,[FR] Having some confidence is awesome.,Fender1310,seduction,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/1oogy8/fr_having_some_confidence_is_awesome/,"Hello guys,

Let me preface this by saying that before I knew seddit I did not know shit about anything in life, at all. Reading everything up here, getting it confirmed by friends made me rethink how I act around people, not only girls, in general. Seddit turned my life to the better.

Let's get started now.

I work in a small fries stand in a mall and I regularly meet girls and we talk to them (my co-worker) and we occasionally get numbers. By we, I actually mean him, he gets numbers. Applying my knowledge from here and copying him I landed a few numbers as well.
The first thing I noticed was that Eye Contact **is so extremely important!**
I cannot stress enough how much differently girls look at me when I look them in the eyes the whole time while they order. Some are in awe that I can operate the register while smiling at me, others just like my smile and small talk.

However, I never built upon that, quite the contrary always occured. My co-worker always took the initiative and told a few nice one liners and got the numbers. He did it just for fun though, as he has a gilfriend already. He always tells me that this is the way to learn and honestly, he is right. Getting rejected is the way to learn, getting your ""numbers"" stolen teaches you how to get them yourself, the best way possible. I finally build upon this.


One day a group of girls comes by and one of them is especially talkative. My co-worker was not there at that time and I striked up a nice chat. She was clearly into me and she left without anything happening. The next day she came with a friend and I was just chilling at work, not actually working (I have nothing better to do, anyway). She recognized me and we all talked and I just went for it. She talked about doing an internship at the stand but it was just for the sake of talking.

I told her, ""Write in your number"", and she did.

I felt fucking amazing.

What followed was 2 hours talking with her and her friend. Her friend wanted to leave but she (lets call her Agnes) did not want to. In the end they did but she did promise to come by again tomorrow. That day I actually worked and she came 20 minutes before closing down. We started to chat again and my co-worker described me as being very aggressive, confident but not quite arrogant. He told me that I really showed what I wanted early on by telling her that I want to go to her place. I told her she should stay till I am done with work and we drive to her place. She shyly told me that her bus was coming too early and that she wanted to leave. After all she stayed and we went to the bus stop together. Me, Agnes and my co-worker waited and I talked on with her. 

At this point I realized that I need to escalate or else I fail. She did not mind me touching her back, so I pulled her by her hip closer to myself. 

My Co-Worker saw that she was quite hesitant and what he did next was awesome and I love him for it. He became the most awesome wingman ever.

He calmly said: ""Look, Agnes, our bus is coming and you obviously want him and he wants you, kiss him and get it over already""

At that moment he left for the bus and I grabbed Agnes by her hip, pulled her into mine and she went for a hug. I was devastated as my co-worker watched me from behind and gestured me to go for it.

I pushed her a tiny bit back and looked her in her eyes. At that moment I neared for her lips but she still hesitated. I boldly said: ""Yes, or No?"" and we kissed. She asked: ""Happy now?"" and I just left with a smile.

I still drove with my co-worker and he was proud of me. I am proud of myself.


Seddit, I never thought the day would come that I could use what I learned from here, but it came and I am more than happy. This is just the step in the right direction.


Thank you seddit, thank you for everything."
1oobig,9,2013-10-17,"I've [21M] been seeing someone who is way too young (16f) for me for last four months. Is it possible that it works out, or should I just end it?",ThisIsTrouble,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1oobig/ive_21m_been_seeing_someone_who_is_way_too_young/,"I'm going to change some minor details like names/locations for privacy (and am using a throwaway account for that reason). This really isn't an issue I can go to people I trust IRL over, so I'm here. I'll try to keep this as short as possible, and I appreciate the time anyone puts into reading it. 

This June, I met someone during a pool party. I was at a friends' place and they were throwing a pool party and his friend's younger sister had some friends over too. Somehow, I ended up talking to one of the sister's friends for a long time and we exchanged numbers. I knew that she was younger than me, and I still talked to her and flirted with her. So that is completely, 100% on me. I don't know what it says about me. 

She texted me later that night, and we fell into this amazing, easy conversation. It was just so much fun talking to her, and she was so smart and cool and funny. That first night, we were texting until something like 5AM. The next few days were pretty similar, and we got to know each other really, really well. I asked her out about a week after we started texting, and we just went to a movie and had ice-cream after. We didn't do anything beyond holding hands. 

We had a really good time, even though the movie wasn't that great (The Bling Ring fwiw). I immediately had regrets and second thoughts, and became super worried about her age. I'm 21 and a University Junior, and she is 16 now, but was 15 when we first met. Which is super, super young. I don't really have a defense. I knew how old she was, and that she was too young when I met her. Its just that she is so, so fucking pretty and then has this amazing personality, that I lost track. I did wise up after that first date, and just stopped talking to her because I realized this was really, really stupid and I was falling for her. 

The not talking lasted like 4 days, until I gave in and answered her texts. She was telling me that it was really not nice for me to just drop off after telling her that I really liked her, and I started to feel guilty. That led to us going back to texting, and then calls every night. She wanted to meet up, and I avoided it for like two weeks. Kept making excuses, because I was aware of my feelings for her, and like the right/wrong thing to do. 

I just also want to say this, because it might seem like I'm an awful person reading this. I've never messed around with anyone around Emily's age before. At all. I'm also (normally) smart. I go to a top-ten university for undergrad. I've had great internships, I volunteer, etc. The point is I'm not a shit-head who hits on underaged girls normally. 

To kind of speed this up, later in June, Emily and I met up again. We had a fun date, and then fooled around. We didn't have sex then. After that point, though we were spending all of our free time together, and a couple weeks later we did have sex. It was the day after her birthday, so she was 16, if that makes it any better. The rest of the summer was just so much fun, and we were both really, really happy. We had to keep things kind of a secret because of the age thing, and that kind of made us grow closer to one another. Like an us v. everyone else feeling. We both said I love you to one another, and the relationship was really, really serious. 

I went back to school in September, and we had a really emotional, going away talk, where we both were crying, and we agreed to just see where things go. I'm in school about a three hour flight away from her, so it isn't like we can see each other regularly. We've been talking every single day, and she had her parents fly her out here a couple weeks ago, under the guise of wanting to visit my undergrad and see a friend. We had an amazing weekend, and then the same really difficult saying bye deal. 

At first, I did have a lot of regrets and guilt about the age thing. Its technically not legal, but from what I understand not a felony, and not really enforced. But it is still possible that something could go wrong. I'm also 5 years older than her and she is in high school. It should be weird. I just love her more than I've ever loved anyone before, and I know she feels the same way about me. It is just so perfect when we are together. I don't want to give up on that. 

I haven't really tried to pursue anything with anyone else, and for all intents and purposes we are in a long distance relationship. I'm not a fool, and I think the odds are stacked against us staying together. Its like a very, very low chance it works out. I'm going to be studying abroad in London starting in January, and I've been feeling like us calling things off before might be the best bet. It is probably fair to her in that it'll let her be a normal girl in high school, and not like juggling a long-distance relationship with some older guy and it'll let me experience studying abroad fully. I just don't want to have regrets and end up losing her, when she is seriously nearly perfect for me. We just get one another so well, and I don't think I'll find that with just anyone. And I know breaking up with her, would break her heart. She depends on me for so much, and she loves me so much too. So I don't know. 

I just want some guidance and advice from people that have been through something similar. Hopefully, people can look beyond just the ages and ugggh. Thanks for reading this fully if you finished the entire post. 

**tl;dr I (21m) met a girl (16f) over the summer, who I knew was too young for me. We hit it off though, and started to talk a lot, and just fit so well together. I tried ending things, but ended up still talking to her. We had an intense summer romance, and have been essentially dating since then after I went back to University. I'm going to study abroad next semester, and have been thinking that calling things off might be a good idea, but don't know if it is or isn't.** "

1onygi,7,2013-10-17,"[need advice] Currently in a software-engineering internship until the end of the year, but a contractor agency wants to hire me to work for a major gaming company.",narett,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1onygi/need_advice_currently_in_a_softwareengineering/,"The internship pays 25.00 hourly.  This is 5 bucks more than my first job out of college as a Tech Support Technician at a call center.

The major gaming company (I'd throw the name out but I want to play it safe for now) has a position open whose qualifications match with what I do at my internship, except with video game engines instead of corporate software.

A contractor company invited me to an interview.  They asked me a few questions, asked for me to do a few examples on a dry-erase board, and said they wanted to offer me the job but couldn't match my compensation.  At first, they said 13/hour, but today they called me back to propose 15/hour.

I'm willing to be paid less money to work for this company, but I don't think going down from 25/hr to 15/hr is good, especially considering my first job paid 20/hr.

I would've asked for advice sooner, but this went by fast.  When I was called again about getting the compensation raised to $15, I was told I could be given the weekend to think about it.  I told the guys doing the contracting to see if they could get me in touch with the hiring manager on the gaming company's end and see if he/she would be fine talking to me directly.  I even said I'd take the manager out to coffee to talk for 5 minutes if needed.

I'm 23 years old and I'm finally renting my own place.  I graduated from college last year so I'm fresh out of the education world.  I held a full-time job for 9 months, became unemployed, and then landed this decent internship.  This gaming company deal sounds sweet though.

1onwts,2,2013-10-17,Review Coming Up...Could Use Some Advice,Neo_Unicorn,graphic_design,https://www.reddit.com/r/graphic_design/comments/1onwts/review_coming_upcould_use_some_advice/,"I've been with my company for 7 years...6 as an independent contractor, and the last year as a full-time employee. I'm the only designer and handle a large volume of work with quick turnaround (about 100+ ads and 5-6 postcards/flyers a month).

I'm being paid about $5,000 less than the low end of the most recent salary survey by The Creative Group for my position. I get no health benefits, and no 401K. I have 5 vacation days a year. Sick days are not specified, but after a 3 day hospital stay a few weeks ago for anxiety issues (which the boss knew about), I had to be back at work within 2 days because the printer deadline was that week.

To say I'm feeling burned out is an understatement. But employment opportunities are low in my area for graphic design, and I have to work since my spouse cannot (disabled). 

My boss is a good guy.  He took me on full-time when my spouse lost his job due to the disability, which I am grateful for. He started this company by himself out of high school. I came aboard about 10 years into it, and it has really expanded since then. But he tries to part with as little money as he can. He is slowly becoming a little more open with his spending (we finally got a water cooler and a keurig machine).  He bought me a laptop so I could work remotely, but seldom lets me do so (Maybe twice a month).

 I do know the revenue of this business, with only 4 employees, is between 500,000 and 1 million a year, but am not sure of all the expenses.

I've told him I'm at my capacity for workload, and his solution is to find a local college kid who wants an unpaid internship :-(

SO, going into my review next week...I want to stress to him how important it is for him to compensate me more, get me some PAID help, more vacation times, perhaps a stipend for health bills (which have cost my family well in the thousands), ect. I'm starting to earnestly look around for other work, and have 3 irons in the fire right now (which is rare, like I said). Should I outright tell him I'm looking for other employment? I'm afraid he will see that as a threat and not take kindly to that. But he will lose me if things don't change. I know he values my work, and tells me so verbally, but financially, not so much.

tl;dr - review coming up, burned out - should I tell boss I'm ready to leave company if changes aren't made?"
1onux5,3,2013-10-17,[USA] Online contest sketchiness,[deleted],legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1onux5/usa_online_contest_sketchiness/,"This might be long winded I'll try to keep it short. My SO interns for an app-promoter (Android, iOS, Win8, etc) and I have been supportive of her in sharing their social media advertising (sharing with friends, tweets, etc). They do actually have some cool stuff...

Anyhow, yesterday they start promoting a contest on their FB page. I follow the link, make an account and read up. There is a brief introduction to the contest on the [homepage](http://imgur.com/9qKKife) to my profile, but no official rules page. 

It pretty much states to upvote or downvote, subscribe, be a beta tester, downloading, and other various activities get you random values of points. I was able to rack up ~9000, and cash them in to be sent a Samsung Galaxy S4 on the opening day of the contest.

I logged in later on to check for updates and the value of the Samsung has been raised to 15,000. I sent an email to ""contact us"" and the CEO replied saying I violated the guidelines/rules and he would not be honoring my prize. They have since raised the value AGAIN to 75,000 points for a Samsung Galaxy.

Also it states in his ToS that browsing there only falls under jurisdiction of laws in England, Northern Ireland, Scotland, and Wales.

So before I make /b/ aware of this contest what ground do I have to stand on? I honestly did it because I need a phone upgrade and I feel cheated that he changed the premise of the contest mid contest."

1onpzm,2,2013-10-17,I have 3+ years experience and CIS degree. Should I get A+ before N+?,awesomface,computertechs,https://www.reddit.com/r/computertechs/comments/1onpzm/i_have_3_years_experience_and_cis_degree_should_i/,"So I had a random question. I did 5 years in the Marine Corps and went to school immediately afterward. For the last 2 years of my 3 at school, I worked 30+ hours a week at a small online college in IT. That's where I essentially ""popped my cherry"" as my friend was able to get me the job with no experience and that is where I really learned from scratch. Since my friend left almost immediately after, and the other guy there was not helpful, I pretty much had to learn EVERYTHING on my own for the entire office of 90+ people.

After I finished school and got my degree in CIS, I didn't find a job for about 3 months and by then I was in dire need as I have a wife and 2 children (3 now). My iOS developer internship fell through as the company was too small and I really wasn't finding success in the analyst positions as they seemed to require internships that mine didn't reflect. I also found those environments to be VERY high stress for my personality so I really didn't focus on them. I finally got a call back from a company that contacted ME originally a month back about desktop support making a nice living. I've now been at the job for over a year and I love it. I'm really finding that I love the IT field in general. I'm really good at it and I love helping the users; i get a good satisfaction from solving problems that other people can't as well.

Anyways, long story short, I have a degree and a couple years experience. I'm extremely capable and certainly well past the level of A+ so I just started studying to get my N+. Since with both of my IT jobs, I've been relied on for WAY more than desktop support (i'm sure many know how that goes) I figure I should get that since i'm already doing a lot of it but really don't have the technical knowledge...just a lot of google and messing around. My question is, does anyone think I should even bother getting my A+? It would certainly require minimal studying as the only real things I would need to study for is stupid technical definitions for things like CPU northbride vs southbridge (I saw a question about that on a practice exam after 10 softballs and was like WTF?). 

I'm really comfortable here and really not worried about my job security, but I know to never get too comfortable as i've seen downsizing happen and it spares NO ONE. I know I'm extremely capable and I would think my experience/degree would be enough but does anyone have any experience as a recruiter/hiring that might be able to alleviate my concerns of not having an A+? I would think if I got my N+ as well, people would realize that I have no need for an A+ but I know sometimes recruiters don't know IT and are looking for the ""checked boxes"".

**TLDR: I have 3+ years of great, legitimate experience in desktop support and general ""all around tech guy"" and a CIS degree. Should I get my A+ just in case or will no one care at that point with my current credentials?**

Edit: The company I currently work for is a fortune 500 company and the office I work at, I manage about 300 users (100 remote). We have a call center downstairs (about 200 people) that I work with a little (resetting vdi's) but we have 2 other techs and remote people that handle that mostly. I am obviously extremely undermanned and have been training one of the downstairs techs to help me with what they can and I have time to train them on. Just thought i'd mention cause it think it helps pad my resume a little more.

1onjc9,25,2013-10-17,Being a bitch/feminist/party-pooper... RANT,[deleted],TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1onjc9/being_a_bitchfeministpartypooper_rant/,"Hey TwoX, hope you are all having a wonderful day :)

So I'm studying in a heavily male-dominated field. The ratio of girls is about 5%. I'm in engineering school and my program is the one with the lowest ratio. I can't wait to finish my degree and do something that (I hope) will be fun every day! My problem is the general attitude with everyone at school (especially in my program). There is so much going on, I don't even know where to start.

One thing that bugs me is how girls are always going to be ""rated"" by the guys, and her level of attractiveness is going to stick with her. ""Maria the hot one"" - ""Karen the cute one"". I understand people can be attracted to others. But what bothers me is that guys are never going to label each other like that. It's going to be ""Karl the one who's really good at math"", ""Paul who got an internship at *awesome place*"". It makes me angry that I'm never going to be ""bee27 who's really smart"".

Second thing that I don't know how to handle. All of our work, except for exams, is mainly group projects. I usually like to be the leader in a group. I like to push people but it seems like if I do so, I will be a bitch.  If I give my opinion and ask the group to debate on it, I'm a bitch. If I am stubborn, I'm a bitch. Sometimes I don't know if I should shut up and be considered ""nice"", of say what I think but be hated by everyone (and possibly, future colleagues).

Lastly ... I don't really hang out with guys from my program. My usual circle of people is from other engineering programs, but there are social events where I interact with these people and I really don't mind, they're usually fun. My problem is their comments. I usually see those on the program's facebook (closed and private) group. Comments about ""hot new girls at school"", ""hot women at this networking event"", ""you should take this class, the teacher is hot"". When I read these, I swear my face gets red and I just want to tell them that these women do not teach or study at our school to be solely judged on their appearance. They are smart women who wish to learn or teach. These comments would not even surface would the person in question be a man. Other times, I hear rape jokes (although pretty rarely) and I also don't speak my mind. I'm extremely sensitive to that, given how ""easy"" it would be for a girl at my school to get drunk and get assaulted by guys at our many parties.

Last thing, one thing that bothers me is that many girls do not seem to be sensitive to all of the things I have mentionned. I sometimes feel like a few of them lose their self-respect in order to be ""liked"". They will take their t-shirt off, let guys do mock sex on them (kind of like miley cyrus and robin thicke lol) for the laughs, ask stupid questions I'm sure they know the answer to (but again I can't know for sure).

TLDR : male dominated study field, afraid of saying what I really think, wish guys would respect girls a bit more, even if there's just a handful of us

Sorry for the long rant. is anyone here in a similar situation?? I'm curious to know what you think :)"

Questions|Answers
:--|:--
[**Down in the Valley** is one of my favorite songs by anybody in the last few years!  Is there a story behind writing it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1on8y1/iama_the_head_and_the_heart_ama/cctlet6?context=5)|Not a great story. It's the same as most any song any of us in the band write, a little bit too much whiskey and reflecting on what the hell is going on in your life.
[FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, WHO IS JOSH MCBRIDE?!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1on8y1/iama_the_head_and_the_heart_ama/cctlah4?context=5)|He is a good friend of mine. The song was written about him by his lady, who is also a dear friend. It started as a poem, got turned into a song by myself and one of my earliest musical partners in Seattle about 4 years ago. The rest is history.
[Hey Josiah. Huge fan since the self-titled here. Your verses on Rivers And Roads are my favorite parts on that album. We actually met in Hoboken, NJ when you played a last minute show at Maxwell's a few years back. You and all your band mates hung around with my friends and chatted for a while and I left with a poster autographed from all of you guys. It's actually up on my wall right now and has been since.  I wanted to ask how the sonic shift in this new album came about. I've read statements that said you guys were inspired by touring with bigger, more eclectic bands, specifically Iron &amp; Wine for example. On this new album, I feel like you guys fell victim to the same fate as Iron &amp; Wine, in which you expanded your sound strictly for the sake of expanding it, without any substantial inspiration or direction behind that, resulting in you guys applying your great voices and instrumentation to generic, uninspired ""Indie Rock Lite"" style songs. Mostly gone are your wise and wistful lyricism and genuine backwood, down-home roots sound and what we are left with is an album full of songs that sound like Mumford &amp; Sons and Coldplay had a baby that just bought its first Microkorg last week. Was this shift in style encouraged and maybe a bit executively decided by Sub Pop? Was it more to follow in the footsteps of the big arena bands you toured with? Or is this truly the sound you envisioned for The Head And The Heart from the start?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1on8y1/iama_the_head_and_the_heart_ama/cctlvzf?context=5)|I've never envisioned a sound for this band. I've envisioned writing great songs and then arranging them with the other five people in the band. For me, this album feels like a much more genuine reflection of what we sound like when we play live than it would have been to make another record that sounds like the first one. As to the phrase ""genuine backwoods"", none of us live in the woods, we live in a city. Making an album that sounded backwoods would be very not genuine. Which is why we didn't make that album.  From my perspective, this album is a document of what this band is into and what we sound like right now. Might change drastically again on the next album or might stay similar. If you don't like it, that's ok. Listen to the first one. I like this one better now, because that's where I'm at.
[Who is the main songwriter in the band? It seems like almost everyone takes the lead vocals at some point; is the singer based on who writes the song?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1on8y1/iama_the_head_and_the_heart_ama/cctla7o?context=5)|We're pretty open. This album has more Jon songs, but we kinda open it up for whoever writes a good song to take lead. But yes, whoever is singing lead 99% of the time wrote the song.
[1\) Will you release some of your previous songs in a different album? Like Oh Virginia and No One to Let You Down.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1on8y1/iama_the_head_and_the_heart_ama/cctlogm?context=5)|Most likely not on the releasing old songs on a new album. But you never know. I know Jon has still been really into playing Oh Virginia from time to time live though, so that one is still living and breathing.
[2\) What would you rather fight 100 duck sized horses or 1 horse sized duck?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1on8y1/iama_the_head_and_the_heart_ama/cctlogm?context=5)|1 horse sized duck. Can you imagine how terrible you'd feel beating up duck sized horses??
[Would you rather be friends with 100 duck sized horses or 1 horse sized duck?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1on8y1/iama_the_head_and_the_heart_ama/cctm10u?context=5)|Definitely 100 duck sized horses. I'd LOVE to be friends with 100 duck sized horses.
[Excellent new album, as expected!  My question is, what are you guys currently listening to?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1on8y1/iama_the_head_and_the_heart_ama/cctlcvf?context=5)|Phosphorescent - Muchacho. Yeezus. That's pretty much it. On repeat.
[Where is the rest of the body?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1on8y1/iama_the_head_and_the_heart_ama/cctl1zl?context=5)|Below the part you can see.
[I caught a setlist at a mpls show in sept 2012. They had alternate names for ""rivers and Roads"" as well as ""Down in the Valley"" they were ""Rivieras and Rodents"" and ""D in the V"". Inside joke?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1on8y1/iama_the_head_and_the_heart_ama/cctmam6?context=5)|Haha, just keepin ourselves entertained.
[Do you ever get tired of playing those/any songs?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1on8y1/iama_the_head_and_the_heart_ama/cctmno9?context=5)|Oh all the time. Life goes in cycles. Different songs are more or less relevant as life comes and goes.
[Oh, goodness, what a great day. I love your music so much and am absolutely crushed that I can't see you play in Indianapolis next week- I got to see you last year in Broadripple and it is still one of my all time favorite experiences.  I remember you saying that that crowd was the biggest you had as a headliner. It made me really happy because I'd been listening to you for ages. **How do you stay so humble when you have become so popular? And what musician do you dream of working with?**](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1on8y1/iama_the_head_and_the_heart_ama/cctlh2v?context=5)|I'M THE HUMBLEST OF ALL HUMBLE PEOPLE.
[Josiah! I wanna thank you for the AMA and for such beautiful music! ""Heaven Go Easy on Me"" def fits my life and ""Don't follow your head/follow your heart"" has inspired me to give up on the boring life of business and pursue a career in my passion instead - independent music.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1on8y1/iama_the_head_and_the_heart_ama/cctl9fx?context=5)|I cannot secure you an internship at Sub Pop. But best of luck there!
[So can you secure me an internship at SubPop this summer?  But really, I started writing songs a month or two ago, and man its a lot harder than I expected. What advice can you give me for writing lyrics and music as beautiful as yours?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1on8y1/iama_the_head_and_the_heart_ama/cctl9fx?context=5)|I wrote bad songs for maybe 7 or 8 years, numbering in the hundreds before I wrote a truly good one. Don't think you can just start writing songs and have a career. It is a craft that has to be a labor of love. You should write songs. More songs. Songs about anything and everything. And just try your best to get at the heart of what is true in whatever it is you are writing about. If you find yourself writing in cliches, I've found that means you're not being honest enough, because if you really get into your psyche, you'll find you say things a little different than anyone else. Stripping away the years of conditioning to not be yourself and fit in makes doing that really difficult at first, but it comes if you keep at it.
[Do any of you guys live together in Seattle?  Who fights the most in the group when you're on tour?  Who is the funniest person in the band?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1on8y1/iama_the_head_and_the_heart_ama/cctlzsm?context=5)|We don't live together anymore. We're an Equal Opportunity Arguing band. Hmmm, funniest is obviously subjective. But to me, Charity is the funniest.
[Hey Josiah! Love you guys, have seen you three times so far and can't wait to see you again. Where is one place you haven't played yet that you're dying to? Could be a country, venue, etc...](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1on8y1/iama_the_head_and_the_heart_ama/cctlf24?context=5)|Wanna play in Spain. Gone to Europe a bunch but never there yet.
 |And Hollywood Bowl. I grew up in Southern CA so that one is a big part of growing up and the musical legends I nurtured in my brain at that time.
[Any plans to play Ireland? What's your favourite album of 2013 (that isn't you own, obviously!\)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1on8y1/iama_the_head_and_the_heart_ama/cctl9w6?context=5)|Not positive it will happen on this particular upcoming tour but we're coming back to Europe in February. I'm assuming we'll be getting to Ireland. Loved our one time there!
[Dude, outstanding new album. Haven't finished listening to it all the way through, but holy cow it's good.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1on8y1/iama_the_head_and_the_heart_ama/cctl8x0?context=5)|As I met Jon and then as the two of us met more and more people, we added people that we felt a kinship and a chemistry with, rather than thinking about finding people that played specific instruments.
[How have you guys found your blend of rock/pop/folk? How much ""messing up"" or experimentation did you have to go through?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1on8y1/iama_the_head_and_the_heart_ama/cctl8x0?context=5)|We never thought we'd have violin, Jon's big instrument he imagined early on when writing melodies in his head was a trumpet. But. We never met a trumpet player we clicked with. And we met Charity who obviously kills it. So we just stayed open to what fate had for us. Worked out.
[Hey Josiah!! I really love your work and i am proud to say that ""THE HEAD AND THE HEART IS MY FAVORITE BAND"" you have so many fans in all of the world, i am brazilian and want to know when you come to here?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1on8y1/iama_the_head_and_the_heart_ama/cctlg6t?context=5)|We're trying to get on one of those Lollapalooza fests that gets down to Brazil. Cross your fingers that we get it!
[I've always thought that Honey Come Home was one of the sweetest/saddest songs I've ever heard. Was this written from the experience of someone who has gone through a divorce or a child who witnessed a divorce?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1on8y1/iama_the_head_and_the_heart_ama/cctmhjx?context=5)|The characters in the song were a creation that allowed me to deal with heartbreak without needing to spell out my own. 
[What's your favorite type of fish?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1on8y1/iama_the_head_and_the_heart_ama/cctlesf?context=5)|Humu humu nuku nuku apua'a.
[Hey JJ new album is killer, im so proud of all your hard work to get there.  2 Q's - Who are you singing to in fire/fear &amp; The title track Lets Be Still's lyrics sound about the challenges you as a band touring for close to 3 years faced and needed some quiet time. is this a fair assumption? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1on8y1/iama_the_head_and_the_heart_ama/cctlsxo?context=5)|That is a fair assumption, and there's some truth there, but I think Let's Be Still is definitely more widely applicable than just to our situation.
 |And Fire/Fear is an odd one, the feeling and weaknesses and problems in it are things I've dealt with hard, but it was easier to write about them by creating the people in the song and letting them deal with it than to write straightforwardly about my personal situations. So. It's to several different people really, or no one, or to myself. Probably to myself. I think the person who is the narrator of the song is probably saying those things to me.
[Does it ever get boring playing the same songs on back to back nights?  Even your favorite song you can only listen to so many times over the course of 3-4 months, so as someone who plays songs do you ever feel that?  Like on a certain night, man I just really don't feel like playing this tonight, or I just can't get into this song tonight?  Love the new album!  Thanks guys!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1on8y1/iama_the_head_and_the_heart_ama/cctmxj5?context=5)|Yes :)
 |But you don't bail on it just because you don't feel like it. You know?
[Hey Josiah!  The new album is great!!  Any specific reason why there are less harmonies on this record than on your self titled release?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1on8y1/iama_the_head_and_the_heart_ama/cctlc3k?context=5)|It's where the band is at. Some of the lyrics that don't have harmonies felt too personal to cover up with harmony.
[Looking forward to seeing you guys for the third time ever. How good is Thao and the Get Down live?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1on8y1/iama_the_head_and_the_heart_ama/cctlc8e?context=5)|Definitely get there early to see them. Fantastic. That's why we're touring with them for a second time. Quiet Life (the opener) is also fantastic live. We bring out bands that we love and believe people should hear. So please come early and enjoy them.
[How did you guys react to seeing Pearl Jam Tweet a shoutout to your new album? That must've been quite the honor!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1on8y1/iama_the_head_and_the_heart_ama/cctm60h?context=5)|We retweeted it :) But yes. Pretty sweet!
[Been seeing you guys since Feb 2011 and it's awesome to watch you guys grow as a band, and individually.  Are you guys going to do another Chapel Session or Daytrotter Session?  I really enjoy both of those, as your harmonies are able to really stand out - especially the Chapel Sessions!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1on8y1/iama_the_head_and_the_heart_ama/cctlfta?context=5)|Definitely another Chapel Session. Those are fantastic.
[Is there any chance we'll get to hear some of Josiah's other older songs come to life like Snowed in Seattle or Sounds so Sweet? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1on8y1/iama_the_head_and_the_heart_ama/cctloz2?context=5)|Nah, the time for those songs has passed. Time to write new songs. That's kinda how this works. I write songs about what I'm dealing with or living NOW and because it feels relevant to my life, I want to play them for people, I'm able to play them for people in a way that is believable. Those songs just... their time has passed.
[Hey Josiah!  First off I want to say I'm a HUGE fan and love everything you guys have created!  What song on your new album means the most to you, and why?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1on8y1/iama_the_head_and_the_heart_ama/cctl90p?context=5)|Fire/Fear. See my reply to monkeyslicky. Heaviest most personal lyrics.
[Hey Josiah! I've been a fan for a while and saw you guys put on a great show in Richmond last Summer. I love the amount of acoustic live sessions your band performs. How do you think this kind of performance connects with the fans rather than releasing solely recorded songs?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1on8y1/iama_the_head_and_the_heart_ama/cctlhkt?context=5)|It's good for my spirit and soul to do songs in a variety of ways. That's really what's good about doing those sessions. And I love seeing songs by bands I love performed in an alternate way, so I'm sure it works that way for fans of ours as well.
[What are some of your major influences?  Did you have any formal training/music school?  Any tips for an aspiring musician who struggles to write songs?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1on8y1/iama_the_head_and_the_heart_ama/cctm1y0?context=5)|I wrote so many bad songs for so many years before I wrote my first truly decent one. Just write about anything and everything and keep doing it and poking at the truth in what you're writing about. Takes a lot of failures to get to your first success.
[You guys signed my egg shaker, but I've used it so much, all the ink wore off. Will you guys sign it again the next time you play in Boise?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1on8y1/iama_the_head_and_the_heart_ama/cctln8t?context=5)|Yep :)
[I'm guessing you wrote Honey Come Home? What's the story behind it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1on8y1/iama_the_head_and_the_heart_ama/cctlrrk?context=5)|The characters in the song were a creation that allowed me to deal with heartbreak without needing to spell out my own.
[Big fan from Denmark Josiah! I've even created the Danish wiki-page for you guys. It might be weak in information, but it's the effort that counts!

Definitely coming to Scandinavia (and Europe) in February.
[Any chance of you guys of you guys doing a small clubs tour ever again? Poor saps like myself missed you on your stint with DMB, ya know, cause I'm poor. So maybe come back and play Velour in Provo sometime soon.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1on8y1/iama_the_head_and_the_heart_ama/cctm2cu?context=5)|Probably not a full tour, but we throw them in every once in awhile. Not sure if you saw, but we played at Urban Lounge with a last minute announce later that night after the SLC DMB show.
[But you guys don't live in the same physical spaces any more. How will this change things, do you think?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1on8y1/iama_the_head_and_the_heart_ama/cctmqn0?context=5)|A wider array of themes and influences. But the chemistry is so natural that coming back together still always feels like home.
[I saw you play live last summer at Warehouse live in Houston. You wore your Raybans inside for the first half of the set... Any interesting reason behind that? It was pretty dark in there...](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1on8y1/iama_the_head_and_the_heart_ama/cctloc4?context=5)|No, I wanted to dress it up. At the time I didn't want to sing it acoustically because it is a heavy song and dressing it up let me hide behind upbeat music. Now that the situation I wrote that song about is more processed in my mind, I can play it the honest way.
[I love the stripped down acoustic versions of the tunes that you guys play live (Ever Since, Fire/Fear, Homecoming Heroes, Honey Come Home, etc\). At the root of it, you guys are an acoustic guitar driven band, is it difficult to decide how much accompaniment to include on the album?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1on8y1/iama_the_head_and_the_heart_ama/cctloc4?context=5)|It's normally pretty natural to arrange songs with this band, nothing is forced, but obviously it's pretty cool to strip the songs down, which we get to do at radio sessions/take away shows, etc...
[What is your take on these ""exclusive tracks/deluxe editions"" that hit stores like Target.  With your recent (fantastic\) release featuring one new song and live takes of others on the Target version of the album I find it hard to keep up with the ""definitive"" release. How does this impact sales, or your view of the ""album"" as a whole?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1on8y1/iama_the_head_and_the_heart_ama/cctlkcd?context=5)|Sales gimmicks.

Have the records from both your albums!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1on8y1/iama_the_head_and_the_heart_ama/cctmhkv?context=5)|Ups and downs. It's like family.

I also understand that the best I have a chance at getting would be an internship and an actual position.  Beyond that any advice to calm my nervous nerves and not make a total fool of myself would be greatly appreciated.

First of all, I should tell you all what the cause of my depression is. It's not a chemical imbalance, as it is for some people. My depression is caused by my parent's divorce last year. My family was my reason for living, my #1 most important thing in my life, and as necessary to me as food, oxygen and water.

Due to the nature of the divorce, I have had no contact whatsoever with my mother for over a year and a half. I never even had the chance to say good-bye to her. My father just took me home one day from college to his house instead of hers. I cannot reach out to my mother, because I am financially dependent on my father and he would put me out on the street if I had any contact with her. 

So, this situation has destroyed me mentally and emotionally. I love BOTH my mom AND my dad, but I have been forced to remain loyal to my father. I cry every single day for my mother, to see her again, to hug her...and when I am in this state I cannot even get out of bed, feel happy, or anything.

I am a broken person now, unable to hold down a job or pass my classes in school (I'm now on academic warning and am going to have to resign from my internship today).

Therapy DOES NOT HELP. Medication DOES NOT HELP. Belive me, I have tried them both! The only thing that would fix me is if my parents got back together, and I am *fully* aware that will never happen.

The money has run out for my college fund, so come December I will have to find a job. I don't know how I can do that with my condition. I don't know how I can do anything. I literally can't function now that I've lost my family.

I don't even know if you can help me, but thanks for listening to my rant. I just need to vent..."
1omyf1,10,2013-10-17,My ex took my dog,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1omyf1/my_ex_took_my_dog/,"Yeah, so this is kinda messy, and I change tense several times for no reason.

The story begins roughly four years ago.  I had been dating my then girlfriend for about six years.  After working for a small bakery for a few years, she decided she wanted to pursue a career in the pastry arts.  

So, she enrolled in pastry school, which I thought was a bad idea - not because it was an essentially bad idea, but because the timing was bad, and she hadn't really explored any options.  She refused to discuss it, and I didn't press the issue because I didn't want to interfere with her dreams.  The thing is, she enrolled in secret without even telling me the details.  It cost her $50,000.  I mean, we had been living together for five years, and I had no voice in the matter.  Believe me, she had only wanted to do it for like a week, and rushed into it before anything could stop her.  It's how she operates.  She actually could have gone to community college for free.  Plus, the school she went to was shut down for being a scam, but not until after she graduated.

Now, the final part of her education was a three month long internship, which her school called an externship for some reason.  Well, she decided that the best place for her to do her internship was in Naples Florida, which was thousands of miles from where we were living.  Well, she moved down there and signed a one year long lease on an apartment.  I didn't want to move to Naples.  I tried to convince her to do her internship at a small pastry shop in the city we were living in.  The owner was French, and knew his shit.  Anyway, she just brushed my concerns off like they didn't matter, and I didn't press the issue because I didn't want to be a ""controlling boyfriend.""  The thing is, she didn't even discuss it with me.  It was just like ""This is my dream.  I'm moving.  You can come if you want, or...""  but she never said anything about breaking up.

Well, I moved.  She warned me that she'd be working a lot, as though warning me made it okay for her to be working 70-90 hours a week.  No, I don't think that's okay, if you've been in a relationship with someone for six years, without having a serious discussion about it.  She just rushed into it, and all my attempts at communication were disregarded.  I had never been in a relationship before, and I didn't talk to anyone about it, so I just had no clue what was really going on.  I just wanted to be a good boyfriend, and not interfere with her dreams.  And, everything was just *happening*.  It was hard for me to see her in a negative light.

So, I'm down in Naples Florida.  She's at work ALL THE TIME - six or seven days a week, at least ten hours a day, sometimes up to fourteen hours a day.  When she is home, she's too tired to do anything.  I'm working from home.  Naples is a retirement and vacation city.  It's just a huge strip mall.  I'm lonely as fuck - no friends, no idea what to do.  There's nothing there.  I decide to get a dog.  I go with my ex to the shelter.  I pick out our dog.  I pick her up at the shelter and bring her home while my ex is at work.  I take care of her for an entire year, while my ex is at work.  I spend hours at the dog park every day because there is nothing else to do in Naples.  I take her walking for miles every day.

After a year in Naples, my ex decides that pastry isn't for her - gives it up completely.  We move back to our home city, and into a condo where my late grandmother used to live that now belongs to my parents.  They don't charge us rent.  For about six months, my ex doesn't have a job.  I'm still working from home.  So, we both take care of our dog.  My ex does some special training with the dog, so that she can be off leash.  Well, after six months, my ex's workaholism strikes again.  She gets another job where she can spend all her time.  I'm not exaggerating.  It got to the point that she was at work every day, at least nine or ten ours a day, then working while she's at home the rest of the time.  That's the way it is for the next year and a half.

Now, our dog had always been really weird about being inside.  She just had a lot of anxiety, and never seemed very happy, but only inside.  She'd just kinda settle into a chair, and stay there for the entire day, no matter where in the house anyone else was.  When she'd get outside, she'd be like a completely different dog.  She loved to play and wrestle, but indoors she seemed to interpret everything as a threat.  Well, I decided that it might be a good for her if we got another dog, and good for me too, because our first dog's mood was really bumming me out.  I felt bad for her.  So, we got another dog.  That was about two years ago.

One year ago, I decide that I simply cannot stand to be in the relationship anymore if something doesn't change.  My ex is working more and more.  It's all she does.  She's always too tired to do anything.  I never get to relax with her.  It's been this way for almost our entire relationship, but never this bad.  We had made plans twice to move to a different city - where there's really good rock climbing, climb more, and not work so much.  Both times, the plans were dashed because my ex wouldn't quit her job.  There's shit I want to do with my life.  I want a relationship in which I can actually spend time with my partner, where we're building a life together.

Well, she decides that she'd rather just break up.  Dumps me.  I beg her to just take a break, go to a relationship counselor.  She refuses.  She refuses to even talk to me about why she wants to break up.  She just says ""we don't make a good couple.""  I try to tell her that it's the job.  She denies that it has anything to do with anything.  Kicks me out of our apartment (we had moved out of the condo and into an apartment).  I move in with my parents.  I'm extremely depressed because our nine year relationship had just collapsed and it was as though she just didn't give a fuck at all.  I mean, I saw her a few times, and she'd act all chummy.  ""I went on a date.""  I wouldn't respond.  ""I went on a date.""  like I was supposed to ask her about it.  But, she wouldn't answer my calls.  She wouldn't respond to my texts.  My nine year relationship came to an end and I didn't even get to talk to the person about it.  

Before this goes on much longer, let me just say that she ended up with our original dog, and I ended up with the new dog.  My ex changed her phone number and moved out of state with the dog, and basically scoffed at me when I said that our original dog was my dog because everyone knows the new dog was my dog and the old dog was her dog because she did special training with her.  It's like she could only see the time she spent with the dog, and couldn't imagine the 100x more time that I had spent with her.  Ugh, she just had this snide fucking attitude when I tried to talk to her about it.  Even my dad yelled at me when I said I was upset about it ""That's her dog!  This dog is your dog!""  Did I mention that she just fucking quit her job like it was nothing and moved to a climbing destination like we had planned, all the while accusing me of not having aspirations?  She also gave our cat away, whom I had taken care of for four years, and wouldn't tell me to whom she gave it.  

The thing is, our dog loved to play keep away, and whenever the four of us (myself, ex, dog 1, dog 2) would go play in the field next to our house, after dog 2 was tired, I'd always make sure dog 1 got the ball, and I'd chase her around because that's what she loved, that's what she lived for, and that's how we played when she was a puppy.  But, my ex would always want to stop playing and go in.

(Rant),G0VERNMENTCHEESE,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1ompl5/im_just_getting_really_frustrated_in_the_it_field/,"In a period of over 2 years, I must have applied to well over 300+ entry level IT job applications of which I was either under or overqualified for. Craigslist, monster, indeed, careerbuilder, etc. NOTHING! I have not heard back from any of them and after calling some of them back, I only get ""we'll review your application when we're ready"" or ""the ad says not to call"". Not one god damn interview. Sorry but I just literally feel like beating the crap out of someone because it means I'm gonna be stuck working in retail for another round of Black Friday and Christmas this year (AGAIN!!!). Even applied for related jobs such as computer repair shops, desktop support, IT support, remote/mobile support, etc. Not one damn interview. Not even for internships or contract jobs. Went to apply from places all over California, Washington, Oregon, and even Canada. All of the requirements for the ads listed are made for someone that has been in the business for at least 20 something years. They shouldn't even list it as entry level, but the only advice I got was to apply anyway.

I'm thinking of just moving on and learn more about computer repairs and start my own damn private business in that. I enjoy working with computers but its really freaking hard to get any kind of interview or stepping stone. I'll still keep applying, but I'm really just frustrated at this. Yet most of my friends were able to get in basic IT jobs with the same credentials as me and no hook ups of any sort."

1omg2p,4,2013-10-17,"I feel like I'm a terrible person, a pathetic piece of shit, and I don't deserve to be alive.",[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1omg2p/i_feel_like_im_a_terrible_person_a_pathetic_piece/,"I've slowly lost my friends, lost things to do and become less and less confident in my ability to do anything. I just go through the motions day after day, regretting my past decisions and letting life pass me by. 

I've become more and more irritated with my job. For the majority of the past 7 years I've been a pharmacy technician. I became more and more irritated with the selfish pharmacists and technicians I worked with. The pharmacists and techs would dick around on their phones and I'd bust my ass for the pharmacy. I was always the person who rearranged their schedule for everyone. I could never get full time hours so I started working customer service in the store here and there. I eventually got fed up with the pharmacy completely and now I work as a stock and customer service clerk in the store. I don't use my brain at all. It's boring and repetitive work but I need the money it gives me. At 28 though, I feel like I shouldn't be working a shitty job like the one I'm at, especially since I have a college education.

I have a BA in sociology, which I regret doing. I had no idea what I wanted to do in college. I had absolutely no plan going in and I completely wasted my time there. I never joined anything and pretty much spent all of my free time in my dorm or apartment playing video games or browsing the internet. I worked on the weekends back home so I never spent a weekend at school. When I should have been out making friends, finding an internship, finding myself, or planing for the future I did nothing worthwhile with my time. I couldn't find a better job upon graduation so I started graduate school in demography. I hated it. I can't teach and my ideas were shit. I started drinking heavily while in the program. I never finished my master's thesis and I eventually dropped out of the program. 

After failing to find another job (again) I enrolled in library school this year, which I'm not sure is a good idea. I interned at a few libraries but nothing permanent. I'm getting myself into more debt for a graduate degree which I'm not sure will help me anyway. Another bad decision on my part.

I had a DUI in August which I feel terrible about. I rear ended someone and totaled my own car. I'm glad no one was hurt but the fact is that I drove drunk and I feel like a total piece of shit for it. One more reason why I hate myself. I lost my license and got put on a non reporting probation for a year. I feel like it's now going to be impossible for me to find a job in a new profession with this on my record (I can't get it expunged). One more strike against me. 
 
I've had nothing but failed relationships. Every time I meet someone and we seem to hit it off it never works out. There's always some better than me. Someone smarter, funnier, wittier, all around better. 
I managed to date someone for more than a few dates earlier this year for the first time, but it didn't work out. I also have a huge crush on one of my co-workers but she already has a boyfriend. Just as well anyway. I don't think I really have anything to offer anyone anyway. I have no money, I'm not attractive, and I don't really have any talents. 

I'm also a virgin. I know that I shouldn't let that bother me but it does. Being almost 30 and having zero sexual experience makes me feel inadequate. I'm afraid that if I ever do find a girlfriend and our relationship progresses to that level of romance, she'll be completely turned off that I really have no idea how to make love. I want to know what sex feels like and I want to know how to please a woman.

My week mostly consists of waking up, doing school work or mindlessly browsing the internet until I go to my job, work, come back to my apartment, browse the internet some more, go to sleep, and repeat the process. I have nothing to look forward to: no events, concerts, or whatever the fuck people do with their time.  

I really don't know anymore. Going to sleep now, maybe I'll wake up somewhere new, or as someone else. "

A year after I started, I was ""promoted"" into a role which would have me help train and develop new hire talent. Since then, I moved on to temporarily train full classes of new employees and even oversee the mentoring process.

For this time, I've had my eye on the supervisor position at my company. See, my job doesn't do merit raises or anything like that, so the only way to get paid more is to get moved into a different role. It was a long process but finally, my company is expanding and hiring on a lot of new people. I helped train and mentor many of them and I found out today that I've been accepted into the company's supervisor internship program, where they'll train me and ultimately give me a team of my own!

I couldn't be happier and couldn't think of a better place to post something like this. After a really challenging year, personally and professionally, the hard work has paid off!"

We were poor, and we were many. I was known as the smart one, and people always expected me to become successful. My parents are kind of like hippies, and didn't think much of me getting an education. When I graduated I never plan on how to pay for college. At this time I realized my parents didn't pay taxes, so I couldn't get financial aid. I did community college for three years not properly planning out my degree, just thinking I was getting my basics. I ended up paying my parents taxes and getting into a university. This whole time I had been living with my parents. I decided on getting my degree in physics, but then realized I was way behind in the program. A year later I switched to engineering due to job opportunities. My third year in the university, my grandma died. Up until this point, my grandpa had been taking care of my family. When my grandma died, he couldn't cover our rent, so my dad decided to move a few hours away (Keep in mind my parents had been listening to this ""modern day prophet"" who said our town would be destroyed.)     

At this point, most of my siblings had their own lives. My three younger sisters and I had been living with our parents. One of them, ""J"" fell into the cult and wanted to follow my parents. My other sibling ""S"" was pulled out of school after the second grade and had absolutely no education (no matter how much I tried.) My other sibling ""R"" had a normal life, and ended up moving in with her boyfriend. I still had two years of school to go at this point but no job.     

My brother took me in and I immediately got a job as an intern getting paid pretty well. I offered to move out (he's married) but he needed help paying the rent. I stayed with him for two years, graduated and moved out. I now make 70k a year, and have gotten to know some influential people. My boss in particular is a multimillionaire who has taken me on as his protege, giving me opportunities to consult people inventing new products.   
I still don't feel like I make much money. Taxes and health insurance take up 33% of my check. Outside of that, I've racked up a 60 thousand dollar student loan dept which cost me $800 a month. Rent, food, gas, and utilities doesn't leave me with much extra.     

My brother gave me a call a few moments ago to let me know my parent got evicted from there apartment, and might go to a salvation army homeless shelter. My parents still think the world is about to be destroyed and do as little as they can to get by. My brother tried to get them to come back to our town but they won't. My little sister ""R"" really wants to leave but nobody wants to take care of her. Over the past few years I've been buying her books to study and get her GED, hoping that she can get into the army after. She doesn't read the books and sells them. My brother is worried my parents might die in five years if they continue this lifestyle. I know if I try to help them out, my opportunities for success are dashed. I don't know what to do.   

**TL;DR:** Parents follow cult, might become homeless and continue to do as little as they can to get by. Family expects me to take care of my 19 year old sister who has a second grade education and no motivation to do anything in life. "

1om6sf,1,2013-10-16,Need advice after 3 months of being mislead and underpaid,Rosetta_Clupea,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1om6sf/need_advice_after_3_months_of_being_mislead_and/,"~3mo ago, I transferred locations (+7miles each way) because the department manager at another store wanted to train me as his assistant. I have been waiting for the official promotion, but needed to speak with our regional merchandiser(I believe this is her title) again and today found out that she is looking for someone with open availability instead.

*I spoke with her months ago and let her know that school limited my availability. Open availability is listed as a requirement, but her response made it sound like something doable and she continued to go over the requirements and such with me as though it were a possibility.

*I was told she needed to talk to me about it again to finish the process, but her vacation, opening a store, hiring a new manager, teaching that manager our new ordering system, and the managers conference all got in the way.

*She mentioned teaching me the new ordering system about two weeks ago. Managers and assistants do the ordering in our department.

*I have been doing the work of an assistant for about three months, listed on our schedule as assistant manager, while being paid the same as regular staff.

*For about 10 days and one long weekend, we had no manager. I ran the department.

*After using me for three months, they are just now looking for someone to officially fill the position.

When I told her that she had not been clear about my availability being a disqualifier, she said she was ""sorry that I misunderstood her"". The store has been using me in place of paying someone more to do the job and I feel I have been taken advantage of and mislead. Supposedly the person above her will not approve if my availability is not open, but I made it clear that it would not be open from the beginning.

This job is my internship for school, so I'm stuck until that's complete; furthermore, I don't believe I can list assistant manager on a resume because it was never official. If I take online only in Spring(bonus: w/ scholarship money from this company) I may be promoted, but might have to transfer or see if they will let me continue as I am for two months, performing the job without the pay.

Advice will be greatly appreciated."

I wasn't very smart about my career in college. I didn't do any internships and only took a few interviews my senior year. I wound up working for a small local company for a pathetic hourly wage. I was basically left to my own and I hated the projects I was working on.

I decided to quit and change careers. Fast-forward 8 years, my new career hasn't worked out as I expected. I'm considering getting back into the software field, preferably in a project manager or similar role rather than an engineer. A few questions:

1. Do I even have a chance at competitive entry level jobs targeted at new grads? (To be honest, it would not be worth it to me to get back into software unless I were making somewhere around $70k within a few years of starting. I love my current career; I just don't make enough money.)

2. I don't want to go to grad school. (I already have too much debt.) What should I do over the next year or so in order to make up for the lost time away from school? Is it worth it to review the theory I learned in school such as big-O analysis, data structures &amp; algorithms, linear algebra, etc.?

3. Would it help to develop personal projects? I have a few ideas for niche mobile/web apps related to my current career, but I don't know if it's worth taking the time and money to develop them.

Thanks in advance for any advice!"

My GPA in my major is around a 3.6(my overall GPA is lower because I switched from engineering, which I was not enjoying). I have had one internship, as a marketing analyst intern at a smaller(100-200 people?) company. I was able to get a great letter of recommendation from this internship. I have experience working with SAS, MathCAD, Excel, Minitab, and a bit of C++ and R.

I know that I need to find internships pretty soon, but I can't help but feel like I'm nowhere near prepared enough to be writing code that would impress employers.

I am currently doing my Masters in Computer Science. I graduated from BSc in Computer Science with Magna Cum Lauda (not that this matters jack squat, but you'll know why I mentioned it) I also did co-op terms in companies such as Adobe and IBM and some other smaller companies.

Now, after graduating... I had little to no problems finding a job. But instead of taking the job, I decided to accept a scholarship with funding for my Masters.

All my friends asked ""Why?, you don't seem the Masters type"". My reply was ""Oh, I love school..so why not?""

But the truth was not so much that I loved school, but more so that I hated my job. I hated the 9-5 schedule SO bad that it would make me depressed when it was enforced on me. I also hated the fact that I was confined to one desk the entire day. 

I love talking to people, I LOVE doing presentations. I love looking up techniques on how to improve presentation skills. And I'm always making conversation with new/random people. I hit on girls all the time, and get rejected 98% of the time. But you gotta swing to score, right? ;)

 My grades in school matter LITTLE since I don't take that knowledge above and beyond by researching new technologies for fun. I don't want my job to  be a job I'm doing just for the money. 

The way I see it is that for the next 30 or so years of my life, I'm going to be spending majority of my week at work + sleeping. Do I really want to spend it doing something I don't absolutely love?

Am I looking at this wrong guys? Am I just burnt out? (I doubt a few internships could do that) Am I cut out for sales? Or will I be throwing away my skill set as a Java/C#/Android developer/Flex developer?

Any advice whatsoever will be appreciated. And if you have any questions that you need to ask to get a better understanding of my situation, feel free to ask!

First of all, I've been lurking and asking some questions here and there. This community really helped me out when I had to make a call or a certain decision. A big THANK YOU from the bottom of my heart!

So I received a summer internship offer from the company that I've been aiming for since the beginning of the year. It is one of the major investment banks in the world (if you make a guess, you'll probably get it right the first time). They flew me in last week and everything was great. The people are really chill and nice. I can't speak for the whole IT department, but the team I was the most interested in and the one I eventually got the offer from works with desktop applications as well as it does quite a bit of mobile development (Android, iOS). So you can't really say that this team uses outdated technologies. I was reading some reviews on glassdoor and a good percentage of people say that this is a great place to start your career for young college grads. I got this impression that people actually want to go somewhere else to work after? The pay is great and the things you might be working on are pretty interesting (imo). I mean, there's really only tech companies like Google, Facebook or Microsoft that might be better and maybe suitable for certain people in terms of company culture and pay. Maybe it's too much stress and people simply burn out after a year or two?

I guess I'm just not sure how much higher can you go from here (aside from starting your own business later on) and why anyone would want to leave. Can anyone enlighten me on this career-related subject?

* Born in Venezuela, currently that is my one and only citizenship.
* Moved and lived in the UK since I was 8 
* Lived in Ohio, USA for two years in my teens
* Moved back to the UK
* Currently in living Malaysia, leave to remain here for a year (social pass).  Living with my parents in the middle of Kuala Lumpur.

I want to go to Canada.  Seven years ago, I met my fiancée, who is a beautiful and wonderful Canadian citizen.  We plan on getting married, but since I need to a visa to even visit Canada, that has not happened.

---

* I am 24 years old, 25 this November.  I have a BSc 2:1 Honours degree from a good university in the UK in Biomedical Science.  I had to do a project on my own for the last year, and present a thesis, so I am not new to working in a lab.  However, I have never gotten paid for it, either... while I was studying, I was a waiter.  I've also worked as a PA in Venezuela, where my English came in handy, for a solicitor's office.

* I am open to doing a MSc here in Malaysia while I visit briefly to Canada under a visitor visa and getting married while I'm there.  I am not sure how (or if!) that would work out.  An MSc in Canada would also be great... however, I applied to Western, only to be told at the last minute that I need to take a GRE.  

* No available dates to take it until April, where I applied for May, so... I somehow don't think I'm getting into Western.  However, I am open to the idea of any other Canadian university.  Please bear in mind that I need estimates of rent and such, unless it's a university near London, ON (where I could live with my fiancée).

* I have zero criminal conviction, I don't so much a jay-walk.

* I speak fluent English, and am also fluent in Spanish.  I have moderate proficiency in French and Japanese.   I am also learning (on a self-study basis) IT programming - HTML, CSS, JS, and Python.  Not sure if that helps, but there you go.

* I feel kind of lost... my fiancée is in University, and we don't have a huge deal in the way of money.  Our respective parents are financially stable, but not super-rich either.  They would be open to support us, but I have no idea what to even ask for.   Fiancée is living with her parents.

* It's highly unlikely I'd be worth the hassle of a worker visa for any prospective employer...  I only have a BSc (hons).

* Finally, I am seriously fretting about my chances of my fiancée getting sponsorship approval, she is still in Uni and only has an internship at a prestigious private school (doesn't get paid) and a part-time job at some high-end retail place.

1oq8yp,0,2013-10-18,A program idea I would love comments on,[deleted],learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1oq8yp/a_program_idea_i_would_love_comments_on/,"Hello LearnProgramming, this is my first post here.
Just to give a short introduction: I'm 22 years and I study Computer Science in Denmark currently on third semester. I've learned Java and SQL.

My program idea is sort of an upgraded version of the calender as we now know it and use it.

So about calenders and the need for them:

Calenders are smart, many people have a calender which they use daily; other people don't use a calender at all, some of these people might not because it seems like more trouble than it's worth to manage one.

Some people use an old-fashioned physical version, some people have a calender app on their smartphone, and others use a calender program on their pc. Calenders are here to stay, they're not going anywhere, dates and times are becoming more and more of an issue in most peoples life, especially the part of managing it is a struggle for many.

About my idea and how it occurred:

So, I'm one of those who don't use a calender, simply because I can't be bothered with typing in the event and time in my calender app on my smartphone, I'm too lazy to do that I'll admit.

But yesterday, as I was browsing a forum, I entered a thread about the upcomming movies in 2014, with people showing links to imdb, trailers and such. I quickly realise there's actually quite a lot movies in 2014 I want to see.
Now the problem is, there's not release date for most of them, and the thread I'm looking in will be gone from the first pages of the forum in a few days, and I'll eventually forget about most of these movies, although I'd like to see them.
It would be great, if I could somehow subscribe to something, and be updated automatically as each release date is announced. But how would this work?
This is where my idea starts; now, if I had a personal online calender(either phone app or pc program), which I could use as a standard calender, typing events in for dates manually, but with the extra feature of being able to 'subscribe' to services of my own wish; then I'd suddenly have lots of purpose of managing my own calender.

The way I imagine the subscribing part, is that the services I'm subscribing, will be able to add new events/reminders in my calender.
Etc. if IMDB had a movie announcement service, people with this calender app could subscribe to it, and when a release date for a movie is official, the people managing the IMDB movie announcement service updates all subscribers calender with an release date event added to the date of the release. Maybe getting an event added for each new movie worldwide would be annoying, so obviously there could be added a filter where you choose only to have your calender updated with the release dates of movies you choosed, or limited to one or more genres, actors, producers etc.
This way you get updated automatically, and don't have to sit and do all the work of checking up on when there's a release date announced.

But there's tons of other options:
Starting a new education, or just a new semester on your current education? Well simply subscribe to the schools scheme for your class, and you'll get your calender updated with dates and times for every class lesson. Teacher is ill and have to cancel todays lessons? The teacher simply uses his/hers mod-login for the schools calender service, and updates every students calender for the classes for which it's relevant.

Want to watch Tour De France, but only the mountain stages, which you're not sure on what days is happening? Simply subscribe to a Tour De France service and choose to the filter option they've made(we're playing with the idea that this app is real and popular), to pick the types of stages you prefer, and get your calender automatically updated with the exact dates for each mountain stage, time it starts, and maybe even link to the stage profile.

Invited to a birthday party? Check your calender, and simply add the date of the birthday as an event like you would in any other calender.

Annoyed that you've subscribed so many services that you're calender feels spammed by added events, and you have trouble finding the birthday event you added, to check up on time, just to be sure? Well choose the filter option for your calender, and choose 'family and friends', or 'parties'. Or you want a good overview on all stages in the Tour De France you're planning to watch, choose the filter that limits shown events to only those from the specific service you choose, in this case the Tour De France service.

I could mention more options of use, but I think the idea and potential is clear now.

If I'm going to pursue the idea of this project, I'm well aware that it'll require a good amount of time and coorporation with others. Currently, I simply want to share my idea and get some input and thoughts on it from other people. That is what this thread is made for.
On my fifth semester, there's no class lessons, because it's meant to be where you find an internship with a company you can work for and learn from by putting your theory into practice. But there's also the option of working on your own project, if it meets the required criterias and gets accepted by the school. I'm thinking a project this size, could very well be accepted, and it would open up for the possibility of that I can get fellow students from my class to join me on the idea.
This program is a gamble in therms of making it worth the time used on developing it, but if I where to work on it as a school project, it wouldn't feel that way, since worse case scenario, should be that I'll get through my education, just like if I had chosen an internship for the fifth semester.

Obviously there's still a lot of things to consider, like choice of programming language, ambition and expectations, feasibility as a fifth semester project, features and functions in the program, and so on.

Also, I'm aware there's probably tons of similar functioning services to this, but I have yet to see a calender where you can subscribe and combine everything in a smart way like I'm thinking for this program idea. But you're of course welcome to mention programs I could find inspiration from, and from which I could get answers to some of the things I'm considering.

Even if you got nothing to comment on this, thanks for reading through.
But of course I hope to get some responses :)

1oq8r1,1,2013-10-18,Quit or continue working?,carolinafever,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1oq8r1/quit_or_continue_working/,"I graduated in 2012 from a top 25 school and have been working as a business analyst in large corporation for over a year now. I have internship experience with IBM Application Server support as well.

I enjoy coding and believe that I am above average in my coding skill at least with respect to my fellow classmates who graduated with me. I want to get back into programming, however, it has become difficult to search for jobs while continuing to work. 

I am certain that I do not want to follow the career path as a business analyst,therefore, would it better if I quit by job to work on improving my interview skills and expand job search? I am financially able to support myself for 4-6 months. 

Given the job market, how long of a wait should I expect? Will I miss out of fall recruitment (which, I believe is significantly better than spring), if I do not try my best in my job hunt? Does it impair my resume if I work on independent projects and have no work for 4-6 months? "
1oq6wt,0,2013-10-18,Need some serious help decisions what I want to do with my life.,PaperPals,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1oq6wt/need_some_serious_help_decisions_what_i_want_to/,"I am currently a Sophomore in college, but I've changed my major many times without actually taking any classes. I started out undecided and then a week or two into classes I found that it seemed like everyone else had already decided a major. **TL;DR will be at the bottom.**



1. I figured ""what the hell, I'll just go do History. I enjoy history and I can become a teacher with a degree in it."" After a few weeks(didn't waste any money on classes yet) I realized that although I enjoyed history classes, the only thing I can really do with a degree in history is teach. I thought teaching wouldn't be so bad when I first decided on History, then after thinking about it I thought I'd be a horrible teacher. I'm not very confident in myself, I had speaking to groups on people, and I wouldn't be stern enough to try to get kids to pass. I have the mentality of (well, if you don't want to do it suit yourself you can fail and take the class again). I had also heard many stories where people said they really regret becoming teachers because 

2. Then I went to the Agricultural building and signed up for Plant/Soil sciences. I had heard from a neighbor it was interesting and they make decent money. But after thinking over it I decided it wasn't the best for me. I'm not a science kind of guy, and I'd have to take Chemistry (not a big deal. I mean I hate chemistry but I'll do it if I absolutely have to.) Plus I'd have to travel to the university's farm which is on the other side of the city, but I have no ride over there and being the shy guy I am and not really wanting to ask for help from other people, I decided the mix between me hating Chemistry, me having to travel there every day, and me not being a science guy, Plant/Soil sciences wouldn't work out.

3. Then, and currently, I came into Sport Management. In my philosophy class last semester my professor told us we should major in whatever interests us because (she said some statistical number) of college graduates end up working in a job that doesn't require the degree they earned (and I think it's some bs, but whatever I followed it because I didn't know what else to do). So I decided to go into Sport Management. I've only taken three classes is it so far and it's interesting I guess. I mean, I thought there'd be a more statistical side to it and more real life, current day examples of the things we talk about in class. But apparently it's a very competitive field (one of the most competitive) because so many people go into it because they love sports and it's the thing for them. I'm not sure it's the thing for me though because there is a business side to it where I have to take 7 elective classes in marketing/business. I'm taking one marketing class and it's the first class I have had a 100% in by midterm. It's the first upperlevel class I've taken too, and it's easy but soooo boring I hate it. Marketing I know isn't for me. Back to the SPMT part of it, it requires a lot of experience which I have minimal and it's hard for me to get any considering I can't drive yet. Representatives from the Red came and spoke one day and said that for an intern position they had available, they allowed applications for about two weeks and ended up with over 3k applicants. I'm starting to think it'd be a waste for me to do because I really doubt I will be able to stand out in 3k people for one position that doesn't even get paid. 


******TL;DR***
I've come to the conclusion that I think I'm wasting money. I mean, college is a waste of money in general right? But I want more wisdom, so I'm doing it. I want to waste my money on a degree that will help me land a job or help me in a job. 

- I want to do something that makes decent money. I'd like to pay my parents back for all they have done for me.
- I want to help people. Growing up I've heard that if you aren't helping others, you're wasting your time.
- I want something with a traditional 9-5. In SMPT the hours a terrible (working like 14~16 hours a day and on weekends, and missing out on majority of the holidays no matter your experience/time with an organization. This is another reason I'm doubting SPMT. 
- My interests are Running. I like to play video games. I like animals. I like to eat. I like teeth (most beautiful part of a girl if she has nice teeth, imo) so I thought Dental Hygiene would be a good field for me to go int, but my 
school doesn't offer that program. 



Do you all have any suggestions of what maybe I could to? Or any idea on how I can find out what would be a good career for me? I'm starting to feel ""depressed"" (don't know if depressed is the right word for it, maybe sick with anxiety?)
Any and all help is appreciated. Thanks."
1oq64x,1,2013-10-18,I'm only staying around because I need a car for work,onigai,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1oq64x/im_only_staying_around_because_i_need_a_car_for/,"Me and my mom have a rough relationship. I actually up and left my sophmore year of college and moved in with my dad (my bf also joined me as he had just had his house foreclosed, that's a whole other story). she had hacked my fb and everything, told people I took everything from her house (I only took things I had bought myself). she badmouthed my bf and accused me of doing anything for a dick, and called me a whore. I learned who my friends were that day because they reared their ugly heads and told her off so hard it was enough to bring me to tears.  I was forced back into contact with my mother when she was told she had cancer. at the time I was in engineering school and in the process of slowly realizing that I was in over my head. so I used her as an excuse to change majors and switch to a two year degree somewhere else, but in all honesty, I didn't feel like repeating another year of engineering classes. 

I actually had family try and cancel my placement/entrance exam to my new school because I was going to ""abandon"" her at the hospital, I was going to be late because of the exam but I was still planning to be there to pick her up.  luckily the idiot was dumb enough to threaten me with it before actually doing it so I had a chance to call the school and tell them not to believe anything they don't hear from me regarding my schooling. not 15 minutes later my adviser called me and asked if I was okay because someone called saying there was a family emergency that I wouldn't be at the exam.

now I should mention me and my stepmother never have gotten along (my father sure can pick them) me and my bf were forced to live in the back room of their moldy basement that was halfway through reno that was never finished after Irene. there was a kitchen and bathroom and two other rooms but she filled them up almost as soon as we moved in with junk from their second house. I felt like I was living in a hoarders house. There were mice, spiders, silverfish, mold and some freaky looking slimy things that we would find under mirrors. 

but we were happy, even with the constant torment about how ugly and disgusting and worthless we were from the woman. My bf bought me a white mouse after we caught a mouse in our live trap (that mouse had a very strong personality) and I named him and everything even though I had to let him go (my bf felt really bad). this little white mouse helped us get through this surprisingly, I guess it gave us something to look forward to when we got home. but our little fuzzy friend gave us more to be harassed about as well. hell the hag even poured bleach on him because he ""stank"" (he smelt like the average hamster).  I know for a fact there was no way they could smell him upstairs because not only was he in the farthest room from the stairs but we kept an automatic air freshener in the room and it always smelt fresh. 

eventually things went south between me and the hag and I ended up back at my mothers and my bf at one of her friends' house who ""volunteered"" to help. later the woman renigged on the offer and my bf wasn't even allowed to use the bathroom after we got home from night classes. he now live two blocks from me thank god and has the coolest roommate you could find on craigslist.

so here I am at my moms, she threatens to take the car from me any time I don't do what she wants, shes even tried to tow it(luckily her bf stepped in). I graduate in a month and already have a job in the field which is 30 minutes away but its the happiest place I've ever been in my life, I love it there. last night I was with my bf at the school for his presentation and we go again next week for mine.  last night she texted me asking me where the hell I was and now is taking the car from me. there is no bus to where I work, its a warehouse surrounded by farm land and its owned by a small company. anyway, I'm losing the car two weeks before internship ends, I'm required to work these weeks or I can't graduate. she texted me and flipped out asking where the hell I was and where was her car, that I better not have driven my bf to Carlisle (its where his ex and children live). from what her texts said, she knew her car was not in front of my bfs apt. Even if my car was on drive mode she wouldn't have known I was anywhere but his house until after the first text. not only that I had told her where we were going the night before while I was helping edit his paper. I have seen her drive past bf after bf's house. shes even snooped on my bf asking why there were a bunch of girls hanging around the house(he has a 2nd floor apartment, it used to be an attic before it was split into 4 apartments, and the girl downstairs is pregnant so I'm pretty sure it was a baby shower). so I finally confronted her about it ""wtf? why are you always driving past F's place when I'm staying over its creepy as fuck, you  knew I was at the school for F's graduation presentation"". now its how dare I accuse her of being a stalker and shes so through with me and I'm done. Also she wants her car and I'm never going to drive it again. supposedly. but so far no cops are at my work so I doubt this isn't going to be much more than her badmouthing me to the point I'm suicidal and then some.

I can't even bring myself to tell my boss I may not have a way in on monday, I'll probably end up crying.

I'm so close to being able to get out and be free, now its all going to hell. I thought I would tell someone so I can make the pain in my chest go away. but I'm not sure its working.

edit: I just realized my story has nothing to do with the title. I'm sorry."

Please help if you can.

Currently I am 23 years old and 6 (8 if you count the 2 I'm taking now) classes away from my Computer Science degree. This hasn't been an easy journey for me, I had to leave my first university at 17, ended up with an anxiety disorder and panic attacks that made me fail a few classes (Calc II several times actually) and put me behind in where I'm at and as it stands I'm about $80,000 in student loans with no degree to show for it. Last year I had to drop out of school due to lack of financial aid, but was lucky to find a job that paid $20 an hour doing programming in a bastardized SQL language called Visual FoxPro. This semester, I was able to afford to go back to school part time and pick up 2 more classes to put me closer to my degree, but now I just got laid off and now I'm not really sure what to do.

My resume basically has 3 years of running a mobile DJ business, a year and 2 months working at my last company writing/running SQL queries in FoxPro to process data and a few retail/fast food jobs. I know this probably isn't going to get me a good CS job, especially without my degree, but I've been applying anyway lately and I haven't had much luck. 

So right now I sit, really wanting a software development job, but not knowing if I really am where I should be for that. I'm only missing basically an ethics course and some elective CS courses (Compilers, Game Programming, Networking, other such courses), but I don't think I can afford to take them, and to make matters worse, my school only seems to offer them during the day.

My options seem to be the following (let me know if you can come up with something else):
1. Job hunt everywhere and anywhere until I get hired and drop out
2. Mooch off unemployment and my tax refund and try to take 2 classes in the spring then finish up on financial aid in the fall (this will be REALLY tight on my money)
3. Find a job that pays the $2k a month min I need to pay my bills in any field I can and basically abandon CS

I really don't know what to do right now. I see a lot of people on this site getting great jobs, but I've had the worst time trying to finish my degree or even find internships. Yeah, now I have a year of ""in the field"" experience, though it's with a outdated language, will anyone even consider that? I don't need a $60-80k job now, just a $40-45k job would cut it, but I also don't want my career to be dead end, I really felt like my last job was. And I should add, I'm willing to relocate for a job, especially to Seattle because that's where I've always wanted to live, I just need someone to give me the job offer and I'd be happy."

Most of the time he is completely fine, but sometimes an event will shake his confidence and he'll slip right back into his anxious ways for a few months.  He just finished an internship and graduated college about 2 months ago, and now the company he did his internship for wants to hire him.  Our wedding was about a month ago, he had pretty high anxiety on that day and now he's having troubles trying to shake it.  He does have some beta blockers (very low dosage) that he takes every day and also some type of medication that is very similar to xanex that they gave him 10 of that is supposed to last 4 months.  The beta blockers don't seem to be doing much for him, but that might be because he's taking such a low dosage.  He saw a therapist earlier this week, but he isn't a huge fan of him.  We tried to get him into a woman that specializes in anxiety but she doesn't have an appointment available until the end of this month which will be after his interview.

He knows about breathing techniques and they help a little, but can anyone give me some advice on how to help him cope? I know he'll feel better once he gets a job...but the interview and first few days on the job are going to be tough for him."

:--|:--
[You mentioned you've finally gotten comfortable being naked in front of strangers. what motivated you to start nude modeling in the first place as a self-described awkward, shy person? have you noticed any difference in your everyday life (as in, less modesty with your partner\)? also, how much does it pay?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1opoaj/iama_nude_model_for_art_classes_at_a_large/ccuavrg?context=5)|$15 an hour, I sit for 2h45m each class period, in a variety of different poses.
 |I had always been interested in figure drawing modeling (an old roommate of mine did so for her mother &amp; a few other artists), and I'm a student in the art history department, so it's important for me to associate with professors &amp; be more involved. I found it to be actually really no big deal at all &amp; has improved my confidence (I'm pretty but I have some body issues, and seeing the drawings is both interesting &amp; a confidence booster sometimes!)
 |As far as improving life with my husband, it's the same. The only thing that's changed is he wants to buy a painting/sketch of me :]
[Ha, yeah, you should plaster your walls with nude pictures of yourself and act like it's no big deal when people come over. the most elaborate, expensive joke that would get old pretty fast...](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1opoaj/iama_nude_model_for_art_classes_at_a_large/ccub2tj?context=5)|Yeah, the students are usually cool with me walking over behind their easels after a long pose. The ones I saw yesterday, of me in a reclining pose, were really quite pretty!
[I hadn't even thought about how you'd get to see the drawings afterward, but i could see how that could go both ways depending on the style of art. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1opoaj/iama_nude_model_for_art_classes_at_a_large/ccub2tj?context=5)|Also I super want a sketch of myself for sure. The new class I'm going to be modeling for OMG the professor is the most incredible painter. I wish i was just posing for his work instead, but alas.
[Since you're a student too, does it ever make it awkward that your professors have presumably seen you naked?  I could understand coming in off the street to serve as a model, but hanging out naked with your professors adds another dimension to it.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1opoaj/iama_nude_model_for_art_classes_at_a_large/ccucqy6?context=5)|Nope. I see the professor I mainly model for all the time (I'm an AH major, I'm always in the building). He is funny and nice and not creepy at all. :&gt;
[It's nice when the model takes interest in the artwork done by the students. The people that would model for my class I don't think ever peeked at our artwork once. :(](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1opoaj/iama_nude_model_for_art_classes_at_a_large/ccud8am?context=5)|Aw :&lt; I really enjoy seeing it, it's so neat.
[Any oddball stories from classes? Many boners/ladyboners?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1opoaj/iama_nude_model_for_art_classes_at_a_large/ccuan07?context=5)|Surprisingly, no. The classes have a few ""older"" students, but mostly everyone is close to my age, but it remains a professional environment. It's not silent, we chitchat and make jokes (never about my body, of course, they're there to learn). No ladyboners here, (I'm married!)
[What do mentally while you pose?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1opoaj/iama_nude_model_for_art_classes_at_a_large/ccuan07?context=5)|To pass the time, I listen to music, if they have some that's playing, or think through songs in my head. Sometimes you have to keep a difficult pose for literally upwards of 30+ minutes(just yesterday, I was putting all of my weight on one leg, the other foot on my toes, with my right arm against the wall. It sounds simple but oh my god my legs are sore today). Sometimes I'm laying down and nearly fall asleep. Otherwise, breathe, concentrate, and don't lock your knees!
[As an art student I can say this (as awful as it sounds\); the model becomes just an object. Even nude, I had never felt any limerence or sexual desire for them.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1opoaj/iama_nude_model_for_art_classes_at_a_large/ccubkc2?context=5)|No no, you're totally right. Honestly, I forget that I'm not wearing clothes. It's a job. I have to think about how to pose myself, where my light is, as well as just concentration and dealing with any pain &amp; passing of time. Most of the time you guys are too busy trying to get the grade than pick up the model, anyway. It's nice if you talk to us though (if you can!)
[I being a nude model a full-time job? Do you work any other jobs? HOw do you feel completely comfortable with artists staring at your naked body?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1opoaj/iama_nude_model_for_art_classes_at_a_large/ccualon?context=5)|Nope. For one class, I work every other Tuesday and Thursday (Tuesday one week, Thursday the next week, back to  Tuesday, etc), and the other class I work every Tuesday and Thursday, as well as if any other models call out sick.
 |I do! I work from home, and am also in the process of writing a book. I don't do art modeling for the money (although it pays relatively well).
 |FINALLY yes. I am probably the most awkward person you will ever meet, and very shy, so preparing myself before the first time was a real trip. I think it was more a matter of ""Taking my robe off the first time will be the hardest part, but then I can deal with the rest."" You honestly forget you're nude, and the classes are very friendly. They're close to my age (we're all college students), so we just chitchat. It's very professional.

[Any other awkward moments you've experienced a potential model should be aware of? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1opoaj/iama_nude_model_for_art_classes_at_a_large/ccuatx5?context=5)|I think a lot of people (especially women) worry about body hair. i shave my armpits (although i forgot to yesterday, and i modeled, oops), but i don't go bald downstairs. in fact, i've heard a lot of artists say they actually prefer it that way, for whatever reason. it's just hair and it shouldn't freak you or anybody else out, you're there so people can learn how to draw real people, and you are a real person.

And breathing.
 |I almost always have a bottle of water with me. I don't shower before, the classes that I work in literally come right after two other classes, so I don't have time to run home. I'm not stinky, it's nbd.
 |I can briefly move if I need to, I just need to know exactly how my body is placed before I move, and I only move what i need to. If I need to take a break, I just let people know and then we take a break. I'm naked, so I'm the boss.

And what's the worst?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1opoaj/iama_nude_model_for_art_classes_at_a_large/ccubdg6?context=5)|Best thing about this job is seeing whatever the artists have created. You can look at yourself in a mirror and obviously know the general shape of yourself and how you look, but it's so different on a piece of paper. Sometimes I think, ""OMG my boobs are so saggy ;-;"" and then other times it's like, ""Wow, I didn't know my hips were that big &amp; shapely."" It's just neat to see how other people view your body (both objectively, as they're learning classical technique, but also subjectively, because they all have their own style and little touches).
[Also, besides your husband, do your friends/family know about your job? If so, how do they feel about it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1opoaj/iama_nude_model_for_art_classes_at_a_large/ccubdg6?context=5)|My friends all know, my family knows (but they think I model clothed. For some reason it would be outrageous to them if I was *naked* in front of *people*). My parents think it's...interesting, but hey, i'm covered in tattoos and piercings so I guess they're really not all that surprised. In fact, I'm not sure if they actually believe me or not. Friends think it's great.
[Covered in tattoos... ever though about posing for Suicide Girls?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1opoaj/iama_nude_model_for_art_classes_at_a_large/ccue4uq?context=5)|Yes and no.

 |Most embarassing thing was showing up the first time to model and realizing my roommates ex-girlfriend was there to write an article on the class. Neither of us had any idea the other was going to be there. Turned into a great interview and some good laughs, she's a very nice person.
[Did you ever get ""excited"" being nude in front of all the students, that it was visible?

What do you plan on using your degree for?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1opoaj/iama_nude_model_for_art_classes_at_a_large/ccuct39?context=5)|For me, it's less competition. I go to a REALLY top university in the south (say what you may about our football, but we're not called the Harvard of the South for nothing, and I'm not necessarily talking about academics, just the prestige that comes with the name Ole Miss), and I am in a REALLY small department, and I'm excelling well. I have done one awesome internship last semester, the first semester I ever went to this school (as a transfer student, no less), and am working with a professor this summer, as well as nabbing this art modeling gig. I've got it MADE.
[Ps.  Yes, I am aware that many people turn their art history degrees into lucrative and/or fulfilling professions in the arts.  I am just talking about the perception.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1opoaj/iama_nude_model_for_art_classes_at_a_large/ccuct39?context=5)|Hey, I didn't see this until just now. I think it's bullshit, but there are bigger reasons (that Reddit doesn't really like to hear) why I think STEM is pushed pushed pushed and people just like to shit all over anything lib-arts. I actually am getting more opportunities as an art history major than I did as a bio major back in the day. There's just such a flux of STEM and, yes, there are jobs in STEM fields, but the math just doesn't compute when there's a glut of students racing for those jobs.

Excited, but verrry nervous, I'm a very shy person. Slipping off the robe was the hardest part, but once I was there, it was honestly no big deal.
[Hi! I'm a photographer and dabble in other forms of art, and have always thought this would be an interesting job to have as pocket-money, how did you get into the job?

I do not believe you have to be a student, but it's probably encouraged (we're obviously pretty poor). As far as I know, no certain age (other than legal, for obvious reasons). As far as I know, my body type has nothing to do with it. I have heard that sculptors prefer thicker models, but as for drawing, all body types are encouraged afaik. I am not skinny, but slender &amp; curvy, and have seen a few older models, as well a verry thin dancer-type girl, as well as a thicker model. :&gt;
[How old are the students? Did you feel offended by some drawings? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1opoaj/iama_nude_model_for_art_classes_at_a_large/ccub5na?context=5)|The oldest woman in one of my classes is probably 40-50. Most students are around my age, 18-24. I don't feel offended by any drawings. They're all from different angles so even a more ""unflattering"" pose is still true to life. Most of them are incredible artists.
[Okay, thanks. Are there any ""immature"" students?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1opoaj/iama_nude_model_for_art_classes_at_a_large/ccube83?context=5)|Not at all! I was surprised, because in one class there's a more ""bro"" type guy, as well as a looot of sorority girls (or I'm assuming to be so), but they're actually incredibly nice and talk to me a lot.

Yesterday I was in two longer poses, one reclined, one standing, both of which were very painful. The first pose was the worst, though. my legs were half-stretched out and I was kind of rolled forward onto my right hip, while my upper body was slightly propped up with pillows, kind of like if you were on the floor and resting your head on a low stool. The pilows were comfy but my shoulder blades were pushed further out instead of closer together (or something?) so that hurt, and any time my right leg even twitched, it hurt so bad. Laid there for a good 40 minutes.
[Have you picked your focus yet in Art History? I've been debating switching into the program at my University and I'd like to study French Baroque specifically if I can.

There are a lot more opportunities here than you would think (and there's so much room for growth, because I honestly think we have no more than ten AH undergrads here, and no AH grad students). My focus is in minority art, particularly art of women and art BY women. My super super focus is on Mabel Dodge Lujan &amp; the Taos art colony she founded in the 20s. That's currently the subject of the book I'm writing.
[I worked in a museum briefly as an assistant curator at K-State and it was kind of fantastic. It's crazy that you only have ten AH undergrads!

I sincerely forget I'm naked, because I either zone out or I'm concentrating too much on how to position myself, or working through the pain of a difficult pose. I tend to keep my legs more closed, just because I don't want the pose to seem vulgar, although if a student or the class wanted a more ""exposed"" pose, I would be comfortable with that. It comes down to what shape the students want to learn how to draw.

[Hello! I actually used to schedule models to come in for my college's art club so that we could do public figure drawing sessions. I always had an easier time getting women to model, men were always a bit cagey about it. Could never figure out why, but guys seemed really self conscious about doing that kind of work. Any thoughts on that? Have you ever noticed a disparity between male and female models? Any ideas why that discomfort would fall along gender lines like that?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1opoaj/iama_nude_model_for_art_classes_at_a_large/ccud4ee?context=5)|I've never met any male models in our department yet (although we have some). I have the feeling guys are actually more prudish about that and assume it would be some kind of sexual experience, when it's genuinely not.

Thanks ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1opoaj/iama_nude_model_for_art_classes_at_a_large/ccuayxd?context=5)|To stop? No. Once I did it, it was quite natural and I frequently forget I'm naked. I wanted to do it for general interest in art modeling, as well as wanting to be more involved in my department, as well as a confidence booster. It's quite liberating!
[Have you thought about branching out into other aspects of modeling, such as photography? Why/why not?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1opoaj/iama_nude_model_for_art_classes_at_a_large/ccuclw1?context=5)|I don't feel I'm conventionally attractive and no photographers I know have expressed an interest in photographing me.

It's not really a sexual thing, but I understand if just like the whole ""Please don't get a boner please don't get a boner"" aspect just unconsciously makes you have a boner. Oops!

A scholarship I'm applying for requires that I submit 8 portfolio images for review, should I send them 2 images each from 4 projects or 1 image each from 8 projects? Should I go for diversity or consistency? 

Additionally, since the internship is Fashion Branding based, should I include pieces that are only tangentially related to fashion?

For example, two of the images I intend to submit are from a hypothetical microsite mockup for Aston Martin which still falls within the luxury category but isn't directly related to fashion. 

I should mention that the criteria for the competition is quite vague and provides little direction. It only states that entries must display intellect, vision and innovation however the review panel is composed entirely from those working within the fashion and luxury industries. 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated. 

Thanks

I have written in a lot of languages (including PHP, C and Java) and have experience with MySQL but I am far from a master of any because of that, and furthermore I have only taken a couple courses of programming (Java) in high school and college; though I have been programming for ten years. Most of the code I currently write is not really presentable in a comp sci job either because only a small part is mine (ie, I have modified some supercomputer codes that I run to better suit our needs) or because I very quickly put it together and it looks like junk. Some is good code but it is not often object oriented as much of programming in the scientific world is not. I am also not very familiar with things like factory patterns or not at all with things like MVC architecture. I do have a few ""projects"", especially one large complicated project, I have worked on but they have always been for myself and compared to modern PHP they are quite outdated (quarter of the code was written before PHP 5 was even very well adopted, with most of the latest code being early 2011 as I have been to busy to put in a lot of time). I have done basic LAMP system administration for about ten years as well (2 production servers most of that time). I have, from almost scratch, written projects for 2 friends in their 400 level CS classes, but they have had internships and classes where they learned things I do not know (e.g. data structures other than multidimensional arrays, which is basically as far as I know). I am absolutely horrible at web design. Can anyone give me any ideas on how to go about finding a job outside of standard online sites and what kind of places I have a chance in (I live in a large city in the mid-Atlantic East Coast)? A lot of places I look have very specific requirements even for entry level positions (like knowing/having worked with popular frameworks for a language for example) that I do not have. "
1op5j6,3,2013-10-18,I'm Done With College,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1op5j6/im_done_with_college/,"I'm 19, male, of standard to above average intelligence, living at home, going to college right now, and I'm sick of it. 

I stayed home and went to the shitty college in my home town because every-fucking-thing I wanted to do was rejected by my parents. Every course I wanted to take wasn't what they wanted me to take. Every place I wanted to go 'wasn't really where I want to go.' I'm sick and tired of not standing up to my mother and step father, and this is the end of it. I'm not some 16 year old bitching about how shitty school is, I'm someone who wants to take life in the direction I want, and not let what other people want me to do be the only way I live.

My highschool marks were good enough to get me into just about every college in Ontario. I wanted to take a year off and work, my mother wanted me to go straight into college.


I went to college. 


I wanted to take a course on Interior Design. My stepdad said ""what are you, gay?"" and my mom told me there are no jobs in that field right now. I know my mom was right, and I knew that. Well, aside from the family friend who works heavily in landscape and interior design, who told me he would have no problem referring me to companies, or even letting me intern under him. 


I'm straight. I didn't go into an Interior Design course. 


I wanted to go into an Engineering course in a college in Toronto. I got accepted, and I was really happy. I had even changed my last semester Grade 12 courses to a more advanced math so I would qualify. According to my mom and stepdad, I didn't want to travel to Toronto every day. Of course I didn't want to drive 2 hours every day. I want to live in Toronto, regardless of schooling, I like the city, I want to get away from the suburbs for a bit. 


According to my stepdad I don't really like Toronto, and once I get there I'll never make the money to move away. 


My mother said that living out of town is expensive, and I agreed, but I showed her I got into the course I wanted at the college I wanted. She said she thought the college in my home town was better. They don't have the course I want. 


Since 'I don't want to live in Toronto and I don't want to go to my choice school,' I didn't accept the offer to go there.

The only semi-relevant course to Engineering was Computer Networking at this college I'm at. 


I got accepted. 


I don't like the core courses, they relate to nothing that I want to do with my life. The Communication courses are alright, at least they hold some use for me.  I don't like the college I'm at. It has a decent reputation. It's relatively inexpensive. I'm living at home and saving money there. I'm working part time around school which is what I want to do anyways. 

I don't like the school all that much. I keep thinking about how much more enjoyable studying a field I care about might be. Maybe even working full time and moving to Toronto for a while. I listen to my high school friends talk about how much they enjoy being in Nursing, in Computer Programming, in Criminology out of province, or how glad they are that they took the year off and are saving up for their field of study out of province. I'm here, in the course that hold little relevance to my life, doing everything because I listened to what my parent's wanted me to do.

I'm going to tell my mom I'm leaving college this week. I'm passing my courses. I don't enjoy them, I'm not learning anything I care about or want to care about. I haven't suddenly been exposed to an area I want to pursue as a career, I've been taught that I dislike learning about the OSI model, and don't really care about how many Volts a 1 and 0 (binary) are converted to when being sent across a copper wire. I've also learned that I've become restless living at home, and that isn't a fun feeling.

Mom is going to be upset. She wanted me to stay close, and I get that no one really wants their son to be a drop-out. My stepdad is going to tell me that I'm just wasting money, that I already paid for this semester so suck it up and finish it off. I'm just going to tell them I've made up my mind. I'll go to college when they can accept I'm going to go into a field I want, or at least can stand. 

I work tomorrow. I'm going to tell my boss I can start working Tuesday through Friday again. I'll start working full time to save up enough. Not sure what 'enough' is. Enough to pay my loans off and my car insurance. Maybe a bit saved up to go to a school I want next year.

I'm debating selling my desktop computer. I built it, it's pretty new. I might be able to get $800 out of it and pay back some of my loans, maybe put a bit into first or last rent on a place in the city. I'm not sure why, but for the past 3 years I've had this dream of moving to Toronto. I'm in no rush to get there, but if I'm not in school, maybe it's time. 

TL;DR - Rambling. Tired. Upset. I think this post went from ""I'm angry with how my life is"" to ""I just don't know."" read and find out if you'd like.

1op222,1,2013-10-18,Take Yourself Out of the Pressure Cooker,mariabruggere,LifeProTips,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/1op222/take_yourself_out_of_the_pressure_cooker/,"Last month I felt like I was on the verge of some kind of weird breakdown. I had gotten hung up on September 11, various conspiracy theories, the Syrian war, the Newsroom, and everything else the news had to offer. I wasn't just feeling down on myself, I was feeling down on the world, but that only made me feel worse about myself. Pathetic, I know.

But why?

Because here I sit, in fabulous Los Angeles with a college degree from Oregon State University, work experience in various areas of the entertainment industry, a worldly background, and charisma to boot, and I feel like I can't find a full-time job (that I like) to save my damn life.

I'm not talking part-time job, volunteer work, or internships, I'm talking a job. The 9-5 lifestyle that consists of a salary, benefits, company camaraderie, the whole lot. Sounds easy, right?

When I, and anyone else that was born anywhere from 1985-1992 were told that we would spend all this time in school, go to college, make lifelong friends, and graduate with the knowledge and opportunity to blast into the work force and find a great job paying $40k plus with benefits. We were lied to.

Is it the liars fault that we were lied to? Not at all. Even though we want to believe it, our parents can't predict the future. They couldn't predict that terror would strike us in ways we didn't think was possible. They had no idea the banks were full of terrible people doing selfish things. And they definitely didn't know that most of us would still be living with them at the age of 24 or 25, working part time at Starbucks and part time at Red Robin and living at home.

I visited home recently and realized how many people still live in the town I grew up in and they have part time, minimum wage jobs, and college degrees. See what's wrong with this picture? We are the milennials, we are supposed to be the ones that save the world. We're supposed to be the ones that put a stop to global warming and human rights issues, and vote for the first female president. But so far, we haven't figured much of that out because we are struggling to survive ourselves. Therefore, all the old farts think that we are lazy. HA.

As I sit and think about all of these things day in and day out - about how I can get better every day and how I am going to make a difference, I get frustrated. I know one day I will have a career I love, the family I want, and so on and so forth, but right now it all seems so far away. The milennials went through such a transition in history and we haven't completely made the switch yet. That part we are still trying to figure out.

When I thought I had reached my breaking point a few weeks ago, I finally got enough sleep to snap back into the glass half full skeptic that I am (sort of ironic, I know). And I realized this:

Working a minimum-wage job with a brand new shiny college degree isn't the depressing part. Living with your parents doesn't suck that bad (after all, you did it for the first 18 years or so of your life). But what does suck is giving up. Giving up on your peers, your country, and yourself. If you do all of that, you are sure to live a miserable life.

People have said we are the problem generation. With tattoos, piercings, truck driver mouths, and Miley Cyrus, but we still have many great qualities. Our generation elected the first African-American president. Our generation has brought you things like Tumblr and Facebook (and you're lying if you say you don't like them). And our generation brought you us - we are who we are and we're not really going to ever change no matter what you say, but be grateful, it will be a good thing one day. When the milennials are old and pooping in their adult Pampers, the young people are going to be grateful for us and what we accomplished.

What I'm really trying to say to the people my age (24 or around there) is don't put so much pressure on yourself that you give up completely. Don't crumble into a million pieces and work at 24 Hour Fitness for the next 10 years. Do what you want to do. Get your bills paid, of course, but don't give up what you're passionate about. If no one is going to offer you a real job anyway, make your own. Do it yourself.

I put all this pressure on myself that I have to find the perfect job tomorrow, I have to lose 15 lbs. this week, and that I have to find the man of my dreams and have a baby by next Friday.

That might sound really super crazy to some of you reading this, but believe me, there are a million other 20-somethings out there thinking the exact same thing. In so many ways I want so badly to be perfect that I almost feel like I'm nothing but a lazy piece of crap, but that's not the case! Not even close. I am worth a full-time job, the benefits, the husband, and the family. But Rome wasn't built in a day.

Moral of the story? Take your time. Pay your bills however you need to. Live your life one day at a time. When you lie down at night to fall asleep, think about each thing you did that day to accomplish one step closer to your ultimate goal.

For example:
-- Today I secured a part-time job
-- I started a new writing class
-- I rode my horse

Those are just three things I did today that helped me in various ways move closer to my ultimate goal. Life is supposed to ultimately be something of joy, laughter, and willingness to love.

Try it, I dare you.

1ooyjx,8,2013-10-17,"[USA, TX]: Non-Compete form for a therapist. Can my friend be sued?",dpd102,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1ooyjx/usa_tx_noncompete_form_for_a_therapist_can_my/,"This is for a friend of mine who was recently involved with a counseling group in Texas. She is an LPC in training which means she needs 3000 hours of work under the guidance of a supervisor before she can get licensed and have a practice of her own. The facts are as follows: 

* She first made contact and agreed to work for the group in question 11 months ago

* 7 months ago she was presented with a home-made non-compete agreement and told she had to sign it or leave the organization. She signed it. 

* The agreement states that if she leaves within 12 months of beginning her employment with that organization that she cannot see ANY of her clients for a further 12 months beyond the date of leaving

* The fee she paid to be a part of this group varied from month to month but averaged about $600 per month. This is high. For this she was supposed to be supplied with a constant stream of referrals. In 9 months she received 6 referrals and only one of them turned into a full time client. This is a very low amount. During this time she did receive clients of her own through her own advertising and from referrals from her existing clients. She had brought in about 8 clients from her previous arrangement (a non profit, the relationship ended amicably). 

* When her supervisor first found out she was leaving he reminded her that she had not fulfilled the non-compete and informed her. He stated that she should stay until the end of this year (Which would have been approximately the 11.5 month mark) and if she did that then he would consider the terms fulfilled. She responded by offering to stay one additional month (The 10 month mark), but that was going to be her only offer. He responded by saying he would let the courts handle it. 

* Today she received an email from him stating that she would have to either pay him $2000 or else he would be seeking $9000 of damages in a lawsuit. 

So the crux of this question revolves around whether or not the non-compete she signed is enforceable, and if not then *how* unenforceable is it? It contains the following phrase: 

Note: To be clear - at no point does the organization offer anything at ALL in exchange for the agreement. It is simply a one-sided demand. 

* When leaving Organization…

* If a therapist at Organization for a minimum of one year, I agree to not transfer or see any Organization clients at another location that I have seen for less than 20 sessions and less than 6 months at Organization.

* If a therapist at Organization for less than one year, or for Organization clients not meeting those criteria, I agree to not see any Organization client for a minimum of 1 year after leaving Organization.

My contention is that this is entirely unenforceable for several reasons: 

1) There is no definition of what an ""Organization Client"" is or how it is determined. Most of her clients came with from prior to her coming to this organization, and all but one of her clients were direct referrals from existing clients or from her own advertising work. 

2) There are two rules fundamental requirements of a non-compete in Texas: That it be both a) Reasonable and b) Part of an Otherwise Enforceable agreement. I believe that this satisfies neither because a) It's not possibly reasonable to keep a therapy client from seeing their therapist for ANY reason - let alone because of a legal contract, and b) There is no actual agreement here. The organization is not promising anything in this agreement, and neither is the person threatening the lawsuit. They are just making a demand and saying ""Sign it or you're fired"". Basically there is no way for the ORGANIZATION to hold up its end of the bargain because it doesn't have an end of this bargain. Therefor this is not a part of an enforceable agreement. Additionally this was most definitely signed MONTHS after the beginning of employment at the organization. 


I have advised her as a friend that she should immediately cut contact with this guy on ALL channels and seek the advice of an attorney. However, given that I am not an attorney I cannot give any legitimate legal advice here. 

My question is: What are the odds that this guy has the necessary standing to WIN a lawsuit and claim his stated $9,000 in small claims court? (Note: In texas the small claims limit is $10,000)

One extra note: She left this guy's organization because he's extremely shady and is a massive asshole. He was supposed to be helping her as a supervisor and he most certainly was not helpful in any way. She was desperate to get away from this guy but she's incredibly poor/struggling so her options were always limited. She has no money so I'm not even sure what he stands to gain by filing suit. 

**Extra Info: Just to alleviate some of the confusion around how this arrangement works... Interns work for these supervisory organizations. They pay the organization and the organization in turn provides supervision and offices for the intern to use. One of the unfortunate parts of being an intern is that you are NOT allowed to have clients pay you directly. Instead they have to pay your supervisor and he then pays you in turn. Typically organizations charge a flat fee of $200-$300 per month for this service. However in this case the organization was charging a flat fee plus a portion of overall earnings.**

I have been actively involved in oceanographic research and field work since the beginning of my undergraduate studies. 
During several summer internships and eventual short-term position as Junior Oceanographer at BBB, I assisted with deployment/recovery of marine instrumentation and performed field data processing, interpretation and presentation tasks. I also created MATLAB-based software that analyzed raw oceanographic data which was much more user-friendly than the old manufacturer's software and allowed to cut the processing time at least by half. 

While working as a Research Assistant at the University of CCC, I developed a highly complex numerical model that examined various aspects of large-scale ocean currents. This model revealed previously unknown recirculation mechanisms that take place in the world ocean. 
My technical expertise includes fluency in several programming languages (MATLAB, C++, Fortran), depth knowledge of various analytical programs (OriginLab, Microsoft Excel, Wolfram Mathematica, Maple) and solid experience in scientific and technical writing.

1oonxp,158,2013-10-17,"100 job applications later, stats on my 2 month job search (class of 2013 grad)",basickafka,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1oonxp/100_job_applications_later_stats_on_my_2_month/,"**This is my own personal experience but I hope some of the things I’ve learned will be helpful to others in a job search.**

I graduated from a Top 10 school last spring with a history major. At the time I didn't know what I wanted to do as a career so I decided to apply for an internship at a company at my school's spring career fair and ended up working at that company over the summer. I've since moved to New York City and decided to dive head first into a job search here. 

My history background makes me a generalist... I know how to read, write, research and articulate my background, ideas, and goals. I know I would not want to work in a corporate environment. I knew what industries I had some interest in. Every job I applied to I qualified for based on the job description. 
I have held on campus leadership positions as well as 3 internships including the one I just completed the summer after my graduation. These were probably the biggest help in getting my foot in the interview door. Even if a previous internship wasn't directly relevant to a position, I had transferrable skills that I highlighted in my cover letter.  

I found job listings via Indeed, going to company's websites and looking at their jobs section, and on NYFA's job board. Out of 100 applications I had 2 employee referrals at major tech companies. Neither panned out. For every other job I applied directly to the listing. My cover letters were always written from the heart, explaining why I want this position and what background I can offer to contribute to the team. Hiring managers don't like robots, unless maybe you're applying for an old-fashioned corporate company. I applied to a lot of big companies who for sure use some sort of resume parsing system and I'm sure I didn't make the cut in many cases there because I was filtered out for not having certain keywords. Whatever, I don't want to have to deal with bots looking for matches so I stopped applying for companies like that. The companies I did hear back from are small to medium sized with a casual, friendly vibe. 



* Started looking for jobs 8/22/13; didn't start seriously applying till the first week of September
* Jobs applied to: 100 (16/100 internships, 84/100 salaried positions; 5/100 resume only, 95/100 with cover letter)
* Shortest response time for interview after submitting application: within a few hours from a tech startup, media agency, pr agency
* Longest response time for interview after submitting application: 17 days/12 business days from a tech company
* Average response time for interview after submitting application: 1 week
* Number of requests for first interview (some first interviews were on the phone, some in person at an office): 18/100 (4 for internships, 14 for salaried positions).
* Number of rejections after interviews (whether 1st or 2nd round): 4 (1 went to internal candidate, 1 went to more qualified candidate, 1 didn’t like me, 1 thought I didn’t have enough experience). 
* Number of companies I withdrew from after interview: 3 (would not be happy at these places)
* Number of companies interviewed and waiting for response: 4
* Number of companies with first interviews scheduled: 7
* Most enlightening moment: I got a reply from the CEO of a small startup. He said I should have passed highly in his resume review but I didn't because my cover letter was too generic. He told me (rather harshly, but I thank him for this) that I need to figure out how I as a recent graduate can add value to a company. Why would a company invest time and money in you? Show them that it will be worth it. Come up with a pitch about how you can contribute to a company. This changed how I approached cover letters and got me more interviews. 


Most common interview questions I encountered:

Why this company?

Tell me about yourself and why you applied. 

Tell me what you did in X position.

Do you have experience doing [insert specific responsibility from job description here]?



My advice:
Try not to get discouraged no matter how long your job search is. I would get really depressed days at time after a string of rejection emails and it really sucked. Just know that if you are determined and keep at the job search, you will see progress. For example, I got SO much better at job searching (finding opportunities, cover letters, interviewing) with practice over the past two months. I have more interviews now than I did one month ago near the start of my search. If you need to pay the bills, consider getting a part time job at a grocery store or other job like that to bring in some sort of income. I lived off my savings, which probably boosted my motivation to keep on applying, knowing that I had to find a job before my money ran out. 

Write an awesome cover letter. Put yourself in the hiring manager's shoes.. will they think, ""that person sounds awesome, they have the skills and they have a great personality"" or ""meh forgot about this person among the 50 other applications I received"".

An interview tip that's really worked for me. Before an interview, stretch really big, move your muscles, roll your neck, make your body really big. I saw a TED talk about body language and how powerful it is to stand in a ""victory stance"" before a job interview. It brings up your confidence, opens you up, makes you feel better.  It has worked for me.  Listen to a fun song before the interview. “Without me” by eminem always gets me feeling relaxed and happy.

Good luck to my fellow job-seekers. I'm still in talks with a few companies, all of which I really like. So hopefully I'll be employed in the next few weeks. "

[Thankyou for answering this, but can I be rude and just ask another?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oq8g6/hi_reddit_we_are_sloane_ant_neely_after_working/ccuihg6?context=5)|Sloane got a job as a receptionist at Henson's and made herself as invaluable as possible - willing to help anyone and everyone out, smiling a lot and being easy going.  When Henson's were planning Muppet Treasure Island she asked to be an assistant in the art department (ended up in the model shop though).  Then she made as many contacts as she could.
[What is your opinion on the state of film schools within the UK? I'm currently attending one but I get the sense that it's too late and I've wasted my money. How did the both of you start out?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oq8g6/hi_reddit_we_are_sloane_ant_neely_after_working/ccuihg6?context=5)|I (Ant) did trainee (unpaid) work in an art department and got my foot in the door that way.  It really is about meeting people - which is hard, but you just need to reach out and understand that is is an ongoing process!
[Great advice for people thinking about joining a film school! Thankyou once again.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oq8g6/hi_reddit_we_are_sloane_ant_neely_after_working/ccuihg6?context=5)|UK film school is tricky - Rhetorical questions: Does the school have a track record off graduates getting into the industry?  Are you learning? Are you enjoying the experience?  Are you spending every spare moment making shorts with other students (you should be!).  In your holidays are you trying to get runner/assistant/trainee positions for experience? 
[Thanks once again. I have a lot of things to think about... Even though the school itself is highly rated, I just don't feel like they're giving all they could &amp; creating shorts without any equipment myself is next to impossible.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oq8g6/hi_reddit_we_are_sloane_ant_neely_after_working/ccuixgl?context=5)|Does the school not let you use their gear?  They should!
[They're very reluctant to do so mainly because a lot of students don't look after the equipment properly. Often we will go to see what is available &amp; all they will have is some gel's and a C-stand.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oq8g6/hi_reddit_we_are_sloane_ant_neely_after_working/ccujb3c?context=5)|Ouch. Not great.  Don't forget though - it's all about learning how to tell a story, so if you only have a borrowed iPhone, then at least you can experiment.  It might not help you much to learn about being a technical DP, but you will learn about coverage etc.
[What was hardest to sacrifice for your dreams?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oq8g6/hi_reddit_we_are_sloane_ant_neely_after_working/ccugqcg?context=5)|""If we loose everything, but make the film, would we still feel it was worth doing?"".  We both said yes.  Life is short and it is something we were really passionate about doing.

[Sloane U'Ren - what set design in Harry Potter were you most proud of/impressed by?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oq8g6/hi_reddit_we_are_sloane_ant_neely_after_working/ccugufm?context=5)|I was impressed by so many things!, both sets drawn up by other members of the art department and my own.  Having worked on the 6th Potter, the Quidditch Pitch came up again and our amazingly talented Production Designer Stuart Craig wanted to change the design slightly from what it was in the first few films.  I got to draught the new version that had 20 towers now instead of 16 - and the towers were now about 25 feet taller (in theory!), so over 110 feet tall.  There were other smaller changes and tweeks as well.  Though a part of the tower had been built at full size for previous films, on the Half-Blood Prince, this was the first time that the Quidditch Pitch (that is the field itself) was built full size.  So we had half an entire pitch laid with grass at full size!, plus the grass bank that curves around the far end behind the three hoops.  It was quite exciting to actually have the big field.  I (and a couple of junior draughtsman) drew/redrew the entire Quidditch Pitch, both on the computer - so that it could go to the VFX houses to be built in 3D and the characters could be composited, flying around on their brooms! - and by hand. Other impressive sets definitely include the Observatory, the Room of Requirement - such amazing detail in every set!
[Some advise for people who want to get into your trade?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oq8g6/hi_reddit_we_are_sloane_ant_neely_after_working/ccuguc9?context=5)|It's all about meeting people. It is hard to cold call/email and introduce yourself to people - but it's part of the business.  Sometimes people will have time to chat, sometimes not - but persevere.
 |When you do get someone on the phone/email, ask if you can send a CV (resumé).  It always pays to know a bit about who you are talking to - be familiar with their work and reference it.  Write a polite email and follow up every couple of months (email is best).  We get lots of emails, and when it is time to find people for a project, we naturally will be more likely to remember someone who has kept in contact.
 |Of course, study everything you can about the field you are interested in.  Find out what skills are required and learn them.
 |One thing that is really important - film/TV hours are long!  Having a positive personality, an can-do attitude and a smile really helps.  Everyone likes to be around nice people.
 |Hope that helps?  Good luck! :)
[Hi Sloane and Ant! Sloane... What/who inspired you for the half blood prince? I loved the colour pallette you used. It's definitely the most aesthetically pleasing film out all of them. And I think it's inspired that you moved. Less rugby traffic. (I live in that area\)  And another question. I'm a student in animation and would love to get my foot in some kind of ..well any kind of art department to one day become some sort of part of a design team. What do you think is the most important aspect to show in your portfolio/showreel? And more importantly do you guys enjoy your jobs? What's the best bits and the worse bits?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oq8g6/hi_reddit_we_are_sloane_ant_neely_after_working/ccum4hu?context=5)|Hi! When it came to the Half-Blood Prince, as that was 6/7 years into the 10 year span of shooting the films, the colour palette was fairly much already determined by the production designer by then.  So I didn’t actually have any influence when it came to the colours - that credit has to go to Stuart Craig and his Set Decorator Stephenie McMillan.  Glad you like the look of Half-Blood Prince though - I am proud of my work on it.  I think a portfolio should of course show your talents and creativity to the best of your ability as well as showing off any technical elements that is important to your specific creative talent.  As I’m sure you know, although we all like to flex our creative muscles, when it comes to film/television/animation, etc., as it is not a fine art, we generally can’t just do whatever we want(!) - their is a script to follow, a director and/or producer to work for/with, etc.  So we have to look at these requirements in a creative and yet logistical and practical way (to problem-solve and invent ways to tell an overall story and to add to this, without taking over or being to flashy).  That’s usually the challenging but fun bit, from a design point of view.
 |Make sure when you talk through your pieces in your portfolio that you point out how you made something ‘work‘, how and/or why you chose to design something a certain way so that it worked for the project.  We love our work!  Best bits...I love working as a director now, though I do also really love working in art depts (and do still do that here and there).  Worse bits...lack of sleep when you’re working very hard on your own project! Thanks very much, Sloane.
[In doing art design or soundtracking other people's work how much leeway were you given?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oq8g6/hi_reddit_we_are_sloane_ant_neely_after_working/ccugsq7?context=5)|In doing art department work and designing, it really depends on who you are working for (how the head of the art department - the production designer - works). Some PDs know exactly what they want and will sketch up an idea, do a loose draughting up (a loose technical drawing of plans and/or elevations, like in real world architecture), and/or give you references of images, like photo reference out of magazines, books, the internet, or other designs/art work - as inspiration.  Then your job is to work out how to make their design work in terms of size and materials used to build it.  Other PDs will just give a photo reference of a set and basic sizes of how big/tall it should be and, as a set designer/draughtsman or art director, you get to run with it.  Even if the latter sounds like you get to be more creative (and frequently you do!) the former isn’t bad either - when you are working for a designer, I do also appreciate that they have a clear idea of what they want.  So both works for me! The first feature film that I production designed was also the first feature film that I directed - Dimensions.  Though it was great to design (and I did specifically think that if I didn’t like directing, at least I have now designed a feature and I can continue getting into designing films! - though I love directing), I would not do that on the next one - as you can image, it’s too much work.  Still, it worked for me on Dimensions...and the conversations between the director and the designer were very short and the director always agreed with the designer!!
[Thanks for doing this!  What are some things that no-budget independent filmmakers can do to up the quality of their production?  Also, what's a question you wish we would ask you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oq8g6/hi_reddit_we_are_sloane_ant_neely_after_working/ccujas3?context=5)|Tips:  Shoot with what you have.  Write around what you have access to.  Collaborate.  Scripts are free (assuming you or a collaborator writes them) - so nail it!  Use actors and not friends (lots of good actors will do shorts if they like the script).  Don't be afraid to ask.  Put together a team of passionate people that are good.  If your DP (etc) isn't up to scratch, then have that difficult conversation - an audience won't give you a 'free-pass' because it is no-budget.
 |As for a question... ""Would you like me to sell my house to fund your next film?"" :)
[Awesome, thanks for the reply!  I'm guilty of using friends as actors.. But now I will start looking at the local university drama and film departments for people looking to build up their reel!  If I owned a house, I would sell it to you.  Maybe.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oq8g6/hi_reddit_we_are_sloane_ant_neely_after_working/ccujvqw?context=5)|Hehe.
[With more and more production design and set design being extended (or created entirely digitally\), how does this affect your job as an art director?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oq8g6/hi_reddit_we_are_sloane_ant_neely_after_working/ccuiqg0?context=5)|It really depends on the film - often it is a combination of green screen and sets so we work closely with vfx.
[Do you enjoy the creative possibilities that CG allows for, or do you prefer physically working with the art?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oq8g6/hi_reddit_we_are_sloane_ant_neely_after_working/ccuiqg0?context=5)|There is nothing like the atmosphere a good set creates though - it feels magic!  Also, it really gives the cast something to react to.
[How much of the job now involves directing animators or effects teams instead of dressers and building crews?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oq8g6/hi_reddit_we_are_sloane_ant_neely_after_working/ccuiqg0?context=5)|CG does open up a huge amount of doors - and I love it when it is done well.  For me, a combination of physical and CG can give the best of both worlds.  For Dimensions we had SFX (smoke, explosions) and VFX (sparks, glow etc.) for the time machine.  The actors react to the set and SFX, while the VFX heightens the illusion. 
[What's the most difficult thing about being in the industry, and are you willing to part with some trade secrets for a 3rd year film student? Thank you!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oq8g6/hi_reddit_we_are_sloane_ant_neely_after_working/ccuil8d?context=5)|Lack of sleep. Finding work. Getting people to say 'yes'. Getting people to read scripts.  But it can be sooo much fun.
 |Smile. Always be on time (or early).  Be willing to pitch in and help anyone.  Respect boundaries.  Watch how others behave on set and emulate (the good bits).  Everyone is sleep deprived so a positive attitude really helps!
[What are the chief responsibilities between production designer and art director? How collaborative is it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oq8g6/hi_reddit_we_are_sloane_ant_neely_after_working/ccuifro?context=5)|Here is a great link to the breakdown of what the production designer, art director (sometimes the supervising art director on big films, with larger art departments) and assistant art director.  (On some bigger films, the head of the art dept is the PD, then their right hand person is the supervising art director, then there might be a couple/few art directors, then assistant art director(s), set designers (called draughtman or draughtsperson in the UK), and so on.)  It is written by Greg Papalia, who is a fantastic and talented Supervising/Art Director who I had the opportunity to work with a while back when I was still in the U.S. on the film The Patriot... [Link to www.adg.org](http://www.adg.org/sites/art/pdf/art_department.pdf)
[What's next after your first feature? I've always heard making the first is hard, making the second is even harder!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oq8g6/hi_reddit_we_are_sloane_ant_neely_after_working/ccuifro?context=5)|It depends on the personalities of the PD and the AD but, hopefully, they almost always work well together(!) and that they usually get the best results when their is a lot of collaboration.  I worked with a PD and AD who did many films together and the AD could frequently answer questions of the other departments that the art dept work with, such as construction and location, without consulting with the PD constantly because he know what the PD would want, or he knew that the PD would like the ADs choices.  That way, as well, the PD had more time to devote to other things (meetings, issues, etc.). You are correct about getting the second one up and running.  I guess , with the first film, as Ant and I took the plunge and sold our house to make our feature, once we decided that...that was it, we just went ahead and started pre-production and went on to make the film.  With the second, we are beginning to attach actors and it’s a different process.  Dimensions has helped open doors for us and we’re getting meetings that we would not have gotten had we not made the first film. Thanks very much for your congratulations! Sloane 
[What makes you laugh?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oq8g6/hi_reddit_we_are_sloane_ant_neely_after_working/ccugqmr?context=5)|I actually really like my feet tickled - find it relaxing. When I was a kid my mum used to get me to tickle her feet and she would fall asleep, so I guess I got it from her.  Under my arms though - now that is ticklish.
[Are you ticklish?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oq8g6/hi_reddit_we_are_sloane_ant_neely_after_working/ccugqmr?context=5)|I laugh at a lot of things - I try to especially laugh at myself (try not to take things too seriously!).  Recently just been wetting myself laughing at Tim Minchin's work - he is brilliant!

[Sorry if that's really too personal.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oq8g6/hi_reddit_we_are_sloane_ant_neely_after_working/ccuhb4h?context=5)|When we told people we were selling our home to make a film, the initial response was a little wtf?  When we explained that it wasn't a financial decision, it was a 'life' decision, then the reaction changed completely.

[What is it like working with Christopher Nolan?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oq8g6/hi_reddit_we_are_sloane_ant_neely_after_working/ccui1h6?context=5)|When working on set, directors tend to have to be so focused on the job at hand that there frequently isn’t a lot of time to be social.  I was introduced to him on set once, on Batman Begins, but I didn’t really have a lot of interaction with him so I’m afraid I don’t have anytime fun and/or fascinating insights or stories!
 |That said, as a film-lover, he makes films that I love to watch and are really well made - The Prestige, Memento, Inception. Thanks, Sloane.
[Having a lot of experience in many different areas of film making which element of Writing/designing/filming a movie would you say is your favourite? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oq8g6/hi_reddit_we_are_sloane_ant_neely_after_working/ccuh42s?context=5)|I would have to say that directing is my favourite. I’ve only directed one feature so far, but I love both the creative and the technical/logistical elements of directing a film - working with the actors and my HoDs about how we want to make the story come to life, and working out my shots/shot lists, lens sizes/how capture a scene with my DoP...I just the love the team work and working off of one another to create a flushed-out film from the script.
 |I do still love working in art departments, too, though - in fact, I have still gotten work in them after completing Dimensions.  Every script and film is, of course, different and I feel fortunate to have worked on so many various projects over the years - drawing up parts of space ships (Lost in Space), Edwardian England (The Wind in the Willows), New York City shopfronts of the 1960s (Ali), part of an opera-theatre set (for a Six Feet Under episode) to name a few.  Each one is a new challenge and almost always fun!
[So the film is done? Any links to trailers?  Web site?  Is the look along the lines of Sky Captain?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oq8g6/hi_reddit_we_are_sloane_ant_neely_after_working/ccuhl9n?context=5)|Yes the film is done - we're currently in the US doing some cinema screenings.  Trailer here: [Link to youtu.be](http://youtu.be/93sxrEx-mpg)  It has some Dieselpunk / steampunk elements - but we had such a tiny budget we had to focus the spend on specific bits (so it isn't as grand a Sky Captain).  That said, we think it looks stunning (we had an amazing cast and crew).
[Why do you suppose the color correction trend in the last decade has leaned toward desaturation? Are there larger politcal/social influences on this?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oq8g6/hi_reddit_we_are_sloane_ant_neely_after_working/ccuk5g2?context=5)|It's interesting - my feeling is it is just a trend.  We went through the blue/green thing in the early 2000 - maybe a backlash to that?  I suppose you could argue it reflects the bleak nature of our times (economic difficulties etc.).  However, I am not convinced we see that in the actual story telling, and I would have thought a backlash would encompass all elements.
 |Sloane and our cinematographer (Simon Dennis [Link to www.imdb.com](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1171917/) used McCabe and Mrs Miller as a reference palette wise.  She then worked closely with costume, set dec and hair/make-up to unify the look.  We are both fans of a lot of 70s type films, so it was fun to use elements in that way.
[Hello!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oq8g6/hi_reddit_we_are_sloane_ant_neely_after_working/ccul6ye?context=5)|As the designer, it is great to offer up to the director options that s/he might not have thought.  You of course want to provide the set and the props that are mentioned by name in the script but just as important is to provide the rest of the world in which the characters and the story itself lives.  Since your job is create a world, be it contemporary, or perhaps and unusual take on the world we live in, the more you can layer (though that doesn’t necessarily mean clutter) a set, the more interesting it usually is, and also the more the actors have to work with, or many absorb, even if they don’t know it at the time. Things to think about are the colour palette, and foreground/mid-ground and background (giving a shot depth, etc.)  If you give the director/cinematographer something to pull focus on, say between something/someone mid-ground and something/someone in the foreground, if it aids the story or the character’s journey, you will have added something to the film that is that much more interesting, by perhaps linking two things together that might not have been apparent before.  So offer ideas up to them that might help enhance the whole world of the film. Also, if there are any particular items (furniture, hero props, etc.) that you would like but don’t think you can afford, go to charity shops/thrift stores and have a good look around for inexpensive items that would work perfectly for a character/in a scene. Hope that helps. Thanks, Sloane.
[My question is, what are some really simple things I can do as far as set design goes to make my short films just a tiny bit nicer? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oq8g6/hi_reddit_we_are_sloane_ant_neely_after_working/ccul6ye?context=5)| 
[Yeah I found the IMDB link, And sky captain as grand as it was was still mostly green screen.  My guess the bane of the art department.  Ill check it out.  Coming to Seattle with the show?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oq8g6/hi_reddit_we_are_sloane_ant_neely_after_working/ccuhutb?context=5)|Aaaahhh, green screens...  I do admit to being biased towards set builds as opposed to shooting entirely against a green screen.  I think green screens are helpful and useful when adding to a set build, whether it’s as a backdrop or something within the middle of the scene (i.e., augmenting a hero prop, or creating a particular character like Gollum). But from an art department point of view, it is not only more interesting for the most part for us to create a set build, but the actors usually appreciate it - gives them something to work off of - and allows you to be bit more flexible when it comes to the world that you create.
 |Having said all of that! - we just saw Gravity in 3D in the cinema and although there were interiors of spaceships/shuttles built and exterior parts of the spaceship, there had to be a fair bit of greenscreen.  And I thought the film was fabulous.  The performances were spot-on and the director (and his team, of course!) creating an amazing world in space.  Very captivating. Unfortunately, we’re not coming to Seattle, though I wish we were. thanks!, Sloane 
[The kind of camera you used has a very distinct look.  What kind of camera did you guys use? ...or maybe it's the color correction, I don't know.  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oq8g6/hi_reddit_we_are_sloane_ant_neely_after_working/cculgza?context=5)|The camera body we used was a Canon 5D Mk II.  And our director of photography - the extremely talented Simon Dennis - arranged for us to hire Zeiss prime lens (basically, fantastic “movie” lenses).  So, yes, it was a combination - between Simon’s cinematography that did look fabulous coming straight out of the camera, and Adam Garstone’s colour grading (Adam was the editor AND did colour grading), we got the glorious look we were going for - I like to think it looks beautiful and timeless!

[If you had $1000 art budget on a small film, what would your priorities be? Paint? Thrift stores? Wall paper?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oq8g6/hi_reddit_we_are_sloane_ant_neely_after_working/ccuqh2a?context=5)|Thrift stores are a very good place to start.  On our film Dimensions, the time machine was based on a lovely piano we bought from a charity (thrift) shop in Cambridge.  Then we spent some time and effort on changing it and turning it into a time machine!  You can find good hero/hand props from thrift stores, and other set dressing as well.
 |Presuming you’re shooting at a location, unless you really think the existing wall colour/wall coverings are awful(!) and really don’t work with the story, I would try to not paint or wallpaper - it will end up eating up more of the $1000 quicker than you think, and is time consuming.  I would use you time and money elsewhere.
 |If there is a particular style of set dressing or special prop that you want but can’t afford, you can try to find a cheaper version of it and change it/augment it, i.e., get some material you like to cheap-and-cheerfully reupholster a chair you love (but hate the current coverings of) to make the piece you like.
 |Remember to prioritise though - balancing what is required in the script but making sure that you layer and add to the overall world you are creating.
 |I have in the past borrowed items from friends on short films in the past...and though that did, thankfully!, work out well for me (no items were lost, damaged or stolen), it is a bit risky as you can’t guarantee that nothing will happen to these items and, ultimately, you are responsible and have the obligation to replace them should anything happen to them.

 |I think working with local filmmakers to do shorts etc, is a good way to meet others while honing your craft.  If you are not into writing scripts, you could always see if anyone on the r/screenwriting sub wants to adapt a short/novel - you might end up forging a working relationship that way.

If there are particular films/television shows that you like and/or think your pieces might suit, I would take down their name and try to find their contact details on line.  If a costume designer has worked on many different looking films/tv shows, they will have designed what would work for that story/that character, so of course that will be different from project to project.  But if you think your pieces are unique (and I’m sure they are(!) and that so-so-designer might be up for using interesting and unusual pieces, they try to contact them.
 |Some might have their own websites and you can contact them through there.  If they do not, if they are on something currently, you can try them through the production office (sometimes at a particular studio) of the project that they are on.  Or you can try them through their agent - though sometime through someone’s agent is quick, and sometimes, not so quick.
 |Don’t be put off if you don’t hear back - as I’m sure you know, people work incredibly long hours in the industry (and sometime barely have enough time, if that, for family and friends!...let alone people they haven’t met yet).  If you don’t hear back and really feel that your pieces would be something of interest to the person, email/ring them again (not too soon after the first time, give them a bit of time to get back to you, possibly) and be short/succinct about who you are and - most importantly - what you can do for them (i.e., provide something they haven’t seen before that they could work for them/their project...without sounding like you know more than them!!).
 |Also, and I’m sure already know this, so please forgive me but...always, always, address the person by name.  I can’t tell you how many c.v./resumes I’ve gotten addressed to Dear Designer (or some such), or even Dear Mr U’Ren (I am a women, and I’m sure that could have been googled).  It’s not that I’m easily offended but I think it can show a lack of attention to detail if your name is not used/spelled correctly/correct gender, etc.

It makes sense to make films available in whatever format the audience wants - at the same time.  Some people can't/don't want to go to the cinema, they want to stream or watch a DVD and we think you should be able to do that on the same day as cinema release.  There is a lot of distribution politics though - it's changing very rapidly and different outlets are trying to figure out how to exist with each other.

 |With regards to 'Dimensions', as I (Ant) wrote the script and Sloane directed it we had a rather unusual situation.  I tend to not discuss anything about a script, write it, then give it to Sloane - so she can evaluate with no pre-conceptions.  If she likes it, we move on to rewrites, if she just doesn't think the concept has legs, we drop it and start again.
 |As for other directors - it really depends.  Some of them are keen to work on every detail and have strong ideas, some want you to come up with ideas to present.  I would advise always to have ideas - let them lead a meeting and pitch in.  Plus, always have back-up ideas and not just one!

What are your thoughts? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oq8g6/hi_reddit_we_are_sloane_ant_neely_after_working/ccusjko?context=5)|That’s a tricky one!  My own opinion is that I’m not sure that I, personally, would like to come out of school 30k in debt - but that doesn’t mean that it isn’t worth it or that you shouldn’t do that...I’m afraid that you will definitely have to come to your own conclusion about that(!).  Still, good (and even not so good schools) are expensive.
 |I was impressed with the facilities at Colorado Film School.  They have an extensive amount of equipment for the students to use, post facilities that the students learn on; they edit their own shorts right after shooting them, etc., so there looks to be very good level of practical learning.  There is also theory and film studies, I believe.
 |I didn’t sit in on any of the classes, tutor sessions, etc., so I cannot comment first hand on them, but I was impressed with the knowledge, dedication and enthusiasm of all of the staff that I met there.  As well, they told me that their students make many short films a year - I believe they said 6, if I remember correctly. I think this is great because I believe you need to study (whether it is film school, or studying films themselves, filmmaking books, etc., if you don’t go to film school...and I did not go) AND you need to get out there and just make films.  You will do wonderful things and your will also make mistakes along the way, but you have to put yourself out there and create and learn.

All my research so far has been MM or post-HF development with a lot of random using DFT there, but I really love DFT and I'm mostly applying for grad schools with that in mind. Specifically, I have come to prefer the more condensed matter physics type DFT codes (TDDFT is awesome to me!).

Now I kind of want to attend my own graduation (which will take place in Scotland) because lol robes or something, and there are a couple of theory summer schools in Greater Western Europe that I want to go to, so I'd like to find some sort of paid employment for 4 months in Europe. I've got a job offer, but it's neither in Europe nor any sort of DFT.

Does anyone know about research groups that would match my ridiculously specific criteria and might have funding for this type of thing? 

Addendum: I think at this point I'd also be fine with exchange-correlation functional type stuff, but I gather there's a lot of competition and little funding there."

Here's what I'm currently doing:

* Looking for a research internship for next summer (my current plan is to ask around in my department, but if anyone has advice for finding research internships, let me know!)

* Going to research group seminars in my department. I'm usually the only undergrad there and half of it goes over my head... but it's interesting and gives me an idea of what kind of research is going on (the seminars are given by a mix of PhD students, postdocs, academics in the department, and academics from other universities). I'm hoping to build up to asking questions and talking to people in these seminars, but at the moment I'm still the shy undergrad sitting at the back just listening and looking :p

* For 1/4 of my year's modules, I chose to do a 'mathematical extended essay', which I'm doing on a topic in an area of CS close to the areas of research I'm most interested in. I have a supervisor for this. There is a small amount of original research that I'm going to try to do as part of this essay (just proving the correctness of a couple of algorithms, one of which has been around for a while, the other of which has been implemented fairly recently but not written about)

* I am trying to be better organised and work harder than in previous years to try to get a high degree classification

* Occasionally blogging about topics in mathematics/CS that I find interesting (I don't know how helpful this is, if at all... but maybe it demonstrates a real interest in the subjects? or something?)

On top of that, I'm working on a few programming side-projects, some of which I put on my website (the one with the blog on it) (since if I don't go into a PhD, I'll probably end up applying for software engineering jobs).

What am I getting right? What am I getting wrong? What can I start doing now that will benefit me in a year's time when it comes to apply for these PhDs? Any other advice?

I received a less than acceptable answer from Sen. Portman.  Below is my re-address to the Sen. (it's long, so I apologize for that in advance):

""Senator Portman,

Growing up I was always told that in this country, we can contact our elected representatives to voice our concerns on issues.  Earlier today (18 Oct 2013), I decided to exercise that right.  I attempted to contact you in regards to a situation involving the snuffing of journalism and freedom of speech, and the Presidents involvement in a situation with a journalist.

Instead of a reply from you, or even an aide of yours, I received a reply from you saying how glad you were that I was contacting you in regards to the government shutdown, below is the e-mail you sent me, verbatim:

“Dear George, 
  
Thank you for contacting me to express your views on  the bipartisan agreement to reopen the government and avert default.  I am grateful to have your input, and I appreciate the opportunity to address your concerns.   
After weeks of dysfunction in Washington, I was glad to see the partial government shutdown come to an end and Congress work together to ensure we did not default on our obligations. I was also pleased that my push for income verification to prevent fraud and abuse in the implementation of President Obama's healthcare law and minimize the negative impact on Ohio families was part of the final agreement.   
 
Although the government shutdown ended and default was avoided, moving from crisis to crisis creates an environment of uncertainty and is no way to bolster America's economy. Unfortunately, we do not have a long-term fix that will prevent another shutdown in January, which is why I will continue to fight for passage of my End Government Shutdowns Act. This bipartisan legislation would ensure that Americans do not have the threat of a government shutdown hanging over their heads and would provide more certainty for our economy and government agencies and the families across the nation who rely on them. More details on the End Government Shutdowns Act can be found  here.    

Now that Congress has temporarily avoided this crisis, I am hopeful that President Obama will stick to his promise and come to the table to negotiate on a path forward to deal with Washington's underlying problem of overpromising and overspending that brought our nation to this crisis in the first place.   

My colleagues and I are ready to negotiate on how to rein in Washington's out-of-control spending so that we not only prevent a future debt limit crisis in February, but also avoid passing along this debt crisis to our children and grandchildren.  Unless this borrowing is restrained, future generations will face a doubling of their tax rates as well as lower living standards and we have a moral responsibility not to endanger future generations with the consequences of such economic irresponsibility.  This is why I am  looking forward to being a part of the bicameral and bipartisan budget conference committee that was established to address our serious spending issues.    
Ohioans deserve more from Washington. A long-term plan to curb spending and put our nation onto a path toward fiscal responsibility would be a step in the right direction.  
  
Once again, thank you for taking the time to write. I am honored to represent you and the great state of Ohio in the United States Senate. For more information, please visit my website at www.portman.senate.gov, where you may also sign up for my newsletter. Please keep in touch. 

Sincerely, 
Rob Portman
U.S. Senator”

Now I don’t know about you, but your response addresses none of the concerns I contacted you about in the first place.  

Please please PLEASE respond back to me ACTUALLY TALKING about the issue I brought up to you earlier.  Remember, it is WE THE PEOPLE who got you into office in the first place and you are supposed to work for, and answer to US!

Respectully,
A very angry voter

PS In case you need another copy, below is the original message I sent you. 
 
ORIGINAL MESSAGE:

Senator Portman, 

I am contacting you in regards to a news article I came across this morning, and it is the first time I've heard about this.  Below is the link:

http://www.democraticunderground.com/10023300531

My question is, why is the President trying to silence journalism and freedom of speech?  Are those things not what we, as Americans, preach to those around the world, especially in repressive countries?  For being as freedom loving as he claims to be, this sure seems like the exact opposite of what he preaches.  

As a member in the U.S. Armed Services, this is one of the many great freedoms I risk my life to defend, and I find it absolutely repulsive that a man who is supposed to lead us, and be a shining example and an embodiment of us as a whole, would even entertain this idea, especially when this journalist was about to be pardoned.  He needs to be reminded that the job of a journalist is to be a watchdog against the horrible acts of a government, and should not be punished for doing their jobs, but instead praised. 
 
I urge you to contact the President, and to make this issue known and to right this wrong.  Thank you for your time.

Very Respectfully,
George DeNillo""

I feel this is unacceptable coming from an elected official.  Now don't get me wrong, I understand that chances are his secretary or intern or whatever actually sent me a canned response, but it is his name that is attached to the e-mail, so he must be held accountable.

I want this to go viral, we deserve a proper response from our elected officials when we contact them.  Thank you in advance to those who decide to help

I have two scenarios in mind, both involve you pretending to be something else, your secret is revealed, you are seduced into submission and then fucked silly.


1) You were always a tomboy, playing outside in mud with the other boys. Dolls, dresses, and pink never had any appeal for you. Your adolescent years were spent as one of the boys, you played and fought as well as any of them. 

Then puberty hit and you got tits, small firm ones to be sure but tits none the less. Baggy clothes, the occasional girlfriend, and a mean right hook kept you in the ""bro"" category. 

I'm college you drank, swore, and fucked girls like one of the guys. But sometimes when you were alone you would use a toy on yourself, never with any one though. 

After Graduation you made a fateful decision, Alex was a unisex enough name after all. You packed up everything and accepted a junior position in New York, as a man. Surgery and hormones was a option but you couldn't bring yourself to do it. You had the right hairstyle and clothes to pull it off, a small framed effeminate guy hardly stands out in NY.

You fooled them all, even some of the girls in the office are chasing you. Except your Boss, you can't shake the feeling that he knows. The way he looks at you penetrates your disguise and your cunt leaving you wet, even more so when your mind drifts to the time you walked in to his office to see him changing shirts. 6'2 Ripped and Tanned sporting a couple of days beard, and from the gossip around the office a long thick cock, attached to a man who enjoys the submission of others.

You should quit and get a job somewhere else, away from this man, you really should. But we both know you'll stay and play this most dangerous game.



2) Trap, that's what they call you on the internet. Your childhood was cliche but the results weren't. You always wanted Daddy's attention but he was never home, mommy always wanted a girl, and jenny from down the block might have made you play dress up too often. Whatever the cause your course was set early.

You always had girlfriends but at the time you suspected not like the other guys had. The boys locker room was a nightmare, puberty might have skipped a few steps leaving you almost hairless, high pitched, and only 4"" hard, you were an easy target, and the taunts of *boyclit* still haunt you.

Moving out west for college seemed like fate, you could start again. Alex became Lexxy, the makeup and fashion skills form your girlfriends came in handy, and who would notice a slightly taller than average girl out here? In 4 years no one ever called you on it, and more than one suitor chased after your ass.

An honors degree secured you a job in tech valley, and expensive implants made you the center of attention for every man in the room. You are the girl you always wanted to be, everything is perfect, except for your Boss, the owner and CEO of the company and a former Marine Captain back after 2 tours in Afghanistan.

You first meeting with him was walking in on him fucking one on the interns. Watching his thick cock slide in and out of her ass and her whimpers of pleasure filled you with lust, fear, and jealousy. The little slut didn't last long, neither did the next one.

Now it's become a game between you, when you manage to catch him he just looks at you, daring you to take the place of whichever girl he's fucking. Daring you to fall to your knees and worship his cock, just the thought makes you shiver, and let's not get started on what thinking about his cock sliding into ass does to you. 

Tonight is a company event, and you've seen the way he looks at the new girl. Tall, blonde, nice tits and a tight little ass. The little tramp looks too much like you to be coincidence, she even bought a cheap knock off of the dress you were planning to wear. If you're not careful he'll be balls deep in her before the night is half over.


Let me know which scenario you prefer."

Note: I've had a few internships, but I haven't had a ""real"" job using my degree. My internships were with Chambers of Commerce and one general contractor.

They're neat people and good at what they do, but their methods are in many ways very oldschool. While the hardcore focus on prospecting and leaflets (they deliver them themselves - or did, until I showed up!) is very effective, it's my assigned task to give their day-to-day operations a tune-up.

Since they're currently storing all their contact info in a spectacularly complicated spreadsheet, I figure step one is to find a CRM. (Step two is for me to spend many hours doing data entry. I don't like step two.)

After much research (and binning eEdge/Market Leader, even though they're obliged to pay for it regardless), I came up with the following candidates:

Top Producer: Old-school. Everyone hates it. A lot. Not cheap.  

Salesforce: The Audi RS6 Avant of solutions: Does everything brilliantly all the time, will cost you your house.   

SugarCRM: This looks a lot like Unix: Very clunky, infinitely customizable. Unless tasks can be automated VERY heavily, but is it worth it?

Zoho: Plan B. Well regarded, not too expensive.

And finally:

Insightly: Cheap, simple, and integrated with Gmail, which my employers absolutely love. It could be improved in a lot of ways - you have to use filters to generate your own e-mail lists and manually enter them into ConstantContact, and there's no automation, and Google integration could be much better - but it's effortless to use and fills the primary role of ensuring my employers contact people they met at open houses. 

So, market professionals, am I herping my derp? "

Chapter One

                                        Monday's Suck

    It was the beginning of a cold, dreary Monday, and some idiot decided to resurrect me. With stale creaking limbs I clawed my way to the surface. Above me I saw the dark silhouette of a man, black against the pale light of the moon.
   
    ""Alright wise guy, was it you who got the bright idea to resurrect me?"" I said, one graying hand still on the casket.
   
    ""Um..yes?"" The bald man who resembled the fat statue of Buddha said in a squeaky voice, wringing his hands as if already regretting this decision.

    ""Are you asking me or telling me?"" I snapped back at him.

    ""T..telling?"" He stammered uncertainly.

    With an exasperated sigh I lay back down and demanded, ""Alright kid, kill me and bring me back again some other time, sometime more cheerful. Is July still nice? Then reawaken me in July, but not now.""
With an irritated glance at the foggy, damp, groggy morning, I lay back down in the casket and turned the one eye I still had to him expectantly.

    Looking like Christmas had been canceled, the bald little man exclaimed, ""N..no! You're supposed to do my bidding! That's why I resurrected you!""

    With a sigh I sat back up and, pointing with one decaying finger at my arm, from which the strong smell of rotting meat came from, and said, ""Well, if I'm going to be living again, could you do something about this?  It really draws away from my eye.""

    ""W...well You see,"" he stuttered. ""My spell didn't bring you back to life, it made you a... well, it made you a zombie.""

    ""Great."" I sighed as I climbed out of the casket. Dragging one foot behind me I began to trudge toward the road.

    ""Wait! Where are you going?"" Cried the man with a voice that all too much spoke of complete disappointment.

    ""Look,"" I said, patting him friend-like on the back, immediately regretting it as a finger fell off. ""If I'm able to walk and talk again, I may as well visit some friends. After all, who know how the world may have changed in the past fifteen years?""

    ""B..but,"" he began, practically begging now. ""You're supposed to do what I ask!""

    ""Look buddy, you seem like a perfectly nice, albeit creepy, guy. But I'm going home. Or at least, to what used to be my home... Man I'll bet it's changed. I wonder if they ever fixed that old creaky gate...  Anyway though, maybe some other time, but for now goodbye."" I said turning to head to the road again. When I hear a dry sob behind me, irritated, I turn on the spot, and say, ""Hey, cheer up. Maybe you can resurrect yourself a nice zombie girlfriend. This one, the one I'm pointing at, she used to be a real looker back in the day.""

    With that I began on my old route home for the first time in fifteen years.

                                      Chapter 2

                          Death can't get rid of scars.

    Unbelievable, I thought to myself, after fifteen years of death the place still aches. Remembering that eventful day, I stuck out my remaining thumb in the hope of hitch hiking, and thought back.

    The year was 1998, and, just like today, it was a cold, wet, foggy Monday. And, just like every other Monday, I was driving to work. I should have known, then and there, to turn around, for the day was not going to be a good one. On my way in, I hit a bird. Not just a sparrow or Blue Jay, but a hawk. A full grown, red-tail, idiotic hawk. And unlike those smaller ones, the hawk did some substantial damage to both itself and my car. So I spent half the morning cleaning bird feathers and blood out of the grill on my Mustang, time which should have been spent on the hour-long drive to work. 

    After what I'm going to call, ""The Bird Incident"" from now and on, I was already half an hour late. But I decided to go anyway, for I loved my job. My job, in fact, was part of the reason I died. But we'll get there later. Anyway, after The Bird Incident the morning was fairly uneventful, aside from the daily near-side-swipe incident, that is, which in itself is normal.

    I arrived at work, tired and disgruntled already, half an hour late, to the usual morning greetings and the occasional, ""Jeez man, had a rough morning?"" 

    If the bird hadn't convinced me to go home, the Laser Event should have. Before I get to that, however, I need to explain my job. I work, or at least, I did work, at a private university. Not teaching, haven't got the patience, but in the physics department. In my job, I used lasers on a daily basis, since much of my job required it. Today, however, I should have been nowhere near the laser laboratory, as I was currently trying, like so many others around the world, to prove String Theory. Most of you are probably wondering what String Theory is. Well Goodle it. Is that what they call it nowadays? Google? Anyway though, like I said I was working in the theoretical physics department on that day and shouldn't have been anywhere near that lab. However, an associate of mine assured me what he had to show me was worth seeing. As it turns out, he wanted to show  me he could heat up Ramen Noodles with the laser, something I'd been doing for years. Long story short, that intern was released that very day. After I ordered him out, I fiddled around with the laser, like I liked to do if work was slow. That, as it turns out, was a mistake.

    The second I turn on the laser I realised three things. First, the energy beam was on high, a rookie mistake, seeing as nothing but the most important of experiments require that much power. Also, that the intern had, for reasons unknown, placed a mirror just so the laser reflected it back exactly at the laser reactor. Finally, I realised that I had about five seconds to get out fast before that lab, and all the high powered reactors and lasers alike, went up in a fiery inferno. With a shout I dived for the door and had already dialed the ""9"" for ""911"" on the employee wall-phone before it happened. An explosion so powerful we got calls from five stories down that the geology department could feel the effects. And glass, so much glass. Test tubes, breakers, windows. Gone, vaporized, shattered. Five people were sent to the hospital, each only minor in their injuries. I, having dealt with explosions before, knew what to do to shield myself from damage, and was therefore not hurt, however, if that was not a sign to go home, I don't know what was.

    But I stayed, and that was my mistake. If I had left, he never could have snuck in during the commotion. He never could have gotten past security. And more than likely I would still be alive. He was nothing but a nuisance to me, John Oliver was. But to him, I was a rival. Oliver too was a physicist. But unlike me, he had never made even the remotest contributions to his field, while I had developed several theories and even a few laws. Recently, I had discovered something new in an atom, revolutionary it was. He knew it, yet did not know what I had discovered, though I can assure you it would have shunted all his work to the side. So, to him, it seemed he had no choice, he had to kill me and steal my proof. Unbeknownst to him, however, I hadn't yet written it down. Nevertheless, he still snuck in the lab, got in my office, no doubt through that uncanny lock-picking ability of his, and waited. When I walked through the door and closed it, I flipped on the lights, and there he was. Thin, pale, and short, especially to me. I never had time to scream as the thin silver blade was shoved roughly between my ribs. I dropped to the floor, croaked a little, bled a lot, and finally after what seemed like hours, a colleague entered and saw me there, dying. He was a large man, so he easily overpowered Oliver, but he was too late for me. The last thing I saw was his face, the face of a friend, staring helplessly at me, as he knelt to attempt CPR. 

    The slowing of an engine brought me back out of my stupor as an old pickup stopped on the shoulder of the road next to me. Gently lowering my still held out arm, I slowly dragged my mangled ankle into the truck, and saying many thanks to the driver, we drove off."

1ov3do,3,2013-10-20,"In college, but ultimately alone",[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1ov3do/in_college_but_ultimately_alone/,"I'm almost two months into my sophomore year of college, and I was coming off of a pretty shitty summer break. I wasn't able to get a job or an internship, so I spent the entirety of my summer just staying at home, working out and IMing my gf who was in another country for the summer. So I was pretty depressed throughout summer, but at least I knew in a couple months I would be back with my friends and girlfriend and I would be doing something productive.

My classes aren't really demanding a lot of time or energy, and I only have classes either very early in the morning or at night. So I'm always in class when my friends aren't and only really hang out with my roommates.
Aside from that within a week of being back with my girlfriend, she had been acting very distant and was not making much time for us to see each. She had a really busy schedule so it was understandable that we couldnt see each other all the time. However, after enough time of her being kinda bitchy to me, she apologized but broke up with me because she realized that she couldnt be in a relationship. Now I've spent the past month constantly thinking about her and how we had a really good thing going, but it was never given a chance to get off the ground.

So now I'm constantly alone, even on the weekends my roommates spend a lot of time doing things with their frats. I havent been able to make friends in any of my classes and I can't join any clubs or anything because of my night classes. I'm pretty shy, but once I start talking to people I can be charming and interesting, its just that I'm not meeting anybody that I would really care about getting to know. I tried going to parties but its ridiculously hard to get into them as a guy without any connections and I'm not really into that scene anyway.

I can't think of anything to do, and I constantly either feel lonely, bored or angry, and now my emotions are starting to affect my academics which is really the only thing I have going for me."

I'm a twenty year old college student at a very popular university located in a major city. I'm 6'1, a very active/gym bro,healthy and I'd consider myself decent looking. I dress well and I take care of myself.

My issue: In high school I had two relationships (both over one year) and in college I dated two girls long term. After a trust-fallout with the previous girlfriend (she lied directly to my face about something very important). I am single now for the first time (for longer than a month) in many years

I have no idea how to get back into the game. I always would transition into another relationship shortly after getting out of one. I'm scared, nervous and anxious. I do very well in school, have a high-paying internship and I have a lot to offer as an individual (trying not to sound conceded).

I feel as if I've lost ""my game"". I'm unsure if ""my game"" is my self-esteem but whatever it is I don't know how to approach/advance with women anymore. I'm a college student for goodness sakes, but I'm a very emotional guy. I've only had sex with two women (both of which I was in a long term relationship with). I end up in the friend zone too easily. I'm considered just the nice guy now and I don't know how to take it further then that.

If anyone could please offer me some encouraging words or advice in reference to getting back out there and staying single for longer than a month I'd greatly appreciate it.

I'm a twenty year old college student at a very popular university located in a city. I'm 6'1, a very active/gym bro and I'd consider myself decent looking. I dress very well and I take care of myself.

My issue: In high school I had two relationships (both over one year) and in college I dated two girls long term. After a trust-fallout with the previous girlfriend (she lied directly to my face about something very important). I am single for the first time (for longer than a month) in many years

I have no idea how to get back into the game. I always would transition into another relationship shortly after getting out of one. I'm scared, nervous and anxious. I do very well in school, have a high-paying internship and I have a lot to offer as an individual (trying not to sound conceded).

I feel as if I've lost ""my game"". I'm unsure if ""my game"" is my self-esteem but whatever it is I don't know how to approach/advance with women anymore. I'm a college student for goodness sakes, but I'm a very emotional guy. I've only had sex with two women (both of which I was in a long term relationship with). I end up in the friend zone too easily. I'm considered just the nice guy now and I don't know how to take it further then that.

If anyone could please offer me some encouraging words or advice in reference to getting back out there and staying single for longer than a month I'd greatly appreciate it.

Thank you in advance.

1ouzxw,7,2013-10-20,Full-time or internship?,nordicBear,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1ouzxw/fulltime_or_internship/,"Hey, I'm a 3rd year CS major hopefully graduating in December of 2014, but could possibly graduate Spring 2015, depending on an issue with a class. What I'm here to ask is whether I should take a full-time job or an internship this next summer.

I had an internship with a small firm, only 3 employees, last summer. They focus on developing financial and tax software for county governments in the state I live. Last summer, as an intern, I made a small macro in Excel using VBA which connected to and pulled info from a database and pushed it into a spreadsheet to be used as a deposit slip for county treasurers. I also redid their website, as it hadn't been updated since 1996. It was an okay place to work, but one of the guys I worked with was incredibly annoying and his code was terrible. Anyway, I was offered a full time job this next summer and post graduation. Also, I'd be doing something more meaningful this next summer, considering the move up to full-time employee.

I've also been applying for internships elsewhere and wonder what would be better on the resume, etc. I don't know exactly how much the full-time job would pay me as I haven't had the chance to talk to my employer yet, but the internships are around $20/hr it seems like. Has anyone got any advice? Thanks."
1oux1u,5,2013-10-20,How to make up for lost time and position myself for great success? Career/life advice needed.,[deleted],Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1oux1u/how_to_make_up_for_lost_time_and_position_myself/,"Hey Reddit. I'd very much appreciate it if you could spare a minute to help me think through my career and future. I'm asking for one part career advice and one part financial advice. My goal is to craft the most resilient life possible at an upper-middle-class standard of living. 

Here's my story/your frame of reference. I'm 22, graduated in 2012 with a philosophy degree from a large, public university in Minnesota (the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities). Philosophy...to retail with me, right? Well, I thought I'd be somewhat employable, as I have a good GPA (3.77), little debt (around 4k), a bunch of in-school leadership activities and about 2.5 years of work/volunteer experience relating to nonprofit work. For example, I spent the last year conducting applied research as an AmeriCorps VISTA. I had originally intended to study law with the philosophy degree, which shifted to public policy, which shifted to communications/development/advocacy work for nonprofits. Basically looking to use persuasive writing skills to shape public discourse relating to social issues. I'm currently unemployed (since September), back living with the parents, but doing an unpaid internship and actively searching for work. For example, I've applied for jobs as: 

*A research assistant/associate with a nonprofit
*A communications assistant with a nonprofit
*A technical writer with a software company
*An editor with a business group

...and all sorts of writing-related occupations, but so far no luck. My skills mainly lie in research (literature reviews, prospect research), writing (descriptive, technical, persuasive) and marketing/communications. I'm a great simplifier of messages for audiences, a synthesizer of information and trends, that sort of thing. 

However, since I've been back, out of the workforce and out of the college-bubble, I've taken the opportunity to survey the economic and employment landscape through internet research. Most of what I've read points to a worsening or stagnant American economy and a separation of domestic jobs into high-competition, high-skill, high-reward professions and low-skill, low-reward, generally shitty service jobs, with increasing unemployment. Therefore, my concerns have become much more practical, and center almost entirely around figuring out how to get and maintain higher-paying jobs than those that I've been looking at. My main concern is job security or resilience to drastically changing market conditions. I really think that the job market of 2050 is going to look drastically different from that of today (much more automation, possible depression, for instance). 

I see three ways to go about positioning myself to have a highly successful, resilient career: First, continue on the path that I'm on and eventually work my way into a foundation as a program officer. If the economy improves, more people will be looking to donate money through foundations and if the economy tanks, more people will need charitable donations from said foundations. I see this as the most natural progression, and a compromise between ambition/idealism and practicality.

Second, go back to philosophy, get my PhD, and get tenure somewhere. This path would allow me probably the greatest joy, but given the job market (pretty bad) and the changing conditions (rapid) in academia, this seems like the most risky route.

Finally, retraining. Change my skillset to center around a different field, namely programming/web development. This would be the most economically/practically wise, I think, as the market for web development and web design seems positioned to grow rapidly. It's also soooomewhat similar to the sorts of things I've been doing, as it requires design/communications/logical ability, but the downside is that I know really nothing about computers besides the basics.

So, given these options, which do you think would be best for me to pursue? Are there other options that you think would be a wise choice that I haven't even considered yet? Have I just completely wasted my time in college and work in terms of employability? Is my analysis of the future way off the mark, and will abundant middle-class jobs return? I appreciate any and all advice. Thanks!

I wasn't able to get a job or an internship, so I spent the entirety of my summer just staying at home, working out and IMing my gf who was in another country for the summer. So I was pretty depressed throughout summer, but at least I knew in a couple months I would be back with my friends and girlfriend and I would be doing something productive.

My classes aren't really demanding a lot of time or energy, and I only have classes either very early in the morning or at night. So I'm always in class when my friends aren't and only really hang out with my roommates.

Aside from that within a week of being back with my girlfriend, she had been acting very distant and was not making much time for us to see each. She had a really busy schedule so it was understandable that we couldnt see each other all the time. However, after enough time of her being kinda bitchy to me, she apologized but broke up with me because she realized that she couldnt be in a relationship. Now I've spent the past month constantly thinking about her and how we had a really good thing going, but it was never given a chance to get off the ground.

So now I'm constantly alone, even on the weekends my roommates spend a lot of time doing things with their frats. I havent been able to make friends in any of my classes and I can't join any clubs or anything because of my night classes. I'm pretty shy, but once I start talking to people I can be charming and interesting, its just that I'm not meeting anybody that I would really care about getting to know. I tried going to parties but its ridiculously hard to get into them as a guy without any connections and I'm not really into that scene anyway.

I can't think of anything to do, and I constantly either feel lonely, bored or angry, and now my emotions are starting to affect my academics which is really the only thing I have going for me."
1oulsm,3,2013-10-20,Me [22 M] trying to work out some issues related to my perpetual singleness and whether I really want to change that or not. Also some venting. It's long and not that interesting.,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1oulsm/me_22_m_trying_to_work_out_some_issues_related_to/,"Okay, first of all, this is an edited crosspost from /r/foreveralone. I thought I'd post something here in the hopes of gettign advice from a more knowledgable audience. I'm using a throwaway because some of this stuff is a bit personal, and my regular account can be linked to my identity if you do enough research. This way, it's just between me and the NSA.

I'm bassically just trying to figure out a number of issues related to relationships, especially concerning my lack of them and attempting to determine if I really desire one, and what one I'd want might actually be like.

Some background: I'm in my early twenties, currently working a paid internship as a programmer. I'm done with my undergrad, looking at going back for a masters. I'm theoretically pansexual, but in practice the vast majority of people I'm attracted to end up being women. I think I'm maybe towards the upper end of the lower 30% by appearence, but one person has told me I'm closer to average, and that I just have dificulty imagining anyone else might find me physically attractive.

I'm pretty much completely inexperienced sexually and romanticly. The summer after highschool, I finally figuered out a friend was really in to me and decided to give a relationship a try. I didn't really have any feelings for her beyond enjoying her company and finding her a little attractive, but I figuered I might as well try it out and see if it worked out. It lasted about a month before we sort of drifted apart as I got closer to going to college. It never got farther than a little kissing and sort of makeing out. I never got less awkward at it. She had to walk me through bassically everything or I'd just stand there awkwardly not knowing what to do. It was kind of enjoyable at times, but looking back at it I feel like it was a mostly negative experience for me.

Fast forward a couple years. I was living at an occupy encampment for a while, and I ended up with a pretty serious crush on a girl who was sort of on the periphery of the local occupy. She was really nice and friendly, and she turned out to be the sort of person who is very physically affectionate with all of her friends but doesn't really mean anythign by it. Anyway, there were a few nights where we ended up cuddleing mostly to keep warm, or with the excuse that we were trying to keep warm. It was really nice. I sort of lost touch with her after the encampment broke up, but after that I've craved the chance to cuddle with someone again. I mostly try to deal with that with a body pillow. It works pretty well for the most part. Later on, I ended up going to the same conference as her and hangeing out. By that point, I was bassically over my crush on her, but I still let her know that I had had feelings for her at one point. She told me that she didn't recipricate, but it didn't get awkward at all and things bassically immediately went back to the way things were. She's been pretty friendly the handful of times I've seen her after that.

Fast forward another year or two. I met a girl who eventually became a pretty good frined for a while. She decided to pretty much take me on as a project, and offered to teach me about all things sexual. I never took her up on much of that because it just didn't really seem appealing for whatever reason. I found her reasonably attractive, but I guess I was mostly content with dealing with my sexual needs through copious masturbation. The farthest any of that ever got was a little kissing when she was a bit drunk at a party and a few times I saw her in a state of partial or (once) total undress when I was crashing at her place for a while between more permanent housing. We've sort of drifted apart recently because of somethign unrelated.

That brings you more or less up to date on my background. At the moment, I live with two roomates, both of whom are very good friends. One is a late twenties conventional FA type, minus the fact that he has plenty of female friends who he mostly sees as just friends. The other is in her mid to late twenties and seems to be pretty successful romanticly, with a mixture of fairly frequent hookups and some dateing in the past.

I have a few good friends and several circles of people I am sort of friends with. Aside from my roomates and schedualed events with the local hackerspace or the radical political organization I'm part of, I don't do much of anything that isn't solitary. I'm not always sure how fine with that I am. Usually, I don't have any desire to be more social, but sometimes I go through lonely phases where I want to spend more time with people but don't.

I'm going through one of those lonely phases right now. At the moment, I'd kind of like more friends and maybe even a relationship of some sort. The problem is, these aren't things I want to want. I ought to be content with my current situation. I have a good life overall. I have some good friends, I can more or less satisfy my typical social needs just by going through my day to day routine, masturbation is pretty much completely sufficient for dealing with my sexual needs and hugging my body pillow more or less addresses my unfortuante desire for human contact. For some reason, though, I go through these phases where I'm not really satisfied with all that.

I can't even really figure out what a relationship I'd enjoy would even look like. I value my free time too much to want a time commitment much beyond a few hours a week, and even that might become a problem. I have little or no interest in sex with another person and have no interest in all the steriotypical dateing stuff. I'm not sure what exactly it is that I find myself wanting. Maybe just a good friend, plus a bit more of an emotional connection and some occasional cuddleing? I have no idea. I suppose I could be okay with some sex if they wanted, but it just seems like it would be a lot less convenient and more awkward than masturbation, and I'm kind of worried that I'd end up liking it too much and would be worse off when I was next single.

In some ways, I'm pretty flexable about potential partners, but in other ways I'm not at all. I don't care very much about appearence, for one thing. Fairly consistenly, I start to find people moderately attractive right around where other people would normally put 3 on the typical bullshit 1 to 10 scale. From maybe 5 to 8 I actually have difficulty judgeing how attractive most people are likely to find them. Even if someone isn't at all atractive to me, I don't think that would be a problem, especially since I'm already fulfilling my sexual needs by myself. During one past lonely phase, I actually tried to condition myself to lower my standards by fapping to steadilly less attractive people. I think it mostly worked. I now find I have much weaker prefferences about things like weight, gender and overall appearence, though I've been unable to overcome some hangups about age and would probably have dificulty dealing with someone more than perhaps 15 or 20 years older than me. On the other hand, I don't think I could ever have a relationship with someone who wasn't of above average inteilligence, with enough similar interests that we'd have things to talk about, a genuine desire to make the world a better place, a more or less rationalist worldview and political viewpoints bassically compatible with mine. Pretty much a slightly stricter version of the requirements I hold potential friends to. If I can't get along with them, I don't really see the point.

Unlike a lot of more typical FAs, I can work around most of my social awkwardness and I don't really care enough about what others think of me to get much social anxiety. I can usually talk to people reasonably well once I get going, though I'm sometimes a bit strange in the way I go about it. I have no dificulty in particular talking with people I'm attracted to. I don't really have a firm grasp of how to turn a friendly aquaintence into a friend, but I seem to manage despite myself. I have no understanding whatsoever of how to flirt, or for that matter how to let someone know I am interested in a relationship with them beyond litterally just telling them that bluntly. Fortunately, I've only ever had that one serious crush and a handful of much weaker ones, so I haven't had much occassion for practice.

This whole thing just feels kind of rediculous and pathetic. It's like every so often some primative somethign or other evolution put in my brain millions of years ago tries to convince me I want something that I shouldn't actually want and have no idea how to get. I'd really like to make it stop. I've done a little research, but haven't found evidence on the internet of a way to turn off that need through some sort of medication or by down-regulating some region of the brain with TDCS or somtheing. For that matter, I suppose I'd kind of like to get rid of my sex drive too so I could save the time I spend on masturbation. I'd also be open to trying to address my occaional desire for a relationship (or whatever it actually is) by giving it what it wants, if I could figure out how to do that, especially in a way that would work for me. I don't really see that happening, though.

What does everyone think? What should I do?

1oukdu,1,2013-10-20,"Help me help a friend. 9 months ago, he [21 M] and his gf of 1 year ended things on a bad note, he's still not comfortable being in large group social situations with her and our mutual friends.",HelpingAFriend321,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1oukdu/help_me_help_a_friend_9_months_ago_he_21_m_and/,"Two of my friends dated for about a year, but things ended on bad terms. I am much closer friends with the guy (I'll call him Nick) than I am with the girl (I'll call her Rachel), so I'm looking for advice to give to him.

We are all in college together, and we have many mutual friends that enjoy large group social situations (going out to dinner, throwing parties, going camping, etc). I say ""large"" because there are usually at least 15 people involved when we do something together. None of us really drink much alcohol, in case that means anything for your advice.

Rachel is intelligent and kind, but she is very awkward person. It's actually a group joke (that she's well aware of) that she's just ridiculously awkward, but that's perfectly fine. We're all nerds. Nick is a pretty cool guy; he's athletic, intelligent, and very sweet and caring.

They ended things on pretty bad terms. Basically, it was mutual and their life goals just weren't going to ever be similar, so they called it off, but things just weren't happy or even okay, they were both pretty down about it. Not angry, just sad/upset.

Things were awkward at first, since Nick and Rachel shared so many mutual friends (and because Rachel is so awkward anyway), but eventually our big group events seemed to be back to normal. What we didn't notice was that Nick wouldn't show up to an event if Rachel was going. His excuses always seemed valid, so we didn't put two and two together.

Before we could realize this, summer break happened. Everybody went back home or out of town to an internship. No more big dinners or parties happened until everyone returned in the fall. 

This fall, we've all gotten back together to celebrate birthdays, holidays, etc. on several occasions. I planned a group camping trip. Nick told me not to mention this to the others, but that he wouldn't be going if Rachel was going. That's when it hit me - Nick was avoiding events that involved Rachel. This has happened a few other times in the past two months. Nick gets excited about an upcoming event, but then backs out of going once Rachel decides to join us. 

If for some reason Rachel shows up and Nick is already there, he gets very quiet and shys away from any conversations or interactions with Rachel.

Every year, one of my friends and I throw a big Halloween party at our apartment. This year, as we suspected, Nick told us he wasn't going after he found out that Rachel had told us she was going.

I want to talk to Nick about this - it's been a really long time since they broke up, and our group just isn't the same without him. He's being the awkward one, which is kind of comical since Rachel is inherently way more awkward than he is, but she's fine with being places with him and all of us. 

I want to let him know that I understand his reluctance to hang out with Rachel, but that skipping these events isn't helping him get over it. It would be very easy for him to hang out with us and never have to say a word to her, since there are usually so many of us. I don't want him to feel like he has to miss out on things to avoid an awkward ""hello"" or some other interaction with Rachel. 

Rachel is graduating this December and starting a 2-year-long job rotation in Europe. Once she's gone, this won't be an issue anymore... but it's an issue right now.

I think he'd be fine with things if he started dating someone else, but that hasn't happened. He's not necessarily avoiding meeting new people, but we're pretty busy with school in general and we're graduating soon, so it's hard.

I just don't know how to start a conversation like that. Any ideas? 

**tl;dr**: Friend and his girlfriend ended things on bad terms a long time ago, he's still not comfortable attending large parties/group events if she'll be there."

I value my free time too much to want a time commitment much beyond a few hours a week, and even that might become a problem. I have little or no interest in sex with another person and have no interest in all the steriotypical dateing stuff. I'm not sure what exactly it is that I find myself wanting. Maybe just a good friend, plus a bit more of an emotional connection and some occasional cuddleing? I have no idea. I suppose I could be okay with some sex if they wanted, but it just seems like it would be a lot less convenient and more awkward than masturbation, and I'm kind of worried that I'd end up liking it too much and would be worse off when I was next single.

In some ways, I'm pretty flexable about potential partners, but in other ways I'm not at all. I don't care very much about appearence, for one thing. Fairly consistenly, I start to find people moderately attractive right around where other people would normally put 3 on the typical bullshit 1 to 10 scale. From maybe 5 to 8 I actually have difficulty judgeing how attractive most people are likely to find them. Even if someone isn't at all atractive to me, I don't think that would be a problem, especially since I'm already fulfilling my sexual needs by myself. During one past lonely phase, I actually tried to condition myself to lower my standards by fapping to steadilly less attractive people. I think it mostly worked. I now find I  have much weaker prefferences about things like weight, gender and overall appearence, though I've been unable to overcome some hangups about age and would probably have dificulty dealing with someone more than perhaps 15 or 20 years older than me. On the other hand, I don't think I could ever have a relationship with someone who wasn't of above average inteilligence, with enough similar interests that we'd have things to talk about, a genuine desire to make the world a better place, a more or less rationalist worldview and political viewpoints bassically compatible with mine. Pretty much a slightly stricter version of the requirements I hold potential friends to. If I can't get along with them, I don't really see the point.

Unlike a lot of more typical FAs, I can work around most of my social awkwardness and I don't really care enough about what others think of me to get much social anxiety. I can usually talk to people reasonably well once I get going, though I'm sometimes a bit strange in the way I go about it. I have no dificulty in particular talking with people I'm attracted to. I don't really have a firm grasp of how to turn a friendly aquaintence into a friend, but I seem to manage despite myself. I have no understanding whatsoever of how to flirt, or for that matter how to let someone know I am interested in a relationship with them beyond litterally just telling them that bluntly. Fortunately, I've only ever had that one serious crush and a handful of much weaker ones, so I haven't had much occassion for practice.

This whole thing just feels kind of rediculous and pathetic. It's like every so often some primative somethign or other evolution put in my brain millions of years ago tries to convince me I want something that I shouldn't actually want and have no idea how to get. I'd really like to make it stop. I've done a little research, but haven't found evidence on the internet of a way to turn off that need through some sort of medication or by down-regulating some region of the brain with TDCS or somtheing. If any of you has found somethign that works, please let me know. For that matter, I suppose I'd kind of like to get rid of my sex drive too so I could save the time I spend on masturbation. I'd also be open to trying to address it by giving it what it wants, if I could figure out how to do that, especially in a way that would work for me. I don't really see that happening, though.

What does everyone think? What should I do?"

While waiting, I met a very nice young man, and we got to talking. We shared a bit of information about our respective backgrounds, what we were doing in the city, etc.- it was very enjoyable! Unfortunately I made the mistake of forgetting to ask his name. So, /r/brussels, in the hopes that one of you might recognize this guy and I can talk to him again, here is what I know about him (without being too specific, I don't want to be THAT weird):

* He's originally from Paris, but recently got his Master's degree from a university in Berlin
* He has a patch of white hair on the back of his head
* He's doing an internship at the European commission

Anyone have any idea? Mystery man, if you are reading this and you think it's really creepy, I apologize. I thought that you were cool and I would love to talk to you more!

1oua5k,0,2013-10-20,Processing Operation: A microcosm of how Gaijin Continues to Mismanage Game Development,TomCollins7,Warthunder,https://www.reddit.com/r/Warthunder/comments/1oua5k/processing_operation_a_microcosm_of_how_gaijin/,"Sunday morning for Americans, Sunday night for European players, 55,000 online. Everyone is having a good time. And suddenly, we're not. We're unable to connect to queue. We're unable to get out of queue. So we disconnect from the game and reconnect. Now we can't even get back into the game! 

After waiting for 30 minutes, we're finally back in the game, but now we're not connected to chat, and we're being kicked out of the queue. 

And Gaijin has recently stated it wants to add 5,000 planes to the game? That it's going to have multiplatform gaming--computer players with PS4 players? We are less than a month from the launch of the PS4 and Gaijin is living in a dreamworld. 

After what happened today, can there be any doubts as to the seriousness of the problem of how this game is being developed? It seems woefully under-funded--both in terms of in game development, aka introducing proper flight models, public relations with the community base--aka Soon.TM, and with the infrastructure of the servers--aka what happened today.

And Gaijin's attitude is so blaise about all of these issues. They don't see any problem with it.  It doesn't seem to matter to them that FMs take so much time to develop-aka ""Arado is over-performing,"" ""Dora will be fixed in one week,"" ""Sabre F model largely finished,"" or that their servers continually crash, but it does matter to the player base and it will matter to the wave of new players that will come aboard with the PS4 launch. 

People who read this and say: ""But the game is still fun."" Yep. It's awesome, I love it, i'm addicted to it. But the problem here is the opportunity cost: Imagine how much better it could be if the devs took these issues seriously, if they hired the proper amount of people to work on the mechanics of the game and of the server. 

People may also read this and say: You and your crazy conspiracy theories, how can you possibly back up any of the assertions you make in the post? And that's largely correct, but here's the problem: Gaijin could alleviate all of this. They could silence curmudgeons like me from constantly complaining by showing their work. How hard is it to update the stats on the hangar interface? That's something an intern can do in a month. And yet it hasn't been done. And I believe it's because the arrogance of Gaijin has left this game underfunded and poorly developed. "

A pair of siblings from London (Ray Milland and Ruth Hussey) purchase a surprisingly affordable, lonely cliff-top house in Cornwall, only to discover that it actually carries a ghostly price—and soon they’re caught up in a bizarre romantic triangle from beyond the grave. Rich in atmosphere, The Uninvited, directed by Lewis Allen, was groundbreaking for the seriousness with which it treated the haunted-house genre, and it remains an elegant and eerie experience, featuring a classic score by Victor Young. A tragic family past, a mysteriously locked room, cold chills, bumps in the night—this gothic Hollywood classic has it all in [The Uninvited](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0037415/?ref_=nv_sr_3).

John Cassavetes was a genius, a visionary, and the progenitor of American independent film, but that doesn’t begin to get at the generosity of his art. A former theater actor fascinated by the power of improvisation, Cassavetes brought his search for truth in performance to the screen. The five films in this collection—all of which the director maintained total control over by financing them himself and making them outside the studio system—are electrifying and compassionate creations, populated by all manner of humanity: beatniks, hippies, businessmen, actors, housewives, strippers, club owners, gangsters, children. Cassavetes has often been called an actor’s director, but this body of work—even greater than the sum of its extraordinary parts—shows him to be an audience’s director in [John Cassavetes: Five Films](http://www.criterion.com/boxsets/558-john-cassavetes-five-films).

A fellow classmate of mine helped me get setup with an internship as of the beginning of september.  The problem was I had a warrant out due to missing a court date for stealing alcohol.  this all happened when i was not doing well at all mentally.  I had a previous weed possession thing happen and had a really bad experience with the court which is why i pretty much had a panick attack when contemplating this court date i had to deal with

I ended up missing court - made another appointment and did the same damn thing again.  The internship i was about to have with Gallo winery fell through after they did their background check ofcourse.  I've since went to court to try and take care of this.  from the looks of it i'm always going to have this petty theft on my record.

at the time i was tryin to steal alcohol - it was when i had a major problem with painkillers and was withdrawling.  ever since losing this job opportunity i've been gettin pressured everyday to get some shitty part time job at mcdonalds or something similiar.  i have about 45 grand in student loans due this november.  The thought of working at a fast food place - the shame i feel from fucking up and missing my earlier court date from years ago - the fact that i truly feel that i have totally killed every single opportunity i've ever had - makes me wanna just off myself. 

i pretty much have it set in my head that if nothing comes through within the next couple months i'm either gonna drive the 90 min. to the golden gate bridge and jump off or take my gpa's gune and shoot myself.   i can't see myself living with this sort of anxiety and shame for the rest of my life.  all i can think about everyday is how muc i've fucked up everything.  

i feel like there is no other way out - despite how hopellesss, anxious, and hatefull i feel towards myself.  i will absolutely not deal with being in default on my student loans and working at a place like Mc. Donalds the rest of my life.  I couldn't live with myself knowning i fucked up such an opportunity.  If nothing shows up in the next few weeks  I will gladly off myself.  Like i said...i couldn't live with myself otherwise.   Anyone else dealt with similiar thoughts?

edit: 

i should make clear - this previous petty theft was from almost 4 years ago now.  i wish i'd just taken care of it now after the consequences that have hit me but that's just wishful thinking.  i had a major problem with smoking weed everyday plus opiates which ajorly affected my quality of life.  as of today i've been off the opiates (morphine pretty much) for 6 weeks and been off the pot for about 8 weeks.  i finally went to court and have started to take care of this petty theft business from my previous stupidity.  but still.  i can't get rid of this shame, regret, and hatred i feel everyday towards my stupidity and fucking  up my life pretty much.  i'm sure you all can understand wanting to off yourself under such a situation. like i said it still scares me -- but the amount of self hatred i feel even more eclipses that fear.  i pretty much made a promise to myself that if no one hires me in the next couple months that i might as well kill myself 0 and jumpin off the golden gate feels like the least painful option i have. after losing this internship with gallo winery i really feel hopeless. i'm kinda drunk right now so i just felt like sharing my thoughts with this subreddit.  meditation helps somewhat - but i still have this sense of hopelessness and self-hatred everyday when i wake up

i just wish i could do it all over again"

I graduated college a year and a half ago (Spring 2012), after graduation I was lucky to secure a paid one-year product strategy internship with an automotive OEM on the other side of the country . I had always dreamed of working for this company and to do product for them. I loved my internship, but hated living where the company was located, however, my love for the job outweighed the negatives the location brought. Upon the end of my internship, I was offered two positions. Although I loved working for this company, I was beginning to question how long I could manage living in this location so far from my friends and family. I somewhat reluctantly accepted a position that would have the broadest applicable experience to potentially future jobs in other industries. This position is a contractor position, so while I have a ""1 year contract,"" my company extends these contracts typically indefinitely until you find a full-time position with the company, or leave.

I have been in this position for nearly 4 months now. I still enjoy the position and the work, however, this love is fading fast. With new management, the environment of my company and department has gone sour. Most are unhappy and express their frustrations daily. Between still not loving the location of where I am at (in fact hating it more) and now work being a more toxic place to be, I am not happy. One thing that holds me back is my current supervisor is amazing. He is extremely kind, gives me paid time off (off book), and is an all around great manager. He reminds me constantly of what a good job I do and how he is happy to have me on his team. I hate the idea of disappointing him by quitting out of the blue and leaving him with more work due to my departure. I know I don't want to live here longer than a have to and want to move to California (where I have friends and family), but am not sure how to proceed. 

Today I found a job posting with my company at our California location, that while it is not my ideal job would at least combine aspects of a job I like in a location I want to be. I would like to apply, but am concerned that if I do, my manager will be questioned about my performance, alerting him that I am intending to leave.  

What is the best way to handle my situation? I don't want to burn bridges or flush my career down the drain, but I want to get out of where I am ASAP."
1ot27z,0,2013-10-19,Is this a case of disparate treatment or impact in the workplace?,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1ot27z/is_this_a_case_of_disparate_treatment_or_impact/,"Hello,
I work at a marketing company in New Jersey. I have been there for about 9 months now. I wanted to share with you all some things that I have experienced there and was hoping that you could answer a question that I have.

So, my job title at this company is Intern/office support. This is a permanent contract position, and not seasonal like a common internship. All three of us currently in this role are college graduates. The point of the internship is to learn how the company works and eventually gain a permanent position in the company.

I want to share my experience with differences in treatment that I have experienced between myself (a male) and other female interns. There are three situations that have stood out in my mind.

The first situation was when the two of our interns (both female) were asked by the president of the company to sit in on a marketing meeting. He wanted to have them give their input on the design of the new company website that was in the process of being launched. Apparently the president wanted our generations’ viewpoint on the design. I was sitting right there when he came by our desks to ask if they were available, and I was not included even though I am the same age and had been at the company just as long as the two female interns. He also did not explicitly ask them if they would like to seet in on a meeting, he asked them if “he could borrow them for half an hour.” I learned after the fact that it was this meeting that they attended. I would have loved to have the opportunity to sit in on the meeting, and receive the same treatment as my fellow interns.

The next situation was when our company ran a meet and greet for some of our major clients at our bosses’ country club. About a third of our staff was asked to attend. Neither I nor the only other intern at the time was asked to attend, however on the third day of the trade show, she (the other intern) was given an invitation from one of the higher-ups to attend the show. This was frustrating because she was offered an opportunity to showcase her skills, impress the bosses and win high value giveaway prizes, and I was not included.

The third situation was when the other intern was given a promotion. I was on vacation for a week in the summer and when I came back they had moved her into a new role as a sales coordinator. They did not inform me that there was an open position, and I would have loved the opportunity to interview for it. It almost seemed as if they capitalized on the opportunity of me being away to move her up so that they did not have to deal with me.

There just seems to be an overall difference in the way that they treat male and female interns. I learned that I have been labeled “the phone guy” by one of the senior members of our company, which actually is not true. Admittedly, I have been on my phone before in the office, but only when I am not busy and I never am on it long. I never let using my phone get in the way of completing the work that I need to. Also, the two female interns that I worked with were on their phone a lot more than me and would snap chat each other during the day and gossip constantly. The difference is I get labeled “the phone guy” and they get promoted and given opportunities to succeed.
The way that it feels to work there generally is that female interns are catered to and get taken under the wing of upper management figures, and male interns are looked at under a microscope and not given as much opportunity to rise.

My question to you all is, is this a possible case of disparate treatment or disparate impact?"

1oxdgt,42,2013-10-21,Thoughts on UGA’s injuries and “bad luck” from another perspective.,AlphaMarshan,UGA,https://www.reddit.com/r/UGA/comments/1oxdgt/thoughts_on_ugas_injuries_and_bad_luck_from/,"This will probably be lengthy, so bear with me. I wanted to chime in from a different perspective on what I’ve seen the past several seasons regarding your team, you faithful UGA fans.
So I live in Georgia, and most of my friends are UGA fans, so I’m always watching the games with them even though I’m mostly unbiased. One of the things that has been consistent with UGA the past several years, anyone will tell you, is the injuries. Season after season, UGA comes in with a top 10 caliber team, only to lose what feels like half its starters on either side of the ball due to injuries. 

Sure, football is a collision sport, there are bound to be injuries. But really? 2 RBs, 4 starting WRs and how many on the OL? And it's half way through the season? What about the year Stafford came back and a pre-season #1 ranked UGA lost, what was it, 3-4 starters on the OL? Malcolm Mitchell tore his ACL celebrating a TD? Anyone remember the Boise State game? No way those kids could hang with UGA right? In the 2nd quarter UGA players were cramping. In the first game of the season. In a DOME. If it's always bad luck after bad luck, how come LSU or Alabama doesn't suffer injuries to the same extent UGA does? I have truly never seen a team, regardless of conference, suffer injuries year after year the way that UGA does, and I think most UGA fans would agree. I don’t have the time to do all the research on it, but if I would be willing to bet that UGA’s multi-game, season, and career-ending injuries are statistically higher when compared to at least the other teams in the SEC. How many times is UGA going to lose key player after key player before we stop attributing it to just ""bad luck""? Now, keep that in mind as I segue into another topic.
I am a certified strength and conditioning specialist (the CSCS is a standard certification most athletic HR programs look for when they are hiring a strength &amp; conditioning (S&amp;C) coach), and I’ve had the privilege of working as an intern with UMiami’s (you know Richt is an alum right?) basketball and soccer teams, among others. The SEC is, in general, one of the most difficult S&amp;C jobs to land because of its reputation in sports and the expectations they have. You need to have a strong educational background in exercise science (most jobs list “bachelor’s required, master’s preferred – which generally means you better have a master’s, which I do) as well as 3 key certifications: you must be a Certified Strength &amp; Conditioning Specialist by the NSCA, Strength and Conditioning Coach Certified by the CSCCa, and a USA Weightlifting Certified Sports Performance Coach. 

For years, Dave Van Halanger was the director of strength and conditioning at UGA. I'm pretty sure kinesiology/exercise science degrees and research in strength and conditioning probably didn't even exist while he was coaching, but it does now. After being fed up with the conditioning, Van Halanger was moved to ""Director of Player Welfare"" (whatever that is) in 2011 and Joe Tereshinski Jr. was promoted to Director of S&amp;C. The Tereshinski name is engrained at UGA – Something like 4 generations of players have now come through the program. Tereshinski Jr. graduated in 1977 and had been working as an assistant strength coach at UGA since 1982, and he learned everything he knows from whom? You guessed it, Van Halanger. So the UGA administration ditched Van Halanger and instead of hiring a qualified strength and conditioning coach, promoted Tereshinski in-house to director when he wouldn’t have even been looked at as an ASSISTANT based on his lack of appropriate education and/or certifications related to S&amp;C. So now you have a guy running the strength and conditioning program with no background in exercise science/physiology, whose assistants are more educated than he is in proper S&amp;C programming and protocols, and whom have to shut up and do what they’re told because he’s running the program. They brought over John Thomas from Penn State who is a “Master-level strength coach” as deemed by the CSCCa and has to work as an assistant under Tereshinski.

The point is this: something's fishy here and if I were a betting man I'd put money on it that UGA's S&amp;C program bench presses and curls too much, doesn't train sport specifically enough, lacks any sort of mobility screening (FMS maybe?), is dominantly sagittal-planed, programs exercises out of order and in the improper energy systems, and lacks any sort of oversight into auditing the programming. There is a host of S&amp;C protocols that any person formally educated in this field knows by heart and uses in their programming to protect and strengthen the knee and surrounding ligaments to reduce the risk of injury. However, strength and conditioning has always been a ""good ol' boy"" type network, and since the Tereshinski family is literally generational in the UGA system, I don't see him leaving anytime soon, especially with Richt's loyalty to his coaches. I'm not saying that all of the injuries are anyone's fault, but UGA loses WAY more key players when compared to their SEC counterparts like LSU or Alabama, season after season. At some point you have to address your S&amp;C and athletic training programs and figure out if it they are at least contributing to the problem, rather than throw up your hands and saying, “Whelp, bad luck again guys. UGA is just cursed, huh?”

I bet if you put Oregon's S&amp;C coach (Radcliffe) at UGA you would get phenomenal results: better conditioned players, faster, more explosive, and fewer injuries. Oregon doesn't come close to getting the caliber athletes that UGA does, but they've made a NAME for themselves based on their speed and conditioning, and Radcliffe is formally educated and in many ways is a pioneer in S&amp;C, and routinely addresses S&amp;C conferences around the country. 

It’s hard to “prove” anything as anecdotal as improper programming in workouts = more injuries for UGA, but as an unbiased observer I think Tereshinski is part of the problem for why UGA seems to suffer so many injuries and have poor conditioning year after year. If there’s anyone you should be calling to replace, it’s him. Fatigued players are always more susceptible to non-contact knee and hamstring injuries. 
Just my thoughts, thanks for reading.

I'm a Junior in college in the US, and I recently got an summer internship offer with GE in the ITLP program.  I just had a few questions that some of you might be able to answer.
If anyone could give me some general information on what I'll be doing, it would be much appreciated.  To my understanding, the ITLP kids do half programming and half business type stuff.  How does this program differ from a spot in the EEDP portion of GE?  Will I be coding a lot (I love coding and want to be a software engineer)?  And will I be simply supporting GE internal IT issues, or will I be able to actually work and innovate projects. Are there options to move around at GE into different issues as an intern?  

I'm crazy excited about this opportunity; I've never really been offered something like this. I'm eager to hear some more from experienced people that know more about this program.  Thanks for any information or advice!!!"

This happened yesterday, and I've talked to a few friends about it, but I am really not ready to have to repeat the story so many times when people ask what happened.

I used to absolutely love being single.

I could do whatever I wanted, sleep and mess around with whoever I wanted. I had a girlfriend my freshman year of college, and didn't have another one until after I graduated. I never felt lonely or even alone.

But then I met the woman I was in a relationship with until yesterday. I didn't feel trapped like I did in other relationships, there wasn't a girlfriend who was preventing me from living my life the way I wanted, but who made me want to live my life in a way that would make our relationship work. And I loved it. We had the strongest, most supportive, and most loving relationship that I've ever had in my life. For real, about as perfect as any relationship can get.

She moved across the country in late July for an opportunity that was really too good to pass up. We thought we could make the distance thing work, but ended up breaking up about a month and a half in. And I was the one who initiated it, it was just too hard. I think she'd have liked to have tried a little bit longer before we calling it off, but it was about as mutual as a break up can get.

We stayed in contact though. We'd constantly be texting each other, calling each other multiple times through out the day just to talk for a minute and tell each other we loved one another, continued sending letters and gifts to another.

Then she came home to visit last weekend. We spent the entire weekend together, and it was, without a doubt, the best weekend I have had since she moved away. Since the last time I saw her. We spent most of Monday before I drove her back to airport talking very seriously and at a great length about being together again. We didn't start dating, but we agreed to cut off all other people and be exclusive with one another until we figured out whether or not I'd be able to manage to move across the country to be with her. For one of the first times in my life I actually tried my best to make something I wanted to happen happen. Last week, I did my best not to spend any money I didn't have to, put the large majority of my paycheck into savings, applied to several jobs and several paid internships in the city she lives in, called around about apartments. I was going to make this happen because as much as I'd miss my life here, I couldn't imagine missing anyone or anything where I love now more than I've missed her while she has been away.

This past weekend, we both went out with our friends in our respective cities, sending each other the occasional text to say I love you or just talk a little bit about something.

I wake up Saturday morning to a text that we needed to talk.

I call her, she cheated on me.

She said she started to doubt whether or not we were making the right decision, and she was scared about taking this next step in our relationship. Moving for one another, moving in together. So with the nervousness she felt, she made a very terrible and very hurtful mistake. 

I believe that's what happened, and she just didn't think it through. I believe, still, that she is a good person but she did a very bad thing to me, and I can't forgive her.

She tried to send me texts and phone calls through the day on Saturday apologizing and trying to start making conversation. I'd either ignore them or just send back a couple words. I did ignore all the calls, though.

Now, I called her yesterday, which was Sunday. And told her that she ruined what was between us, and that I went from getting mail, phone calls, packages, texts, and hoping it was her and being unable to prevent a smile when it was. Know, those same things, hearing from her just makes me some sort of crazy combination of sad, depressed, betrayed, and angry.

So I told her that I couldn't have her in my life anymore, not even as friends, and not even to try to fix this. Maybe I'd consider it if we were in the same place, but this isn't something I think we can fix from a distance. I want her in my life, so badly, but it's not good for me. As long as she is in my life, I'm going to be in love with her, but our relationship will never be the same again and I need to get over her. And need her out of my life, at least for now, to do that.

But it's so hard. I want to call her and hear her voice, but so far have refrained. In the time I was with her, I went operating great as a single man, to relying so heavily on her always being there and helping me, supporting me, loving, hugging, kissing me. I know this is something I have to go through alone, but it's the first thing I've had to alone in so long that I don't know how to do it. 

I just want someone there to cuddle with and talk to while I fall asleep, someone to call when I have good news, or bad news.

I don't want to be alone anymore, and I don't know what to do.

Sorry for the wall of text, I wrote this hoping to ask for advice. Maybe I just wanted the catharsis of typing it out and letting anyone and everyone read it, because I don't even know what to ask for, any support or advice, or insight into how I'm supposed to do this?

TL;DR: I got spoiled rotten.]

So I'm an intern here at Walt Disney World, and let me tell you, kittens, it is not sunshine and rainbows and happy cartoon characters all the time. It is hot, it is humid, and we interns work the crappy shifts for mere peanuts. On top of that, NO NAIL POLISH ALLOWED unless it's super boring and conservative. Think nudes and pale pinks. UGH. BORING.

I still have toes, though, so I can indulge in a little bit of lacquery fun.

ANYWAY. Halloween is the greatest holiday ever, because the day after is the best regular day ever. (Hello, half-off Halloween candy? Get in my basket, then in my belly.) So of course I jumped at the chance to be a part of this exchange.. partly to spoil someone, and partly to get spoiled. And boy, did I get spoiled.

But first, let me tell you a little story. Since I'm an intern I live in Disney housing, which *some people* refer to as Mauschwitz. There are rules upon rules upon rules. No candles, no incense, no posters, no stickers, no deliveries, no moving the furniture around, no toy weapons including lightsabers (we can buy them at the parks but we can't bring them home), no streaming or copyright infringing of anything, etc. The no deliveries part is where our story begins. All mail gets dropped off at the front desk of our complex, and we're emailed to pick up our packages. My giftee told me on Sunday that my package had arrived Friday, and after some mild hair-tearing frustration, my package was found. The guy behind the desk was like ""um, riotcoming? Is that you?""

Yes, that's me. Would you like an autograph? I always have time for my biggest fans.

""Next time have them send the package with your real name. We almost returned it. We've been trying to contact you all weekend.""

Which explains why my roommate and I both had approximately 0 e-mail notifications that a package for our apartment had been delivered. 

SO. I had the package, and I had 20 minutes before I had to hustle off to work. I rushed back to my apartment and opened it, and saw [this](http://s23.postimg.org/hhqo7x64b/image_9.jpg) waiting for me. Such a cute decorated box, and look! Candy!

I pull the box out and it's been [decorated](http://s23.postimg.org/vhsq027uj/image_17.jpg)  [on](http://s23.postimg.org/e9m6uvjuj/image_15.jpg) [all](http://s23.postimg.org/mzeohzby3/image_11.jpg) [sides](http://s23.postimg.org/hf277cd2z/image_8.jpg). So cute!

I open it up and.. what's this? [More candy?](http://s23.postimg.org/b3wzqxbuj/image_7.jpg)

[Everything out of the box](http://s23.postimg.org/gi0dc7qyj/image_12.jpg).

I had to know who spoiled me first, so I opened [the](http://s23.postimg.org/z15gydvsr/image_3.jpg) [card](http://s23.postimg.org/xu0pxnkfv/image_16.jpg) and discovered that /u/riotcomingtrickster is /u/swiftieatheart !!!

So let's see the haul, shall we?

First up, the two delightful jars. She was sweet enough to remember that 1) I LOVE pumpkin everything, and 2) I really like for my gifters to send a little piece of home with them. I try to do the same for my gift packages, to give a little piece of me with every gift. Behold, [pumpkin butter](http://s23.postimg.org/ga851yqm3/image_10.jpg) and [apple butter](http://s23.postimg.org/uzsz6gsvv/image_1.jpg)! I love pumpkin and apple butter, and could not have been a more perfect gift. My roommate was jealous until I told her I'd share the apple butter.

As for the nail polish haul:

Currently working in a coffee shop after spending 7 months in an out-of-state internship under a manager who hired me with a mutual [unwritten] agreement that I would be there long-term (1-2 years.) She develops more of a personal connection to her employees than any other manager I've worked for. I was hired on the spot of my interview about three months ago now. 

A few problems. Right now, I simply do not enjoy what I do. I have a respect for the job and the people who work there, however it's just not satisfying my own professional goals. I'm kept there (often later than scheduled) after working 9 hours on my feet and then waking up to go to classes. It's an extremely tough balance and I've already had to drop a class.

My other problem, which I feel is the biggest, is that it was established that I wouldn't be heading back out of state again this spring. At the time, it was true. I had no desire to go back...anytime soon, anyway. I'm experiencing a change of heart. I established a life down there. Developed relationships and connections that I feel I'm not as ready to walk away from as I thought I was. When I think of going back, it's actually one of the few things that makes me feel better about anything.

I don't know how to approach her about this. All things considered I don't think it's going to go over well. 

What have your experiences been under these circumstances? How did you approach your leadership about the situation, and how did they react? "

1ox4ad,8,2013-10-21,I just ended a relationship and I don't know what to do.,Throwawayforadvicepl,whatsbotheringyou,https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsbotheringyou/comments/1ox4ad/i_just_ended_a_relationship_and_i_dont_know_what/,"I'm using a throw away simply because some of my friends figured out my reddit account from a couple stories in previous threads. This happened yesterday, and I've talked to a few friends about it, but I am really not ready to have to repeat the story so many times when people ask what happened.

I used to absolutely love being single.

I could do whatever I wanted, sleep and mess around with whoever I wanted. I had a girlfriend my freshman year of college, and didn't have another one until after I graduated. I never felt lonely or even alone.

But then I met the woman I was in a relationship with until yesterday. I didn't feel trapped like I did in other relationships, there wasn't a girlfriend who was preventing me from living my life the way I wanted, but who made me want to live my life in a way that would make our relationship work. And I loved it. We had the strongest, most supportive, and most loving relationship that I've ever had in my life. For real, about as perfect as any relationship can get.

She moved across the country in late July for an opportunity that was really too good to pass up. We thought we could make the distance thing work, but ended up breaking up about a month and a half in. And I was the one who initiated it, it was just too hard. I think she'd have liked to have tried a little bit longer before we calling it off, but it was about as mutual as a break up can get.

We stayed in contact though. We'd constantly be texting each other, calling each other multiple times through out the day just to talk for a minute and tell each other we loved one another, continued sending letters and gifts to another.

Then she came home to visit last weekend. We spent the entire weekend together, and it was, without a doubt, the best weekend I have had since she moved away. Since the last time I saw her. We spent most of Monday before I drove her back to airport talking very seriously and at a great length about being together again. We didn't start dating, but we agreed to cut off all other people and be exclusive with one another until we figured out whether or not I'd be able to manage to move across the country to be with her. For one of the first times in my life I actually tried my best to make something I wanted to happen happen. Last week, I did my best not to spend any money I didn't have to, put the large majority of my paycheck into savings, applied to several jobs and several paid internships in the city she lives in, called around about apartments. I was going to make this happen because as much as I'd miss my life here, I couldn't imagine missing anyone or anything where I love now more than I've missed her while she has been away.

This past weekend, we both went out with our friends in our respective cities, sending each other the occasional text to say I love you or just talk a little bit about something.

I wake up Saturday morning to a text that we needed to talk.

I call her, she cheated on me.

She said she started to doubt whether or not we were making the right decision, and she was scared about taking this next step in our relationship. Moving for one another, moving in together. So with the nervousness she felt, she made a very terrible and very hurtful mistake. 

I believe that's what happened, and she just didn't think it through. I believe, still, that she is a good person but she did a very bad thing to me, and I can't forgive her.

She tried to send me texts and phone calls through the day on Saturday apologizing and trying to start making conversation. I'd either ignore them or just send back a couple words. I did ignore all the calls, though.

Now, I called her yesterday, which was Sunday. And told her that she ruined what was between us, and that I went from getting mail, phone calls, packages, texts, and hoping it was her and being unable to prevent a smile when it was. Know, those same things, hearing from her just makes me some sort of crazy combination of sad, depressed, betrayed, and angry.

So I told her that I couldn't have her in my life anymore, not even as friends, and not even to try to fix this. Maybe I'd consider it if we were in the same place, but this isn't something I think we can fix from a distance. I want her in my life, so badly, but it's not good for me. As long as she is in my life, I'm going to be in love with her, but our relationship will never be the same again and I need to get over her. And need her out of my life, at least for now, to do that.

But it's so hard. I want to call her and hear her voice, but so far have refrained. In the time I was with her, I went operating great as a single man, to relying so heavily on her always being there and helping me, supporting me, loving, hugging, kissing me. I know this is something I have to go through alone, but it's the first thing I've had to alone in so long that I don't know how to do it. 

I just want someone there to cuddle with and talk to while I fall asleep, someone to call when I have good news, or bad news.

I don't want to be alone anymore, and I don't know what to do.

Sorry for the wall of text, I wrote this hoping to ask for advice. Maybe I just wanted the catharsis of typing it out and letting anyone and everyone read it, because I don't even know what to ask for, any support or advice, or insight into how I'm supposed to do this?"
1owvca,18,2013-10-21,Google internship,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1owvca/google_internship/,So I recently applied for Google's SE internship and I ended up getting an email back from a recruiter saying they wanted to do 2  phone technical interviews.  I was pretty shocked because there isn't much special about my resume and I haven't taken some classes that would be helpful for this position. For example I haven't taken my data structures course yet. This seems to be an area that they really focus on during the interview even in the email they say brush up on this. So my question is why did they pick me? I'd assumed they would look at my resume and transcripts before accepting for an interview. I'm super nervous because I don't know data structures very well and that is what is going to be asked. Should I just deny the interview and not waste there time or do it for the experience and see what they ask to be ready for maybe next year? I applied assuming I wouldn't be chosen and surprised I got picked. Will they possibly ask more questions that deal with what I've done according to my transcripts and resume or am I just screwed? I'm not a person to give up easily so I'm going to be reading up a lot on data structures for this. But I doubt it would help much since my interview is in 3 weeks. Any advice?

""Guys, I've just called this meeting to once again thank you all for your incredible work on this project. We can now say that this project has been a complete success. Before I lay out our plans for the upcoming DLC's, does anyone have anything they'd like to say?""

From the back of the room, Zach the intern raises his hand.

""Yeah, Zach, what's on your mind?""

""Uh...I just wanted to say that...I was on the gameplay testing team, and I think this whole jetpack mystery you guys threw in before the final code commit was simply genius.""

The executive leading the meeting looks confused as his eyes scan the room...""Uh...what jetpack mystery?""

Just then, one of the lead programmers steps forward...""Yeah, sir...we have a...uh...small problem. None of the guys were going to say anything about it, but I think it's time we came clean.""

""See, some of the guys...to be honest, it was just Dave...thought it would be funny to throw in this stupid mural on Mt Chiliad. It has a stick figure of a guy with a jetpack on it.""

""So, what's the problem?""

""Well, sir, this one stupid picture has sparked an internet witchhunt which has taken on Machiavellan proportions. People are spending hundreds of gameplay hours looking for some jetpack now, but there's not really any jetpack in the game.""

As the exectutive dismisses the rest of the team, a few coders stay behind and open up /r/chiliadmystery to show their boss. The coders are then asked to leave while the boss begins to read the posts.

Cut to 24 hours later, the executive reconvenes the staff for a new meeting.

""Ok guys, new topic...I haven't slept in 20 hours. I've driven the Space Docker to every place I can think of and honked every custom horn. One of you assholes better come clean right now and tell me how to find this jetpack.""

""Sir, that's just it...there IS no jetpack. We never thought it would become this...""

""YOU SHUT YOUR GODDAMN PIEHOLE JOHNSON! IT's RIGHT THERE ON THE FUCKING PICTURE! NOW, I SAY AGAIN, ONE OF YOU ASSHOLES START SPITTING OUT THE ANSWER...I'M GOING TO COUNT TO 5....1, 2, 3...""

""Sir, but there's really...""

""THE NEXT WORDS YOU SAY WILL BE YOUR LAST HERE, JOHNSON, I'm WARNING YOU...""

As the camera fades out, we faintly hear Zach, the intern, as he chuckles to himself....""Classic fucking Dave."""
1ownuw,0,2013-10-21,(Jobs)I'm a sophomore CS major looking for a internship for the summer of 2014,theferdog,oklahoma,https://www.reddit.com/r/oklahoma/comments/1ownuw/jobsim_a_sophomore_cs_major_looking_for_a/,I'm a sophomore computer science major currently at OCCC transferring to OU next spring (2015). Looking for any type of IT internship for the coming summer. I'm not sure what exactly I'm looking to do in the industry so hands on experience seems like a ideal solution. OKC jobs preferred but willing to travel some.
1owlp4,1,2013-10-21,[25/f] I want a career and he [30/m] is offering me what any girl should want.,ihearditinalullaby,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1owlp4/25f_i_want_a_career_and_he_30m_is_offering_me/,"I have known him for years but we only went on two dates a year apart - but then somehow we started talking on the phone/skype all the time and I found I missed him if we didn't talk. But still I felt we were in the getting to know each other phase when he flew across the Pacific to visit me where I have relocated for work.

We had a great time spending a weekend exploring a new city neither of us had ever visited. If we lived in the same city (or um, continent) I would be hoping for a lot more dates :)

He wants me to move back to N. America with him at the end of my internship where he will comfortably take care of us and I would ""only have to work if I want to."" We made lists of the parts of the world we want to visit with promises to see them all. He loves me and is willing to wait for me until my contract ends in June.

I thought I needed a career to feel financially stable enough to reach my eventual goal of starting a family. Now here I am at this internship with a very high chance of being offered a full-time, two-year contract... and all of a sudden I realize I actually LOVE my work.

I could look for work in his city but the language difference would be a disadvantage for me. Not impossible - but here I am very likely to get that really nice ""2 years full-time experience"" added on my resume... which would probably then find me a job back in his city afterwards, or at least into a masters degree at school there.

I see a lot of potential with this guy but the reality is that it isn't there yet - he says he loves me and I cannot genuinely return the feelings, but that doesn't mean it won't happen in the future. I can still look for a job when I'm with him its just going to be a much harder search there.

Contracts come up in a month for next year and I am SO torn.

tl;dr Do I renew my contract and take the stable job or move home for a man who loves me and will allow me to live a life of luxury except that I'm not sure yet how I feel about him?

...well now that I say that it seems rather clear, doesn't it."
1owki6,8,2013-10-21,Gaming PC in the 400 Euro range,TheWrongGuy,buildapcforme,https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapcforme/comments/1owki6/gaming_pc_in_the_400_euro_range/,"&gt;What will you be doing with this PC? Gaming? Photoshop? Web browsing? etc. If you need a Workstation, be specific on the programs you'll be using. Try to list as many games/applications that you'll be using as you can, as well as your performance goals for those programs.

Mostly gaming and general PC use, I'd be playing mostly RPGs like Skyrim and Fallout: New Vegas but I would like to be able to run BF4 on decent settings. 

&gt;What is your maximum preferred budget before rebates/shipping/taxes?

450 Euros is the max I'd like to spend, but I'd prefer to stay around 400 if at all possible, if not I can try to expand my budget.

&gt;When do you plan on building/buying the PC? (note: if you're planning on buying more than 2 weeks from now, it's very much recommended you wait and come back then, to ensure you get the most recent and accurate price data)

I'd like to buy and build within the next couple weeks, however I can wait as long as December and then I need the machine for a class.

&gt;What, exactly, do you need included in the budget? ""Everything"" is not specific enough. Tower, Operating System, peripherals like the keyboard, mouse, and monitor(s), wifi adapter, speakers/headphones, etc. are all relevant.

I would need a keyboard and I'd like Windows 7, but 8 is ok with me.

&gt;Which country will you be purchasing the parts in? If you're in the US, are you near a Microcenter store?

Germany, in the area near Stuttgart

&gt;If reusing any parts, what parts will you be reusing? Please be especially specific about the power supply. List make and model. If you have a monitor, list the size/resolution.

None

&gt;Will you be overclocking? If yes, are you interested in overclocking right away, or down the line? CPU and/or GPU?

Nix

&gt;If there's any specific features you want/need from the rig, please list them. Examples might include rear and/or front-panel USB 3.0, a RAID setup, etc.

Front panel USB 3.0 would be a plus, possibly 3.5mm jacks for audio/mic but those can be on the back if need be.

&gt;Do you have any specific case/tower preferences such as a window or LEDs, or do you have a preference for low-noise components?

A window would be useful as I intend to rebuild/build the computer with a class at school, I can be flexible to maintain price. Also I'd like to avoid a full size tower as I have to either bring this with me on the plane or ship it back to the United States.

&gt;Do you already have a legit and reusable/transferable OS key/license? If yes, what OS?

No

&gt;Extra info or specifics:

I'll need to take this computer back with me to the USA so light weight mid size components would be awesome but not entirely necessary, I'm on an internship in Germany until July and I aim to teach a  class how to build a computer. "

[How much money do you earn p/a, roughly?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ouxt0/iama_petroleum_engineer_specializing_in_hydraulic/ccvwqi6?context=5)|With &lt;5 years industry experience I am making $ 115,000 USD + bonus a year.
[Do you enjoy your work?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ouxt0/iama_petroleum_engineer_specializing_in_hydraulic/ccvwqi6?context=5)|I am very fortunate to have the opportunity I do. I enjoy my job and it provides well for my family. I can sit inside on hot/cold days or go play with very large equipment if things get boring. Couldn't imagine not being in the oilfield.
[Do you need a specialized degree to do this kind of work?  I have a Geology degree but I didn't have any particular specialization in college.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ouxt0/iama_petroleum_engineer_specializing_in_hydraulic/ccw0pzj?context=5)|You are not required to be an accredited engineer or what not to do the work, but I don't think anyone would hire a non-engineer for an engineering position.
 |I think the new standard for geologists to work in industry is to have a masters. Again, not a requirement but my understanding from talking to the Geos is most companies won't accept anything less. 
[Yeah, I'm definitely no engineer and unfortunately I never got my Masters.  Never could figure out what I wanted to do.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ouxt0/iama_petroleum_engineer_specializing_in_hydraulic/ccw161s?context=5)|How old are you and what type of experience do you have now? Big companies have different requirements for themselves than smaller mom &amp; pop operations. Are you in an area that's busy with oil &amp; gas activity? 
[I'm late 20's, no oil/gas experience (I've done all environmental consulting to date\) and live in Southern AZ. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ouxt0/iama_petroleum_engineer_specializing_in_hydraulic/ccw1rvm?context=5)|The area you're in is probably the biggest hurdle to overcome. I don't know of anyone out that way who I could hook you up with to talk to. Sorry. 
[Can you explain the process behind extracting oil from tar sands and why we don't have the technology for it today?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ouxt0/iama_petroleum_engineer_specializing_in_hydraulic/ccvvm44?context=5)|Preface with: I do not work those sands. I specialize in high temperature/high pressure (HTHP) formations. Someone involved more intimately with them could give a better answer. The technology to extract oil from tar sands does exist - its just there are easier places to get hydrocarbons from for the time being, which means a dollar goes further elsewhere.
 |Basically my understanding is the hydrocarbon is simply too viscous to flow through a rock matrix. In fact it is so viscous that it requires cutting with liquid hydrocarbons in order to be able to pump it through pipelines.
 |There are methods of increasing the temperature of the oil underground so that is becomes less viscous (steam floods for example) but those require extensive planning, maintenance and a very high capital investment. Even then, I am not sure of the % of oil that can be recovered from what is initially in place.
 |I'll do some asking around for you if you want and message you a response.
 |ETA: Here's a video from Cenovus who is a big player in the oil sands. In this example they are using steam to heat the oil to decrease the viscosity and letting gravity drain it to a well beneath for production.
 |[Link to www.cenovus.com](http://www.cenovus.com/video/sagd.html)
[Sure. That would be awesome.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ouxt0/iama_petroleum_engineer_specializing_in_hydraulic/ccvwaar?context=5)|Luck of the draw really. The company I work for is large enough to be able to afford the increased capital to chase HTHP stuff. But whether its tight shales or very permeable sands its all a variation of the same, you know? The thought processes and operations don't change. Specialized sounds a bit douchey - let's go with ""I mainly focus on HTHP"".
[How did you get to specialize in HTHP formations?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ouxt0/iama_petroleum_engineer_specializing_in_hydraulic/ccvwaar?context=5)|With how hot the market is right now, most companies are taking whatever they can get in terms of experience. If you are trying to transition to a company that predominately works tight shales of course it makes it easier to sell yourself if you have experience in that area - but at the end of the day, it all falls under the same roof.
[Also, how much does it differ between the conventional and unconventional oil and gas industry - in terms of job prospects, pay and expertise needed?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ouxt0/iama_petroleum_engineer_specializing_in_hydraulic/ccvwaar?context=5)|I have worked over-, normal-, and under-balanced formations all for the same company. They pay me the same regardless.
[How did you get your job? (did you make lots of contacts at uni etc\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ouxt0/iama_petroleum_engineer_specializing_in_hydraulic/ccw21vi?context=5)|I spend a lot of time on the computer (writing procedures, checking information, approving invoices), going to meetings or talking on the phone. Pretty much the typical office job.
[With oil being a non renewable resource, what will you do when reserves are low or run out?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ouxt0/iama_petroleum_engineer_specializing_in_hydraulic/ccw21vi?context=5)|I did not intern with any companies and so when it came time to look for a job, I applied to ~ 10 places. The company that hired me had just gone through some folks leaving and were needing people. I was lucky to get hired on. Most of the time it would not have happened that way.  I figure we will not see that in my lifetime. If we do though, with all the things that come from petroleum products we use on a daily basis, there will be plenty of other people up shit creek too, not just those in oil and gas. 
[Source: organic matter from a long time ago that was trapped in the rock during deposition and became what we know today as hydrocarbon after millions of years of increasing pressure and temperature.  Pathway: Permeable rock capable of allowing fluid to migrate upwards.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ouxt0/iama_petroleum_engineer_specializing_in_hydraulic/ccw51uu?context=5)|The point is that the same impermeable layers that have kept the oil/gas from migrating upwards all these years, can also contain my fracture. We know what our layers are all the way from surface to our target zone, and are capable of using tools to log across these zones during drilling and obtain these rock properties. There are mathematical models (models are not the end all be all though, question anyone who tells you they are) which can be used to predict fracture geometry to an extent.
[What is the first thing we do when we start a well? Punch a big hole through all of these impermeable zones with our drilling rig.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ouxt0/iama_petroleum_engineer_specializing_in_hydraulic/ccw51uu?context=5)|In the image above they are sigma 1, 2 &amp; 3. When we frac a well we are overcoming the minimum local stress regime and parting the rock. Imagine we have a balloon sealed inside the block that we are pressuring up on. We would overcome sigma 2 first and the rock would split in half perpendicular to sigma 2, right?
[The photo above shows a representation of the drilling casing program. Basically, as we drill deeper and deeper into the Earth, every so often we stop and run steel pipe into our hole. We then cement up the backside (annulus\) of the pipe before continuing deeper.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ouxt0/iama_petroleum_engineer_specializing_in_hydraulic/ccw51uu?context=5)|The above photo shows an outcrop of rock depicting layering. Now imagine we initiated a fracture where his left hand is and our minimum stress is perpendicular to your computer screen - that means the fracture is going to grow parallel to the layers.
[I am considering the field of petroleum engineering. I hope you can answer some of my questions. First off, what is your work schedule like? Do you move around a lot?  I am planning on a degree in mechanical engineering, will that cover my needs? Is there a lot of competition as far as getting a job?  Do you enjoy your job? Would you recommend it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ouxt0/iama_petroleum_engineer_specializing_in_hydraulic/ccvzjpe?context=5)|My particular job, no. I could travel but I have a family and choose to be with them. I work ~ 50 hours a week, almost all of it in the office, but am available to field calls 24 hours a day.
 |There are essentially two routes you could take out of school: working for a service provider or for an owner/operator. The operator of a well oversees each operation - leasing land, drilling, completion, production - and calls out service providers as needed for the various work (drilling rig company to do the drilling i.e.).The best analogy I can think of is that of a construction general/sub contractors. Working for an operator typically pays a bit more than working for a service company.
 |With the recent boom in the industry, more and more companies are hiring non-petroleum engineers. It used to be you would have a hard time finding work as a non-PETE but you very well could land on something now. Not sure how long that will last though. I actually started out as mechanical as well but changed my major along the way. Engineering classes are basically the same up until the last 3 semesters or so just so you know.
 |Internships are huge in this business. If you are able to hook up with an operator for a couple of summer internships, it shouldn't matter what your major is. Without having an internship you will most likely have a hard time landing a job with an operator out of school.
 |I am very fortunate to have the opportunity I do. I enjoy my job and it provides well for my family. I can sit inside on hot/cold days or go play with very large equipment if things get boring. Couldn't imagine not being in the oilfield.
[Was the college you graduated from highly competitive? Was it difficult to find employment after graduation? And finally, how important is the specific 'Petroleum engineering' degree? I ask because only one college in canada offers it while all others offer whats called Mineral engineering. Would it be difficult to find employment as a PE with an Mineral E degree? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ouxt0/iama_petroleum_engineer_specializing_in_hydraulic/ccweiyu?context=5)|I can't speak to what Canadian based companies look for. But there are quite a few big operators in your country that you could call up and ask those type of questions. Not sure if you guys have career fairs up that way, but down here they are a big here and would be another chance to touch base with the companies in your area.  Seriously, just call up one of the guys up there and ask to speak to someone in HR that deals with college recruiting. That's your best bet for the right info. 
[Have you seen the documentary Gasland, and if so what was your overall assessment of the movie?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ouxt0/iama_petroleum_engineer_specializing_in_hydraulic/ccw2do7?context=5)|I watched about 3 minutes of it and turned it off. 
[Yeah, my impression of the trailer was that it was completely a waste of time, then I watched the first 10 minutes. Seemed too propagandic (is that even a word\) to me.  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ouxt0/iama_petroleum_engineer_specializing_in_hydraulic/ccw2wnv?context=5)|Propagandaish maybe? :p Yea I'm in the same boat. It was way too one-sided to sit through. 
[Why wouldn't a rich enough company explore cleaner renewable energy? Last time I checked nobody complained of wind gusts because of wind power :-/](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ouxt0/iama_petroleum_engineer_specializing_in_hydraulic/ccvxhuy?context=5)|That's a fair point. I'd argue that the thing to remember is that hydrocarbons don't just provide energy. Petroleum products are in almost everything you touch. That computer sitting in front of you is proof of that.

[Fracking in Canada right now is highly controversial, there was actually a riot last week. The long term affects are still relatively unknown with many feeling it's not worth the economic boom. Does Texas and the surrounding states face as much controversy? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ouxt0/iama_petroleum_engineer_specializing_in_hydraulic/ccvyy0a?context=5)|Short answer: no. Oil and gas is HUGE in Texas. It may be the friendliest state for companies to operate in. The industry has been here for over 100 years, and it is such a commonplace thing now that no one thinks twice of it. OK,KS,LA,MS are all similar when it comes to acceptance.
 |I'd say the closest state to us with well known opposition would be Colorado. They do have protests and I know of folks who have had to have security escort them to their vehicles when leaving work due to harassment by locals.
 |Hydraulic fracturing is not a new process - its been around for over 50 years. In recent years it has become more mainstream I suppose due to mass media and sensationalism (youtube videos of people lighting tap water on fire - something they could do 100 years ago by the way). Most of the time I have found those with the loudest voices against it, know nothing of the science behind it...
[Is that tap water thing real, btw? is it due to the water being actually full of liquid petro-chemicals or just NG letdown through the pipes?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ouxt0/iama_petroleum_engineer_specializing_in_hydraulic/ccwc3uu?context=5)|The stuff in those videos is a result of shallow coal bed methane formations where gas percolate up into the ground water. There are rebuttal videos to those where people go in areas without any oil/gas activity and light river water on fire for instance.
 |So yes, people can light their tap water on fire. But they are able to do so not because of something humans did, but because gas is naturally migrating upwards into their water supply. It has been going on for thousands of years. 
[If a community would like to complain about the two main types of contamination you mentioned, either a chemical runoff or fracking into an aquifier - what kind of evidence would they need? That is, what would be considered conclusive proof that the fracking operations in the area caused considerable environmental degradation?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ouxt0/iama_petroleum_engineer_specializing_in_hydraulic/ccvz0d4?context=5)|That's tough to say without knowing the specifics. The general idea though, would be to get samples taken before/after the activity in the area. These could then be analyzed and a determination made based off the findings.
 |The most recent case I can think of around that topic was the Pavillion field in Wyoming. Here's a link with some info on it (granted its from the operator who was accused of causing the damage, but I like this because it lists why they refute the claims).
 |[Link to www.encana.com](http://www.encana.com/news-stories/news-releases/details.html?release=632327)
 |I should point out that the EPA discontinued their study, so there would seem to be some merit to the disputes listed by Encana. There are a ton of other sites with info on this case on the web if you want to do some more reading.
 |Truthfully though, you will not be able to find a case in which fracturing was the sole cause of an aquifer contamination. Barring a shitty cement job done during drilling, the physics behind a frac job don't support that type of anomaly. We can go more into the specifics of that if you would like.
 |If you are talking about chemical runoff, or behind pipe (bad cement job) communication - in which fluids migrate up the wellbore into shallower zones  - I fully acknowledge the potential that exists for aquifer contamination. But it won't be the induced fracture downhole itself.  
[Can you talk a little about why the physics don't support a sole cause of aquifer contamination?

 |Granted the depth of the target formation could be closer to the water bearing zone, but take the first photo with a grain of salt.
 |First thing we need to talk about is what makes a reservoir. Let's stick with conventionals since they are a bit easier to talk about. So three things have to exist for us to have a reservoir by definition: a source, a pathway, and a trap.
 |Source: organic matter from a long time ago that was trapped in the rock during deposition and became what we know today as hydrocarbon after millions of years of increasing pressure and temperature.
 |Pathway: Permeable rock capable of allowing fluid to migrate upwards.
 |Trap: A 'cap' if you will that blocks the further migration of fluid towards surface.
 |So by its very nature a reservoir could not exist without something that keeps fluids from migrating further uphole. The trap has sealed the fluid for millions of years, why would it suddenly give way? The only way that gas could get closer to the surface (and aquifers) if it a pathway was created.
 |What is the first thing we do when we start a well? Punch a big hole through all of these impermeable zones with our drilling rig.
 |[Link to www.propublica.org](http://www.propublica.org/images/articles/methane/methane_graphic_475px_090424.gif)
 |The photo above shows a representation of the drilling casing program. Basically, as we drill deeper and deeper into the Earth, every so often we stop and run steel pipe into our hole. We then cement up the backside (annulus) of the pipe before continuing deeper.
 |For this particular example there are 3 steel barriers, one with cement behind it, protecting the ground water from contamination from below. Typically the minimum set depth for the surface casing is a state requirement and is dependent upon the water table. We are required to test the casing/cement job for integrity prior to continuing operations to ensure everything is holding.
 |So although we did create a pathway for the gas to travel to surface on, our casing/cementing program should keep the various zones separate. However, there are times when shotty cement jobs allow for crossflow communication and can in fact contaminate the ground water. This is due to drilling practices though, not hydraulic fracturing (we haven't gotten to that step yet).
 |Hydraulic fracturing is used for one purpose: to increase a well's productivity. Productivity is just a fancy word describing how much fluid we get for a given pressure drop i.e q (flow rate) / (P initial – P flowing).
 |Let’s put it into something we can picture. Out in my backyard my son has a kiddy pool filled with water covered with a lid I cannot take off; that is my reservoir. You approach me and say you will give me $1 / gallon of water I can give you that I take out of the pool. Hell of a deal I think and I head off to get your water. Now reservoirs, just like pools, come in all different shapes and sizes. The important thing to remember is compared to the diameter of the hole we drill (called ‘wellbore’ – varies by area but typically &lt;12”), the reservoir is HUGE! Its like a coffee straw compared to my kiddie pool, or if I have a really big reservoir, a coffee straw compared to an in ground pool. Needless to say I’ve got a ton of water to get out of the pool, and a very small straw to do it with.
 |No big deal I think, I’ll just put in a bunch of straws and suck out of more than one. The catch is that a straw may cost me a week’s worth of sucking, or a month, or a year before it pays itself off. I can’t afford to put too many in the pool, or it will take too long to pay out. I decide that 5 straws is an economic compromise, so I put my straw in the pool (drill my hole) and start sucking (producing the well).
 |Now there are two important differences between my kiddy pool analogy and the real world that we need to understand.
 |The first is that not every well I drill in the real world will be equal. Some will produce more than others, and some not at all. Some straws I bought will never pay for themselves.
 |The second point to make is that unlike water flowing freely in a pool, the fluids in my reservoir cannot move so readily. In my analogy the straw would be the limiting factor in how much fluid I could move (frictional pressure loss associated with such a smaller inner diameter). In reality though my wellbore can move however much fluid I can throw at it, the problem is getting it there. That is, the connected pores in the rock do not line up perfectly to my straw. There are tight spots, backtracking, dead ends and all sorts of things that the fluid has to fight. Not only that, but once you get to the base of the straw there are some other effects. We can mimic these behaviors by placing a maze around each straw that restricts how much fluid I can suck. So now this maze, and no longer the straw, is the limiting factor in how much water I can move.
 |So here I am sitting in my backyard, with 5 straws spaced around the kiddie pool sucking away (don’t forget we added the maze). My wife walks out, sees me and asks how would I like to decrease the amount of effort (pressure drop) it is taking to suck a certain volume? She says she will create a path that completely bypasses the maze and can increase how easily the water flows to the straw by 4 times. Not only that, it is only a third the price of a new straw.
 |That is what hydraulic fracturing does to a well. It creates a pathway for the reservoir fluids to bypass the permeability of the rock – a one lane country road – and jump on an 8 lane highway headed straight for the straw. For the same amount of pressure drop, I can move much, much more water.  
[Has their been an influx of petroleum engineers over the past few years?  I know for a while a bunch of websites were saying it has the highest paying starting salary, so I figured lots of people would begin to major in it.  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ouxt0/iama_petroleum_engineer_specializing_in_hydraulic/ccvxyis?context=5)|According to this there are only 23 accredited schools in the US that offer petroleum engineering (PETE) as a major.
 |[Link to www.myplan.com](http://www.myplan.com/majors/petroleum-engineering/colleges-that-offer-this-degree-14.2501.html)
 |Compare that to mechanical engineering numbers (using the same site) of 296 schools, and you can see it is a not so common field. I think most people do not know about the option, and if they did, wouldn't be able to attend a school without moving.
 |I know of companies that were hiring non-petroleum engineers (chemical,mechanical even some industrial) to work PETE jobs just because there were not enough PETE graduates. I'd be curious to see if that trend continues.

 |**Frac Mechanics**
 |Any combination of forces on an object can be represented by three principal directions.
 |[Link to petrowiki.org](http://petrowiki.org/images/thumb/0/0d/Vol4prt_Page_328_Image_0002.png/235px-Vol4prt_Page_328_Image_0002.png)
 |In the image above they are sigma 1, 2 &amp; 3. When we frac a well we are overcoming the minimum local stress regime and parting the rock. Imagine we have a balloon sealed inside the block that we are pressuring up on. We would overcome sigma 2 first and the rock would split in half perpendicular to sigma 2, right?
 |So a fracture will always grow perpendicular to the least principal stress.
 |[Link to www.southampton.ac.uk](http://www.southampton.ac.uk/~imw/jpg-Lyme/11LYM-Thin-Oil-Shales-lab-m.jpg)
 |The above photo shows an outcrop of rock depicting layering. Now imagine we initiated a fracture where his left hand is and our minimum stress is perpendicular to your computer screen - that means the fracture is going to grow parallel to the layers.
 |Although no formation of rock in nature is homogeneous, for our purposes we will assume it is. You will notice that on either side of our target layer, we are bounded by rock that looks significantly different. There are two mechanical properties of rock we are concerned about when it comes to fracturing: Young's Modulus and Poisson's Ratio. Basically how stiff our rock is, and how much flex it has. So we have a layer of rock, our target zone, with a certain YM and PR bounded by rock on either side with a different YM and PR.
 |So we pressure up on the rock next to his hand, overcome the minimum stress and the rock parts. Now how much of the rock parts is dependent upon how much pressure over the minimum we exerted. If it took 1,000 psi to open the rock and I applied 1,001 my fracture will grow less than if I applied 2,000 psi. This concept of pressure greater than my minimum pressure required to open my fracture is called 'net pressure'. This is the energy that will be used to grow my frac. Let's say I have one gallon of fluid and I pressure up on my rock with a minimum stress of 1,000 to 1,001 psi and my fracture initiates. As soon as I create enough space for that 1 psi to dissipate into, my fracture will quit growing. In order to keep growing my fracture I must continuously inject into it.
 |So back to our photo. I initiated my fracture, and will continuously inject into the formation to keep a net pressure of 100 psi. My fracture begins to grow both out and up. At some point, it will reach the upper and lower boundaries. Because of the varying mechanical properties, the pressure required to grow a frac in those layers may be 2,000 instead of 1,000 psi and the fracture will no longer grow vertically. Sure, the layers could be less than 1,000 psi but I will eventually hit something above and below that will be too hard to breakdown with my 1,000 psi. My frac will quit growing in height.
 |The point is that the same impermeable layers that have kept the oil/gas from migrating upwards all these years, can also contain my fracture. We know what our layers are all the way from surface to our target zone, and are capable of using tools to log across these zones during drilling and obtain these rock properties. There are mathematical models (models are not the end all be all though, question anyone who tells you they are) which can be used to predict fracture geometry to an extent.

1owf2m,1,2013-10-21,Understanding Education Leadership,mohangohade,news,https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/1owf2m/understanding_education_leadership/,"There are many who claim to be leading education service providers specialize in offering unique programs for those aspiring to build bright careers. In fact, it is these claims that lead to a mad rush during admissions to MBA.  Claiming to be the best business school and being unable to offer a business management degree that justifies this stance, is often a case of betrayal that students face in several management colleges. The MBA in India has evolved from being just an extension of graduation programs to the much coveted management degree that allows students to realize their dreams of making big careers. However, in this long history of evolution it is a challenging task to find those who have truly established their legacy of education leadership. This becomes an even more challenging role when you shift focus to a relatively niche degree like the MBA IT Specialization. 
In fact, this concern is replicated in the industry as well. When Steve jobs started his career, people questioned his qualification and abilities. Today, he is almost a demigod for anyone who is an IT fan. His thought leadership was not the result of an overnight transformation. It takes effort, dedication and a lot of hard work even for management colleges to prove their education leadership. By claiming to be education leaders, the management colleges promise students an academic infrastructure that is at par with world class academic training. In fact, for niche programs like MBA IT specialization, the education leadership for management colleges can be established only by proving their mettle in terms of giving students internship opportunities and features like project management training. After all, it is these features that are pivotal to a student’s differentiation in the regular IT crowd. 
Now that we have told you about the various parameters that go into deciding the education leadership of even the best business school, ask yourself how many of the candidates actually fulfill these criteria? There are many PGDM colleges in Pune but how many of them are able to justify their claim of providing proper academic training and industry exposure. When you start this probe, you will realize how the PGDM in pune is a very generic search and is rarely able to give the student an opportunity to realize their dream. However, the situation is not all that grim. There are colleges like Symbiosis Center for Information Technology located in the IT hub of Pune that have been silently continuing their pursuit of academic excellence by providing world class academic training to the MBA IT specialization students. 
Yes! SCIT is recognized as one of the best business schools in the country for the IT specialization. In fact, recently SCIT was recognized for its pioneering contribution when it received the Dainik Bhaskar National Education Leadership Award. This is an addition to the existing list of accolades that SCIT has earned in its pursuit of academic excellence. So, if you think that the MBA In IT is your call than SCIT can be your golden ticket to transform your future. http://www.scit.edu

[Bands Website](http://anamanaguchi.com/)

Info about [Anamanaguchi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anamanaguchi):

Anamanaguchi is an American chiptune rock band from New York City, that ""makes loud, fast music with a NES from 1985."" The band has four members: lead songwriter and guitarist Peter Berkman, bassist James DeVito, guitarist Ary Warnaar and drummer Luke Silas.

The name ""Anamanaguchi"" came about from a member in one of Berkman's former bands pronouncing gibberish in the style of Jabba the Hutt; the band has also explained it as coming from the members' internships at Armani (Berkman and DeVito), Prada (Warnaar), and Gucci (Silas) while studying fashion at Parsons School of Design, though three of the four majored in Music Technology at New York University.

Like other chiptune artists, Anamanaguchi creates music using video game hardware from the mid-to-late 1980s: namely an NES and a Game Boy. Berkman has stated that their music isn't just based around video game music and that much of it is inspired by ""[s]imple pop stuff, like Weezer and the Beach Boys.""

The band composed music for the video game adaptation of the Scott Pilgrim graphic novels, Scott Pilgrim vs. the World: The Game. The soundtrack for the game was released on Amazon and iTunes by ABKCO Records on August 24, 2010. The soundtrack debuted at No. 3 on Billboard's Heatseekers chart (aka Soundscan's New Artist Chart). Two tracks from Dawn Metropolis (""Blackout City"" and ""Mermaid"") were also used for the Bit.Trip Runner soundtrack. In October 2010 it was announced that Anamanaguchi would appear in the music video game, Rock Band, with the track ""Airbrushed"". The band's song ""Jetpack Blues, Sunset Hues"" is the current theme to Chris Hardwick's The Nerdist Podcast. Anamanaguchi's second LP Endless Fantasy came out on May 14, 2013 and debuted at No. 1 on the aforementioned Heatseekers chart. 

On May 3, 2013, Anamanaguchi provided a Kickstarter project for their album Endless Fantasy. In just 11 hours, their funding goal of $50,000 was reached. At the end of its run, the project was backed by 7,253 people who contributed to raising a grand total of $277,399, making it the second most-successful music project to be funded on Kickstarter at the time, behind that of singer Amanda Palmer.

1ow3xs,9,2013-10-21,College graudate: what do i do?,confusedinlife55115,needadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/1ow3xs/college_graudate_what_do_i_do/,"Hello Reddit,

Long time lurker and first time poster. I recently graduated from a well-known university with a management science degree (a lot of economic classes with emphasis in math, microeconomics, econometrics, etc.).

It has been about 5-6 months since I graduated and I really don't know what to do with my life. I realized that I don't know anything of the real world and that I don't have the business personality and mindset that so many people in my major seem to have. Along with that, I have no experience with internships or anything of the sort. I was just that college student that took classes and did nothing else but do general club activities, drink and game.

I feel like I made a wrong choice in my major and that I should go back to school (looking into a computer science degree as I am interested in the subject and the job opportunities that are open with it). Even though I have no idea on how to do such a thing.
What I'm wondering about is this. Is it smart to go back to school to get another bachelor's or should I just try to keep finding jobs in my major? Also, to those that say I should go back to school, should I go back to my old university (where I would have to pay an arm and a leg for) or is an associates good enough for this field?

Sorry if this seems like a ""I need help, please give me all the answers with no work on my part"" type of question. I have just been extremely depressed for the past month as I took an extra year to graduate with this major after switching from a science and all of my friends seem to have moved on to the next stage of their lives.

P.S: If neither of the questions seem like a good idea, any answer would be great. I just feel like my glass was shattered when I finally left school. Finding out I don't really like my major, and with no classes to take, I feel like I can do anything; however, I just don't want to make the another mistake (such as switching from science to management science without really thinking about it).

TLDR: Depressed college graduate with a BS in Management Science wondering if to go back to school for a Bachelor's in Computer science. yay or nay?"
1ovw8y,1,2013-10-21,I don't want to go home,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1ovw8y/i_dont_want_to_go_home/,"This is probably the wrong subreddit, but I've been in this community for awhile (this is a throwaway) so I don't know a better place to turn to.

I'm a Junior in college right now, and I know I dont have real problems like a lot of other people here, but I do want to vent.

I'm supposed to go home in November for thanksgiving and that's okay, but after that I'm supposed to go home for two months in the winter and I just don't want to. I want to stay here or I want to go somewhere else. I feel like I'm drawn home by default because there's no better option. I wish there was; I wish I had a good plan to get out and experience something completely unfamiliar, but I don't. I have an internship and class and then I go home, but I want to have something else that keeps me here, or puts me somewhere new.

I know what's waiting for me at home. It's not bad by any means. I'll hang out with all my friends from the first 20 years of my life. I'll spend christmas with my family. I'll have awkward encounters with my ex-gf, and I'll go to bed at 4am every night and wake up at noon. I'll have some great times and then I'll come back here and wait until the summer where hopefully I'll stay and work. 

But I don't want that and I'm worried that things are taking me in that direction. I don't want to go back to New York City, I want to start my own life. I just have no idea how to start. I know my parents would probably support me if I had a good plan, but I don't.

I want to remove myself before I'm the last person asking where everyone else went. I want to leave before everyone leaves me. Fuck, I don't want this to be about anybody, but I don't want to be bailed on once I'm not an everyday aspect of someone's life. I don't want to let anybody treat me like my ex-gf and my best friend have been.

I need a fucking plan to bust out and really drop off of everyone's radar for awhile. Learn about who I am and who I can be. Sorry for the rant."

[A month ago, this stupid chick started stalking my boyfriend.](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1ml1ou/can_this_be_considered_stalking/) She got his number from their mutual friend, she texted him and called him, he tried to convince her to fuck off and even told her that he's engaged (he isn't, but she doesn't have to know, now does she?), but she just didn't care, because we're in a long distance relationship and she believe she could make him happier than I do.

He didn't go to college once and she texted him asking if he didn't, and if not, then she'd get a ride back to his place. He never answered.. then she showed up at his place. She walked around outside the buildings, called him, he ignored. She left after he told her he'd call the police if she didn't fuck off, and she texted him, ""i like you, im capable of sacrificing myself for u""

She eventually stopped calling and texting, as far as I know. She still tried to talk to him while he was at college but he ignored her.

Until tonight. She got a friend to text him asking why he wasn't talking to her.

I'm getting more than fed up with this, I thought she was finally done being a crazy bitch but apparently not.

He didn't want to get a restraining order before because he was supposed to come here (NC, he's in Puerto Rico) for his internship but that didn't work out. He doesn't think he can get one now because she hasn't done anything lately.

What the hell should he do?"

I know these posts get old, but I don't have a bunch of time to research my best options so I wanted to ask for some help. I'm looking to get the most bang for my buck, but I'll toss out a 'soft' limit of $1700. 

I do know the benefits of solid state over HDD, but if you're going to advocate that, could you at least give me an idea of what to do with a pretty big stash of movies/music I have?

My requirements:

-A Windows partition to learn VisualBasic on for an upcoming internship.

-MatLab

-A suite of CAD programs

I use Spotify a lot, so I guess that could help with the music issue. Then it becomes an issue of the TV shows and movies I have. I don't think I'll run in to hard drive space with the technical stuff I'll be doing on my laptop as code takes up hardly any space.

rMBP? old cMBP? Any engineers here that can chime in?

1p0g9k,3,2013-10-22,"Recent grad, unhappy at current job, Should I stick it out?",givemecsadvice,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1p0g9k/recent_grad_unhappy_at_current_job_should_i_stick/,"I was an intern at my current company for about a year and they offered me a software development position on a different team when I graduated. It's been a few months now and I'm feeling pretty unhappy at my current job. 

I hate to say it but most of all, I dislike my team. There is no team chemistry at all. Everyone does their own work, they rarely socialize with each other and cooperating on work related stuff is at a minimum. I'm also the only recent grad. Everyone else is a Senior Developer and there is very little mentoring, which is a big departure from my old team. I have reached out on many occasions but most of the time I get the sense that they do not want to take the time to help. I'm not asking anyone to hold my hand but at the same time, I do not feel like I'm benefiting from working with a team of Senior Developers. 

I also dislike the product. I have learned to use it but nothing outside of work compels me to use it. 

All of this has drained all of my motivation. While I had less free time when I was in school and working as an intern, I still found time to do a little extra programming on the side, just for fun or self-improvement. Now, when I get home I want to do nothing but watch TV, eat, and maybe exercise before I head to bed.

On the bright side, pay is competitive with good work-life balance but like I said above, I no longer have the motivation outside of work to program.

Should I stick it out for a year or try to jump to a different company right away?"
1p0b4e,97,2013-10-22,71 days: Life is Incredible,radman11,NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/1p0b4e/71_days_life_is_incredible/,"Let me first give thanks to this awesome community. Just knowing you are not alone brings so much motivation and commitment to excel. Now let me share with you my personal changes and success over the past 8 months.


Background info (you can skip this if you want): I am a 20 year old full time college student. I began NoFap in March of this year and it took me five months before I was able to get past those first two weeks of NoFap. I have come a long ways, relapses for me were often but now I will never go back.


**My success**


* Right now I am doing the best I ever have in school. I have an increase in energy, concentration and a strong drive for success. My mind is clear and I feel fully in control of my life.


* I have been LIVING. By that I mean I have been going out and enjoying new experiences. I have picked up new hobbies such as skateboarding, longboarding, flirting with new girls, working out, meeting new people, going out to concerts and other events. I use to avoid social situations as much as possible, but now I genuinely enjoy surrounding myself with new people.


* I have improved myself, achieved a true sense of happiness and set incredible goals for my future. Last week I landed a highly competitive internship for this upcoming summer. Without having the mindset I have now, there is not the slightest chance I would have been able to do so. I got the internship entirely through networking, which was the result of surrounding myself with new people.


* During all this I have started a small business. I would consider it more of a hobby, but it is my sole source of income as of right now. It's a great feeling being able to support yourself, especially when your parents are struggling financially.


* This brings me to my final point, sex. **My ED is completely gone** and I have enjoyed intimate encounters with beautiful women of different types. This is what we all started for, and I can tell you that YES this is the cure.


I am truly living for the first time in my life. I am full of happiness and energy. I bring others up with me as much as I can. I have stopped smoking weed (previous daily smoker), improved my health and physical attractiveness. I have made more friends in the past three months than I have in my entire life, especially lady friends ;)


With that being said, I hope this motivates you to stick to your goal. KEEP GOING NEVER GIVE UP. Remember, it took me five months before I passed day 14. The moment I did I told myself I would never go back. I am now on day 71. I would consider myself fully recovered and in the best physical and mental health of my life.



One of my favorite quotes that would keep me going: ""If you can dream it, you can do it."" - Walt Disney.


Best of luck to you all!"

Official league games will start on the weekend of November 23rd. Coordinators should finalize recruiting their teams and rosters for their Division 1 teams and Division 2 teams. Be sure that each member of your team has a valid university email address to be verified as a student. Any exceptions to registration will be handled on a case by case basis and should be submitted to admin@cstarleague.com. Teams are expected to commit to the entire season of games, and some teams may be penalized if they forfeit excessively after registering for the league.

Teams will be sorted into groups determined by their region (we will do our best to accommodate). Games will be played once a week over the course of the season, and the top teams in each group will advance to the playoff bracket which will be played through the final portion of the season. Number of groups and who advances will be determined by the number of teams that register for each game.

We are aiming to have the CSL Finals be played live at the end of May, or in June, pending venue availability and locations!

**Regional LANs**

Yes! Regional LAN events are back! We have two Regional LANs lined up for this season.
*Late January, 2014* - West Coast Regional @ San Jose State University
*Early March, 2014* - East Coast Regional @ University of Maryland, College Park
We'll be announcing exact details in the next month or two for how you can register to attend, prize information, and stipend applications.

**FAQ**

*What's new this season?* We'll be offering **Division 1** and **Division 2** play. Division 1 will be for teams who are more competitive, Division 2 will be for casual play. The choice to enter Division 1 is voluntary, there will be no up-downs, or anything of the sort. Anyone who wants to field a competitive team can do so. Teams can have both a Division 1 and Division 2 team in the league (players can't swap between teams)!
*What are scrims?* Think 1 match a week of collegiate action isn't enough for you? We can solve your problem! You will be able to challenge any team to a scrimmage (either ranked or unranked) to get your fix. Ranked scrims will count for a team's ELO and may qualify teams for additional tournaments and prizes. Unranked are purely for fun - teams can also have some flexibility in choosing their own formats.

*What's taking so long?* We're trying to build a website that doesn't exist anywhere in eSports. We're not running off a template - everything on our site is custom built, and specially designed. The scope of the project is pretty large, and unfortunately, we lack the funds to pay a development team to work full time. Our dev team consists of two interns who are also full time students and have to balance their work on the CSL website with their own school and work. This means that we haven't been able to finish as quickly as expected - but we are working hard! If you are an experienced Ruby developer looking for an internship or interesting career opportunity - please email duran@cstarleague.com for info!

*What's the prize pool?* CSL is no longer working under a corporate entity (Azubu), and as such, will be funding the season ourselves. This means we are currently raising money to host all the events and fund all the prizes that we can. When we have funding confirmed, we will announce prizes for the year. Currently, we have earmarked budgets for each of the Regional LAN events and are looking for sponsors to be able to fund a live finals and prize pool for the season. Stay tuned for more updates as 2014 rolls around. We won't announce anything until we have the funds fully confirmed because we want to avoid the headache of delayed prize payouts and uncertainty.

Please note, our goal here is transparency. We want to be honest with the community about where we stand, what we're doing, and what we want to contribute to the community. We hope that this will be the best year yet for CSL and our amazing staff will be working hard to put on a show for everyone.

Stay tuned to our social media channels and website for updates on the process and stand by with your teams.

I am in the third year of a four year degree in a technical field. I feel a year out from college would make a lot of sense for me, but I don't want to do it unless I have something lined up. I am looking for internships at the moment for the summer as I have not done one before now, and I don't want to put that in jeopardy by making myself look bad. Do you think what I want to do is realistic? I am an average student, my grades are not amazing but not horrible either. Should I apply for graduate positions and include a cover letter?  If somewhere will take me, even if it is unpaid I would take it in a heartbeat, but I don't want to undersell myself either. I really want to make this happen for next year, does anyone have any advice?"
1p02xd,0,2013-10-22,"Hello, /r/Accounting! Graduating Senior seeking post graduate advice",hrunge,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/1p02xd/hello_raccounting_graduating_senior_seeking_post/,"My dilemma began with interviewing with a small yet lucrative CPA/Consulting firm here in FL for a full time gig after graduating in this December, and after completing various assessments based on personality, excel, quickbooks, and basic accounting knowledge, luncheons and after a weekend excursion they decided to hire me on with one condition- I needed to be more confident.

As my first day began, I completed compilations for quarter year financials, sent checks within QuickBooks, filed both corporate and personal tax returns and asked as many questions as I could to further gain insight into the field. They were really big on asking questsion- ""You can't get fired for asking questions"" is their working motto...

After three weeks of 'interning' I was let go due to lack of experience. Throughout the interview process they picked my brain and asked me as many questions as they could and I was honest with them about my lack of practical experience, but they seemed all about personality. I was devasted when they told me the news. And whilst beginning what I thought was my real, post-graduate career I missed a HUGE (I cannot stress this enough) Career Fair at my University where all the major firms were set up. This being said I missed all networking opportunities and did not apply to these firms on the school's career website.

So here I am, 2 months until graduation, with three internships under my belt with a 3.1/4 dual major in Accounting and Finance, and it looks as if I have no hope to score any type of internship or entry-level position with a Big 4 firm or any larger regional firms in my area.

I applied online to Deloitte, with the hopes of writing a large essay in the Additional Information section this could help me score some points with the reviewer, but that is where I currently set.

Reddit, do I have any hope pursuing a full-time gig with the top companies, or should I focus on the CPA or MST and stay in academics for a year longer? 
I am in knots about this. I hope you great people can provide some hope and insight!

TL;DR: /b/ lost potential career opportunity two months before graduation. Missed all networking possibilities this recruiting season 


Thanks again,

1ozzo8,4,2013-10-22,"First (proper) job... er, what the heck is going on?",[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1ozzo8/first_proper_job_er_what_the_heck_is_going_on/,"Ok, so a little about me first, I’m a computer science graduate, I did pretty well in my degree (not boasting just adding some context) and I’ve been programming since childhood, I feel I’m pretty good at what I do although I realize I’m just starting out in my career. I’ve recently finished a 6-month internship as software engineer on a project at a university where I used Java, PHP, JavaScript and MySQL amongst others, I feel I did pretty well and got good feedback. Now I’ve just started my first proper job, my first day went well, I met everyone in the office and a co-worker helped me install everything on my machine, it was a bit of a blur, my line manager was busy all day and I barely saw him but I was busy setting up my machine anyway, I should mention at this point that I’ve had no introduction to the tools I’ll be using, the projects I’ll be working on, who the projects are for, the deadlines, the timescales etc etc.

Also, this company uses C#, ASP.net, MS SQL, none of which I have used in previous jobs, obviously I realize C# and Java are very similar but I haven’t had any time to brush up before I started this job. So my second day comes along and I assume I’ll get some time with my line manager and some sort of introduction to the job, I tell him my machine is set up and he gives me a task to do, he emails me the task and his request is one sentence long and extremely vague and requires me to update a tool (which is a very small part of the very large project) that the previous guy wrote and no one else knows anything about. My line manager then leaves me at my desk, I try my best to get going with it but really struggle, no one has told me how to access the database (which contains tonnes of data, various logins, groups etc) which I need to do to complete the task, how to run or compile the main project (which is made up of 100s of smaller projects which have to be configured a certain way and there are also different versions of each project and no indication of which to use).

I occasionally asked the guy working next to me for help and he was very helpful and friendly, but he was also busy with his own work and I sometimes got the feeling that he thought I should know the things he showed me even though I feel there was no way I could have known (e.g. I asked about how to login into the database and he listed a username and password from memory, both were about 12 characters long and made up of seemingly random letters and numbers, how was I supposed to know this?). I should also mentioned that this is an entry-level position and I did not lie or exaggerate during the recruitment process, I even completed a test which I felt (and was told) I did well on. Anyway, long story short, I was wondering what should I do tomorrow, I don’t want to struggle on in silence trying to finish a task I feel I am ill-equipped to tackle but at the same time I don’t want to seem whiny or incompetent by asking for at least a basic introduction to the job and set-up."
1ozzi0,19,2013-10-22,"I fear I may be digging myself a deeper hole by chasing my dreams, am i crazy?",whattodo01,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1ozzi0/i_fear_i_may_be_digging_myself_a_deeper_hole_by/,"I'm not sure if this is the right sub reddit to post this, just need advice.

This December I plan to quit my job, finally take some solid time off for once, travel back to London to see my girlfriend, and also achieve my dreams by interning in one of the worlds best restaurants.  I already had a taste of it not too long ago, built the connection, now I am OK'd to go back and continue for how ever long I want.  This is both beneficial to me, and my resume/CV.

The thing is, I don't have much time to save up for it to really make a good impact.  The longer I stay working, the better it'll be.  I'll only have  around $2900 after money is spent on the ticket, some of that has to go to my hostel lodging which will be the cheapest, anywhere from $4-600.  

I'll also need some money reserved for when I get back, since I'll need a job once I return.  I plan to be free in the summer when the girlfriend comes to visit, which I'll need money for, as soon as she leaves after two months I've planned another internship that's an 8 month commitment in another worlds best restaurant in Spain.  

How do I go about achieving this with such limited funds?  I'm afraid I'll have to sell some things, maybe my father may be able to help but I'm not counting on it.  I'm 25 in May, is this time to pull out my first loan to be able to accomplish my dreams for my career? A lot of accomplished Chefs say it's better to pull out a loan to do exactly what I'm doing rather than 40,000 to go to a culinary school that doesn't matter.  My moms credit isn't too hot, I don't think she'd co sign.  My father has never been in my life until I went to internship a few months back, he helped out with that.  So I doubt he'd co sign either.  

I'm kind of lost, but I need this.  It's time.  I can't be interning when I'm a couple years older.  Especially if I plan to propose to my girlfriend in the year coming, and by the time a couple years passes, I'll need solid income coming in to be able to pay for all the visa processing fees. 

I bet you're thinking to just not quit my job, and cancel on this? What are my options do you think? I'd appreciate any input!

We'll be announcing exact details in the next month or two for how you can register to attend, prize information, and stipend applications. 


**FAQ**


*What's new this season?* We'll be offering **Division 1** and **Division 2** play. Division 1 will be for teams who are more competitive, Division 2 will be for casual play. The choice to enter Division 1 is voluntary, there will be no up-downs, or anything of the sort. Anyone who wants to field a competitive team can do so. Teams can have both a Division 1 and Division 2 team in the league (players can't swap between teams)! 


*What are scrims?* Think 1 match a week of collegiate action isn't enough for you? We can solve your problem! You will be able to challenge any team to a scrimmage (either ranked or unranked) to get your fix. Ranked scrims will count for a team's ELO and may qualify teams for additional tournaments and prizes. Unranked are purely for fun - teams can also have some flexibility in choosing their own formats. 


*What's taking so long?* We're trying to build a website that doesn't exist anywhere in eSports. We're not running off a template - everything on our site is custom built, and specially designed. The scope of the project is pretty large, and unfortunately, we lack the funds to pay a development team to work full time. Our dev team consists of two interns who are also full time students and have to balance their work on the CSL website with their own school and work. This means that we haven't been able to finish as quickly as expected - but we are working hard! If you are an experienced Ruby developer looking for an internship or interesting career opportunity - please email duran@cstarleague.com for info! 


*What's the prize pool?* CSL is no longer working under a corporate entity (Azubu), and as such, will be funding the season ourselves. This means we are currently raising money to host all the events and fund all the prizes that we can. When we have funding confirmed, we will announce prizes for the year. Currently, we have earmarked budgets for each of the Regional LAN events and are looking for sponsors to be able to fund a live finals and prize pool for the season. Stay tuned for more updates as 2014 rolls around. We won't announce anything until we have the funds fully confirmed because we want to avoid the headache of delayed prize payouts and uncertainty. 


Please note, our goal here is transparency. We want to be honest with the community about where we stand, what we're doing, and what we want to contribute to the community. We hope that this will be the best year yet for CSL and our amazing staff will be working hard to put on a show for everyone. 


Stay tuned to our social media channels and website for updates on the process and stand by with your teams.

1ozvzv,2,2013-10-22,Finally landed my first internship interview tomorrow! Tips?,the_regex,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1ozvzv/finally_landed_my_first_internship_interview/,"Today I got a call from Western Digital to interview for an internship.

I'm finishing up my lower division courses next semester, as a CS major. 

Over the phone, they asked me if I knew C++ or any other languages. I said I took an intro course on C++ and am delving deeper into Java, and she said that is good because they need students with familiarity of programming languages.

I'm so excited, especially because I'm a huge fan of WD harddrives as well. Also they are offering $17/hour which gives me reason to quit my current job that I despise.

Any general advice? Do you guys think they will ask me programming questions? I know I should dress well/conservative, keep eye contact, firm handshake, smile and all those interview basics."
1ozt3y,43,2013-10-22,CSL Registration Begins November 2nd!,cstarleague,starcraft,https://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/1ozt3y/csl_registration_begins_november_2nd/,"Registration for the Collegiate Starleague will be open on November 2nd for StarCraft 2, League of Legends, and Dota 2. Official league games will start on the weekend of November 23rd. Coordinators should finalize recruiting their teams and rosters for their Division 1 teams and Division 2 teams. Be sure that each member of your team has a valid university email address to be verified as a student. Any exceptions to registration will be handled on a case by case basis and should be submitted to admin@cstarleague.com. Teams are expected to commit to the entire season of games, and some teams may be penalized if they forfeit excessively after registering for the league. 


Teams will be sorted into groups determined by their region (we will do our best to accommodate). Games will be played once a week over the course of the season, and the top teams in each group will advance to the playoff bracket which will be played through the final portion of the season. Number of groups and who advances will be determined by the number of teams that register for each game.

One intern is very competent and knowledgeable.  Intern 2 is not.  

His computer competencies, in his words ""well, I have a computer at home and set it up and plugged it in and it turned on and stuff.""

Let me say that HR did the hiring, not the IT department.

Today he had a shining moment.  A user calls.  User cannot access his contacts in Lotus Notes.  When he clicks on ""contacts,"" an error pops up that says ""Cannot load contacts due to disk read error.""

Intern 2 turns to me and says, ""What is this?  I asked if he had a CD in but he said he didn't...""

Cue another in a long line of facepalms for me."
1ozju8,2,2013-10-22,"I think unpaid internships are mere idiocy by the ""interns"" and that they need to look no farther than a mirror to assign blame. CMV",[deleted],changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1ozju8/i_think_unpaid_internships_are_mere_idiocy_by_the/,"I'm a senior graduating from college this year with a degree in computer science.  I've never had an unpaid internship.  I've never even had a ""real"" internship - I basically worked at summer camps for the fun of it during the summer.  I have multiple job offers at high salaries from top companies.

1. Unpaid internships are often in fields where there are more people looking for jobs than jobs.  Many many many more people.  To be honest, you should have studied something else in college.

2. Unpaid internships really don't mean shit on your resume unless they are from one of the very top employers in your field.  Seriously, your academics achievements and your interviews are SO SO SO SO much more important.

3. When you accept unpaid internships, you sometimes take a job away from a paid employee.  You're 20 year old self creates the problems you have at 25.

In short, this is my rant.  Just stop taking unpaid internships.  Value your last few summers before having a real job and do something fun like camp."

I'm just unsure what type of projects I should do. I am currently into game development and am using Pygame to make my first game, but I don't want to go into game development when I graduate. I'm having fun learning but I feel like it's a waste of time and that employers will see it as irrelevant.

I also don't have the skills to make huge projects. I'm only currently in an intro to Python programming class. I enjoy programming though and do it in my free time. I feel like that if I make an program it will seem trivial to employers. I'm currently working on a GPA program.

I've been trying to learn web development but I always get bored and quit because I'm not making anything of use to me and just following examples.

So do you just suggest that I do projects that seem fun and are useful to me or should I do difficult projects that will impress employers?"
1ozhj3,1,2013-10-22,Any direction seems hopeless.,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1ozhj3/any_direction_seems_hopeless/,"My position is in no way life threatening. However, let me just vent.

I am in school for a second bachelors, but I am slowly failing out.

My last degree was in animation, but I never went further because the options were either get further away from actual animation for take yet another internship. 

Lastly, while at university, I also studied abroad, fell for a broad, and now she is teaching in Japan. All I can think about is how to get over there. We are just friends, but I fell for the country as well. There are programs I can go for. 

Currently, I am doing a programming project last minute.
Let me just add that I hate my college. Being a freshman for a second time may seem like joy to others, but I don't want to be messing with kids. Even though, I am a pretty much a kid myself. 

So I guess the question is, ""Where should a mid twenties student go to find some peace of mind?""

So far, I think I am done with education even though it is mid semester."
1oz26x,7,2013-10-22,"I am a fresh postgrad based in Kent, UK. I am confused about what I want to do with my life, afraid of the future, I don't know what job I want to do (never really knew), I don't have any relevant experiences on my CV and generally I am starting to feel depressed because of this...",[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1oz26x/i_am_a_fresh_postgrad_based_in_kent_uk_i_am/,"Sorry for the wall of text, but I feel I really need to get this off my chest and this sub has it in its name so...


I feel an incredible confusion, a mixture of feelings, fear and uncertainty... I don't know what to do. I might be writing this in a non-chronological order as my mind is currently flying around the place... It is raining outside, I am sitting here, writing this, listening to some music and I have to remark, I did not cry for some time... I believe I did not cry for a year, but now I am....

This month, I graduated and obtained my Masters degree at the University of Kent in American Studies. My bachelor's degree is from History with International relations. I have always lacked this kind of force which would drive me forward towards something concrete I would like to do. This was going on I think since primary school. At the end when we had to choose the direction of our secondary education/college (this was in the different country - I came to the UK for my university studies). I did not know what direction to go so I took a generally aimed course of study, doing a bit of everything, which would in the end provided me with more time while I discover what I'd like to do. Apart from classic teenage thoughts of doing this and that (never really a good idea when you only think you know how the world works, but you actually don't), the feeling of being certain in doing something concrete, having a strong interest in something I like, it has never come to me. Thus I have learned the truth, that is, I don't know what to do with my life really. I always liked History stuff, so I wanted to study history. My father rightly told me to take something else with it, so I decided for International relations as well. I liked what I was doing, the course was really interesting and I actually enjoyed it for the most part. In the third year of my undergrad I discovered a hidden interest for Cuba and Latin American affairs... The overall American reality got me hooked and based on it, as I again had to make that decision what to do. I have decided for American Studies to be able to explore further the realities of the Americas, mostly Cuban - US relations, and the historical perspective of Latin America.... Also I did not want to continue directly in political sciences because of all that theory. This probably is not even important, sorry for writing it... 


The point is, I am confused and scared, afraid of what is to come... I am trying to think about my possibilities and what I want to do in the future. I know for certain that I want to stay in the UK cos I love the country, the culture, the people and almost everything about the UK. I always had.. that also was the reason why I chose to come here for studies. This is not a problem though, as I can legally stay as long as I want (EU stuff), at least for now...

Throughout my studies and even before, I was always very introverted, quiet and shy out of my comfort zone. The UK studies were not an exception. When I came, the first year, I have barely came out of my room and did not talk when I did not have to. I don't know why, I am not like that anymore, I have changed and thoughts about this make me sad as I know I have missed a lot probably. This was better in the second year, although not perfect at all as well. You see, the problem is that because of this, simultaneously with perhaps meeting new friends, I have also missed the opportunities to socialize and get a job back then, to volunteer, being a part of some student entrepreneur groups and so on... This is what makes me desperate the most, the stupidity of this. 


Eventually, during the third year, I started to speak with more and more people, my English has improved substantially, I have became a volunteer for London 2012 Olympic ceremonies, and got a proper part-time job as a cleaner. I have this job till now, in August after a series of rounds in an interview I managed to be able to switch to full-time. I also have to mention that I managed to have some small jobs like Christmas casual in 2010 as a till assistant, and in 2011 in Royal Mail as a mail sorter. These things lasted from one to two weeks respectively. Not that much experience gotten from them. 

I was always handing around some CVs in town when I could before I found the work as a cleaner... no that I did not try. I don't know I tried to do my best, not having an experience on the CV and maybe those people in the shops knew I am not confident. I tried to look like that but, somehow they might have seen through me... but I tried.


I think I live in an unhealthy environment as well. I live with people I can consider friends and good friends both... Mostly colleagues from work actually. One my supervisor... the point is, they are all older then me, I am 24 and they are all 29 and more. They don't have any goals in life as it seems... They just go to work, earn money and live on. I don't want to do that... I want to do something, I just want an opportunity to be able to achieve something. I just don't know what to do... It is all so confusing... looking through those jobs, opportunities, volunteerings internships, there is always something what makes me unsuitable or some restrictions I have like some good stuff appears but it is located too far for me to be able to go there. I am afraid to just go and risk everything for an opportunity I don't know THAT much about. I need my job, I need to support myself, and it took me almost three years to find an income. I don't want to lose it again, especially when I see how stupidly hard it is to get even volunteering.... I have applied for an offer on a page offering volunteerings and they wrote me back that I need SKILLS and EXPERIENCE to be able to even register with them. How the fuck am I supposed to get an experience when I need some even for a volunteering???


How can I get out of this vicious circle? I have already caused too much pain to my parents because of my recklessness and despite them always supporting me, I cannot ask them for any financial support because of my stupidity couple of years ago... It pains me so much because I have to give them the money they spent on me previously back, but for that I need a good job and an opportunity to earn money but I don't see how now... 


Because of this I have decided to do this... to keep the job I have now no matter how much money it brings (around £1000) and at the same time, to try to get a volunteering or an internship and earn money while improving my CV... The job starts in the evenings, at 5pm, so I have all mornings and afternoons to do something else. That was the plan when I applied for a full-time position there. So I am constrained to this place, I need money to survive but as it seems, it does not provide me with opportunities to improve chances for a better living. I want to buy a cheap car to be more mobile and increase chances to find some opportunities... but I don't really have money for it either.. I need to save as much as possible. 

That is also a plan. To save as much as I can and then try to move somewhere else, bigger place, maybe Brighton or something where I can do something... but still? Is this the right way out? To do the same in the bigger city? I want to be able to get experiences now... and then move somewhere bigger already with them on the paper and get a proper entry level job there... 

Speaking about Brighton, I believe that was the kicker... you see, this past weekend I went there to visit my friend who studies there. I loved the place and for some reason it has opened my eyes in terms of handling my life. I realised how stuck I am here and that I need to do something immediately to improve it... 

That's how I really got into this mess. I planned to look for internships or volunteering for a long time and did start even before going to Brighton, but it really struck me in the face for some reason... I don't know what to do, I want an experience to be able to experience my life... 

In the past I have been doing summer jobs since 2007. I have also managed to organise several student parties with various themes with my friends... I have organisational experiences and many other skills, and I have no problem adapting to new environments anymore... I actually never had... I just had one problem, that was being shy, but I am not anymore... and with this, all other problems disappeared. I know I can handle almost any kind of work when properly instructed about it... When I know what is expected from me to do, I'll do my best to do it... but these things don't seem to bother any of those ""potential employers"".... 

I actually realised this random rant helped me to feel slightly better... not that I am actually better now or anything... I just don't cry anymore... cos my eyes hurt... and my head as well... Maybe I'll do something more productive tomorrow... but time is getting short and I need to find something soon.... I don't want to lose any more time.... I need experiences and get on with my life to be able to fix things, to experience things, to return favours and to be able to live as free-spirited person who wants to explore the world...


One of my dreams is to go and visit Latin America and Cuba... to travel around the continent, seeing places, meeting people, to help in communities, to engage and to know the harsh realities of life there... These petty problems I have are nothing compare to those in there... but to be even able to reach to such places I need to overcome these and to save enough money to get me there.... I hope I will be able to do that... sometimes... 


Please, if you know anybody about something which might help me out of this mess, please let me know... I'd be forever thankful.... Any opportunities in East Kent....

I don't know whether anyone will be interested in what I wrote that much that they will get up to this point... but if yes, thanks stranger for hearing me out... "
1oz03e,4,2013-10-22,Looking for c/c++ library capable of scanning header files,asxa86,cpp_questions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp_questions/comments/1oz03e/looking_for_cc_library_capable_of_scanning_header/,"Hello,

I was hoping someone could point me in the direction of a c/c++ library that is capable of parsing a c++ header file into a data structure.

My end goal is to write a program that scans my teams' project directory for every header file and parse out the setters and getters for each class.

Then write unit tests for each class using the parsed setters and getters.


Edit: Adding more detail.

Lets say my teams' solution consists of 70+ project which have over 200 classes (probably a lot more).  Instead of going through and writing up a CMakeList.txt for each project and then writing a *test.cpp file for each class and then inside that test file creating the object to test every set and get for the class...

I will have a program that will scan every class, check if it has any pairs of sets + gets, and then generate an autogen.test.cpp file for the project that will contain a test block for each class that belongs to the project.

I'm almost done with this project.  I'm able to parse out the sets and gets and such but it's not pretty. 
Was just hoping for a library where someone has already solved this problem and I can just load a data structure with the parsed data and access the functions i want to test.

Also,  i am an intern at this company currently and don't have a choice on whether this is a waste of time or not.  
Boss says write a program that generates unit tests for sets and gets.  Boss gets a program that writes unit tests for sets and gets. :)"
1oyvfi,5,2013-10-22,I've ruined myself.,cawcawcawCrow,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1oyvfi/ive_ruined_myself/,"It's 3am on the 2nd day that I've been awake, fueled off caffeine and nicotine, and I part of me realizes I'll probably rest better if I get this off my chest.



I think I've ruined myself. A few weeks ago I broke up with my long-time girlfriend (going on 5 years). The sad part? I cheated on her because the first 4 times I tried to break up with her, I failed. I took her back because I'm a sucker for tears and sad faces. Therefore, I resolved to do the one act that I knew she wouldn't come back to me for: cheating. It worked. I don't feel too bad about that, until 2 weeks later, I realized, I may have made a mistake.

Here I sit, rethinking my endeavor, and I realize: by Odin's beard I am lonely. I never realized, until it was too late, that my only friends were her friends. My only friends I've honestly only met on the internet (a few people I've played WoW with since raiding Zul'Gurub was a big deal), and we all live on separate sides of the country anyways. So here I am, back in my parents house, feeling lonely as I suppose lonely can be.

My story seems to compile onto itself, and the more I type it out, the more I feel like I may be in the Sims and my creator has a twisted sense of humor. 

I'm 102 applications deep, in 2 weeks, and not a call back. I just came back from an out of state job that took up a good part of the year. I'm okay financially, but those funds aren't growing on themselves. I'm back in my parents house because they literally begged me to: the eldest male of an Asian-American family I feel compelled to help. That was a mistake. 10k later I feel like I should have left my family in the dust, but I'm too stupid to learn from my own mistake (this is not the first time I've saved up money and had to bail my parents out of debt and pay off things that were really needed. Like cars, health check-ups for both family and pets, and getting my sister the things I never had in high school (financial support to do after school activities)). 

I do have a bachelor's under my belt, so there's that. Except the fact that not only do I not have my masters to get some work (yay, Criminology!), but the wait-list for relative internships is over a year long. Do I want to go back to school? Of course! I do not have the money, and my parents refuse to let me take a loan out (and my stubborn Asian upbringing makes it really, really hard to defy my parents. There's no logic behind it, there's just being Asian). 

I'm also back home, as I mentioned, to help my sister get things I never got while growing up. I also do the same for my brother. They were lucky: my dad finally got a decent job before they understood that we were poor. Except the fact in doing so, I'm not moving forward in my future. I want to do go do things, I want to become a teacher, I want to move out of my house, I want to go to a bar with some friends and bullshit about, at this point, whatever.

I think I'm rambling at this point, but I feel sort of better. It's not like I'm not friendly, it's just my habits kind of lead me into solidarity: online gaming, reading, and biking. I'm not the most interesting man in the world, but I'm not also the most boring, I think. That coupled with a minor level of social awkwardness (I still, at 26, get mildly nervous at cash registers and over-think the littlest conversations I have with people, when I do).


Where was I? Right. I feel bloody alone, like I'm going nowhere, and like a prisoner to my own stupid choices throughout life. At this point I swear all I can do is laugh at my own misfortune. I can't even begin to blame others: I know 99% of my problems would dissolve if I had half the gumption to do actually do anything about them. I should just go out and meet people (how ever you do that), I should just tell my parents to stop messing with my money, I should let my parents take care of their children, I should move forward with my own life, but, I just can't seem to. I feel sad and pathetic, and even doubly so for realizing and still doing nothing. I have no idea what I'm afraid of, but by the heavens I am scared to do anything."
1oyqip,4,2013-10-22,I end up saving everyone and I get no credit,NoMore222,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1oyqip/i_end_up_saving_everyone_and_i_get_no_credit/,"I work in a medical setting (for minimum wage, 40 miles from home) where if things are not done the proper way, someone could get hurt. My apathetic co-workers are always screwing things up and I end up having to fix their problems because I don't want something bad to happen. They either don't acknowledge it or laugh it, like it's some big joke. The few times I've mentioned it to anyone higher up, they haven't done much. One of the people I had to save today received employee of the month last month. (I've been thinking of quitting but I just don't have time to search for something else until school's out.)

I helped get somebody at school an internship because I wanted to network with some of his family members who work in my industry. He needed the internship badly because he was late in getting one for school. He skipped out on the internship after a few weeks because someone gave him a better one, made me look bad, and never bothered to introduce me to any of his family, even though I made it obvious I wanted to network. He is close to our internship professor and she sent an e-mail to all of us about how great his current internship is and how we should model our internship efforts on his. She didn't do this for anyone but him this semester.

My whole life has been like this. As a kid, I don't know how many times I did something nice for someone and then they forgot me when they could clique up with someone ""better."" I always excelled in classes but it was the students who ""improved"" the most who received recognition.

I hate living on this inconsiderate planet. All the superficial people give each other awards, while people like me hold up society and get dirt kicked in their faces for it. What do I have for a future? More and more of this? I don't know how to long beyond it anymore. I have no one and nothing to show for my efforts, even when I try to be selfish and focus exclusively on myself."
1oyf0z,8,2013-10-22,Any tips for an Aussie engineering student to find an internship/vacation employment?,michaelbryan92,perth,https://www.reddit.com/r/perth/comments/1oyf0z/any_tips_for_an_aussie_engineering_student_to/,"Hi /r/perth,

I am a student in my second-to-last year at UWA studying a bachelor of Chemical and Process Engineering. A requirement of the course is the completion of 12 weeks paid work experience (usually completed over the summer vacation period) before graduation can be achieved.

I am having difficulty finding this required employment, as most engineering firms are not hiring at the moment, let alone taking on interns. I would like to ask if anybody had any tips on applying for this type of work, I must have applied to 60+ companies in the past 3-4 months and not had a single response, not even a letter of rejection, which is quite disheartening! 

I have quite good marks, I believe my resume is quite well-written and I also am under the impression that I am better equipped with communication skills than a large number of my fellow students (a large portion speak and write in very broken english). I am also completing my thesis with relevance to methane rejection in LNG processing.

One of the main problems I am having is the impersonality of the application process; a single company will require you to fill out hours worth of questions regarding your work habits and job expectations however they will not list an email or a phone number that can be used to contact somebody. Another issue is the problem of finding a company which will take on chemical and process engineering interns in the first place!

So I guess my question is this: does anybody know any additional resources that I can use to further contact and apply for vacation work positions? Additionally, can anybody offer any advice in general about obtaining such a position, or even just finding and contacting engineering companies in general?

Thanks!"

I can't win.",[deleted],self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/1oyeah/fuck_the_cs_get_degrees_mantra_a_c_could_actually/,"Maybe I'm just being a college freshman here, but here are the facts, in mostly sequential order:

- I did well on the PSAT. Big whoop. Somehow whatever ungodly forces of nature that govern the world decided that I should go all the way up to the National Merit level for sitting in a gymnasium and filling in a few circles to the best of my ability.

- My mom gets diagnosed with breast cancer. Whatever, they caught it early, they can do plenty, but because we are so fortunate to live in the land of the free, the healthcare isn't.

- Most of my dad's paycheck already goes to care for my severely autistic little brother. It's chill, though - we're upper-middle class and we still make enough to live fairly comfortably. Hell, since he's this brilliant self-employed man of men, he can increase his paycheck whenever he needs to.

- Come FAFSA time, the government basically looks at my dad and says ""Oh, wow! Would you look at that fat paycheck. You could basically buy a whole wing of a university with that!"" and offers to flip a nickel or two my way for higher education.

- I end up looking for the biggest scholarship package I can. Here we go, University of Alabama. All I have to do is stay above a 3.0 GPA and graduate somewhere in the College of Engineering and tuition is something I can set equal to 0. Computer Science is even in there, so that's a big plus (never taking another Chemistry class - so clutch. AP Chemistry was hard, I worked more for that class than any other and was ecstatic for a 4 on the AP Test  and a B in the class. Smarter kids got to try half as hard for a 5 and an A. Fuck me, right?), I've always had an interest in programming but it's never been a priority for my time, never got past rudimentary stuff.

- Cue my dad basically telling me ""Look, I'm really happy for you. But I need you to stay above a 3.0, I seriously don't have the money that any piece of paper says I does."" Welp, looks like I'm not allowed to get below an 84% in any class if I want to guarantee that I have a job **four years from now**.

- And now everyone that ever existed says ""Hahaha Cs/Ds (major-dependent) get degrees, man. Turn up!"" and ""Your GPA doesn't even matter when you graduate. You need to network and get work experience.""

Well, I'm SO SORRY that I can't look for work because I'm terrified that any significant number of hours I spend away from a textbook will mean that whatever Dunkin' Donuts job I find to replace it may have to be a permanent replacement. Hell, let's be honest, I already blow too much time on Starcraft fandom, College Football, and Reddit, and I've cut back SIGNIFICANTLY on all 3 from my high-school years.

Did I mention that I was stupid enough to take the route where I'm also getting money for staying in the College of Engineering? As in, the fields (outside of Pre-Med) where your GPA is walking over a tightrope and getting shot at by a firing squad? You go, 17-year-old me. Shine on.

Oh, what about summer internships? After all, there's no coursework to worry about then! Remember the part where I said I only looked at programming as something that was cool from afar, and only went to a summer camp or two to learn the basics (which I'll be honest, have made Programming I a breeze. 3 weeks of mostly nonstop learning apparently == 1 semester of 6 hours/week learning)? Well, guess who's going to the hire the guy who still doesn't fully understand lamdba functions and classes and still hasn't gotten his laptop to dual-boot a Windows OS and Ubuntu like CS majors here are recommended to do? If you answered ""Maybe your local library"", you'd be wrong.

The sad part is I don't even want to be like my dad, making enough to cash to support 3 kids, one of which requires more per year than most do per four. A nice IT job, making sure everything in a company  that I can assist in is running properly, answering users and helping them - something I actually sort of enjoy, even if I am just telling them to do some power cycling - seems blissful for me. But I can't get that without work experience, which I can't get without sacrificing study time, which I can't get without losing everything.

Oh, and my mom walked out on my dad last week. So that's cool.


EDIT: TL;DR: Need a 3.0 to stay in school because of circumstances, need internships/jobs to have a career after school, need a 36-hour day to make it work, and I'm generally behind on life anyways. Woo.

EDIT2 before bedtime: Definitely forgot to add the causal connection between scholarship and the first bullet on the PSAT; part of the Alabama scholarship comes from being a National Merit Finalist, which stemmed from me doing well on one test on one day, so I don't even feel like I deserve to be lumped in with other people who have to maintain a 3.0 in terms of pure intellect/speed of grasping material."

1oy4n5,143,2013-10-21,Thoughts on UGA’s injuries and “bad luck” from another perspective. [X-Post from /r/UGA],AlphaMarshan,CFB,https://www.reddit.com/r/CFB/comments/1oy4n5/thoughts_on_ugas_injuries_and_bad_luck_from/,"This will probably be lengthy, so bear with me. I wanted to chime in from a different perspective on what I’ve seen the past several seasons regarding your team, you faithful UGA fans.

So I live in Georgia, and most of my friends are UGA fans, so I’m always watching the games with them even though I’m mostly unbiased. One of the things that has been consistent with UGA the past several years, anyone will tell you, is the injuries. Season after season, UGA comes in with a top 10 caliber team, only to lose what feels like half its starters on either side of the ball due to injuries. 

Sure, football is a collision sport, there are bound to be injuries. But really? 2 RBs, 4 starting WRs and how many on the OL? And it's half way through the season? What about the year Stafford came back and a pre-season #1 ranked UGA lost, what was it, 3-4 starters on the OL? Malcolm Mitchell tore his ACL celebrating a TD? Anyone remember the Boise State game? No way those kids could hang with UGA right? In the 2nd quarter UGA players were cramping. In the first game of the season. In a DOME. If it's always bad luck after bad luck, how come LSU or Alabama doesn't suffer injuries to the same extent UGA does? I have truly never seen a team, regardless of conference, suffer injuries year after year the way that UGA does, and I think most UGA fans would agree. I don’t have the time to do all the research on it, but if I would be willing to bet that UGA’s multi-game, season, and career-ending injuries are statistically higher when compared to at least the other teams in the SEC. How many times is UGA going to lose key player after key player before we stop attributing it to just ""bad luck""? Now, keep that in mind as I segue into another topic.

I am a certified strength and conditioning specialist (the CSCS is a standard certification most athletic HR programs look for when they are hiring a strength &amp; conditioning (S&amp;C) coach), and I’ve had the privilege of working as an intern with UMiami’s (you know Richt is an alum right?) basketball and soccer teams, among others. The SEC is, in general, one of the most difficult S&amp;C jobs to land because of its reputation in sports and the expectations they have. You need to have a strong educational background in exercise science (most jobs list “bachelor’s required, master’s preferred – which generally means you better have a master’s, which I do) as well as 3 key certifications: you must be a Certified Strength &amp; Conditioning Specialist by the NSCA, Strength and Conditioning Coach Certified by the CSCCa, and a USA Weightlifting Certified Sports Performance Coach. 

For years, Dave Van Halanger was the director of strength and conditioning at UGA. I'm pretty sure kinesiology/exercise science degrees and research in strength and conditioning probably didn't even exist while he was coaching, but it does now. After being fed up with the conditioning, Van Halanger was moved to ""Director of Player Welfare"" (whatever that is) in 2011 and Joe Tereshinski Jr. was promoted to Director of S&amp;C. The Tereshinski name is engrained at UGA – Something like 4 generations of players have now come through the program. Tereshinski Jr. graduated in 1977 and had been working as an assistant strength coach at UGA since 1982, and he learned everything he knows from whom? You guessed it, Van Halanger. So the UGA administration ditched Van Halanger and instead of hiring a qualified strength and conditioning coach, promoted Tereshinski in-house to director when he wouldn’t have even been looked at as an ASSISTANT based on his lack of appropriate education and/or certifications related to S&amp;C. So now you have a guy running the strength and conditioning program with no background in exercise science/physiology, whose assistants are more educated than he is in proper S&amp;C programming and protocols, and whom have to shut up and do what they’re told because he’s running the program. They brought over John Thomas from Penn State who is a “Master-level strength coach” as deemed by the CSCCa and has to work as an assistant under Tereshinski.

The point is this: something's fishy here and if I were a betting man I'd put money on it that UGA's S&amp;C program bench presses and curls too much, doesn't train sport specifically enough, lacks any sort of mobility screening (FMS maybe?), is dominantly sagittal-planed, programs exercises out of order and in the improper energy systems, and lacks any sort of oversight into auditing the programming. There is a host of S&amp;C protocols that any person formally educated in this field knows by heart and uses in their programming to protect and strengthen the knee and surrounding ligaments to reduce the risk of injury. However, strength and conditioning has always been a ""good ol' boy"" type network, and since the Tereshinski family is literally generational in the UGA system, I don't see him leaving anytime soon, especially with Richt's loyalty to his coaches. I'm not saying that all of the injuries are anyone's fault, but UGA loses WAY more key players when compared to their SEC counterparts like LSU or Alabama, season after season. At some point you have to address your S&amp;C and athletic training programs and figure out if it they are at least contributing to the problem, rather than throw up your hands and saying, “Whelp, bad luck again guys. UGA is just cursed, huh?”

I bet if you put Oregon's S&amp;C coach (Radcliffe) at UGA you would get phenomenal results: better conditioned players, faster, more explosive, and fewer injuries. Oregon doesn't come close to getting the caliber athletes that UGA does, but they've made a NAME for themselves based on their speed and conditioning, and Radcliffe is formally educated and in many ways is a pioneer in S&amp;C, and routinely addresses S&amp;C conferences around the country. 

It’s hard to “prove” anything as anecdotal as improper programming in workouts = more injuries for UGA, but as an unbiased observer I think Tereshinski is part of the problem for why UGA seems to suffer so many injuries and have poor conditioning year after year. If there’s anyone you should be calling to replace, it’s him. Fatigued players are always more susceptible to non-contact knee and hamstring injuries.
 
Just my thoughts, thanks for reading.

**EDIT 1:** Here is a video of one of UGA's workouts: http://youtu.be/p4_OWHufwDU. If we assume the editing is in proper order (which I'll admit, we don't know), they are trap-bar deadlifting towards the end of the work out (this particular exercise would tax the CNS way more than anything else and should be towards the front of the workout), and the workout is centered around chest and biceps (close-grip bench presses, curls, chain curls, chin ups, etc.). The only really good exercise I see is the trunk rotations with the bar, which unsurprisingly are clearly being led by John Thomas, the former director at Penn State, whom I mentioned earlier.

Assuming this is a winter 2013 workout (which the video says it is), that means they were just out of season in either January or February when they filmed this, which means they should have entered into asymmetrically-loaded and mostly unilateral work to strengthen the trunk and get rid of any imbalances as they transition into hypertrophy. However, it's mostly bilateral work and the players are using chains, which doesn't make any sense because chains would be better for strength/power/in-season workouts since the whole point is that they are heavier through the concentric portion of the lift, teaching the athlete to explode from the bottom of the lift. This is a glorified bodybuilding workout.

**EDIT 2:** I'd also like to point out that I'm not even saying it's necessarily appropriate for Tereshinski to be fired. I even said ""replaced"" in the original write up. As /u/epmatsw pointed out, I don't have the numbers to prove any of my claims, and in all honesty don't care enough to find 10 years worth of injuries for every school and compare them all. I'm just saying it's a hunch, and at the very least some auditing needs to be done into the program. If it turns out that it IS a confirmation bias and UGA's injuries are on par with the rest of the teams out there, I'll be the first to tell you that I was wrong. But it certainly offers an explanation as to why these injuries occur so often. "

I need to be able to:
Be able to read in pre-written files that I will be doing, that will hold around 100 questions at a time, and be able to display them at random with out repating one.

Be able to cycle back through questions that I have moved on from

Keep track of each schools score at each meet.

and save easy to read files with the rankings of each school for each individual meet and the over all year.

I need to be able to impliment some simple GUI (which may be hard because I was never taught it) and It needs to be simple enough that a teacher can read the rankings and use the software if I am sick that day.

So far I have learned C++ and Java, which are as a result off the table, and Im familier with some basic object oriented programming and advanced data structures.

Any idea what language I should learn for this kind of program, or any tips.

This is a big step up for me considering last year I was doing simple file reading and calculation programs.

Much appreicated, and appologies for my English.

EDIT: I should make note that they want this all done in a single scripting language of sorts."
1oxzzz,0,2013-10-21,I give up,[deleted],Austin,https://www.reddit.com/r/Austin/comments/1oxzzz/i_give_up/,"I moved here almost 3 years ago, with an internship in place after school.

After years of working at my retail job they decided to stop my progress not from poor performance, but because I was moving too fast. My girlfriend cheated on me with someone she met through a friend at work. But there is always hope right.

Even after the internship I have tried getting a job, but most responses I have heard are your not qualified, freelance work does not count, your over qualified because of your military experience, or you will hear from us in a few days with no response, even after following up and my personal favorite, your not from Austin you will not understand the ""local"" aspect we are looking for. Almost 3 years of looking for a job in this city, and still nothing. Over 500 resumes and cover letters. 

Apparently being a vet was the wrong choice for my life because I have gotten nothing good from it career wise. Going to school did not matter because it is all about who you know.

You see, I really need some solid advice.

My girlfriend and I of two+ years broke up last October. I had to do an internship out of state, did long distance for 3 months, relationship fell apart. She met someone at her new job (being the needy bitch that she was). They got engaged in July. but enough of that..

Over the course of this past year the dating world has not been kind to me. Be it by the both of us not clicking, or whatnot. It's been miserably frustrating. In January I started going to a particular gym in my hometown (I had been away at school for 4+ years, so coming back home where most of my good friends who stayed behind are now married, it's not been easy.) Upon signing up for a membership, I notice a gorgeous raven haired receptionist. She looks like solid mix between Marisa Tomei &amp; Kristen Stewart. We exchange smiles and she compliments a (Brand New) band shirt that I'm wearing. Over the course of the past 8 months I have lost 25 lbs (started out 175, now 150, I'm 5'10) &amp; am in the best shape of my life at 27. I neglected my body in college, since I was more concerned with playing music and drinking beer. 

 My Dilemma: 
We have exchanged banter a multitude of times over the course of the past  6 months, whenever she is working. never kino because she's usually behind a desk when we flirt. Her name is Jess and now she is straight giving me the ""fuck eyes"". You know, when you see a girl across the bar making eyes at you, well yes those eyes. She seems to have low self-esteem for some reason. She remembers my name because she no longer looks at my membership card, and gives me the nod in. The problem at my gym is there are always like 3 or 4 employees behind the counter, so I can never really get her to myself. I don't want to embarrass her by asking her to go out for a coffee or beer, placing her on the spot with four Purple Shirts w/name-tags standing around her. 

I am quite the mix between an extrovert &amp; introvert (people person, but need my 'alone' time to properly function). My temperaments are Sanguine and Melancholic if that says anything. During weekends at the pub downtown, I have literally seen every younger personal trainer/receptionist who works at my gym and have been social with everyone of them. But Jess never goes with them. Ever.

I am at a breaking point of reaching out to her on Facebook (we have a few mutual friends, alot of mutual interests, she wouldn't be completely creeped out with me), problem is I know the stigma that goes w/ talking to a girl online before you really know them, and that a thousand Jobin's do it. However, the pro is that we have carried on conversation in person many times. I have put together a rough draft of sorts for a potential message I will be sending Jess tonight, please tell me what I am doing right, and more importantly what Im doing wrong.

""Hey Jess, Hope all is well with ya. I can never seem to catch you by yourself to ask you out for a coffee/drink. Ive seen everyone who works at PF downtown Winston except for you! I don't want to embarrass you by putting you on the spot (although I can imagine you've heard some great one-liners coming from some of Walkertowns finest) [[w-town is a local redneck county]] with all your co-workers around, however i definitely want to hang out. - are you available tomorrow night or Friday?
 ps. I'm very glad that you're the second 'Jess, Planet Fitness' that comes up in a fbook search. Made this alot easier for me :) ""

....alright, pros, cons, advantages, disadvantages, better-ways-to-communicate-things? I need all of the input I can get people. Thanks in advance. I want to go for the kill tonight.

I had a good paid internship for most of the year so my income is fairly high and even though basic calculations have me receiving a refund for this tax year overall, it can still be increased.

My question is on common law relationships. Under my federal and provincial tax forms non-refundable credits can be claimed for a spouse or common law partner. For 2013 this will amount to 11,038 - the Net Income of said person. Technically I do not have a common law partner, just a long-term girlfriend who does not live with me (she lives at home and has very little income for 2013). If I were to claim her as a common law partner it would boost my refund by over 25% by my calculations. Would doing this be viable or is this something that can actually be audited by the CRA, what additional impact may this have on my return?

If you have any additional tax avoidance advice etc. for Canada that is also welcome! Especially thoughts that are not fairly obvious (like RRSP contributions).

Cheers,

But once I'm right at the cusp of experiencing success, I'll give up. Some examples are:

I did my degree *and* Masters, but I haven't found a job/position relating to either of those degrees. 

This year my goal was to learn coding, and I even found an internship where they would pay me to teach me the code I wanted to learn, but at the end of the internship when they were ready to offer me a job, I quit. 

I wanted to create jewellery and sell it online...so I bought all the equipment and made a ton of jewellery but never created an etsy account. (I sold some of my jewellery through my mom, since she wore some earrings I made and got many requests from others to buy some, so I know people liked it - I just thought it was shitty jewellery and didn't think I'd be good enough to sell online). 

Part of what stops me from pursuing these things is that my true love is writing. Since I could read and write, I've always wanted to be a writer. Every time I start putting effort into something I think, ""why put effort into this when I could be putting effort into something I actually like doing, like writing?"".

So for the past few months I've been writing like crazy. I have hundreds of thousands of words written, many short stories, even two novel-length stories. I'm currently enrolled in many online classes to make me a better writer so that I can improve my story-telling abilities. The problem is, just like with all the other things I've pursued, I've come to a point where I'm close to tasting the end but I'm sabotaging myself. 

My dad just sent me a position working in his office which matches up with my credentials perfectly (my Masters, my coding knowledge, etc). This is a pretty good job and would give me some security, but it would mean abandoning my writing (because I know if I'm working mon-fri 9-5, I wouldn't be as dedicated to this goal than if I kept my current job). Even in my heart I know I won't apply, because I don't even have the confidence to have an ""adult"" job and work with other people. It's the same reason I'm too hesitant to finally finish and start self-publishing the stories I write (or even let people read anything I write).

-I have taken the time outside of class to expand my toolkit (taught myself Python, HTML/CSS, how to use Linux, etc.)

-I have put out more applications than I can count on 10 hands

So I'm wrapping up an internship with a medical device company working on low-power monitoring devices relying on embedded systems. My work here has been around efficient use of the RTOS and wireless transmission/communication on the current device. I'm now trying to teach myself how to use these platforms to filter/process raw bio data in a way that minimizes processor usage.

I've read a lot of papers on EEG and ECG delineation that involves the wavelet transform, but I haven't seen any representations in C itself. I understand the concepts themselves (DWT, STFT, etc), but I'm not sure how I would go about implementing this in code.

I figured that since everything is discrete it shouldn't be so bad, but it would be nice to see an example or two before I tackle this myself. Does anyone have any resources that I can refer to?

They were private numbers so I can't call back, and I don't know which of the two places its from. I was hoping they might call again today, but they didn't. Its possible that I didn't get the position and they just wanted to notify me and give me some feedback (which one place said they would do) on my interview, but I'm pretty worried that I might have missed my spot over something really silly like this.

Should I send an email to both places? Wait a few days? Let's just say that they were going to offer me the spot or call me back for another interview, would they actually call me again?

One of the interviews was a month ago, but they were interviewing a lot of people so a late response would be understandable, the other place was a much smaller company, and the interview took place two weeks ago.

1p1fav,0,2013-10-23,Just wanted to have a whinge about my used-car purchasing experience.,malkouri,cars,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/1p1fav/just_wanted_to_have_a_whinge_about_my_usedcar/,"First, quick details about me: I'm a Kiwi uni student studying Mechanical Engineering in Auckland, looking for a first car to get to a job I have for a four month full time internship about 15km away (still taking suggestions on cars for under 4K USD)

**Sunday:** I had been browsing TradeMe (our equivelant of eBay) for the last few weeks, focusing on small cars in the under 4k NZD region. I settled on checking out a 1998 Toyota Corsa 110k kms on Sunday at what turned out to be a ""private dealer"" (he owned a small corner of a larger dealer). It was in good condition, a scratch here and a small dent there, drove well, but was selling in an auction with an opening price of 3.5k NZD. 

That evening a 1997 Corolla II 98k kms was posted (the same car, just a different name essentially. Visually no different.) with an asking price of 3.3k and no exterior or interior damage at all. 

**Monday:** I texted the guy (Middle eastern or Eastern African mid 20s) and organised a test drive and personal check out, and it drove well. My checks showed everything ok bar rear and front seal leaks on the engine and the timing belt likely needing replacement in the next 10000km.

The original Corsa from Sunday had the auction Monday evening and no one bidded, so it was relisted the next day for the same starting price.

I called a mechanic to come and inspect the vehicle the next day, and he said to text the address.

**Tuesday:** I went out and checked it out again, after I accidentally texted the address to the wrong number (11 digit cellphone number, got one digit wrong, derp). Talked to the owner and we verbally agreed that if the mechanical check showed no issues above the ones I had found, I would be prepared to offer 3.1k for the car. He agreed.

**Wednesday:** The mechanic arrived at his house to check at the car at 4pm. I was unable to make it because I was at uni. He called me a half hour into the check to tell me the seals leaked and the spark plugs were worn, and asked if I wanted to continue with the check. I said yes.

When he finished the check, he spoke to his mother, and they agreed the car wouldn't be sold until she (or him) had talked to me.

**Wednesday evening:** The car guy texted me just after the mechanic left (~1730) asking if I was ready, I said that it would take a while for him to write up the report and get it to me. He texted me at 2016 saying the following:

""Sory mate gve you the chance. someone is coming to pick it up tmrw.""

The mechanical report arrived at 2028. Leaking seals, timing belt will need changing soon, sparks are worn. Everything else is fine.


I don't really know how I feel right now. Disappointed? Yes. Confused? A little. Faith in humanity? Reduced a little.

**TL;DR - Tested a 2nd hand car, checked it myself, verbally agreed to purchasing it on the outcome of a mechanical check, had the mechanical check done, mechanic verbally confirmed the car would not be sold until they talked to me about the report, car was sold two hours later to someone that wasn't me**"
1p156e,67,2013-10-23,Want to contribute to open source? I have a project!,zidaneqrro,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1p156e/want_to_contribute_to_open_source_i_have_a_project/,"###FogbugzJS
Hey guys! I am an amateurish programmer (I just finished my first year at college) who always wanted to contribute to open source. I stumbled across this project idea through my internship, where I was required to use the [Fogbugz API](http://help.fogcreek.com/8202/xml-api) along with [Nodejs](http://nodejs.org/). It turns out, there wasn't any node package that used the Fogbugz API so I decided to create one!

I literally created it today and it is pretty bare bones but I will be adding a lot to it over the next few weeks. It's also my first git project (with actual contributors I'm hoping..).

###Contributing
Basically, what we want to do is provide a nodejs library for calling functions in javascript that interact with Fogbugz. We would want to port all the supported Fogbugz XML Api calls in the documentation and return JSON instead of XML.

If you have any questions about the project or how you might be able to contribute, please don't hesitate to ask. I'm going to be very patient because I know what it was like to start out. 

###GitHub Link
https://github.com/claudiowilson/FogbugzJS

Right now, all it has are functions to call the API with text, and to logon. I have written a lot of these functions already in javascript but haven't ported them to coffeescript yet, and will do so soon. 

###Development Setup
I finally got a contributor! Anyway, people have been asking me about my development setup for coffeescript and node so here it is. I'm using [SublimeText](http://www.sublimetext.com/3) as an editor along with the [Better Coffeescript](https://github.com/aponxi/sublime-better-coffeescript) for syntax highlighting. Also the [Coffeescript cookbook](http://coffeescriptcookbook.com/chapters/strings/) may be useful for people like myself who are not used to coffeescript yet.

Obviously I have node installed for testing, along with a free fogbugz site set up so I can test functions. "

Should I cut back on classes and delay graduation - or just push through and get this over with?,Pecorino,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1p14d4/spreading_myself_too_thin_at_school_should_i_cut/,"This is a bit embarrassing, as I'm only taking 14 credit hours - but I'm getting burnt out very quickly and it's starting to affect me in ways I did not anticipate. Basically, I'm at the point where my workload at school is so high, that it is starting to affect my overall performance in school. Lately, I haven't been able to finish assignments and the quality of my work has been horrid.

I feel I'm particularly disadvantaged because I tend to learn at a more leisurely pace (a nice way of saying I'm slow) than my peers, and I have to put in more time to ""get it"" than others. Currently I'm in the second CS course, and a Java course. The workload alone in these two classes take up the majority of the time I spend outside of class. 

Of course, if I'm completely honest with myself, I could be managing my time and focus better - but still. I am stressed out. I don't have weekends anymore, or free time for that matter.

My question is this... would it be wise to cut back on the amount of classes I take at the expense of delaying my graduation even further? Many on this subreddit seems to emphasize the importance of getting an internship. Well, I don't know how I could possibly hold an internship, with the same workload at school and not go insane.

Any input would be greatly appreciated."

While I am not positive which position I will fit in with best, the worst case scenario is I have to decline 4 offers.

1p0zjb,1,2013-10-22,Fear About My Future: Should I Choose College or Experience?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1p0zjb/fear_about_my_future_should_i_choose_college_or/,"**For those who want a tl;dr:** (although I'd prefer you'd read everything to know my position)

My dad owns a company where he is the only employee; He maintains the COBOL code for old Counterpoint systems. I was screwed doing an experimental program in high school, and now my college is pretty much half-ruined and costs about 1.5 times as much. The degree itself is proving to be useless anyway, as the way it's designed I learn very little pertinent to my field and can't skip anything. Should I face my parents and intern with my dad, work on open-source, and build a portfolio; Or should I stay in college, tough it out, and hope to God everything works and the degree is worth it?

**For those of you who can hear me out:**

About five years ago I started programming. I was a 4.6 GPA student at my high school until about two years ago, when I went into the Saint Petersburg College Early College program. This program allowed me to take all my classes at SPC, and get an AA when I graduated high school.

Now this program was highly experimental and nobody really knew what they were doing. As such, I was put into humanities classes I couldn't possibly handle - three of which were 9 credit hours each - and my strong subjects were being diverted because they didn't think my high school calculus could even let me skip college algebra.

Because of my ineptitude at humanities, my GPA in the program ended at 2.7 and my high school GPA plummeted to a 3.4 (4.0 weighted), but at least I got my AA. And hey, I was promised that my GPA wouldn't transfer anyway; I would be accepted with the “dual-enrollment” credits, and on the fast track to my major.

Well they were wrong, the GPA did transfer, while some of the requisites didn't. So another calculus, more humanities, writing intensive classes. And the classes I have to take aren't easy classes where I can program in my free time. I actually had one week of ~4 days of no sleep getting 27 pages of essays done. And like I said before, humanities are my weak spot – analyzing the role of Virtue in Plato's Utopia (Republic) isn't something I do especially well.

To make matters worse, that 2.7 on 60 hours transferred instead as a 2.4 on 72 hours. This means two-fold:

* After the first 140 credit hours (including the already obtained 72), I'm going to have to pay *double* for my classes.

* I may not even get into the computer science department. It's a very small department with a 3.0 entrance requirement (with other requirements as well). To get the GPA I need when I need it, I need to get A+ grades in *every* class.

And if I thought it couldn't get worse, the way the schedule is set up, I won't be able to touch programming in my classes until next Fall; The classes I then take are made up of “concept” programming, such as learning OOP and “Common Data Types”; I talked to the head of the department and she said I cannot skip any of the concept classes without a documented class from another college, because “how else can they know that I know”; And I can't even take comp sci based electives instead of the requisites that *did* transfer until my senior year, because they require the concept classes!

In terms of pricing, I have about $10k of loans a semester, plus another $4k out of pocket (on private loans) even with scholarships. But remember, starting my Junior Spring, I'll need to pay twice as much tuition because of the new credit hour laws. So I estimate by the end I'll have ~$79k of debt. 

Meanwhile, my dad owns his own business. A small contracting one that (mainly) maintains COBOL code for old Counterpoint software, where he is the only employee. He's a phenomenal programmer and all his clients love him/his work.

After everything I've been through, I've started to doubt the use of the college I'm paying so much to receive. I want to ask my parents if I can just come home and instead intern or work for my father and start contributing to the open-source world, and when I feel I'm comfortable in the “real-world”, I can start looking for jobs with an AA and a few years of experience under my belt rather than an expensive degree.

In terms of experience, I like to think I'm actually a pretty good programmer. I've learned some-odd 13 languages, although my proficiency is in C++(11), Ada, and a (toy) language called Nimrod. Programming is my passion, and I spend almost all of my free time doing it! I have a firm understanding of all the concepts, but my main weakness is that I don't know how to do “real-world” programming. And no, I don't want to do game programming like so many others do, I'd prefer something more along the lines of what my father does (but as an employee of a real company – not a contractor). 

What I want to know is what you guys think of my situation, and which course of action you all think I should take. I feel like this might be a great opportunity but I'm absolutely terrified of disappointing my parents and telling them I want to drop out like this, but I'm far more mortified of what will happen if I don't. 

Note: I'm sorry for how long this is, I wanted to be as concise as I could but also be well spoken. It might have some spelling/formatting errors, and I apologize ahead of time."
1p0w1v,2,2013-10-22,MMFB Today has been a day,[deleted],MMFB,https://www.reddit.com/r/MMFB/comments/1p0w1v/mmfb_today_has_been_a_day/,"I'm usually pretty happy. I try to find one thing to be happy about and focus on it. Maybe that makes me ridiculous, but I like to think it makes me hopeful. Saying that, today was a small dose of horrible I couldn't quite fathom nor happy thought my way out of. 

Everyone has one of those days where the things, whatever they are, whip at us. 

A couple of things: 

Ty is town complicated things with his sudden engagement and giving me a pet bunny. What am I to do with a pet rabbit? He beats at door at 4am
bringing songs, bunnies and donuts. I'm sick with the flu, but have to work. Ty rubs his love in my face and leaves me missing of the times we'd dance in the  parking lot in our hometown. Making Alaska permanent home with his new bride. That's the news my best friend gives me. No jokes about me being his communal bride. Just my bearded manly running off to be happy and marry and live in the wildness and have a ton of hairy babies that, in my head, look like bears. His fiancée is basically like a bear to me, even though I've never seen her. He slips me a number when I leave. Says not to call it unless I really want an adventure. I've no idea what that means Ty! 

My favorite pretzel shopped closed on one of the most important board of directors days of the year. They love pretzels and were less enthused my
offer of pastries during the presentation I've been working months on. It would be unfair to blame them hating my presentation on pretzels but it really threw me off my game. 

I've watched my grandfather dying. 
It really hit me today. I needed him most today. I sent him a text and then I remembered he couldn't check his phone now. 

I spent the morning receiving call after call about a missing company car that I'm no longer suppose to be responsible for since my promotion. Perhaps everyone was too wasted at the promotion party for me to hear the part about how that isn't something I'm responsible for starting three months ago. That seems trivial now. But it is frustrating. 

My cousin will her have baby next month. We got pregnant around the same time. If I hadn't gotten my first abortion I'd be having my baby around that time.  I hate the little updates she sends me. Stop it! I want to scream. But she doesn't know. I haven't told anyone really.

I was in the dressing room with a friend today and she noticed my nipple points in a strange way that I've never noticed before. Now I'm going to worry about that every time I have sex. 

I've a bunny now. I don't know what to do with a bunny. 

One of our new interns that started today is the girlfriend of an ex boyfriend. I recognize her from their happy Facebook page updates and happy photos.  I dumped him because he had a weirdly colored penis. You know the ones where the color is different from the rest of body. Not his fault but I could never have sex with him or look at it because it creeped me out. I dumped him a party one night after he told me loved me. I was 20 and I mentioned his penis to him. I regret now and feel really bad. 

I played a event reception tonight with a 102 fever. My boob popped out of my dress. All I could think when someone told me was that I really hoped it wasn't the boob with the oddly pointed nipple. I feel like the oddly pointed nipple should be something I tell penis guy to make him feel better. "" Hey, I've a weird thing too."" 

I've cried today over love and loss and the thoughts of everything in between.

Now I'm at home in the dark. Trying to desperately not to answer any calls or texts. People never stop. I guess it's better than no one caring. All I want though is for someone to come hold my hand while I sleep and tell me it'll all be okay in the morning. 


Hey, at least I've my health, right? I've a lot to be thankful for and I really hope tomorrow is a better day. "

Must have experience with Python, SQL experience is preferred but not necessary. I will immediately place anyone at the front of the line if they have personal side-projects in Python and can explain them in detail.

To give you an idea of the context:
This is a team-based internship in which the supervisor (me) has little time available to provide training. The last group of interns had a very good mix of skills and were thus able to train each other in their own specialties. When our two departing interns had their exit interviews, each intern mentioned that they learned more and much more was expected of them when compared with their peers' internships (the other two interns chose to remain throughout the school year). The pay reflects this level of expected output. This next group of interns will be set up slightly differently, so your experience may vary.


Duties and responsibilities:

* Automate repetitive or ad hoc tasks (data analysis, consolidation, warehousing; report generation; miscellaneous scripting requests)
* Miscellaneous duties as a result of my workload overflow, much of which can also be scripted if you're capable

Required skills:

* Ability to pause and change tasks at a moment's notice and to keep track of a large list of postponed tasks. Priorities tend to change quickly; the better you are at supporting my workload, the more forward-looking I can be and therefore the less firefighting you'll have to do.
* Ability to take a large number of tasks and handle them efficiently, with updates provided as your workload changes, and without much oversight. If you're good at delegation, then I may set you up to supervise other interns as well.

This is not an easy internship. You will be allowed to deal with an ever-increasing set of responsibilities if you can handle it. If you want time to browse Reddit (outside of the occasional rest break), then this is not the position for you.

If you're interested, PM your resume. I'll be conducting phone interviews with qualified candidates. If you pass this stage, you'll be required to submit a formal application through Taleo (HR's requirement, so you have my condolences) before we can have an in-person interview.

The official job description is also available on request. Sorry for the throwaway account; I don't want my career and my normal Reddit account to cross paths if they don't have to."

How can network, and more importantly, find a job?",Ziberzaba,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1p0olp/just_moved_across_country_us_after_college_so_i/,"My girlfriend was accepted to grad school, and I also wanted a change, so I moved with her halfway across the nation.  So far I have only been able to find a part-time temp job doing an OS migration.  I don't want to be in IT support, though I have decent Tier-1 experience.  I am really looking for something in programming.  I have a BS in physics with a minor in ME.  I left a good internship after 2 years when I moved; this is where I learned MATLAB and python programming.  I am also learning HTML/CSS and java on my own in my free time.  I feel like I am qualified enough to work a junior level position, but I can't seem to find any; or those that I do say they want CS majors or more experience with a specific language.  
  
I think one of my biggest problems is that I don't know anyone here.  What is the best way to find people I can network with locally (Richmond, VA), and how do I find out about entry level jobs that would take me on?  I have profiles on Dice, Indeed, and SimplyHired.  Thanks."
1p0mbw,1,2013-10-22,SO is two days late on period. How do I calm her down and keep her from stressing,wellshesfreakedout,sex,https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/1p0mbw/so_is_two_days_late_on_period_how_do_i_calm_her/,"Hello,  
My girlfriend (21) is absolutely stressing out because she thinks she might be pregnant. A condom broke a few nights earlier because it was too small. I hadnt masturbated in the previous 24 hours and had urinated several times before sex so I believe my precum wasn't viable.  

I really believe its stress that's causing her to be late. She's had a lot on her plate recently with school, work, internships and her younger sister getting pregnant a few months back. This has in my opinion made her very paranoid. I of course won't tell her she's being paranoid because I don't want to hurt her feelings.  

I have suggested getting two home test kits (better safe then sorry with those false negatives) to ease her piece of mind.  

How would Sexxit suggest I ease her stress?"
1p0jms,1,2013-10-22,First world problem...When do I stop accepting interviews?,cjmcgizzle,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1p0jms/first_world_problemwhen_do_i_stop_accepting/,"I know a lot of people here are really struggling to find work, and I almost feel bad posting this.  I'm just not really sure what the right approach is.  So, please, don't read this if it is going to make you feel bitter about where you are in the process.  I am always happy to provide tips where I can, though, if anyone has questions.

So, I will be graduating in December (finally!), and have been pretty steady on the job hunt since August.  I would say about three weeks ago, the interviews really started coming in.  I've had four interviews so far, with four separate opportunities.  One has already offered an internship (immediate start) with ""potential"" to go full time in December, and another offered a second interview.  The other two positions told me it would be a few weeks, so I'm not really stressing over those.  

My issue is offers for interviews are still coming in.  I have been asked to come in this Thursday, and received another for mid-November (it's a government job, so I'm not put off by the length of time).  

Obviously, my goal is to have a position for when I graduate in December.  The internship hasn't (understandably) guaranteed anything, but if they did, I wouldn't have a problem staying there.  I know that nothing is absolute when looking for positions, but should I still be taking all the interviews that I can get?  Should I get through the process with the first four companies, and see where I end up?  I don't want to screw myself over here, but I also don't want to keep taking time off of work and school to go to interviews when I have so much potential...

I have the tendency to take work very personally.  I feel like it is irresponsible to accept an interview and cancel, or even start the process if I'm not 100% committed.  What is the proper way to handle this with HR?  Do they even care?  Should I be in touch and tell the different companies that I am interview other places?  

**TL;DR** - Gimme some tips for etiquette about handling interviews at numerous different companies, along with when to call it quits &amp; see what happens..."

Questions|Answers
:--|:--
[My favorite part of the show was definitely the near romance shared with you and Sal. I'm bummed for Sal that didn't go anywhere.  As for the questions, how much footage do you think exists of Andrew being funny as hell? Any hope for another set of episodes next summer with a new set of interns? Did you start working for Regina right away? How has that been?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1p533r/i_am_dani_snow_from_syfys_recent_reality_show/ccytpts?context=5)|Sal and I had a good time on the show, and after the show he visited me and we went on a lot of cool dates. He's a GREAT guy and REALLY knows his nerd stuff. He lives in New York though and I'm in LA, so that was the biggest reason why it didn't go anywhere, but our personalities weren't completely compatible either.
 |*Edit, forgot to answer some of it. There is a ton of footage that didn't get used of Andrew being the funniest guy alive. I seriously love Andrew, he was my favorite in the house.  We most likely won't get a season two. Were pretty sure.  I start for Regina possibly in January. Though Comikaze starts Nov 1st! So I'm helping out there too!
[*Molly just loved being around other nerds so much. The show made her look a little cray cray at times, but she honestly loved all of us and was always like WAAAHHH when we talked about us all having to leave each other after filming.*](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1p533r/i_am_dani_snow_from_syfys_recent_reality_show/ccyy3cr?context=5)|Haha, no you were so lively and ALWAYS there with a geeky quote at the right time.
[What are your thoughts on how the ""nerd culture"" was portrayed by the show? It seemed very nerd positive.  Do you have any thoughts as to how SyFy handled the marketing of the show and basically burned off the last three episodes in a bad time slot without any warning?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1p533r/i_am_dani_snow_from_syfys_recent_reality_show/ccyutg4?context=5)|I think the show portrayed real nerds VERY well. I was pleased with how everything came out.  I do not think Syfy really got what it is nerds like, as far as marketing. They called it The Real Big Bang...when most nerds I know HATE The Big Bang Theory.  Syfy was pleasant to work with, I liked everyone I met, but it's not like it's run by nerds. As for the time slot changes, I think they realized they weren't getting the ratings they wanted and were just trying to air the rest of it without canceling it.
[Hey Dani! So happy to see you win the show! (Job\) Was rooting for you!  Question - Lord Of The Rings? Yes Or No! (Do you like it\) ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1p533r/i_am_dani_snow_from_syfys_recent_reality_show/ccytif8?context=5)|LOTR! YES! I saw the Fellowship in theaters 7 times. 
[ now we move on to Harry Potter.  You just received your letter ... congrats.  Which house are you most likely to end up in, and what will be your animal of choice to bring along?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1p533r/i_am_dani_snow_from_syfys_recent_reality_show/ccyuiq1?context=5)|Kristin from the show is the biggest HP fan I know and she thinks I'd be in Gryffindor. I agree. I read the books as a kid and I always saw myself as a noble and brave kid haha. As for animal...maybe a cat, maybe an owl. Probably cat.
[You said you're a makeup artist on the show.  Do you have any pictures of stuff you've done that you're really proud of?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1p533r/i_am_dani_snow_from_syfys_recent_reality_show/ccyuki8?context=5)|I have tons! [Link to imgur.com](http://imgur.com/CBNvw) 
[Hi Dani! Happy to see you got the internship. Do you plan to keep working for Comikaze? Are you still an aspiring make-up artist? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1p533r/i_am_dani_snow_from_syfys_recent_reality_show/ccyuhuq?context=5)|I am definitely interested in doing moor makeup, I do enjoy it. I'm also interested in acting, I miss theater and haven't done much lately. I'm in LA so I may try to get into it.  I REALLY like Regina and her team, so I can see working for Comikaze for a long time. We'll see!
[HEY DANI! WOULD YOU RATHER SWEAT GREEN SLIME OR FART BLUE SMOKE??? (im asking for a friend\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1p533r/i_am_dani_snow_from_syfys_recent_reality_show/ccywquj?context=5)|Hmmm Casey...I don't think either would effect me to a terrible degree...I guess maybe I'd fart blue smoke. Ooo ooo, I know why! So when someone DOES fart and it wasn't me, no one could ever blame it on me! ""Remember guys? Mine is blue? Yeah, wasn't me.""
[If there was going to be a second season of Fangasm what would you want to see on it?  Also, if you were a producer or SyFy executive what would you have changed in season 1 and why?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1p533r/i_am_dani_snow_from_syfys_recent_reality_show/ccyvopt?context=5)|If we somehow got a second season, I'd love to see even more nerd-celebs on the show! Kristin and I kept mentioning in earshot of the producers, how much we loved Simon Pegg, and Nathan Fillion, and Neil Gaiman. Andrew's metting George Takei was a magical moment, I think people would love to see more of that.
 |If I could change anything about season 1 it would be the way it was marketed.
[What was the first show or comic character you really geeked out too?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1p533r/i_am_dani_snow_from_syfys_recent_reality_show/ccyu3o9?context=5)|I've always loved Batman, and the first comic I ever read was Gotham by Gaslight. I started to get really into him and that led me to the Justice League. I remember falling pretty hard for Green Arrow and Black Canary, but also loving Martian Manhunter.
[I have a couple questions. I NEED to know...Is cheese a kind of meat? A tasty yellow treat? Is it normal that I make it from my teet? Should I try and be discrete? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1p533r/i_am_dani_snow_from_syfys_recent_reality_show/ccyv45b?context=5)|Ohhh cheese! Cheese is a kind of beef! HHAHA we need to watch more episodes of it! 
[Have you ever seen ""King of the Nerds""? And do you like anime? If so which one's are your favorite?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1p533r/i_am_dani_snow_from_syfys_recent_reality_show/ccywveo?context=5)|I am aware of the show, but I haven't watched it. I haven't watched a lot of anime, it's not really my thing, but I did watch all of Deathnote and I liked it a lot.
[Hey there, Dani! Big fan of the show! Now it's time to answer life's heaviest question: Green Arrow or Green Lantern?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1p533r/i_am_dani_snow_from_syfys_recent_reality_show/ccytwgr?context=5)|Oliver Queen all the way. He and Dinah are my favorite comic couple EVER.
[I'm not a total geek so I can only relate to you a little bit but your show was pretty awesome.  I was pulling for you and Sal but apparently, he's too immature for you, relationship-wise.  Besides you, Andrew was my other favorite in the house.  Do you still keep in touch with him? Do you keep in touch with anyone on a regular basis from the Fortress of Fandom?  You also just tweeted you have a mancrush... who is it? and how do I make you crush on me?  Lastly, you are very pretty.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1p533r/i_am_dani_snow_from_syfys_recent_reality_show/ccyuoap?context=5)|I do keep in touch with Andrew! We both live in LA so I go see his stand up now and then and we had lunch the other day. He's a sweetheart and his GF Lisa is just as hilarious and nice. The fortress of fandom and I have a FB message we're constantly posting in and talking to each other. I love them all! I miss my girls.
 |Yes I have a HUGE crush on a guy I know...actually we're seeing each other :) He's a big geek like me! Harry Potter tattoo included.
[Have you managed any mischief with him yet? ...sorry, bad pervy joke, but I love Harry Potter.  Thank you so much for a reply.  You're energy on the show is what kept me coming back.  Congrats on the job and good luck!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1p533r/i_am_dani_snow_from_syfys_recent_reality_show/ccyv7gh?context=5)|HAHAHAHA! I'm so using that line! Thanks, I tried to be myself on the show and I'm really glad people liked me.
[What are you dressing up as for Halloween?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1p533r/i_am_dani_snow_from_syfys_recent_reality_show/ccytnm0?context=5)|I'm making an Ashley Williams costume ;)
[Evil Dead or Mass Effect?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1p533r/i_am_dani_snow_from_syfys_recent_reality_show/ccytxuv?context=5)|Evil Dead!
[Jedi over Empire?   Are you mad, woman?!?!?!?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1p533r/i_am_dani_snow_from_syfys_recent_reality_show/ccyv4xh?context=5)|Hey, the first bit of Return is what makes it for me haha. The sheer badassery when Luke enters Jabba's palace. 
[What was your favorite moment that didn't make it onto the show?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1p533r/i_am_dani_snow_from_syfys_recent_reality_show/ccyu8rb?context=5)|Oooo toughie. There was a moment when Andrew got trapped in the bathroom and I kicked in the door to get him out. A lot of good Andrew stuff didn't make it. They also didn't show the trivia challenge Regina gave us when we first met her. I'll brag and say I answered 4 correctly, I think everyone else got 2 or 3.
[What is your shoe size?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1p533r/i_am_dani_snow_from_syfys_recent_reality_show/ccytjg5?context=5)|I wear a women's size 5 shoe.
[Same as my wife!  Where do you get your shoes (she's always looking for place to get small shoes - she's 5' \) ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1p533r/i_am_dani_snow_from_syfys_recent_reality_show/ccytsk3?context=5)|Haha usually online, since a lot of stores don't carry 5's.
[Did you think you were the winner before it was announced?  You certainly seem to work the hardest.  What are your duties now at Comikaze?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1p533r/i_am_dani_snow_from_syfys_recent_reality_show/ccyu1n2?context=5)|I really didn't think I was going to win. I knew that I had without a doubt, worked hard, and that I had really surprised myself as far as what I can do, so even before the announcement, I was already very happy with myself. At Comikaze I will be assisting Regina. We'll all also be in a booth and we'll be doing a panel too!
[Really enjoyed watching all the geekiness in the Fortess of Fandom. Congratulations on your new gig with Komikaze -- most excellent. Now, from a fellow LotR lover: fan of the novel?  Fan (Or even aware of\) the excellent BBC radio production? Ian Holm voices Frodo and Bill Nighy is amazing as Sam. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1p533r/i_am_dani_snow_from_syfys_recent_reality_show/ccyu345?context=5)|Thanks! I read the books when I was younger, but the movies for me are such amazing visual and musical masterpieces, I wasn't obsessed with middle earth until I saw the first movie.
[If you haven't read the Game of Thrones books as I have what do you hope happens next season?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1p533r/i_am_dani_snow_from_syfys_recent_reality_show/ccyu72w?context=5)|I'm not sure! I have given up on making predictions about GOT. I just hope that Arya gets to whatever family members she has left. I also hope she exacts some revenge.
[I just wanted to say that you're beautiful and you were great on Fangasm. I thought you and Sal were awesome together and I felt bad for him during the last episode when all you guys had to leave. I do have one question: is there going to be another season of Fangasm or is the show finished?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1p533r/i_am_dani_snow_from_syfys_recent_reality_show/ccyzun3?context=5)|Thank you very much! There will most likely not be a second season.
[ question. I'm honored.  Who wins in a fight to the death? Deadpool vs Spiderman. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1p533r/i_am_dani_snow_from_syfys_recent_reality_show/ccytirc?context=5)|Deadpool vs Spiderman? Tough, Spidey has such great abilities. I feel like thair banter would be good but Deadpool would be more inclined to fight dirty, and possibly win.
[Has anyone ever pointed out to you that if Daenerys Targaryen married Jon Snow she'd be referred to as Dani Snow?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1p533r/i_am_dani_snow_from_syfys_recent_reality_show/ccyuamu?context=5)|Ummm...actually no. WOW!

[Before I give you my question, I would like to say that you and Andrew were my favorite people on the show from the first episode until the very end, I told Andrew the same thing. My comment and question is about Doctor who, so I have been watching the show about as far back as I can remember, I stayed at my grandmothers house in the summer and weekends a lot as a kid because my mom had to work a lot, my grandmother lived out in the country and only had 11 channels, one of them being PBS and on PBS I found Tom Baker, so he was my first Doctor, I have been a fan every since, so I have a couple of questions, first who was your first Doctor?  Who are your 3 Favorite Doctors?  Who are your 3 favorite companions?  Do you have a Favorite moment in Doctor who?  Do you have a Favorite episode? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1p533r/i_am_dani_snow_from_syfys_recent_reality_show/ccz5r4r?context=5)|Thanks! The first Doctor I ever saw was David Tennant, he is forever my Doctor. I have only seen episodes here and there of the older series, but I really like Peter Davidson! Three fav companions would be Martha, Rory, then Rose. Favorite moment in Doctor Who is hard...David Tennant when he absorbed the radiation in Smith and Jones and expelled it into his shoe, Matt Smith shouting at spaceships from Stonehenge. Favorite episode might be The Doctor's Daughter or The Girl in the Mirror.
[Hi there! First, I know I'm late to this but I had a question I don't anyone had asked which I'll get to in a moment. Second, I really dug the show. Even with some of the editing, you guys all came off as cool and likable individuals. Congrats on the job! Third, my question. As an aspiring make-up artist, have you seen/do you watch SyFy's other reality competition show, *Face Off*?  If yes, who are you rooting for this season and would you considering going on the show?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1p533r/i_am_dani_snow_from_syfys_recent_reality_show/ccz5vyy?context=5)|Thank you! I have watched SO much Face Off! Season 1 was my favorite but I learn things each season. I rooted for Tate season one, and this season, I am all Tate again. He's my favorite artist. I couldn't go on Face Off, I can paint and apply prosthetics fairly well, but I do not sculpt or mold them. I think I would be ok at sculpting and molding, but the formal training I had included far more on-set and out of kit makeups.
[Hi Dani! I absolutely loved the show - and congratulations on getting the job, you absolutely deserved it. How did Syfy go about casting Fangasm? As in, how did they find you all? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1p533r/i_am_dani_snow_from_syfys_recent_reality_show/ccyvgxu?context=5)|Thanks! I got an email from a friend almost two years ago that had a link to an appellation for a syfy show about geeks/nerds. I applied and they liked me, but it wasn't until I'd moved out here to LA that they started bringing people in for interviews. I saw about a hundred other nerds the day I went in for casting, they had a lot of interesting people.
[Are we ever going to get access to the podcasts you guys were recording during the show?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1p533r/i_am_dani_snow_from_syfys_recent_reality_show/ccytt76?context=5)|Syfy has those podcasts, so it's really up to them whether they'll release them or not. 
[One more thing: Seeing you pitch your comic book idea inspired me to work on an idea of my own. Do you have any tips for developing a comic/graphic novel? Any tips for moving to LA and breaking into the business? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1p533r/i_am_dani_snow_from_syfys_recent_reality_show/ccyulyy?context=5)|I don't really have any tips other than really look at stories (movies, books) that have elements that blow you away and use those as inspiration. What business are you trying to break into?
[Thanks! I want to develop a story (I think it would be best as a graphic novel\). Seeing the Stan Lee Fangasm episode really inspired me to go for it, so right now I'm looking into internships at comic book publishers so I can get to know the business and make some connections.  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1p533r/i_am_dani_snow_from_syfys_recent_reality_show/ccyv7sr?context=5)|Ooo, yeah I really have no idea how that works, but I do know that companies do hear pitches now and then, so write write write, and start sending the stuff to comic companies.
[What are you selling?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1p533r/i_am_dani_snow_from_syfys_recent_reality_show/ccyv2qj?context=5)|ADVENTURE.
[You have such a refreshing and positive personality from what I saw on the show. Which species do you think you would be on Star Trek? Do you have a favorite?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1p533r/i_am_dani_snow_from_syfys_recent_reality_show/ccyur7h?context=5)|Thanks! Good question! I'm only on TOS of Star Trek, so I'm still learning about it all. I would be a human, but I'd most likely fall for a Vulcan. I do like the Vulcans haha.
[Hi there Dani! First off, congrats on getting the job!  What is your official title at Comikaze? What's it like working for Stan Lee?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1p533r/i_am_dani_snow_from_syfys_recent_reality_show/ccytr0b?context=5)|Thanks! I will be Regina's assistant. I haven't worked for Stan directly yet, but I just can't wait. He's the SWEETEST guy!
[Aside from LOTR and Game of Thrones ... are there any other Fantasy type series of books that you've read?  Maybe the Sword of Truth series (they made that into the Legend of the Seeker TV show\)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1p533r/i_am_dani_snow_from_syfys_recent_reality_show/ccyv3v1?context=5)|Nope, haven't read it. I read most of the Redwall series by Brian Jaques growing up, it really shaped my love for fantasy.

Inquiring minds want to know!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1p533r/i_am_dani_snow_from_syfys_recent_reality_show/ccz9mk3?context=5)|Hmmm I feel like I'm naturally a Charlotte, but I've been acting like a bit of a Jessie lately!

1p59rh,139,2013-10-24,Petty revenge in the wonderful world of film,FilmYak,pettyrevenge,https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/1p59rh/petty_revenge_in_the_wonderful_world_of_film/,"When I first got out of school, I got a job freelancing as a PA on commercial shoots. A PA -- production assistant -- is the lowest rung on the ladder. It's a shitty job with crappy pay, but you get real-world experience on set. And by commercial shoot, I'm talking 35mm film, full crews, budgets ranging from $50k - $300k per shoot day. This was back in the mid 90's. 

So I get in with this one prodco (production company). They basically get the ad treatment from the agency, and put together a proposal. ""We will shoot it like this, for $x, with this director.""

This one company was a small but successful regional player, and they had lots of jobs, so I tended to work 3-5 days a week for them as a freelancer. I worked my ass off, doing tons of work I loathed, but I did it well and without complaining and they kept hiring me. Meanwhile, I was learning first hand about film shoots. 

The woman who hired me -- I don't remember her name, let's call her PC, because she was the production coordinator. She was a decent boss, no issues, and she liked my work so I was steadily employed. 

Until one day, something happened on set. I didn't do it, but I was there and I immediately fixed the problem. Not a big deal, but it ruined a single take as they were shooting when it happened.  Even though I had fixed the issue and not caused it, I was blamed for it by the director. He said I was a pain-in-the-ass overall because I was always around and trying to see what was going on.  Which is true, but I also stayed out of the way. 

Anyway, he told PC to stop hiring me based on the incident, and she said she would talk to him when I explained my side of the story. She never did, and my work dried up immediately.  Every time I called, she said she hadn't talked to him but would soon. In reality, she was done with me. 

Luckily, I got in with another director, who worked for the largest prodco in the city. I had interned for the prodco before my days as a PA, and they liked me, so now I was their pa. Director saw I was always hanging around and, instead of being pissed, took me under his wing. 

And then the head of the prodco left the company, and  the guy I used to intern for was promoted to head of the company.  He offered to train me to learn his previous job. That was a huge promotion, but he saw my potential and hard work and wanted to take a chance on me. Now it was suddenly my responsibility to bid on jobs, figure the budget, sell the company.... It was a massive learning opportunity and I stayed with them for three full years. 

Well guess what? About 6 months before I left, PC ended up getting a job there as a sales rep. She had to come to me to run budgets. That was my job, so I never screwed her over, but I was plain rude to her for the entire time. She told me I used to be much nicer. I replied that I was still nice to everyone else who didn't drop me for no good reason. 

I was rude to her until the day I left the company. Haven't seen her since.  And I'm still friends -- almost 20 years later -- with the director there, and the guy who hired me to take over his old job. 

Tl;dr. I got petty revenge on someone.

So basically, I am not a beginner Java developer, but I am just confused and stuck on where to go from here to further my education in Java and algorithms and data structures. I have started reading a textbook called Into to Algorithms because I've heard a lot of people say you should understand data structures and algorithms when you hope to get an internship and actually mastering the specific language is not that important considering not all companies use Java.

Any tips on how I can get started at home and get into some stuff that I can do after school? I dont even have an IDE downloaded to my computer right now, but I plan on joining GitHub. My problem is I dont know how to start a project or just how to go about getting the wheels rolling considering I am not that great at Java yet.

1p57jp,3,2013-10-24,What is the least worst time to have a year long break from CS studies?,norsul,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1p57jp/what_is_the_least_worst_time_to_have_a_year_long/,"Hi guys! I would like to apologise for the rather vague title, but the issue is a little complex and requires more explanation than what I could fit into the title.

So here is some background information to explain the situation - I am a Finnish student doing a CS degree in the UK, and I intend to stay here after I graduate (I'm far from finishing my degree, I just want to start planning as soon as possible). In Finland military service is mandatory and can take up to one year to complete, however, you can choose when you are going to do it. I chose go to university before going to the army, which now seems like a mistake, but the past is the past. The CS degree structure in the UK is usually a 3-year bachelor's degree and a 1-year masters degree (masters is of course, optional, but I want to do it).

Now I can finally come to the question. I have a choice between doing my military service after the bachelor's degree and before masters, and doing the military service after I'm finished with my masters. The advantage of the first method is that it is possible to continue straight into a job, and I would imagine that employers would prioritise people who haven't spent a year doing something other than CS. The disadvantage of it is that I will miss the opportunity to do an internship between my bachelor's and masters, which seems to be the best time to be doing internships since you already have some kind of degree. The second method obviously has the opposite pros and cons - possible to do an internship before masters but would have to have a near year long gap before going for a job.

So my question is, which option do you think is the least worst? Either way I lose something valuable, I just do not know enough about the industry to know which decision is better. I should also note that in the Finnish army there is some free time during the evening and you are sent home for the weekends, so I can maintain my coding skills and such, but an employer won't know this before they allow me to get to the assessment stage."
1p570b,0,2013-10-24,"I believe people who can't get jobs after college didn't work hard enough, CMV",no-strings-attached,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1p570b/i_believe_people_who_cant_get_jobs_after_college/,"I believe that those people who complain about not being able to get jobs simply didn't work hard enough and/or made poor decisions regarding careers. While the economy is bad and it is not as easy for everyone today to get a job as it was for their parents, if someone really wants to be successful they can. 

The people who are having trouble finding jobs are those that did not go to top universities. This is likely due to the fact that they didn't work as hard in high school or were not smart enough to get top marks. Many top universities have generous financial aid packages so money should not be an issue. Some even offer full rides to students who are smart enough to make the cut but do not have the money. 

From there, if an individual majors in a lucrative field (think computer science or engineering) and works hard to get good grades while making the most of their college experience (ie: getting internships, participating in extra curricular activities, taking on leadership positions, networking, etc) they will almost certainly get a job. 

It is an entitled view that everybody that goes to any run of the mill college should get a job. If these people really wanted it they had the power to achieve it and were just lazy. There are also thousands upon thousands of jobs available and these people who complain are not tapping into all of the resources they could be to get hired. 

So while I agree that it is harder to get a good job today than in previous generations, it is the fault of the individual for not working hard enough/not being intelligent enough to get a job. 

I hold this view as someone who came from a very depressed area (ranked one of the poorest in the US) with uneducated parents (think grocery store workers) who has worked her ass off her entire life to get into a top university. I worked my ass off in college to make my resume awesome and have gotten many amazing job offers. CMV. 

Edit: Hey guys! Figured I should edit my post because a lot of people seem to misunderstand my argument (sorry if it's poorly written!). I agree that not *every* person can do these things and succeed because of the way the job market is today. My view is hinged around the individual. Any given individual, but just an individual rather than the whole collective. Though who knows what would happen if every individual did perform outstanding. Perhaps they would be able to create new markets of jobs that would actually benefit the entire collective and nobody would be unemployed? (Note: the last two sentences were musings that are not part of my view that needs changing)"

I put a wedge between us when he started living with two girls that first year.  The summer was great but then Autumn arrived. He lives about 2 hours away wheres he attends college.  In my defense,, one of the girls was very strange and really pushed my buttons on purpose.  And my SO would harmlessly play along and he promised it was harmless, but it was enough to keep me awake at night and picture what weird advances she might be making.  This was the first problem in this new relationship.  His major also made him THE ONLY male in his classes.  We worked through a lot and stayed with each other even though we started the make-up/break-up cycle.  During this phase,   I understood that if he wanted to cheat on me he would have done it.  And I believed him when he told me nothing ever happened or ever would.

The next year he lived with his guy friend which definitely made me feel less threatened.  But he was still the only male in alllll of his classes.  Which also meant group projects and library meet ups, all of which pounded more insecurity into my head.  I should mention that this is the longest relationship I've had and the first time  I felt real love for a man romantically.  I am also very attractive and have been blessed with natural blonde hair and ice blue eyes.  There is no reason for me to be insecure with myself. I have come to understand that these are irrational feelings.  My past, more adolescent boyfriends (3) all cheated on me.. So I kept seeing it happen again with my current SO (i have since learned not to let my past control my present and future) So all this being away from him while he was going to class and meeting up with his fellow female students made me feel so extremely jealous. Especially after he told me his friends cousin (known to be promiscuous) was tutoring him.  I vocalized my feelings but it made it worse because he would get upset that I didn't trust him.  It dug the wedge further.  Another issue that came up was that he was diagnosed with HPV.  I was tested 3 times and still remain clean.  So i assumed he was cheating but he insisted that he has no idea why it surfaced because he has not been with anyone else..  I know that this disease can take a long time to surface so we worked through it together.

School ended and when summer came I was so excited to have him be in the neighborhood to hang out with, but what happened was that he felt like I was asking too much of him to hang out so much.  I would plan dates, but he would always bail if and when something came up with his friends who were also coming home from school.  I was a receptionist and he was a messenger and intern kinda at the same law firm.  We would commute to work and eat lunch together, but when I got home from work I still wanted to hang out, but he would want to go to his friends, saying that we hung out all day,, but I didn't see working together as hanging out.  He texted me one night and after a good text fight he finally texted "" I need time. Im sorry"" I didn't want to push it because any further texting would be crazy talk after someone tells me they need time..

I turned into an emotional wreck hanging out in his sweatshirt and crying about how the sky reminds me of my SO and eating my feelings.  

About a week and a half of always looking for him on the train to work or during lunch hour,, he caught me in the hallway and said ""Hey! My friend thats coming home is having a party.  Want to go?"" My eyes lit up and I cooly said ""sounds fun, call me"".   He never called.  Im a mess again. 

After that weekend he did call me and his choice of guilty phrases made me realize he did something with another woman.  I met up with him and sure enough he told me he was with someone.  He had sex with the girl that was tutoring him which is also his friends cousin which meant she would always be a part of his life. He also did not use protection which meant he could have given this girl HIS STD or she could have given him another one.  And also,  she could be pregnant.   Pulling out is not a sure thing.  Pre Cum is still Semen.  I was devastated because all my nightmares came true and I was one of those girls that couldn't have a fairytale relationship with this person I thought would never do this to me. I listened to all the gruesome details and how he was drunk and how they just ""fell"" on each other.  And how im so much better and that he wanted to see what was out there and he now realizes I am the one he wants in his life. But i kept remembering how this girl would always be his friends family and when his friend came home,  she would be there and so would my SO. I wanted to forgive him and we started working on it.  I had my fits of crying and questioning and then he stopped wanting to deal with it and wanted me to get over it.  So now the wedge was completely in and I was constantly questioning his behavior.  He said we were broken up at the time. but i know thats BS because all he texted me was that he needed time.  And he asked me to go to the same party he ended up cheating on me at.  And slept next to her after they had sex even though he insisted right after he came he regretted what he had done.   And when I questioned him about how much he drank I never got a straight answer. He admitted to making a conscious decision though.  

We stayed together going through more of the make-up/break-up cycle when I would get jealous and he would get fed up with a trustless relationship.  About 6 months ago he broke up with me (coincidently after a trip i wasnt invited to because it was a guy thing) In his defense I understand guys need their things, but we were going through a rough week  (and i had just lost a second uncle, both of whom had a courageous battle with cancer) and I didnt want his friends to bash our relationship.  And this girl he had sex with was my SO's friends smoosh and he didn't know about it!  And of course he came home and broke up with me.  That was it for me.  I completely stopped talking to him and about a month and a couple heartfelt emails we started texting and still fighting because I was so heartbroken.  

After hanging out and getting close quick.  I admitted that I was with someone because we were going to be intimate again. He asked questions and i told him I did have sex with this guy. I used protection and it was a very formal agreement I had with this guy that we dont exchange numbers and we both were tying to move on from an ex.  He wasn't from this country and we only saw each other one night.  My SO was so upset and jealous and sad that I didnt think I would be with my SO again.  He was so mean and his words were making me feel like a slut and he was comparing it to when he cheated.  But both times he broke up with me and we hadnt spoken in a month this time.  I explained how I never thought he would want to be with me and if I had known I would have made decisions differently. He got over it after time and we continued to get close again.  

We started to hook up after another month of odd texting and now he is home for 2 months so we are kind of picking things up again.  He told me about the vacation he took that i kept buggin him to take me on and I was mad but continued seeing him because I really love the kid,,  i asked if he had been with anyone and he said no.  I ask for health reasons not just jealousy,, jealousy did rear its ugly head when i invaded his privacy and trust and I snooped on his phone and found pics of 2 girls. 

I confronted him this morning and he told me that one was a friend from HS (dont know why she sent him pics still) and the other girl was from his trip with his friends.  I asked him about the girls and he admitted to making out with this girl on his trip but nothing else happened and that she texted him this pic.  I was devastated because I dont know if he's lying about doing anything else with her.  And after he grilled me for being honest about who I was with. I was afraid of the answer, but i am upset that he lied and grilled me when I was honest about who I was with.  

I am at my wits end with this relationship.  I dont want to give him up because I am so attracted to him mentally and physically,  i want to have his kids and be a supportive love in his life, but all these jealousy issues are dragging both of us down at such a young age.  Im almost waiting for him to be out of school , but i dont know what the real issute is,, my jealousy or the decisions he is making or has already made. 

Or should I learn to move on and stop making everything complicated and be happy with good sex and fun times? Or is my dignity being stepped on?  Please help.. I am going to be talking to him tonight and I don't know how I should approach because I don't know what I want.

Sincerely,
A jelly bean"
1p4wlm,0,2013-10-24,"What is this ""passion"" for computer science?",if_ii_equals,AskComputerScience,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskComputerScience/comments/1p4wlm/what_is_this_passion_for_computer_science/,"I am a current computer science student and have been attending college for a little over 2 years now.  I decided to become a student, not for this passion of computer science, but that I thoroughly enjoyed the puzzled that came along with computers and that I wanted a deeper understanding of them.  I attended lectures about the computer science field, and it sounded like something could always keep my interest as a career because of the brain work and constant learning.

However, for the past few years of attending school, I've noticed that you have to have this ""passion"" for it.  I can tell my colleagues have that passion for it, but sometimes hearing about this ""passion"" too much makes me feel like I don't have it.  Prior to my studies at college of computer science, I had little knowledge of how computers completely worked, how programming actually worked and even what RAM really was.  I could however, do simple IT work, such as fix software issues, windows issues, format and build computers.  This was all self-taught, but nowhere near how much my colleagues know and how much they had taught themselves.

At this point in my life, I have nearly no time to do computer science projects.  I work and go to school full time.  I'm currently in my calculus and engineering physics series and it takes up all of my time.  I do have projects I would like to work on, such as open source programming and some hardware/sofware work with Arduino and the Raspberry Pi.  However, these projects slowly are worked on and just sit there in the back of my mind or on paper.

Now my doubts for myself come from that I have other passions in life too.  Computer science, and science in general are not the only things I enjoy.  I feel as if I have a different passion for computer science than other people.  It's one of many passions, and I truly do enjoy it, but I just don't understand this constant ""passion"" over computer science.  Sometimes I see it as kind of an obsession from some of my colleagues, and I don't ever think I would be that type of person to constantly be tinkering with computers.

So, I'm just curious, from those who work in this field, if you can explain this passion for computer science a little more.  I feel as if college has given me a skewed point of view on this.

In addition, how does a company(for jobs, internships) expect me to work on projects, attend school full time and work?  I'm confident that I would be a great employee, but I don't have the experience or knowledge others have yet."

I have always known I was gay and I was never really confused on what I liked. That being said, growing up in a Hispanic culture I never really felt safe to come out for the obvious fears that we all share (becoming a paria, being rejected by loved ones, etc etc) But this last September I finally came out to one of my girl cousins and she couldn't have been more supportive, that first step was the hardest but it was an amazing feeling getting it off my chest. Just some background info, I don't live in my home town (El Paso, TX) any more. I live with my older brother in a small college town north of Dallas, now me and my bro have always been close we party together we have the same friends and we almost always get along, he even got me an internship at the company he works for. So for obvious reasons I have always thought he was the most important person I needed to tell, ironaclly I was scared to tell him the most. So fast forward two months and two other confessions to my close friends, about a week ago I finally told my brother.... And suprise surprise.... Turns out he knew, he didn't care and he said it never would change anything between us (he is a great brother), now all of our friends know since I had the support of my older bro to tell them, and everyone has been really awesome about the whole thing. Now my question to you bros is what's next? Obviously I still need to let my other family members know, but now im not alone on this and I'm pretty sure they are going to be just like my brother. But I don't know where to go from here, I've never been in a relationship and have messed around on the DL for being scared I might be outted. I'm tired of hookups and I want something more but I don't know how to approach the situation. Where do I go from here? All my life I've been pretending to be something in not and now that I don't have to, what's next?"

I'm a 22 year old man with a substance abuse problem.  I also run a small business selling guitar equipment.  

About a week ago, my girlfriend started questioning my happiness and my sanity.  Her and I dated for about 7 and a half months.  We concluded that I was too busy with my school work, and I wasn't happy so we broke up.  

It all started when I was denied an internship at a hospital that I have worked for years to obtain.  My self esteem was crushed.  I have always been slightly sad for various reasons but this really hurt.  I have been drunk and on various substances pretty much the entire time since the moment I've received the letter saying I didn't get the internship. Now I am currently considering dropping out of my program and doing something completely different.  

Alcohol and I have an interesting relationship... I drink a lot and I try to be responsible by attending all my classes and whatnot.  I have been addicted to various substances since I was 15 years old.  Being sober is just boring to me.  Although I feel like if I had an awesome laboratory job, I would have a lot more motivation to be sober.  

 I am physically active, I go to the gym, ride my bike, run, ect.  Although I have been slacking a lot lately, I usually just don't have the energy to go to the gym.  

I'm also pretty good looking.  This super cute girl from one of my classes wants to hang out with me this weekend.  I just went through a break up but I'm hoping I can get a little action with this girl.  

I'm just sad,  I have had about 5-6 shots of vodka and it's not even noon.  I just failed a diagnostic microbiology exam.  I run a small business which is great but I am currently too depressed to leave my bed to go to the post office where I have to mail some business related items to the customers.  I have class in an hour which I'm not going to because I feel like junk.  (I've skipped less than 5 classes in my entire life)  

I feel stupider..  I have always considered myself pretty smart, but recently I have just felt super dull.  I'm just not acting like myself which is scary, I'm normally very mellow and easy going but now I'm super stressed, anxious and sad.  

I really hope I get out of this funk.  "
1p4or4,2,2013-10-24,"Questions about thematics, under grad research, and grad school.",[deleted],EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/1p4or4/questions_about_thematics_under_grad_research_and/,"Hey all!

Some background information: I am a junior engineering student, on track to graduate in may 2015.  Currently, I have a 3.73 GPA and have to start making some decisions fairly soon and I was hoping to get some opinions from fellow engineering students.


Firstly, I have to choose a thematic to focus my studies on for my senior year.  This essentially just means I will take 4 or 5 classes that focus on the areas below.  The choices are:

1. Thermo/Fluids
2. Mechanical Systems
3. Business

Now, I know I should choose whichever field interests me more, but is that really all there is to it?  How much of an effect will this decision have in my job search? Specifically, how would it be viewed to take business courses?  Do engineering firms like to see that business background, or is it looked down upon?  From the few professors I've asked, they have all pretty much told me that business is boring, and the people who choose the business thematic are the people who couldn't cut it as an engineer.  But people I've asked who are engineers tell me it would be beneficial to take the business route because they like to see that.  So, any thoughts would be helpful on the difference in the jobs I would be doing with those thematics, as well as how companies view business.


As far as plans after graduation, I had always been told by current engineers that I should just get a job right away, and the company would pay for my masters if they wanted me to have one.  However, after discussing it with my adviser and other professors, they've told me to go to graduate school, and at least get my masters, but probably also my PhD.  Thoughts on this?  How much do companies like to see a masters, and a PhD, and how large of a difference of job quality and responsibility between bachelors, masters, and PhD?  And although I'm not in this purely for the money, I am interested to hear the differences in salaries for someone with a bachelors, compared to masters and PhD.  I know it varies, but a general idea would be helpful.  


And if I were to decide I wanted to go to graduate school, it's my understanding that it is far more beneficial to have undergrad research on my resume than internships.  So should I be focusing on finding undergrad research projects for the summer instead of an internship? 


I know that's a lot of questions, but I'm really just trying to gain as much information as possible on the subjects before I make a decision.  Thanks for taking the time to read this and hopefully answer some of my questions!"
1p4mla,2,2013-10-24,Ex is depressed after dumping me. What should I do?,throwawilbur,askgaybros,https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/1p4mla/ex_is_depressed_after_dumping_me_what_should_i_do/,"Jack* and I were together for 10 months long distance and were each other's serious first time as a gay couple while he was still closeted. We were long distance because he had to withdraw from school for depression-related issues and spent the remainder of the year at an internship in another state. Meanwhile, I was one semester away from graduating and trying to figure out where to start ""the real world."" During our LDR he was re-enrolled and I founda job in a major city near our (now his) college town. 

Shortly after returning to school this fall Jack realized he wanted to have the ""college experience"" after all and, after waiting for a very long time to discuss this with me, he boxed me out for a week before letting me know his final decision. I was hurt that, after 10 months, we couldn't have an actual conversation about how he felt. It was also apparent that love wasn't being reciprocated as much from his end. I personally took the breakup rather well. Instead of severing ties with Jack I told him I'd be there for him as a support whenever he needed me-if at all-despite the way he hurt me.

Jack also has an avoidant personality where, the more you put pressure on him, the more he pushes you away and then blames you for the reason he's avoidant. This, too was a big part of our internal conflict, because I wanted him to be better at communication and reciprocation.

**Last week Jack posted on /r/depression about how he's backsliding into the same depression he felt last year, not doing well in school, and smoking cigarettes again.** I want to help him, but I don't want to appear desperate and continue driving him away through my persistence, and he already knows that I'm here for him if he wants to talk. A huge part of me still cares for him and I see his post as a cry for help. I'm afraid of the worst happening, but I feel powerless and that it's no longer my place or battle. 

What should I do? Should I try reaching out to him again or let him go and deal with it?

We are happy, and have the normal peaks and valleys of any long term relationship. If you need more background on this, please ask.

Since we married he has been job hunting. Before this offer the most he had was internships. This amount exceeds all our purposed budget sheets by 30k. We frankly have no idea what to even do with this much money, and plan on just getting a better flat and putting 2k in savings every month. We also will be giving 2.5% pre-tax to charity. Once I begin working after I finish my programme come May 2014, I plan on giving at least 10% of my salary to my parents. This part we shall figure out with time, but is this good? How do people who makes this much usually spend their money? This isn't our issue though- just asking for a bit of fiscal advise. 




---




***Our issue is how do we go from here socially.*** Most of our friends are dirt poor. The ones who aren't that bad, can most def not afford to put 2k per month towards savings. Should I hide how much my husband makes, and say we got a good deal on the flat we move to to lower that price as well? How do I go about doing that? His last internship was 13$ per hour, and my last job was 8$ per hour to put things into perspective. I'm almost scared, what if they stop being our friends? They mean so much to me, I love them almost like I love my husband. I'm so very lost.



How do we not let this go to our heads? How do we not waste this opportunity? Are they any how-to guides on going through such a big socio-eco increase launch thing? 




---




The biggest thing though is how can I be a good wife to him? He will be working so hard, and does not want him to work until I finish my programme now since we can afford that circumstance. I've never been a housewife before. Is that what I'll be? What do housewives do? How can I be there for him after he worked a 50-60 hour week? How can I learn to be without him for so many working hours?




I have my own life outside of my husband, at the moment we don't even live together as he was job hunting but will asap since we can afford it now, but I have never been in a situation where a partner pays for my rent+food+etc. It's such a big change. My husband has paid for my groceries before, but It's always been a give-and-take. These last 4 months I've been doing the lion-share of the spending because he was jobless. Now we'll be be at a point that I cannot pay back. I can't pay him back for forking over 2.5k in rent. I can't pay him back for buying ALL our food or anything. God, he'll be paying for my fucking mobile! I plan on getting a non-smartphone for him to pay because of that. I'll fine some old ""dumbphone"" to use, and save the smartphone for when I can pay for it. I'm not going to ask him for clothes unless I need something nice for an interview. I'm not going to ask for books or movies or stupid shit. I'm not a child who will be unappreciative. But.. the rent.. god the rent. Help me please. 



Please? How does this work?!




**tl;dr**: My husband and I just jumped from our working class circumstances where we debated for 2 hours if we could afford an 8$ date once a fortnight to him making 90k. I'm scared and do not know what to do. I just want to make this work. I have no friends to talk to since they're all fucking poor like I am, or was(?). How can we not let money affect our marriage, our friendships, or just our live in a detrimental way? How can I be a good housewife or whatever that shit is called? How can I get use to any of this? I'm scared. Summarize with a tldr!"

I wasn't really expecting this and because of being busy I wasn't able to get back to everyone.  I did message some of you back, but I dropped the ball on responding to everyone.  For that, I apologize.  With that said though, I actually am now looking for interns!  Please note that this is not a paying job at first.  I will need to make sure you know what you're doing, gain your trust, and know you're a hard worker.  This may take a week, or it may take years.  If you put in the work, you will be rewarded.  Let's get started with the basic requirements!

1. Be familiar with Pro Tools (knowing hot keys is a huge plus), Kontakt, Melodyne, and Autotune.  Also, please be at least a little familiar with Cubase because I slip edit live drums with it.
2. Know how to use and setup microphones, preamps, and compressors. This requires knowledge of gain staging. Knowing how to use a patch bay is a plus.
3. Play guitar, sing, or both.  Drums are a plus.
4. Have some basic music theory.  Theory nerds are a huge plus.
5. Willing to put in a lot of work to help bring artists/bands in. This means going to live venues with or without me and also getting in contact with bands via facebook or other social networking websites.

Extra skills worth mentioning in your PM:

1. Know how to program drums, bass, or effects via Kontakt, Omnisphere, or Trilian.
2. Know how to riff build, tune chords, and quantize guitars/bass via elastic audio in Pro Tools.
3. Know how to quantize drums via slip editing in Cubase.
4. Know how to tune vocals in Melodyne and/or Autotune.
5. Are a guitar or keyboard wizard.

1p41k9,1,2013-10-24,Casually seeing this great guy (25M) but I (25F) feel our lack of communication might be a dealbreaker?,[deleted],dating_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1p41k9/casually_seeing_this_great_guy_25m_but_i_25f_feel/,"So before I start my posting, I'll throw out some bullet points (and sorry for the long ramble):

* I am an overthinker. Sometimes, I wonder if I'm just insane.
* Yes, we've already had sex. I tend to be someone who rushes into things.
* We have opposite work schedules where I work Tues - Sat and he works Wed - Sun. (He'll wake up around 5:30 a.m. to go to work while I normally go to bed around 5 a.m.)

So I've been casually seeing this guy for about a little over a month now after meeting on OKC. But we've only seen each other once every two weeks. To be honest, I'm not entirely sure if this works for me. Mostly because he is awful at responding to my text messages. So, it's really hard to feel any connection when I go so long without seeing him and without really talking to him. Even worse, when I don't get a response within a timely manner, I start to wonder things -- mostly if I sent the wrong thing, if he's out with someone, if he died, etc.

Thing is, even in the beginning, he was slow to get back to me. While trying to set up our first meeting, it took him six hours to respond. He claims he just isn't a big texter. He doesn't text at work (he works at a bakery/cafe) and he doesn't always have his phone with him. The three times we've hung out have always resulted in a sleepover and have actually gotten longer each time. So through that, I have observed that sometimes he'll leave his phone in his room and then go to the living room to watch TV or play video games with his roommates for a few hours, etc. He also once told me he feels that texting doesn't necessarily require immediate responses and that it seems people with iPhones (which I have and he does not) tend to be more responsive. 

I don't know why I'm so hung up over needing him to be more responsive with text messages -- I mean, I've been with guys who were great at responding but shitty people so, yeah. I guess it really doesn't mean much. The time we spend together is great. He's really sweet and funny, we get to know each other, joke around, etc. This past weekend, I spent 26 hours with him and he cooked us dinner. It was really nice. It feels like quality time. I know some people may assume he's just keeping me around for sex, but I really don't feel that's the case (then again, I'm posting here -- what do I know?). I've been with guys who were just in it for the sex and it feels different. Hell, if it were just for sex, I almost feel like we'd see each other more.

I did ask him how he felt about only seeing each other once every two weeks and he responded, ""I'm fine with it but it seems like you're not."" He talked about how he needed alone time sometimes, etc. And I get it. Sometimes it can be tough -- especially when you don't work a normal 9-5 Monday through Friday job -- to just find time for you. I guess, as he put it, he just wanted to keep things ""light and fluffy,"" which makes sense since we don't *really* know each other all that well. In the end, he just said, ""I like you. So stop worrying so much."" 

So I don't know what to do. I feel like I'm trying to handle this different than past relationships in the sense that I'm trying to be more patient and trying to just go with it. But yes, I do get that my first faux pas was probably sleeping with him but whatever, that's in the past now. I wanted it. He wanted it. I don't really regret it.

I've talked to him about the texting issue but it doesn't seem like much has changed. Not that he necessarily promised it would. He's going to D.C. this weekend for a family trip so I know I won't see him, which is fine. A part of me sort of wonders if I should, I don't know, just break it off or maybe see other people too? He is literally the best guy I've ever been with (he's made me breakfast, cooked me dinner, cuddles with me, etc.) but this lack of communication, of seeing each other, I just don't know if I can handle it because sometimes it just really stresses and bums me out. Then again, it's late, I had a bad day at work, maybe I'm just overthinking everything again. Maybe I should just learn to relax, get a hobby, and let everything fall into place?

Edit: I remember something he told me. A year ago, he was seeing this girl for a month or two and said it moved fast emotionally -- but then she moved out of the city for an internship and that was that. I don't know if that has anything to do with how he is now or what."
1p40ws,4,2013-10-24,M4M or M4F. 24. Another story...,throwthatawayboy44,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/1p40ws/m4m_or_m4f_24_another_story/,"I recently posted a story about my first gay experience so I figured I would elaborate and tell the story of my first threesome...

So I was 19 and I had recently moved across the country for a work internship.  At the time I had been talking on and off with this girl but she was dating some guy and I did not want to get involved.  So after a few weeks of blowing her off I get this message saying she and her boyfriend want to go out for dinner and catch up.  

Fast forward and I show up for said dinner and they had set me up with a blind date.  Maybe if the girl was right it would have been more fun but the girl they chose was just...horrible.  A classically self obsessed sorority girl.  So we have dinner and blah blah blah...basically she fucking ruined my night.  I am sitting there pushing my food around thinking of good ideas to get out of dealing with her for one more minute...she was that bad.  Finally the dinner ends and I decide to be honest with her.  Turns out the feeling was mutual and we both happily go our separate ways.  At this point I have lost faith in humanity so I am ready to go home and smoke a bowl and flip on the good ole xbox and play my tears away...but thats when this girl and her boyfriend ask me to come back and chill.

At first I sitting there thinking...they are taking pity on me because I have no friends.  Then as we get in the cab, they start to get into it.  He is kissing her neck and she is wrapping her arms around him and back and forth...and I am sitting there going from six to midnight awkwardly thinking...""shoulda got another cab...So I kinda inch away from them and look out the window pretending its not happening...but its not working.  At this point I am basically losing my shit and we are about back to their apartment so as soon as we get there I hop out and tell them I will just take a cab home and to have a goodnight.  They get out and insist and plead for me to come upstairs and that is when I really started sweating bullets.  I could just tell, and the vibe was in the air.  

We head inside and after about 30 minutes of small talk and a few shots and a bong rip they are back at it on the couch.  Only this time he is really putting it on her.  He pushed her down and took off her shirt right in front of me and then they just layed there making out taking off clothing items...then there is me...I dont know what to do...deer in headlights...My cock is rock hard but I dont want to act...what if I piss him off and he wants to kill me?  What if I weird him out if I try to do something to his dick?  What if I weird them both out because I want him to fuck me while I fuck her?

Anyways...they get down to the last item of clothing each and she stands up and walks over to me and grabs me by the hand and takes my hand and puts it down her panties.  Fuck me.  I have never been so hard/confused at once.  Flustered to say the least.  I look at her and she is smiling...I look at him and he is now naked stroking his cock smiling looking at both of us...So i just figured, fuck it. 

She takes me and we follow her boyfriend into the bedroom and lay down.  She comes over, now completely naked and sits on my face.  At this point I am not thinking rationally so I just start to go to town on her.  After about a minute of doing it someone starts sucking my cock but I cant see because my tongue is buried inside this girls pussy/ass.  I finally get a glimpse and it is her boyfriend.  He is gripping my thighs and taking my cock tip to base like it was a fucking ring pop.  It was amazing.  I smile and close my eyes and continue to eat her out while he blows me.  Then I start to want a juicy dick in my mouth.  I get out from under her and switch with him.  He sildes under and I come out and get his dick all to myself.  

I take my time and kiss it all over and lick and suck on his balls gently.  Then I licked his dick (a solid 7 inch perfection) up and down teasing him before deep throating it all the way to the base so i could lick his balls with his cock down my throat.  I go faster and faster using one hand to jack him off and with the other I slide a finger against his ass and he willingly gestures his hole to my finger so I slide it in and continue to blow him.  

He gets out from under her and  pushes me off.  We all laugh and touch each other and talk dirty for a little and then he asks how we should fuck...I didnt want to upset anyone and I am a go with the flow type of guy so I said I will do whatever you want.  He asked if I had ever been fucked before and I told him yes :).  I imagine I was beaming with happiness...just thinking of a dick in my ass makes my mouth water and my cock hard...So I lay down on top of his girl and spread her legs wide and prop them up with my arms.   I move my legs forward and push up against her and spread my legs so my ass is nice and open.  I slide inside her first and get nice and comfortable.  Then he had to work my ass a little to get his big dick in there but he did of course ;).  Then we had to figure out how to fuck and basically he just got to pound my ass from behind while I was bent over inside his girl fucking her.  He fucked me so hard I came in like 5 minutes.  He was DRILLING my prostate.  Like over and over and over and when I came it felt like a bucket full...I filled his girl up so much I could feel it leaking on my balls before I even finished cumming in her.  Then he fucked me until he came in my ass and then it was a funny cigarette after.  "
1p3zsd,0,2013-10-24,Some thoughts about my unemployed sister which have been killing me for a while.,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1p3zsd/some_thoughts_about_my_unemployed_sister_which/,"I have an older sister, she went off to an out of state college right out of highschool and after her first year she transferred and Moved back to the city where we lived. She first lived in a apartment away from us as she didn't want to move back from reasons, she had a nice pad with some financial assistance to help her pay for the apartment. She managed to get a job while being in school and constantly spoke about how hard she had it, a year or so pass and she moves back with us claiming that the rent was too expensive. *Before I go any further, anyone who lives in New York City knows how expensive rent is and would be awfully glad to get one for a few hundred bucks with no roommate*. She moves back and takes over the house and is upset to have moved back with the family(I'd be pist off too). When she moved back I find out more about her, turns out she went to school about 4 days a week and went from the morning to night. She manages to find a more better job which pays well and stays there for a while, like all people she gets tired and my father tells her that he will support her if she decides to quit. One thing I learned in my life is that my father can never be relied on and he always exaggerates his claims, after she quits that great job she struggles with money angry at my dad who claimed he would help her.

 Fast forward a few months, I never saw her study very much and always struggled to do her homework. I didn't think much of it since I too am easily distracted and procrastinate with my work(I was in high school at this time). She later on starts to find a large amount of friends around her late Sophomore Year, I found out that she's had an extravagant social life and had many ""friends"". She goes out to eat with them every night and would have get togethers, she would often take out money from my dad and take some from me but I assumed she mainly got by on financial aid and some loans. During her third year I discover that she is largely in debt because of college, I of course assume that his to do with the tuition and she starts nagging at my father for help. She made it seem like he had to help her financially and always gave a story about how her friends parents helped them financially, I tried to stay out of it. I also wanted to mention that she doesn't go out and get chinese food or anything no! her daily outing including a plate of chicken and rice for close to $20 with some hookah. She didn't have a job at this time, yet she continued to spend wildly and wouldn't stop. Her Senior Year comes and I found out that her debt has reached about 20k, I wasn't surprised at all but still I assumed that about 95% of it came from the tuition. After her graduation she was unable to find a job, she wanted to go into law but didn't have the money for it and of course my father couldn't be relied on. She went without a job for close to 2 years and finally managed to get a small job in customer service, she however quit within two weeks claiming it was to hard and the pay wasn't great.


 During my time in high school I grew awfully worried about my sister at times and wondered how I would pay for College, I was going under the college transition stress and didn't wanna end up like her. I then started speaking to my sister about things like the tuition, I was planning on going to the same university program and was worried on how I would pay. To then she laughs and says that it's free with the financial aid and low cost tuition, I was flabbergasted, it appears as though the 20k in loans was taken out for her daily outing and events with friends. Some of which she described to be terrible and not even fun. She claims that she never went through any kind of internships to better help her Resume and that he grades weren't very great. At this point I couldn't believe it, I knew she spent a lot going out but 20k in just loans for eating out. She got married close to a year ago and is currently pregnant, she still to this day does not have a job and relies on her husbands measly income. I also found out that she was taking a while to graduate because she kept on taking remedials and never payed attention in some classes. I also forgot to mention that she thought she needed a vacation so spend a few thousand dollars going to Europe and had to beg my dad for money(she resorted to her friends)

Suddenly everything I thought of her changes, I hated her with a passion. When she lived in my home, she made it worse then hell. She the kind of person who would watch TV at night and when you politely ask her to turn it down, she turns it up and opens the door all the way for you to hear. She also disregards everyones privacy, argued constantly and was very abusive. But yet I still felt bad after what *I thought* she was going through, when I found out out about the free tuition, the loans she took and her terrible credit, I honestly wanted to smack the hell out of her. Her stupidity has made me more angry than anything and I still haven't got over it. She can get a job today if she wants but she not even trying and what gets me even angrier is that she only applies to one job per month and acts like no one wants to hire her. All the time she spent at UNi was just for clubs and socializing with friends, she rarely studied.


I currently begun college with free tuition(Grateful for Financial Aid), am not taking any remedials. I'm nothing special but I'm actually trying to get my stuff done and am as frugal as can be(I get buyers remorse when I buy mcdonalds). With my financial aid I actually get a surplus amount of money that can actually last me the whole semester spending moderately as well if I wanted to. I know see that my father had also knew about the free tuition and that is one of the reasons why he never helped her, all those times I wondered why he couldn't just help the *poor* girl out and the answer was right in front of me. I never thought to see how much the tuition was, I never asked anything like that because I thought it would be rude and it just didn't come up. I don't know why I spoke about this, it just really bothered me, I had been so depressed about college all throughout high school and her abuse really took a toll on the whole family, I know I need to move on. I've learned from her mistakes I just hope all of you do too.


**TLDR:Please do not take out thousands of dollars in loans just for expensive restaurants, don't be an asshole to anyone. Don't start smashing silverware when you don't get what you want. If you're taking remedials for a long time, study up and get serious! Take internships during college, don't rely completely on your parents even if they claim they can help you financially. Don't just apply to one position a month and think that no one wants to hire you. Do not take a vacation if you don't have any money and you haven't worked hard for one and if you are a college student you should definitely not be eating at an expensive restaurant(I should be seeing you in burger kind of at most eating Chinese food).If you are unable to find a job, don't be afraid to get some help from programs,*my sister denied getting food stamps because she was too embarrassed*(forgot to mention that). Just be yourself and have fun but do so wisely, no one will bail you out of your problems.**

Disregard the errors, rushing to do this before I get some rest."

I’ve been dabbling with iOS development since 2008 when I worked as an intern at Apple Inc. At the time I really wanted to get into iPhone development, but my assigned work was in Python, so I couldn’t.

Fast forward a year, I tried to learn in college, but RIT didn’t teach it. So I taught myself, and boy was it a struggle (even as a computer science major). I used free resources and a few books, but nothing really clicked until I sat down and coded. A lot of times it was super frustrating and I didn’t have anyone to help me. The iOS SDK was full of bugs or undocumented behaviors in Xcode. FYI: For any real beginners, the Standford iOS courses were too long and totally missed the beginner audience. (i.e. they expect programming experience... yikes!) Over the years I've submitted a handful of apps to the App Store, which has been a great learning experience.

Last year I was offered an Adjunct Professor position to teach iPhone app development at RIT. It was great, but I wanted to find other creative people like me who have ideas and struggled to put the pieces together. Programming is hard, and if you don’t have a programmer friend it can be overwhelming. It’s easy to lose motivation and stop when you hit those walls. It seems like every developer goes through these struggles, but I think it can be better.

In 2012, I started teaching on iPhone Programming on Skillshare.com because it aligned with my desire to help more people. I spent a ton of time filming, editing, and planning high quality lectures and screencasts. I think you’ll enjoy free access and if you like the course, please leave feedback.

p.s. I’m happy to help direct beginners or anyone struggling to get off the ground. Right now, I’m filming iOS 7.0/Xcode 5 materials, which will be available in November. Anyone in my current Skillshare class will get free access to the new iOS 7.0 course.

1p3j6u,1,2013-10-23,"I'm really terrible at college, what should I do?",[deleted],Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1p3j6u/im_really_terrible_at_college_what_should_i_do/,"When I was a freshman I got mostly A's and some B's. However, my second semester I got really depressed because I wasn't really making any friends and I just stayed inside all day. My grades dipped into the B's and C's. The semester after that, my depression was even worse, and I thought about killing myself almost constantly. My grades dropped into the C's and D's, not because I didn't understand the material, but because I never did any work or really went to class.

After some therapy, my grades made it back up to the B/C range, and I thought that I would start doing better again like my first semester. However now, at the start of my Junior year, I'm doing terribly. I don't really understand the material for my classes, and I've already dropped one.

So now my grades are pretty much terrible. I've got a 2.7 GPA and I don't really know how I can get it to improve. I've failed two of my midterms this semester, and had to drop one of them as a result. I can't drop the other one, and it's a major course, so that's even worse. I can feel my depression coming back again, and it scares me. I actually broke down in tears outside today behind a building where no one could see me. I feel like a wreck and I don't know how to improve.

I'm a computer science major, and I'm a pretty good programmer. I've currently got a job as a programmer at school, but I think that compaines will care that my grades are so terrible and I won't be able to get internships. I don't know if I'll be able to graduate.

Now this is starting to get long and rambly, but I guess I'll stop now. I'll clear anything up if anyone needs me to."
1p3ima,2,2013-10-23,"Me [23 F] with my boyfriend [23 M] of 3.5 years, has long distance &amp; plans for moving ruined our relationship?",aloneatschool,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1p3ima/me_23_f_with_my_boyfriend_23_m_of_35_years_has/,"I apologize in advance for an extremely long story.

My boyfriend and I met in college when I was a freshman and he was a sophomore (both age 19). We immediately fell head over heels for each other and started dating about 3 months after we initially met. Things were absolutely incredible and we clicked on so many levels. After a few months, we were even talking about moving in together/marriage (which now, looking back, seems foolish). The fall semester of my Junior year/his senior year, we unofficially lived together. Everything was smooth sailing, and we got along fabulously. 

For a little background that will be important later: we both live in the same state where we went to school, (our homes are about 4 hours apart), and we would always visit each other over the summer &amp; christmas breaks. He is very close with his family, all of which live in the same town where he grew up, but I am not really close with my family. As a child, I lived all over the world and don't see it as a big deal to be apart from my family. 

In January of 2012 (the spring semester of my Junior year &amp; his last semester as a senior), I moved about 9 hours away for an 8-month internship with a fabulous company in my field. We knew we could work through the long distance, and we visited each other as often as possible (Between every 3-6 weeks, so quite often!). Every time he would come to visit me, he would always say how much he absolutely loved the area and that he would definitely move there with me if I ended up getting a full-time job there after I graduated. 

When he graduated, he took a job in a city located ~3 hours from school, ~5 hours from where I had my internship, and ~1.5 hrs from his hometown. Everything was still great, I felt like we had the best relationship in the world, he constantly talked about wanting to propose, move in together, get married, the whole 9 yards.

Enter March of this year. I was offered a full time job with the company I did the internship for (even though I don't graduate until December of this year), and he and I talked everything over. It was an incredible offer (I would make ~12K more than he currently makes), and he said I should absolutely take it and he would absolutely move down with me. So I excitedly accepted the offer.

Not even a week after I accepted the offer, he told me he was unsure about moving down. It's about a 6/7 hour drive to his hometown, and he wasn't sure if he would want to be that far away from family. I told him we could easily afford to buy plane tickets whenever since we'd be making 6 figures combined. I tried to assure him that everything would be fine. But he kept waffling - one week he'd be fine with moving down, the next week he'd say he wasn't ready. Then he would ask me if I'd go back and turn down my offer and look for a job in the city he already lived in. I told him it would be career suicide to do that, and I would never go back on an offer that I've already signed paperwork for. He admitted after a while that he was changing his mind because he had started to really enjoy his job and really didn't want to leave. All of this flip-flopping on his part led to some absolutely horrible fights. After a while, he finally agreed that he would leave his job and move down with me once I graduated in December.

Things were OK for a while over the summer, but towards the end of the summer we started arguing like crazy again because I brought up the idea of possibly wanting to move across the country in the future (We live on the east coast, but the majority of the best jobs in my field are on the west coast). He said he just wasn't ready for that kind of move since he doesn't want to be that far from his family, and that he pretty much sees himself staying on the east coast forever. I agreed and said that I'm not sure where life is going to lead me in terms of my career, so it is foolish for me to be making plans to move while I don't even have anything that would warrant a move. However, after that conversation we just ended up bickering a lot (about when he was going to move down, how I feel like he doesn't put enough effort into our relationship, how he hasn't visited my family since April but i've seen his family ~20 times since then).

After all of the fighting, he told me about 3 weeks ago that he no longer feels comfortable making plans to move down with me. He says if he is going to give up a job he loves and move away from family, he wants to make sure that I am the girl he wants to marry (he would want to get engaged soon after moving in together). And he said with all of the fighting going on, he just isn't sure if he feels that way about me now. He doesn't want to break up, but he wants to figure out how he feels before he makes plans to move down. So now I am at a complete loss for what to do. I had to look for an apartment on my own, make all the plans to move down on my own, and now we always talk about what ""I"" am going to do once ""Im"" down there, not what ""we"" are going to do once ""we"" are down there. 

We always talked about how awesome this stage of our life would be (making plans for moving in together and making plans for the future together), and now that it's here and it's not going the way we planned, it has just been really hard for me to deal with. Every time I try to talk about it with him, he gets frustrated and says we should just pretend like everything is normal so we can try to get back to the way things used to be. 

So my question to you, Reddit, is what do I do? Do I wait around for him to make up his mind? Should I realize that it probably isn't a good sign that he doesn't know how he feels about me 3.5 years into the relationship when we're only a few months away from moving in together? How do I deal with all of the sadness from feeling like everything I ever wanted/planned for with him is now all of a sudden slipping through my fingers?

---

**tl;dr**: Long distance boyfriend and I have always made plans for moving in together. Have slowly realized that we want different things but wanted to stay together anyway. Started fighting a lot because of long distance/wanting different things and now boyfriend says he doesn't know if he wants to move in together/start a life together anymore. I don't know what to do :("

Background: I am a senior seeking a spring internship in tax. I would then go back and finish one class in the summer and start the Macc program in the fall. I have already had a summer internship in industry and think public is the logical next step in my progression. My plan is to open my own tax firm someday, or do tax work for a corporation. I don't see myself staying with public accounting forever, but if opportunities arise management wise, I would definitely consider it. There is a chance that I transfer to something more related to IT, as this interests me a bit more than taxes, and is my concentration in college.

One of the firms is the #1 firm in my region (top 15 overall) (around 200m profit above the second place firm in the region). I am led to believe that I would get exposure to at least four different sectors of tax work (non-profit, fraud, health care, financial services) here - if not more. It is located in a great city, in a different state than I currently live in. I loved the people, and the office seemed a bit more laid back than the following firm. I would have to pay for housing here (for 4 short months), but I am not too worried about availability, or the cost (considering what I will be making). Again, the city was great and I think I would love living here for a short period of time (maybe even longer, I'd prefer to start a family here rather than the later city).

The other firm is big 4.  It is in a ""bigger"" city, but still small enough to only have an office of ~110 as a big four. I like the international aspect here (although I want to stay in the U.S.) and the bigger clients that they have. I think that for my future, the bigger city experience would give me more opportunities and a better chance at having success on my own. I think that I would not be as specialized as I have heard with most big 4 professionals (especially since I am just interning) -- but I would not get the 4+ sector rotation that I would get at the previous firm. I also loved the people here, and the office was cleaner, newer, and seemed more professional than the previous firm. (I am not sure if the more professional, less laid-back office culture is ideal to me, but it does not make or break the deal). I would get one last chance to live at home here, and save on housing along with some meals. The commute to work would be around 40 minutes.

Both offices are of similar size (~110), the pay is very close to the same (along with the study programs and incentives to get my CPA within a year).

I apologize for the novel, but I guess my main question is:

Is having big 4 experience THAT much more important? I just can't seem to justify turning down an offer from a big 4 firm. I prefer the city of the smaller firm, but the pay, people, office, and experience (maybe), seem very similar to me. And..I can do anything for 4 months, even if I hate it (which I don't think I will come close to either way I go with this decision). I don't believe I am going to do public accounting forever, so will I wish I had big 4 experience (and big 4 on my resume) for the future?.

I have two days to decide, and am stressing over this decision. Any help or advice is greatly appreciated. 

Thank you!"
1p3f0b,13,2013-10-23,I am a trainwreck of a computer science student. Help me.,zuuku,AskComputerScience,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskComputerScience/comments/1p3f0b/i_am_a_trainwreck_of_a_computer_science_student/,"This is where I currently stand:  
I am a computer science student in my sophomore year at a state college. I took some java courses in high school which allowed me to enter in one class ahead during my first semester, freshman year. In my CS2 class we learned a lot of java and i was excited for what was to come in future classes. my second semester comes and I take one course in which we got an introduction to C++. Fast forward to this semester, and none of my courses involve explicit coding at all.  

Here is my issue:  
I have not done any actual coding since last semester, as i was taking calculus courses over the summer. My coding skills are not commendable in any way. My resume as a computer scientist is pathetic to be quite honest. On top of that, my lack of coding has left me feeling that i know nothing. my schedule has not allowed me to attend any hackathons or gain any practical experience.  Bottom line, I need to get an internship for the upcoming summer but i have zero confidence in myself or my resume. I have not done nearly enough coding to consider myself a computer scientist.  

What I am asking for is some assistance as to how to get my ass in gear. I built a gaming desktop a few years ago that is running windows, which is not ideal at all for coding. I also do not own a laptop, which makes things very difficult when living in a dorm. What can I do to start shaping up? I don't know how to use github really but i do have an account and i am so terrible at setting up environments to code in, especially with the limitations of windows? Do i convert to linux? Do I dual-boot? where do i go from there? any specific languages i should learn first? Any help is greatly appreciated."

One is for a startup-ish company and the other is for a large defense contractor that's in my area. Both are for CS-related positions. 

Regardless of my actual position within the company which do you guys think would be best for both my resume and/or my development as a software engineer?"

[My question is how what would you suggest to raise the level of civility and discourse in politics?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1p7c2t/iaman_excongressional_staffer_ive_spent_years/cczk1v3?context=5)|First, have more questions than answers. Look at /r/politics and /r/worldnews. What a mess. Everyone has an answer. No one has a question. No one wants to know more about the topic. Minds are already made up. One side evil, the other side good. Be curious. Be insightful. Understand differences.  Finally, understand there are things you can control and there are things you cannot control. You can be mad about certain things. You can want to change certain things. But understand that actions, not words, are what actually enact change.  Instead of being mad about politics. Go register people to vote. Or better, contribute positively to your community. Mad about poverty? You can bitch about Republicans. Or you can go ladle soup at a homeless shelter. Pissed about illegal immigration and always complaining about having to ""press 1 for English?"" Go tutor some poor immigrants in English. Your ancestors were likely immigrants once too.
[Have you met the author of Capitol Hill Style?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1p7c2t/iaman_excongressional_staffer_ive_spent_years/cczkpm1?context=5)|Thanks for flagging that for me, never seen it before. Looks interesting.
[If so, what is she like in person?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1p7c2t/iaman_excongressional_staffer_ive_spent_years/cczkpm1?context=5)|On ACA. The Vitter Amendment was pretty good politics for the Republicans. What's good for the goose is good for the gander, that sort of thing. Many GOP staffers were wildly pissed that they spent two years fighting ACA and now ended up having to jump onto the DC exchanges. I think many of them took some small bit of satisfaction that -at first- they didn't have to register. A personal victory or something like that.
[Also, how did you feel about the use of hill staffers' health care as a bargaining chip during the shutdown?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1p7c2t/iaman_excongressional_staffer_ive_spent_years/cczkpm1?context=5)|Most Dem staffers acknowledged that if they passed a law changing health care for the country, they needed to change too.
[I guess I am having a hard time understanding why taking employer-paid health insurance away from congressional staffers is ""what's good for the gander."" Staffers are a group of talented, dedicated hard-working people that do much of the difficult and thankless work in the legislative branch. Somehow hitting them with a de facto pay cut is good for the country? This makes no sense to me.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1p7c2t/iaman_excongressional_staffer_ive_spent_years/cczldwt?context=5)|I don't disagree with anything you said about Hill Staff. But it felt like you wanted me to explain how ACA was received on the Hill. Did my best to answer your question.
[Hey, just to clarify, the comment above wasn't me. :\)  Also, I wanted to say that I agree with your comment that we should focus more on questions and less on answers. We learn more that way. It's something that I've thought about for a while but I've never been able to put it into words like that.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1p7c2t/iaman_excongressional_staffer_ive_spent_years/cczlswr?context=5)|Ah, got it. My mistake!
[What's the influence of lobbyists to Congress? I always hear about it but don't know anything about it.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1p7c2t/iaman_excongressional_staffer_ive_spent_years/cczh0qz?context=5)|Not much.
 |I can't tell how many times, as a legislative guy, I had to meet with some lobbyist because my boss didn't want to take the meeting.
 |Sometimes one lobbyist will come in and argue one way. Next day another comes in an argues the other.
 |We listen patiently, make sure they feel like they're heard. Sometimes they do pass along good info, like if I law could affect jobs in our district.
 |But this practice is so heavily regulated post-Abramahoff that it's neutered to the point of inanity. People still tell stories of the good old days, when the powerhouse lobbying shops would rent out Six Flags and let all Hill staffers in for free -- exclusive for staff.
 |Now staff can't even score a comped meal from them because of the regulations. Sounds like world's smallest violin, but no member in his right mind is going to change his vote because his leg assistant making $29k a year got a cheeseburger from Verizon's dude on the hill -- and the free meals was one of the ways to make a shitty, underpaid job a little more tolerable. 
[If lobbying is so ineffective, why does almost every major corporation spend millions per year on it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1p7c2t/iaman_excongressional_staffer_ive_spent_years/cczhn6y?context=5)|Well it's similar to law. A lobbyist represents a business to government in the same way a lawyer represents a client to court. If you're a multinational corporation, say Exxon-Mobile, you'll have representatives working with many governments.
 |They also throw a ton of money at non-profits and NGOs. I know a major energy company that funds hawkish think-tanks, dovish think-tanks, do gooders like Africa Relief and nuclear non-proliferation.
 |Having relationships is a good way to get intelligence. And if you're having a problem with a law, you absolutely need to inform Congress about it. Congress might not always listen, but it's simple reality.
 |BTW -- most lobbyists represent trade industries, groups of mid and small sized businesses that represent their larger interests to Congress (think agriculture, infrastructure, aerospace, etc). The whales are few and far between.
 |You would be AMAZED at how many environmental and global warming ads are sponsored by BP, Shell, etc.
[So in other words, they didn't bring a check, so your boss wasn't interested.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1p7c2t/iaman_excongressional_staffer_ive_spent_years/ccziqpf?context=5)|Kind of an unfair shot there. You don't even know who my boss is, but you already know he's corrupt and a bad person.
 |That's what I hate about politics and it's why I want to leave. Everyone assumes the worst about everyone else. It's tiring.
[I don't have to know a name.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1p7c2t/iaman_excongressional_staffer_ive_spent_years/cczivdi?context=5)|Yeah, you really do.
[On a scale of 1 to buried-a-dead-hooker-in-the-desert, what's the most illegal or unethical thing you've done for someone you staffed for?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1p7c2t/iaman_excongressional_staffer_ive_spent_years/cczgqpq?context=5)|I'm a military veteran so if someone asked me to break a law, I (hope) I'd tell them to pound sand. But even the most honest man has a point where he can succumb to greed. I wonder what mine is -- haven't met it yet.
 |Some shady shit goes down in campaigns. Southern politics are particularly sketch.
 |Edit: To wit, check out VA Gov Bob McDonnell's use of campaign donations. Currently under federal investigation for it.
[Ever worked in Chicago? Hard for me to imagine that the southerners have got us beat in corruption.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1p7c2t/iaman_excongressional_staffer_ive_spent_years/cczqp79?context=5)|Haha, that's a great point.
[So how unbearably ass backward can congress be some times? And would you say the politicians have their constituents at heart or is it a lot of bs? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1p7c2t/iaman_excongressional_staffer_ive_spent_years/cczhwoo?context=5)|It got really bad when the tea party showed up. Most members will posture belligerently in public but will be joking and back slapping their opponents on the floor or in the cloakroom.
 |The Tea Party brought a level of zealotry and ideological purity that has poisoned the well for fellow Republicans as well as Democrats. One interesting thing that came out of the Shutdown was that Republicans teamed with Democrats to shut the Tea Party out.
 |I know many GREAT members who are honorable and really do care about their people. Some are in it for themselves. I won't name names. But sometimes I'm blown away with their decency, sometimes I'm disgusted by their dishonor.
[Due respect, it's been very interesting so far, but you're an anonymous account -- can you please name some names? Who in Congress you would consider to be the most self-serving? For that matter, who in Congress would you consider the most honorable or self-sacrificing?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1p7c2t/iaman_excongressional_staffer_ive_spent_years/cczk5yi?context=5)|I will remain anonymous for reasons laid out earlier. I noted Ron Wyden and Paul Ryan as two members who really care honestly about the deep responsibilities that come with governing. Carl Levin from Michigan and Chris Christie too. There are some good ones out there.
 |And you don't need me to spot the bad ones.
[How accurate is U.S. news when reporting on Congress?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1p7c2t/iaman_excongressional_staffer_ive_spent_years/cczh954?context=5)|Pretty good. Fox News is partisan in their coverage, but their Hill producer has been around for years and is one of the best shoe-leather journalists in the business. He presses both sides hard, and has a knack for asking your boss the one question you didn't want asked.
 |Any outlet with a good Congressional reporter is high quality. I'd say The Hill, CQ, National Journal are some of the best -- they have a strong presence and are always snooping around hearings and talking to members and staff.
 |Stay away from blogs and opinion rags like Mother Jones, National Review, and ABSOLUTELY avoid the garbage they up vote in /r/politics, The Contributor and PoliticsUSA. Those guys don't have a clue and are just telling you what to think, rather than what is actually happening.
[Robert Costa with National Review was actually the best source for what was happening within the GOP during the shutdown, IMO.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1p7c2t/iaman_excongressional_staffer_ive_spent_years/cczjr2n?context=5)|He was very good, I agree. I think I'm making more of the larger point about opinion rags versus more straight news outfits. I know many Redditors don't really understand there's a huge difference between opinion and actual news.
[I am a 32 year old middle class white guy, I served 7 year in the Navy when I was younger, and now reside in Marsha Blackburn's district in Tennessee.  I have manged teams of over 80 people for work and I am interested in running for politics because I get angry at some of the things I am seeing.  Part of my just wants to run for congress and part of me wants to do something more local.  Any advice for someone getting into their first campaign?  Does the average person stand a chance at getting into Congress in your opinion? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1p7c2t/iaman_excongressional_staffer_ive_spent_years/cczjew9?context=5)|Sure man. First let me say that I think that more veterans need to run.
 |If you are a Republican or Democrat, first find the PACs that specialize in running veterans. Democrats have really made an effort at this in recent years.
 |They will give you seed money to run if they think you're a quality candidate. Make as many connections as you can at church, rotary club, key club, American legion, VFW, and with local business leaders. Let them know you're a good guy and care about Tennessee-7.
 |I would, however, recommend playing the long game if you live in Blackburn's district. Republicans and Democrats love her, she's well funded and very savvy political. Very difficult to dislodge. Wait until she retires, and then spring your trap.
[Who do you think are the some of the most productive members of congress? Who are dead weight?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1p7c2t/iaman_excongressional_staffer_ive_spent_years/cczhxnu?context=5)|Paul Ryan (R) and Ron Wyden (D). Both care about the responsibilities of governing and take it seriously. I admire both. 
[What are your thoughts on gerrymandering? Do you think it is something we should be addressing? Or just a natural consequence of our system?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1p7c2t/iaman_excongressional_staffer_ive_spent_years/cczk4hd?context=5)|It's not as bad as you think. Both sides have very strong R and D districts. Cook's Partisan Voting Index is the bible for which districts lean which way. [It's available here on Wikipedia\] (\[Link to en.wikipedia.org](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cook_Partisan_Voting_Index)) You'll see a mostly equal division between strong Dem and strong GOP seats.
[I teach politics at the college level, and I'm always looking to help my students understand the political system better.  I try and impress on them the importance of understand electoral trends, committee work, and policy details, and guide them away from the big, sexy gestures.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1p7c2t/iaman_excongressional_staffer_ive_spent_years/cczltb8?context=5)|It's probably a very difficult job, trying to get students to understand and play the long game. I remember being a student and I sure as hell didn't think like that. Everything was ""now now now.""  2) Though designed as a dichotomy, our political system is rarely that.
[No, this is exactly the kind of thing I was thinking of, and is rad (in part because it conforms to what I try and do\).  Thanks!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1p7c2t/iaman_excongressional_staffer_ive_spent_years/cczpq3m?context=5)|Great! Hope I could help -- exactly what I'm trying to do with this AMA.
[I see that you're an ex-congressional staffer. What made you leave the game?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1p7c2t/iaman_excongressional_staffer_ive_spent_years/cczhliy?context=5)|I had a good offer and working in the last campaign really sucked it out of me.
 |I'm so fatigued by people screaming at each other, calling them evil, calling them communists, or racists, or fascists. I feel like I just want to find a small plot of land somewhere, have a ton of babies with my beautiful fiancé, and live the rest of my life in peace.
[How often do you find that higher education plays a role in the upward mobility of political staffers? Does a degree from Harvard automatically make you more appealing?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1p7c2t/iaman_excongressional_staffer_ive_spent_years/cczjcj7?context=5)|Very little. The staff that advance are the ones that bust their ass, stay late until voting is finished for the night, and work well with their coworkers and constituents.
 |Many staffers are children of donors. Sometimes, not always, these types can be entitled little shits and end up going nowhere.
 |It's the guy who walks down the hall, knocking on doors, asking to intern for free that eventually ends up as a legislative director or even chief of staff. The ones with the real passion for legislating show that in their work. And they usually go far.
[Did you get your job from one of your political connections? Is your job related to politics or lobbying?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1p7c2t/iaman_excongressional_staffer_ive_spent_years/cczhr3c?context=5)|Yes, absolutely. Connections are how it happens. I was also a veteran.
 |And yes, my current job is related to politics --not lobbying-- and is more lucrative. I want to make money and get out of this business as soon as it's financially feasible.
[I volunteered on my local congressman's successful campaign and interned for a semester of his freshman term. The money I was offered to work full-time in DC was pitiful to say the least. Judging by your comment on the $29k staffer, I take it this isn't uncommon.  I consider myself pretty innovative at finding solutions, but no way in hell can I figure out how someone can survive on $29k in DC working 50+ hours a week. I had to refuse the offer, which in hindsight I'm glad I did because he has turned out to be someone completely different than the humble state senator we knew before he hopped aboard the Tea Party express.  So two questions: how did you make it on such low pay in such an expensive city and what sort of stories can you tell of staffers who fall out of sync with their bosses? Did they grin and bear it? Jump ship and attempt to start over with someone else? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1p7c2t/iaman_excongressional_staffer_ive_spent_years/cczoht2?context=5)|Well I'm unique in a couple of ways. I was transitioning military. My first job was at $50k a year which isn't bad. Then I moved to a committee, and -as I'm sure you know-- committee staffers do pretty well. I made a little over six figures doing that gig.
 |Then I took a pay cut to do a Presidential campaign, then I went back to the Hill.
 |So living paycheck to paycheck? Well, it was tough to do as a 2Lt living in California. By the time I got to DC, I was ok.
 |I'd say roommates are pretty important. You'll have to be the guy who has 6 of them living in an old victorian in Adams Morgan for a while.
 |I know very high profile case of a communicator who was fired from his boss' committee. He went to go to opinion journalism for a while, then ended right back up on the committee! His name is mud, but he still has a job.
 |Most people jump from the Hill into something lucrative. Hill experience is incredibly unique and sought after. Businesses will pay good money to have a former staffer on their payroll. But you gotta do your time in the mud first.
[Have you watched House of Cards and chuckled at how accurate it can be at times?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1p7c2t/iaman_excongressional_staffer_ive_spent_years/cczj4cj?context=5)|Y'know I was very impressed with the accuracy, esp in detail, until they got to the last 3-4 episodes. Then it spun off the planet.
 |But if you go into McCarthy's office (House whip), the set for Kevin Spacey's (House whip) office is almost dead on.
 |Some of the other plot points were really impressive. Zoe Barnes as a new media journalist going on tv against her old-school boss' wishes, jumping to a new Buzzfeed style outlet.
 |Some of the manipulation was a little over the top -- but it's television. And it's a great show.
[Have you ever lost a friendship or broken up with someone because of their politics?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1p7c2t/iaman_excongressional_staffer_ive_spent_years/cczhjok?context=5)|Definitely not. Never, never, never let politics hurt your personal relationships.
 |I'm great friends with staffers across the aisle. We rip on each other, kind of like a Dallas fan rips on a Washington fan, but it's always cordial.
 |In many cases, we work with the opposite party on bipartisan issues. National Security is a big one, so is veterans affairs.
 |And never assume someone is a bad person just because their politics differ from yours. No one, *no one*, looks at an issue and thinks ""how can I be the most evil Fuck possible here?"" But both sides characterize opposing issues exactly like that.
[If I wanted to start a career in politics, it best to get your masters degree or just go volunteer for a campaign?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1p7c2t/iaman_excongressional_staffer_ive_spent_years/cczgifd?context=5)|A JD is more valuable than a masters I think. Lawyers are all over the hill and in the executive branch. They do policy and some even do communications. Some do law stuff, like consul work.
 |Volunteering on a campaign is something you should absolutely do in college or even younger. Go knock on doors for your guy/gal -- learn how the process works. You could be a career campaign staffer, which can be lucrative, or go into a Congressional office and do legislative work from there. That doesn't require higher than a Bachelor's.
[Can you drop some names of hill politicians who treat their staff terribly?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1p7c2t/iaman_excongressional_staffer_ive_spent_years/cczhv2i?context=5)|Shelia Jackson Lee. [Read this epic opus.\] (\[Link to dailycaller.com](http://dailycaller.com/2011/03/02/congressional-bosses-from-hell-sheila-jackson-lee/))
 |I know Republican staffers who comfort her poor staffers with evening cocktails.
[I was expecting her. Anyone else?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1p7c2t/iaman_excongressional_staffer_ive_spent_years/cczhyc1?context=5)|I've heard Bachmann is an absolutely primma donna and a real pain in the ass to work for. Everything about her needs.
 |Sorry I'm not trying to single out women, just going off what I heard.
[Heh, she came to Afghanistan one time on a fact-finding trip. My boss, a fairly high level guy, mentioned that she could barely be bothered with the briefings and such that were arranged for her and the rest of the delegation.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1p7c2t/iaman_excongressional_staffer_ive_spent_years/cczis6c?context=5)|That is EXACTLY the same story I heard from her trip to Thatcher's funeral. Always late, needed staff when none of the other members did. Made the group look like fools.
 |She'll make another failed run and President and then likely do something lucrative. I don't think the Hill will miss her much.
[Former House intern here, any good intern stories?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1p7c2t/iaman_excongressional_staffer_ive_spent_years/cczm3nw?context=5)|I don't have any personally. But I've been around a long time, and I've never seen one as epic [as this story from July\] (\[Link to gawker.com](http://gawker.com/drunkest-d-c-intern-ever-loses-shoe-while-stalking-pau-977683564)) 
[I was at that hearing! Although this unfortunate soul and his shoes were gone by the time I got in line.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1p7c2t/iaman_excongressional_staffer_ive_spent_years/cczmol3?context=5)|That's amazing. Have yet to meet any on the scene witnesses.
[Hey there! Just a quick question about speech writing. I feel like speech writing is something that falls into someone's lap when they're working on a big campaign -- that it's not really something one works towards. That being said, there has to be some sort of...starting point? I've been working on some campaigns and with State Senators for almost a year now. But is that all I can do? And how do you like field? ;\) ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1p7c2t/iaman_excongressional_staffer_ive_spent_years/cczposh?context=5)|This Q is right up my ally! I was a speechwriter in a few of my jobs.
 |I was ""discovered"" because I had a blog that was popular. That turned into a gig at a political magazine. That, in turn, turned into a speechwriting job.
 |I think being published in a magazine where people take notice is helpful. Once you get ""speechwriter"" on your resume, it becomes much, much easier.
[So just keep writing? :P Thanks for the speedy response! I think the hardest part about writing for someone else is trying to assume their voice, while appealing to the audience you're writing to. I guess it just takes some practice. Can you divulge which speech was most exciting for you to write?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1p7c2t/iaman_excongressional_staffer_ive_spent_years/cczpsqp?context=5)|But yes absolutely, write write write write write. Doesn't matter if you're a novelist, a screenwriter, a playwright. If you do it for a living, do it as often as a full time job would take you.

I will be doing a 5 year master degree program as it is pretty standard in my country (Poland).

My goal is to score internship at a big company, preferably in USA. I'll try to do it after my 2nd year at uni, as it is when I'll have done my algorithms and data structures class.

Up to that point I'll have taken:
Calc 1,2 

Discrete math

Linear algebra, abstract algebra

logic and formal structures

probabilistic methods and statistics

introduction to cs (mostly easy programs in C or pseudocode)

programming course

physics course

programming technologies

data bases and operation systems

architecture of operation systems

networking technologies

algorithms and data structures class


Now in 4th semester I'll be able to freely choose 2 CS course (that will be concurrent programming and alternative paradigms as /u/PasswordIsntHAMSTER suggested)  and 1 math course - there is a lot of options, so feedback on what would be the most important would be greatly appreciated aswell.

I have been waiting long to make this post and I hope redditors who have experience in moving/working in Netherlands can help me!

I am currently studying Master Degree in Finance and Accouting in Poland. My speciality is Business Evaluation. I have very good knowledge of controlling, managerial accounting, risk management. I also studied in Finland as a part of student exchange programme. I am fluent with Basware, know a little of SAP and very good with MS excel.

I have 1 year working experience in a company which has its accounting centre located in Poland. So basically I book/keep accounts for Dutch invoices/costs and according to Dutch standards.
It should count as normal working experience in Netherlands.

I am fluent Dutch and English speaker. I want to move to Netherlands (or in worst case Belgium :)) next year in june, after I graduate, cannot stay in Poland. I am making this post here because I see so many successful stories and I hope if you could do it I can also. 

Problem is honestly I have no idea where to start. Where do I look for jobs related to finance/accounting. How do I look for a job in Netherlands in general? Is it a problem for Dutch people that I did not finish my degree in Netherlands? Accounting standards in Europe are basically the same, plus I know the rules from my work. Also other jobs related to finance such as business evaluation for example, are using the same methods worldwide so I guess it would be less problematic for differences in education, or at least I hope. I will try to transfer from my company but I know they have no open vacancies now :(.

I will also try to register from AIESEC but I know there is not that much internships in Netherlands/Belgium. Or maybe people who went with AIESEC - can you give any tips?

Please kind redittors help me/give me guidance. I know if I stay in Poland too long after I graduate I won't be able to handle it. I don't want to say bad things about my country but staying here fuels my depression and I am desperate to get out. 

Thank you in advance for reading it and helping :)

**10/26**
So after 1 day finger sticks have showed a range of 20 points(70-90 mg/dL) so not too exiting, but all testing occurred at least 2 hrs after meals/during the fast. I'm using these tests to calibrate the CGM, so I probably won't do finger sticks when blood glucose might be changing rapidly. Diet was a little weird today due to a family party. Ill go into the details and meal timing once I have the graphs from cgm.

1p7hl5,43,2013-10-25,My internship is going terribly,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1p7hl5/my_internship_is_going_terribly/,"I got an internship at a multinational tech company which is 1 year long. The team I am in has a high pressure job and as a result people carry a lot of responsibility and therefore often a lot of blame.

The thing is I am very good at computer science but since I have arrived I have been drip fed training and had absolutely no trust or responsibility given to me despite my enthusiasm and work ethic. I am not sure why my team hired an intern as I clearly just get in the way, which I have told them. In response they say that just because they are busy/under pressure I am absolutely welcome to ask questions and shadow them, but when it actually gets down to it they just shut me out.

I am becoming really depressed and would quit if I had any feasible alternative that wouldn't absolutely screw up prospects for future jobs.

The worst part is I don't really know if I am expecting something realistic or not, I thought I would get there, they would train me to do a job and I would do it, but in reality the hardest part of my job is forcing myself to try and integrate with these people and getting some work to do.

I've already told my manager that I am not getting anywhere near the same training a regular employee gets so now I am getting 1 hour a week but it just feels like charity and I am becoming more and more alienated from everyone else (who are all at least 10 years older)

Internships are meant to put you in a better position in your career, this is so disappointing.

EDIT:

Didn't expect so many replies, so I'll just do a general one.

In retrospect of your comments I guess my attitude needs to change. My confidence is pretty damn low at the moment but I'll need to take the humility up another level (ok they are not the same thing but they correlate). When people told me about internships at this place the line ""they treat you like a regular employee"" came up a lot. Well my experience isn't what I thought it would be like and I have to come to terms with it.

For those of you who think I am being a childish asshole you're mostly wrong. I do have a lot of growing up to do though and that is probably why I am having such a tough time. It's good to hear that a lot of people relate to this situation though, I guess it's just a part of life."

I met him about 5 years ago when I recently ended a long relationship and I was ready and excited to be single during my last year in campus before I have to leave for my full year internship. We actually met at a Bon Voyage BBQ and we flirted a bit but that was it. He left the party because he was getting sick and I didn't expect to see again.

It wasn't until I was studying abroad when he messaged me on Facebook. At first it took me a while to realise that it was him but afterwards we would crack jokes and talk about the complexities of time-zones. A month later I returned home and the FB conversations continued. We agreed to meet up and later on that night I had the best make-out session in my life. I might be exaggerating but I really liked it. 

After that we continued to meet up and hook up. I thought it was a nice summer fling since he was leaving for med-school in a month and I wanted to be single, but I did fall madly in love for him. After a year of long conversations, texts, skype calls, awkward/hilarious phone sex, and hooking up whenever he visits I decided to fly to him and confess I loved him. I visited him 2 weeks prior to my internship. I wasn't expecting a relationship and I was just hoping that maybe he felt the same way I felt. I told him I loved him and he told me he doesn't feel the same way and said ""I can't love someone who's 1,200 miles away."" I flew home crying. 

I left for my internship and was pretty excited to be in a new city and hoped to get over him. During that time he would call me to check up on me and sometimes he would drunk call me saying, ""You hate me."" I would tell him, ""I can't hate you."" 

The phone calls became less frequent and I was dating my current [29/m] boyfriend. The last time I saw the ex-fling was when I went home for the Holidays. He embarrassed me in front of my friends saying that my current boyfriend was not good enough for me. I was so embarrassed that I started crying and he was very sorry and that he was drunk. After that we just didn't really talk and for 3 years he would randomly text me and I would reply but he wouldn't really text back. Honestly I did the same thing too. 0_0

When I went back home for a wedding he told me was going to be in town too. I asked if he wanted to catch up. He said yes, but he stood me up and messaged me a day after saying he couldn't leave the hospital on time. I was sad and decided that was my closure. It was painful to accept. That was 5 months ago.

And this morning randomly he texted me saying he'll be in town this weekend because he has an interview at a very fancy hospital and asked ""Did you want to meet up for lunch on Saturday or dinner on Sunday?"" I told him to pick which the date and he chose Sunday. 

I have this stupid game plan in my head of how I should behave during Sunday. 1) Be sober, maybe one drink. 2) Have realistic expectation. 3) Quick good bye. 4) Maybe nothing will happen and he'll bail out again.
My friends tell me I should cut of ties since he's just stringing me along. I know he's dating someone so he has moved on. But a part of me wants to know he does he randomly contact me then leave me hanging. 

Sorry that this post is long. 
Tl;dr for 4 years ex-fling randomly texts me and it messes with  my heart string. Now he'll be in town and wants to meet and catch up.

Regional Firm: Received an offer. Technically, this is a busy season internship (January-May) but they say they are looking for a long-term relationship and wouldn't hire someone who is committed to another firm after May.  The firm is great, the people are nice and the pay is above average. However, the firm conducted their second interviews before I had a chance to do many first round interviews. Therefore, they are asking for an answer fairly early on in the process.

Big 4: I had my second interview earlier this week with a big 4 and I thought it went extremely well. 12 people interviewed for about 7-8 intern positions, and I feel like I have a great chance. That being said, I didn't think my first interview with them went so well and I ended up with a second interview anyways. This internship begins in June. I won't find out if I have an offer until after I have to reply to the regional firm about my offer from them. Big 4 is my top choice due to the difference in professionalism, and obviously better career opportunities. 

Any advice on what I should do? The way I look at it is, if I get the big 4 offer I can accept both offers and do both internships. The only issue with this is I would be leaving the regional firm after my internship and breaking this ""long-term relationship"" they want with me. However, they aren't promising me anything so I don't believe I have the responsibility to fully commit to them. Plus, how bad can burning a bridge really be if I move on to a big 4?

One is going to some StreamingAssets menu and importing from submodule, which then takes like 5-10 minutes.

Then another is another custom menu -&gt; regenerate asset database.

I frankly don't have a good idea what any of these really do and none of my coworkers can explain it well enough, or just accept that that's just the way its being done. I've only worked with Unity for around 3 weeks now, yet I spent 2-3 hours per day struggling with things like random null exception errors during startup and have to relaunch the loading scene and ""pray"" it gets through the loading screen without freezing (luckily it works 3 out of 4 times), then when I change to older commits (git) the assets get regenerated or reimported and I have no idea what's going on and if it works, great, if it doesn't work, I have to do the reimport thing which takes 10 minutes. Least to say, by afternoon I'm extremely burnt out and want to go back to developing my own 2D game where I know that my image is just a file that I move, instead of dealing with prefabs which names aren't in the C# code, animations not appearing but have no idea why, and why some problems appear on iOS but not Android, and Android but not iOS, or both but not on the computer running Unity.

I'm a 21 year old male in my last year of undergrad in Canada. I've known my girlfriend for about seven years, and I've dated her for a little over two years now. I'm completely in love with her. I love everything about her, I want to wake up next to her every day, I want to laugh with her, and I want a future with her. She wants the same things. We're on the same page for almost every aspect of our life. 


I want to attend graduate school on the other side of the country (5 hour flight). She's going to be attending graduate school in the same province. To do this graduate program, I'll be away from her for at least two years, with a third year away from her if my internship is not in the same city she lives in. 


I want to attend graduate school because I want to study something that I enjoy, and because I want to make money. I grew up in an extremely poor family. We barely scraped by every month - I've seen what a lack of money and dead end jobs do to a marriage. I know what no vacations or time away from your kids for 21 years can do to a relationship. I don't want to end up like my parents. I'm scared of being like them.

As good as we are, I dont think we can survive apart for that long, and that scares me. I've been thinking about just applying to another graduate school(not as good) in order to stay with her. But, I'm worried that I will resent her if my career does not turn out the way I want it to. I feel selfish, and I feel worried. I care about her a lot.

I've brought up going away for school, and she told me that if this is what I want to do, then I should do it. But she's also told me that she would much prefer if I were to stay here. I'm torn. 



**tl;dr**: Want to be with wonderful gf and also want to move away for school. Dont think we can do LTR. What do I do?"
1p6cjz,14,2013-10-25,I can't seem to sort out my feelings for this boy,[deleted],gay,https://www.reddit.com/r/gay/comments/1p6cjz/i_cant_seem_to_sort_out_my_feelings_for_this_boy/,"Right now, I am halfway across the country from my home/school on an internship in a big city where I only know less than a handful of people that came here from my school as well. I've been spending a lot of time with one of these guys, I barely knew him before starting this semester, but in the last two months, we've become pretty good friends. I know he's gay, he knows I'm gay, and we've both acknowledged that a lot of the times we spend hanging out, exploring the city get awfully close to feeling like dates. This all came to a head about a month ago when I got drunk and kissed him, and fell asleep together in my bed. We've acknowledged it happened, but we haven't brought it up much. He's slept in my bed at least twice (and will tomorrow), but both times have been strictly platonic. He definitely is interested in me, he's not so subtly implied it, but he's left the ball in my court to make a move on him or not. 

I don't know if I want this to progress to a relationship. He has a lot of qualities I don't particularly care for, he's missing some of the things that I really want in a boyfriend, and while he's kind of cute, he's not so attractive that I feel weak at the knees and forgive all his faults. His interests and mine have only a little bit of overlap, he doesn't play video games, he doesn't follow politics other than major LGBT news, and he doesn't get my nerdy references, so I have to stop and explain half of the things I say, and that gets mentally frustrating after a while.

And yet, when I wake up to an empty bed I wish he was around. He's nice, and sweet, he has a pretty good sense of humor, I like spending time with him. He's genuinely trying to get into things that I like, I've hooked him on Breaking Bad and Game of Thrones, he likes listening to my music, he watches me play Pokemon since he used to play it up to SoulSilver, and tonight when I was explaining how I was starting to get into Magic: the Gathering, he was flipping through my cards after I gave him (the briefest of) an explanation. Sometimes I want him, and when he's around I'm glad he is.

But it's like a switch that flips off and on repeatedly in my head over whether or not I like him or not, and it never stays in one position very long. I broke up with my last ex eight months ago, and since then, I haven't so much as kissed anyone else. I've only been on one official date since then. I have no options that appeal to me but date this boy, and if things go wrong, lose a friend (my only friend I have out here), or stay friends and continue feeling lonely. I'll be back in school in January, Ill see my crush again and a bunch of other guys I might connect with better (my school has a decently sized LGBT community, but between being out for a semester and taking summer classes when no one was around, and now being away on internship, I've been away from it for a while). On the other hand, I know I'm indecisive, and more than once I've let perfect be the enemy of good, but I've been in more than one one-sided relationships where I couldn't get emotionally invested that I just want to find someone where the feelings run both ways.

Guys, can you give me any advice or anything to mull over? Should I give him a chance, or am I just desperate? Am I just an asshole? We've been stuck in this grey area and I think both of us are just waiting for me to decide what I want to do.

**TL;DR**: Away from home for two more months with a boy who has me saying ""I like him, I like him not..."" until I go insane. Wat do?"

Similar rules to last year's competition still apply - teams of up to three undergraduate students will compete against each other to build a web app in three weeks - except we're placing extra emphasis on the consulting and business analysis side of the competition, hence the name change from ""coding competition.""  Not a developer?  No problem!  There will be ample opportunity for business-focused students to exercise their talents around business analysis, requirements gathering, and project management.

The winning team from each school (Purdue, Illinois, and DePauw) will get iPad Minis and will be invited to present their solution at our Chicago headquarters.  The overall winner across the three schools gets the grand prize!

Also, we're still looking for interns to join our Technology &amp; Advanced Analytics practice for Summer 2013.  If you're interested, stop by our info session or PM me a resume.

We'll be on campus next Wednesday (10/30) at 6pm in KRAN G016 to talk about the competition but you can find more info [here](http://www.westmonroepartners.com/purdue).  Free food at the info session!"
1p65xd,17,2013-10-24,"[Rant / Advice] So I have been interviewing for an intern lately, my findings and advice.",Maleus21,sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/1p65xd/rant_advice_so_i_have_been_interviewing_for_an/,"First let me say that I am not an HR person. I am a Systems Administrator,so this isn't geared toward ""the magic sentence that will get you an interview"". That being said, when I finally got approval for an intern (basic help desk position, with potential for higher level projects and exposure to multiple types of technology) I drooled. I felt like if I were looking to get my foot in the door, this would be great, so I was excited about giving someone an opportunity that I greatly desired just a few short years ago. 

So here is the position: Primary role: end user support. Secondary: back up to the sys admin. environment: Windows domain, 50% mac/windows, some linux administration if you can prove your worth. Seemingly very simple, and the possibility for some great experience.  

We got some resumes in from the local universities, I sent some emails out to some mailing lists asking for referrals, and got a decent amount of resumes. They obviously aren't great, but for what we are needing, I just wanted some level of technical ability (doesn't need to be professional experience) and a good attitude, which apparently is a tall order. 

So after a mountain of interviews, here are my recommendations for anyone that is looking to interview for a somewhat technical position.

1. This may seem basic, but read your own resume. Do not type it up, and see there are no little red squiggly lines, and feel it is ok. I saw at least 3 applicants that had incomplete phone numbers, and email addresses on their resume. If you don't have enough attention to detail to make sure I can give you the job, it makes me weary of turning you loose on my network. 

2. Do not exaggerate your resume. I understand you feel you need to add that you are an experienced Active Directory wizard to your resume because you watched a youtube video. But when I ask you a basic question (such as how to change a users password) and you stare at me like a deer in headlights, it shows me you have never touched it. If you want to add it, then set it up at home. Use a VM, go to dreamspark.com and set it up. THAT is initiative, and would have bumped many applicants to the short list instantly, its a single weekend of your time. Which brings me to my next point...

3. Do some things on your own! I asked every applicant if they have any personal non-professional items they want to add. Anything from installing linux as a VM, to setting up a LAN party at their friends house. Only one single person was able to give me something. Personal experience counts. It shows desire to learn on your own. It shows you are not afraid of something breaking, because you have the confidence to fix it. And it shows that you spend your free time learning instead of just surfing Facebook and twitter. 

4. Learn the command line people! I know I will get some backlash for this, but I feel it is important. I don't care if its Windows, OSX or Linux. Open that terminal prompt and learn how to navigate in it. Learn to find your IP address, and what the basic commands are. If you want something even remotely technical, it is a needed skill in my opinion. 

5. Study. I told every applicant that there would be a small technical portion of the interview. I even told them the subjects I would be asking about. And for that very reason, I set each applicant's interview a week away to give them time to study up. I felt like I was handing it away, and was worried my technical questions were to easy. I even asked others if the information I was wanting was considered to advanced for the position, but was told I will probably need to toughen up and have 2nd interviews. Well, not a single person made it all the way through them. So, if you have an interview for a technical spot, and they tell you what you are being quizzed on, take some time and look that info up. Just get the basics down at least. 

Anyway, I know this was long, and I apologize. Although almost everyone in this subreddit will not need this info, you may find some of it useful for someone you know, so pass it along to them. I would suggest adding anything that I left out. 

And no, I still haven't found my intern. Are there no real geeks left in the world?"
1p60r6,4,2013-10-24,"first full time job without a degree, in SF",onetimeaccnt,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1p60r6/first_full_time_job_without_a_degree_in_sf/,"I have been attending a state school for a CS degree, but been pervasively disappointed with the curriculum. I have learned *nothing* from school, and had an unhappy time there. This lead to me disregarding my work there, and after failing several classes, I dropped out. Luckily, I love what I do, and I spent the time mostly teaching myself. I interned with a tiny, but successful startup (~10 employees, ~4 million users), from which I have learned a tremendous amount. After the first summer, they asked me to continue on a contract basis. I then had a ""second internship"" with them the following summer, and have continued contracting with them since. One incredible perk with my work there is that the majority of my work has been open source, which combined with some personal projects, has given me a well-off github account with about ~1800 commits in the past two years. I have also lead two major integrations with other very well known companies.

I have nothing but good words for the company I am working for, but they will not consider me for full time employment. I make enough to get by part-time, but have been living paycheck to paycheck. Meanwhile, I've gotten a number of contacts from other companies (I have not been actively searching, but answer anything that comes my way). Several days ago, I had a final interview with a company in San Francisco. I was asked what salary range I was looking for, and I was not confident. I answered 70k, and got a strange look, and an offer for 75. Meanwhile, I am mid-interview-process with 3 other companies whom I have let know I need an answer within the week. 

The big thing here is that I don't really like any of the companies I am talking to. I do believe that I can learn a lot at them, but I won't really be happy doing that type of work. But I need the money - soon I will need to start repaying my student loans.

I'm not really sure what I'm asking here. I think I sold myself short with the first company, but I feel it is very important to have my first ""real"" job sans degree. I'm also worried about ending my relationship with my current company on a good note. I will be asking for 90k from the other companies I am speaking to if it reaches that point. 

I'd appreciate any thoughts or advice.

Thank you!

1pa9ik,1,2013-10-26,I[22/M] am really into this girl[21/F] but I think her little sister [18/F] is in love with me. Need help :/,[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1pa9ik/i22m_am_really_into_this_girl21f_but_i_think_her/,"I met the sisters about a year ago at a college party and I instantly hit it off with the older sister (Mary/21) and then she introduces me to her sister (Stacy/18). Mary gives me her number without me even asking and Im super excited because she is probably one of the most gorgeous girls I've ever met and I've never been good talking to girls. Stacy is cool too but definitely didn't get the genetics of her older sister. We start hanging out in groups for a few weeks and Mary keeps up the flirting but she always seemed to back off when Stacy was around. Few months go by and Mary stops talking to me and Im super bummed out but Stacy is always bugging me to hang out and the only reason I go is in hope that Mary will be there. I eventually realize that Mary is a huge flirt with every guy she meets and I can tell she really likes the attention. Later that semester Mary moved away for 6 months to do an internship and I was even more bummed out. I think Im actually in love with Mary because I always find myself missing her even though we dont get a lot of time to hang out I really have a thing for her. Finally after the internship is over Mary returns and all three of us start hanging out again. Mary always smiles and laughs at my jokes still but I haven't seen as much flirtatious behavior and I think its because shes trying to respect Stacys interest in me. I hate it but I have zero interest in Stacy and I really want to ask Mary out, I need help with how to approach the situation. Altogether its something thats been bothering me because I dont want to hurt Stacys feelings.
Also while Mary was away during her internship I actually became good friends with her best friend and she's always asking me which sister I like. I never know how to answer and just deflect the question.
Anyhow Ive been putting this off too long, how do yall think I should approach the situation of asking Mary out and addressing the issue of Stacy?"
1pa8aa,5,2013-10-26,"I feel obligated to stay in university for my parents, but I hate it and it is breaking me.",DBPickles,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1pa8aa/i_feel_obligated_to_stay_in_university_for_my/,"I guess I'll get right to it. Sorry for the wall of text, but this is my life.

I am very stressed and worried about my future. When I think of it, it is incredibly difficult. I don’t know how I will manage to succeed in more difficult classes than I currently have. In addition to the increased course load, I have this obligation from my parents, family and friends that I have to find a good job in the summer; a job that will pave the way for my future career. I feel extremely alone, like there is no one to help me. I find it very difficult to talk to people (mainly my parents) about my concerns. When I tell my Dad anything negative about school, it feels like he is looking down on me and that he is disappointed. I can hardly talk to him about anything anymore, and it seems like he disagrees with everything that I do. I can’t even look him in the eyes out of shame.

It honestly feels like I let him down all the time, and that I am such a disappointment. I am not popular like he was or wants me to be; I am not into sports or physical activities like he is/was. I don’t find enjoyment in just being in society like he does. I am not the social butterfly that he wants me to be. I don’t like putting myself out there, for example talking to someone or dancing with a girl.  I don’t work as hard as he does. I make excuses, I’m lazy, and I don’t deserve what I have. I always quit when things get difficult and never stick them through like a man. This is everything that I feel from him lately. It just makes me sad that I feel like he is disappointed with me.

They just don’t understand this weight I have on me right now. I feel like I’m going through this alone. No one is there to help me. I can’t study and no one can help me with what I don’t understand, so I just get frustrated. Teachers have like 2 hours a week to help a student, this is not near enough. There are no TA’s or tutors from the school that can help with this level of study. I don’t feel like I am smart, I don’t feel like I am ready for more courses next semester, I don’t think I will be able to pass them all.  I don’t feel like I can pass my Intro to Energy class right now.

I just want to quit everything like I always have.  I quit my first pizza job. I quit my first relationship with an ex. I gave up during my second year of school when it got difficult. I quit classes in the summer and gave up then, causing me to fail Sociology for not dropping it in time. I got a bad grade in the other summer course I took. I did not look for a job and simply worked for my Dad that summer. I dropped Fluids because I thought it was too hard; I failed Thermodynamics and didn’t fight for the passing grade, I just accepted the Fail.  I took 3 classes first semester of third year and did very poorly in all of them. I took four classes in second semester of 3rd year and did better (I think because I had people to work with). I quit another relationship because I didn’t think it would last while I was gone for the summer. I then went tree planting the summer after third year and quit that job because I couldn’t handle it emotionally, it was extremely difficult
. 
It is now my Fourth year of school, I am 1 year behind. I took 4 classes this first semester and already dropped one elective of it. So I have three classes now and I’ve been skipping all the lectures and assignments of one of them. The midterm for that class (Intro to Energy) is in two days, and I am procrastinating from studying and writing this. I have wasted my entire week. I had three assignments and a lab due this week and I skipped all three, but did the lab.
All I do is sit in my room when I’m home. I say hi to my parents then head to my room in the basement. For the occasional dinner I will sit in the kitchen and eat with them and say a few words. But for the majority of time, I spend little, only necessary, time outside of my room.

I feel weak and helpless right now. I feel so alone and don’t have the ambition to do much.  I’m moving soon too, out of my home town for the last 16 years, into the outskirts of my city. I literally won’t be near anyone I know, there isn’t even much where I am moving that will incline me to be social. If anything, I’m going to be alone in my room even more.

I have told my parents I hate my program and school so much. I told them it’s not what I want to do. The problem is the time and money that I have invested, and I have over a year and a half left before I graduate. I have told them I want to go to college or switch into something I would enjoy. I would rather be happy in a program I enjoy, with people to help me than be alone in this program that I am finding unbearable. 
My whole life I’ve been very attentive to detail, I’m great at visualizing things, building things, following instructions, and I’m fairly creative but a tad indecisive. If I could go back in time, I would go to college for a more hands-on program. Maybe tool-and-dye, some UGS NX CAD designing program, maybe architecture, I don’t know. 

The problem with this is that my parents only think money is important, not whether or not I am happy. My mom wants me to finish university because of her pride; she wants to compete with her sister’s wonder son (whom is getting top grades, has an internship). This seems to apply to my Dad too. They want me to ‘make a lot of money’ and think that will make me happy. I am just sick of this. Every person I’ve told that I hate my program/school, that I want to do something else has told me to ‘stick with it’ and that ‘I only have a year left after this’. They have no idea the amount of stress I am going to have, and the accompanying depression/worry that I will no doubt have. 
There is also a massive amount of risk involved if I decide to stay. Perhaps I fail a course next semester or even next year; that would put me FURTHER back, I’m already 1 year behind from failing Thermodynamics. All my peers have passed me already and I’m stuck with a younger generation that wants nothing to do with me in the classroom.

This amount of shame, worry, anxiety, depression and uncertainty that I am undergoing is going to break me and I really need help.

1pa3jx,49,2013-10-26,Something Strange is Going On in Clearview...,SebasV96,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1pa3jx/something_strange_is_going_on_in_clearview/,"They've erased us off the map, and I think I know why.

I don't know what is going on, but I do know that whatever it is is enough for the US government to take us off the map and keep us some sort of secret.

I'm from Clearview, a small, out-of-the-way, idyllic town you have probably never heard of. We USED to be located in northern North Carolina, yet we've literally just disappeared off the map.

I suppose it really all started two months ago with Mrs. Leverett. She was an old widow, almost Victorian in manners, uptight, proper; she used to sit outside of her tiny little cottage in the poorer section of town, rocking aimlessly and mumbling about ""the war"" (although she never specified which one). Everyone in town accepted the fact that she was crazy, although at times she seemed perfectly clear and coherent. Then came her suicide, and things began to get weird. 

Mrs. Leverett was a weak and extremely old woman, at least ninety and unable to move without her wheelchair or the help of her nephew, Edgar. Yet somehow, the local authorities were convinced that she had somehow moved a huge, heavy armchair from the living room into her bedroom, stood on it, swung a noose over a support beam, and somehow kicked the 80 pound chair over (despite the fact that Mrs. Leverett was probably eighty pounds herself) to kill herself. 

I guess I should tell you how I know about this. My father is a local doctor, and he was called to the scene to investigate the body. The call came in from Mrs, leverett's nephew, the odd, awkward middle-aged Edgar. My father spoke to me about how weird the case was, and how he suspected someone (maybe Edgar) had to have played a role, yet the inspector and his sergeant both disagreed and noted it as a definite suicide. Case closed. 

Then things got weird. Edgar Leverett, the old widow's nephew, started wandering around the streets of the city. In fact, the whole house fell to ruin: he started ignoring it completely. He never went inside. He grew emaciated and gnarled, yet he was such a strange, odd man no one cared, everyone ignored him. He wandered around the neighborhoods, scaring children and mumbling to himself. He stopped speaking English--he started talking in what sounded like Latin, but people usually stayed away so no one really knew for sure. Eentually, people started calling the police about him, and he just went into the woods around the suburbs of the town.

Eventually, Edgar killed himself. I remember that day well: I like to sit outside to read, especially since my backyard looks out into the woodland everything is so calm and serene. I heard screaming--shrill, girlish screaming. A little girl who I semi-recognized (was it Amanda or Samantha?) was running out of the woods, crying and shrieking. I got her inside and my mother called her mother, and the whole time the little girl cried about finding a corpse. Police were sent out into the area, and they uncovered Edgar's body. The creepiest part, my father told me, was that it had been chewed and bit and torn apart--but not by an animal. A human being had done this. 

The town hushed it up. 

Then Amanda fell sick. Everyone attributed it to the shock of finding a corpse in such a condition, considering she was no older than nine. Her mother came to ask me what she had been like when she found the body, etc, and told me that the girl had just laid down and stayed there, motionless, terrified. 

Eventually Amanda Hammond was admitted into a hospital. She died about a month ago, and in a very strange way, too. She just died, and no one had figured out how. Her mother had been in the room at the time, yet she couldn't say anything--ever again. She refused to speak. She stared blankly ahead of her and refused to answer any questions from the police, my father, or other doctors. 

Mrs. Hammond shot herself a few days later. The gun was hanging from the roof with a string attatched to the trigger, yet my father knew it was ridiculous to imagine that someone could pull a gun's trigger with a piece of string and have it enter the right temple perfectly. Eeriest of all, there was no blood anywhere except the wound and the gun--the blood being the bloody fingerprints of Mrs. Hammond. 

The first real sign for me, though, that this was not only weird but quite possibly entirely supernatural, came when I got an internship working with Rufus Ferguson, the head of Clearview's sewage department and a powerful political figure in town. While I was organizing his agenda, I got snoopy, and started prying into his private life, and I noticed one unusual detail. 

Mr. Ferguson had evidently been having an affair with none other than Celia Hammond, Amanda's mother! This explained his change in mood, his grief, yet there was more to this than just silly neighborhood gossip. On the day of her suicide, he had planned a ""visit"" to her for 4:30 PM, and probably kept it. That would mean something very creepy, because according to the medical evidence, Celia Hammond had been dead since three in the afternoon, meaning that Rufus Ferguson had not seen his lover but rather her corpse. That's when I noticed a pattern.

Old Mrs. Leverett was crazy. Then, one day, she killed herself, and the first person to see her corpse was Edgar Leverett. Then, Edgar went completely insane, prowling around town mumbling and sputtering. Then he himself was killed. Amanda Hammond was the first person to see his corpse. Then, Amanda fell into a comatose state and died under her mother's care, meaning that Celia Hammond was the first to see Amanda's corpse. Then Celia Hammond loses it completely: she can't speak, can't talk, ignores everyone around her and stumbles about blindly. Then, she shoots herself. The first person to see her corpse was Rufus Ferguson, and now Mr. Ferguson had sunk into a deep depression. 

I quit working for Mr. Ferguson right there and then, knowing what would happen if he killed himself in his office and I stumbled upon his body. Sure enough, my successor--a kid in my grade named Daniel--found him in his office. He had hanged himself with a rope made of several ties--again, a complicated, improbable, and weak suicide. 

As if this wasn't all creepy enough, Clearview has now been completely erased from all maps. I can't find it anywhere. 

I have no idea what's going on, but whatever it is can't be good. I have to figure out if Mrs. Leverett witnessed any death, since she was also ""crazy."" Some kind of chain is going on here, and I can't explain but I will discover it. 

I'm going to try and get to the bottom of this, and if/when I do, I will try to update. "
1p9u12,4,2013-10-26,Getting into the IT field,[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1p9u12/getting_into_the_it_field/,"So I've recently realized that my current set of skills (ex military, security, etc) Isn't going to pay very well, ever, unless I feel like having zero self respect and slaving away for 60 hours a week for years on end. So I'm thinking of picking up where I left off in high school and going into IT. 

Back when I was in High School between '01-'05 in MA, I was part of a program called YTE which was sponsored by a now-nameless corporate entity. Basic jist of it was they teach you all about fixing computers and entreprenurial stuff, get you internships in the field, and get you out of High School with a job and other goodies. Problem was the program and the company ran out of money in early '04 so everything went to shit, and I wasted my time in Community College.

So, now, I've got some cash to work with, and connections that'll get me a job as long as I have the right certifications. 

Here's the thing: beyond A+, I have no idea what I need. 

I'm also terrible at math

1p9py6,0,2013-10-26,Is there anyway to raise GPA from a 2.68 to a 3.2 by end of sophomore/junior year in college?,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1p9py6/is_there_anyway_to_raise_gpa_from_a_268_to_a_32/,"I'm a sophomore in college now and I'm going for a B.S. in Petroleum Engineering , and my first semester of freshman year was alright; I got a 3.43 in 17 hours of work. Second semester, my GPA tanked to a 2.68 in 19 hours of work. Chem 2, Computing, Honors Calc all contributed to tanking my GPA. I'm taking 12 hours right now, and judging by my efforts, I might get B's in 2 of the 4 classes this semester, which isn't too good. However, is there any way to raise the GPA to possibly a 2.9-3.0 by the end of fall and then a 3.2 by junior year? I'm not planning on grad school, just internships then getting a job, but some companies like BP and Shell won't even talk unless I have a 3.0, so I'm just scared.

Tl;dr GPA tanked to 2.68 after 36 hours of work. Need help to get back on track."

1p9h7n,9,2013-10-26,My parents make me want to kill myself.,[deleted],Parenting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/1p9h7n/my_parents_make_me_want_to_kill_myself/,"I've been waiting a long time to share my story and I'm not sure if I will get everything, but I will try.

I am a 22/f, my parents are both in their mid 60's.

Currently, I am a senior in college graduating in June. To say the least, the later years of high school and my college career have been the worst.

I am the middle child and I have always been very social and independent. I began college planning in 10th grade and got into my first choice university in their honor's program and could not wait to leave home. Somewhere along the way senior year, my relationship with my parents really started going south. I always had lots of friends in school and was very involved and worked at McDonald's part time, but for some reason it always seemed like my parents, Mom specifically, really hated me for what I was. At parent teacher conferences when my teachers would tell them how much they enjoyed me in class she would say things like, ""Well, if you only saw her at home"" and weird things like that.

I never really got to hang out with friends outside of school because I was suppose to be home helping around the house. I hated this, but I could understand. Except that my siblings were always encouraged to go have fun and my parents just loved all their friends.

I tried to not let it bother me-I only had a year left.

I went off to college on shaky ground with my parents, but I didn't care I was finally out of that house. I made great friends and loved life. 

I also failed my classes. To this day I can't tell you why-I think I just always felt like I had more time to get my grades up later. I didn't party and I wasn't depressed. I worked part time on the weekends and I just hung out with people and did minimal work.

I also barely kept in contact with my parents. I didn't want to talk to the because I felt like they hated me. They were footing the bill of my education though, so I should have been in more communication with them. They were pissed when I was on academic probation, but somehow I was allowed to go back in the winter. My grades got better, but not enough to stay in honors and I knew I wasn't coming back.

So, then next year I stayed at home and went to a community college. My friends from HS were still there and it wasn't that bad. Except that I was living at home with my parents who were still pissed at me. It was a really hard year of uncomfortable interactions and me getting yelled at a lot.

I still worked part time and was going to school full time. I was ""never home"" and not helping around the house enough. I hated being home because I was always in trouble and I felt like I was missing out on my college experience. I saw all my friends posting about how much fun they were having and I was stuck home crying because my parents were always yelling at me.

Somewhere along the way, things got better. I love my parents, I do, but I just don't think that they really like me as a person.

I've been commuting my junior and senior year now to a nearby university. My grades are great and I have great relationships with my professors and some classmates. But I still feel like I'm missing out and I am always waiting for my parents to be made at me for something. 

My major requires three internships totaling 1,000 hours. Two of the ones I did were not paid. So my parents paid $900 for me to work for free. I tried explaining the requirements but all they see is  waste of money.

It's really hard to balance school full time, an internship, a part time job and then being home to help with chores. My siblings are away at school living on campus so I am the only one home to help.

I'm always in trouble for not doing enough and it's taking its toll on me. I'm 22, and very successful to everyone but my parents. My Mom has even told me that people should know ""what a bad person I really am"".

I know I should just move out, but they pay for everything and I am so close to leaving anyway. 

It's just really hard to stay positive. I think about killing myself a lot.

So, to all you parents, I'm just looking for advice.

tl;dr My parents hate me and I don't want to live anymore.

Gonna try and make this brief so you get the idea.

I'm in my twenties, graduated with a BS in engineering, and worked extremely hard in my field for a good two years. That's where the good ends.


I was basically paid an internship's hourly wage (which I can tell you is a considerably small amount) at my company even though I had my degree (and did fairly well in a good university) and did some great work for them as well. Then it all just kept on going downhill from there.


With the combining forces of a high rental rate, bad spending habits, struggling with depression, and the eventual quitting of my job and moving back to my hometown I am left with a TON OF DEBT (in my eyes at least).

Fortunately I do NOT have student debts to pay, though I have: two credit cards both with thousands overdue debt, car payments, money owed to lenders, some friends, my old rental management company, and more. And my credit score is below 500 mainly due to all those accounts. Basically if just under 15k magically appeared I'll call it a day... 

AND to top it all off I basically had zero liquid cash up until just recently. 

Fortunately at the moment I am living rent free, got a new retail job as I was unsuccessful in my area search for engineering jobs, and make extra money on the side doing design work. 


If you took the time to read all that... **thank you**! but here is my actual question:

ALL I fucking really want at the moment is a way to consolidate my debt (I guess with another loan for the amount of everything I owe, some of which is not actual credit lenders). That way I have them all off my back, am able to actually rent somewhere soon, and my credit doesn't look absolutely terrible. (AND I don't feel so damn bad) At the moment I know I am able to save safely the amount extra to pay this hypothetical loan (assuming it's over a relatively longer period), but I have no WAY of quickly getting everything off my back without fucking myself much deeper into the hole. 

What can I do? Is there anyway I can get a loan? 

(family or other friends are not an option at the moment)

Am I being too selfish or naive about this? I want to improve my personal finance skills as much as I can."

Like I feel an awesome stretch of time is coming.,metroidprimee,NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/1p8rgz/super_excited_like_i_feel_an_awesome_stretch_of/,"A week ago I walked into my apartment's bathroom to- do the usual shower and shave, and I couldn't help notice that my gut was a bit bigger than I remembered it being. Now I don't consider myself out of shape, I still try somewhat to keep myself relatively healthy, but seeing this made me realize how lazy I have been lately. My future profession will be a 3D artist, so I inevitably am going to be spending a large amount of time on my ass in front of a computer, making the importance of keeping active all the more there, and it made me realize I've been doing nothing but eating and working the past two months. That one little sight of my growing belly make something flicker on my mind. The next morning I got up an hour earlier, readying myself for the big internship fair in an hour and a half, took a shower, which I never do in the morning, walked to the market across the street and bought an apple, instead of getting a waffle, and headed to meet a friend on our way to the fair. I just have to point out that on my way to the market that morning, I felt better than I had in MONTHS. Both physically and emotionally. I was ready to kill it. I decided to also start working out at least every other day, start the days healthier just like I did then, and be up an hour earlier than I usually am, every day. On days that I have a few hours before class, I work instead of firing up or Skyrim or something like that. To top all of that, my last resolution was probably hat you guessed, I don't fap anymore. Even better than that, I'm suprised how easy it is now! I didn't actually try since I've been in school, which now makes my schedule pretty packed. I don't even have any urges, aside form some fantasies every now and again, which were tough to resist, and still can be to be honest, I actually really did want to tonight, almost did in fact, and I remembered back to all those sad sad points where i'm pathetically jizzing onto whatever medium it was that time to catch it, and realized ""damn, I'm not going back to that again!"", and resisted. Tomorrow's a Halloween party i'm hitting up with my friends, and I'm gonna try and flirt a bit there, though I don't think anything will really happen at that point though :P, and then in about a month I'm going home for a week, which I'm really looking forward to, cause I finally have my own wheels, and can actually go out whenever i want, and I plan on trying to hook up with someone while I'm there. Overall my piece of advice on this long post for all of you great people is to just start with a few simple things, a cold shower in the morning, healthy food to get your brain pumping properly wight off the bat, and run for like 30 minutes a day, or even every other day, all the good stuff will fall in hand!

1p8psl,209,2013-10-26,Radio Station,Calinero985,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1p8psl/radio_station/,"I don't know how long I have to write this, so I can't take too long.  I don't know if anyone will even be able to read it.  Nothing else I've tried has worked.

If you get this, I am working at the radio station outside Maidstone, Alaska.  It's a small town, there's only one station.  I'm just an intern, I keep the station open at night--they let me do a show and I can put it on my resume.

About a week ago I was in the station doing my show, and had wrapped up for the night.  I shut off all my equipment, and set up the computer to play enough music on its own to last until the daytime folks showed up.  But when I tried to leave, the door to the building was locked.

I tried using my key and it didn't work.  I tried every other door in the station--locked.  So were the windows.  My phone didn't get any reception, and neither did the station's landline.  At that point I was more annoyed than scared, and decided to just wait for my daytime counterpart to let me out.

They never showed up.  I was starting to get freaked out, so later in the day I got on the radio.  I figured somebody had to be listening, and it was the closest thing I had to calling 911.  But, when I tried to use the microphone, the only thing I heard in my headphones was static.  No matter how I adjusted it, nothing got transmitted.  I was speaking into the void.

By this point I was freaking out, but I still thought I could get out.  I tried breaking open the windows, but they're all too small or too high for me to use.  I tried breaking down the door, and that didn't work either.  I went at the front door with a chair for more than an hour.  The chair broke.  I don't think the door even dented.

By the first night, I was exhausted, and starting to get hysterical.  The last thing on my mind was my job.  So, when it got to 10:00, there was no way I was going to worry about starting my scheduled radio program.

I didn't have to worry about it, though.  It started without me.

There was a crackle of static, broadcast on speakers throughout the whole building.  No matter where I go, I can hear it.  My program started without me.  Songs get played--weird ones, ones I would get fired for using.  And then there are comments.  In my voice.

I can hear myself talking on the radio, saying things I never said.

I ran to the recording room, the one where I normally do my shows, but the door was locked.  I didn't hear anyone talking inside, but my voice kept playing on the speakers throughout the building--and I guess on the radios outside.  To the rest of the world, I was doing my show like normal.  I was the only who knew that it wasn't me behind the microphone.

I've been in the station for almost a week now.  I broke open a vending machine for food, though I'm getting sick of potato chips.  There's still water running in the sinks.  I'm not too worried about sustenance--but I am worried about the voice.

It's started talking to me between shows now.  In my voice.  During the day it will whisper, throughout the whole station.  I can't tell what it's saying, but it's my voice.  It isn't right.  It's not me, but it sounds like me.  I don't understand it.

I was able to get on one of the station computers in another booth.  It seems to be working--but so did the radio equipment, so I don't know if this will ever get through.  Either way, this is my last attempt to contact the outside world.

On the way here, I had to pass the door to my recording booth--I've been avoiding it since that first night.  Today, though, it was cracked open.  I was too afraid to look inside, but now I don't think I have any choice.  The voice has been calling to me.  It knows where I am.

After I write this, I'm going to go through the door.  I need to find the thing that's been using my voice.  It's almost time for my show to start.

Showtime."

I recently started my CS degree at Newcastle University after being rejected from Glasgow because of my chemistry degree (international student, weird acceptance criteria). While I'm happy with my course and the way it is structured I'm concerned as to whether Newcastle uni is prestigious enough to garner an interview at a big game-changing company (e.g., Google, Amazon, Microsoft)

I'm first year but I'm planning a spring few day internships, applying for summer internships, looking for undergraduate research assistant spots and just reading programming books to just develop my own knowledge of the field. (anything that will make me a better developer and that will look good on a CV) Also I know I probably sound a bit naive (hur,dur, I wanna work for Google), but, hey, I'm young so bare with me.

I decided to major in film during my junior year and didn't really get the chance to do many internships. I left, moved to Los Angeles, and am barely making a living. I haven't got a job in the industry (I've been out here coming on 3 years) and I feel mentally beat down. I work 40-80 hours a week and can barely survive. I have lost the motivation I originally came with-- I rarely write screenplays and I haven't made a short film in the 3 years since I've moved to Los Angeles. 

I'm not sure what I should do. I see most of my friends from college being ridiculously successful (making six figures, going to great grad schools, etc) and I'm envious. I'm not sure if I can get my motivation back to get in film or if I should give up. I can't see myself being happy doing anything else (sometimes doing anything at all), but I don't want to be broke forever. 

I was told that I could return to my school and major in Computer Engineering. I don't really want to leave Los Angeles, as I have a wonderful boyfriend, but as it would be temporary, I could do it. I've also looked at schools in LA, but none of the local schools offer a second bachelors, which I've been told is needed when moving from art to engineering. I also would have to take math and science classes, which I haven't taken since I was 20, as well as getting back into the school thing in general. I did take through Calculus 2, though, so my school would want me to start with Calc 3 as well. 

I know engineering is more profitable and I have always loved computers. My mother used to build computers during my childhood, and I do have a fascination with gadgets, though I've never built any. 

I do like the idea of a structured work schedule and being to support myself comfortably but some part of me wonders if I'm giving up too soon or if I'm already a failure, I guess. I'm 24 years old and I feel like I don't have the first step towards any career. I just don't want to be a failure and I don't want to spend the rest of my life regretting not going into film or not going back to school. Or

What can I do to make her feel better?",Overheadsprinkler,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1pbvew/my_girlfriend_of_a_few_years_just_learned_she/,"Hi, /r/depression. This post isn't like what you might used to be seeing around here; it isn't for me, but for my girlfriend of a few years. She has a long history of depression, sometime bi-polar issues, has contemplated suicide, has been on anti-depressants and has been to therapists. I've helped pull her up and she's been in a much better place since she and I met. She's told me that I am what keeps her going, and I love her very much and would do anything for her. But now... she's spiraling downward, and I don't know where to turn. So I'm hoping you guys can help me out.

**The setup:**

About a year ago, she took a year-long internship at her ""dream job"" on the other side of the country. After several months of doing long distance, I packed up and decided to relocate and join her. She and I both left our jobs back home, along with our family and friends, to try something new and exciting. And while the first few months were hard on both of us while we settled in, I found a great new job while she loved interning with her ""dream"" company.

**The problem:**

As the internship came to a close, she interviewed for a full-time position. There were quite a few other interns applying for the same position, and she felt like she ""bombed"" the interview (which for her, is surprising because she's so good with people). She just found out that she wasn't offered the position, and has hit a depression I've never seen her in.

The first reaction was crying. She bawled into my arms, and still does when she thinks about it. There are times when she just lays there, in silence, staring at nothing. Then there are times where she will get extremely angry, yelling at me for even trying to give her words of advice. She then goes back to crying, or laying in bed in the dark for hours, it seems.

**A little more info:**

Her whole reason to move here was to work for this company. This company specializes in a very particular market, one which doesn't have many competitors (or at least, doesn't have many competitors that do as 'good' of a job as this company). She misses her family and friends back home constantly, and she hears about all their good news all the time (""Soandso got a new job!"" or ""Soandso got engaged!""). Even I recently got a great new job at a company I really admire.

She feels like moving here was a mistake. She feels like she's let everyone down (including me), by having us move here and leave everything and everyone behind. She feels incredibly alone, even when I go to console her. And I feel terrible because I simply don't know what to say.

**What I need from you, Reddit:**

I need to know what to say or do in this situation. Regardless if moving here for her ""dream job"" was a good or bad decision, I need to know what to tell her. What should I do? How can I lift her spirits and give her confidence? I want her to feel like there's always another way to reach her dreams, even if it isn't with this company. *(Note: I did just find that there are some part-time jobs her ""dream"" company offers, so I could pitch that idea to her. But they pay significantly less and don't have much in the way of benefits.)*

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

-----

**TL;DR:** Girlfriend and I moved across the country for an internship with her ""dream job."" Meanwhile, all her friends got hired at great new jobs (even I got hired by a great company). So my girlfriend also wants to be a part of everyone's good news, and make her friends and family proud. Her internship with Dream Co. ended, she interviewed for a full-time slot, and didn't get it. Now she feels like crap for having moved all the way here, only to not get the job she was so passionate about. She feels like she's let everyone down and has made a big mistake by betting everything on this. Regardless if that is true, what can I say or do to help her?

I think everyone is still proud of her, I know I am. But what else can I do or say to cheer her up?

I completed my Masters in Communication engineering from Germany. I have one internship ( in Automotive sector in Germany) and a work experience as a junior lecturer in my home country. While I have been trying hard to find a job in Germany, it looks difficult by the day. I am learning the language as well, but I am definitely not fluent, and it might take a while before I hit fluency. My computer skills are good - I can program in MATLAB, C++ and the likes, and I am fluent in English.

Any suggestions in how to search for a job in Germany ? 

Edit: My GPA is 1.73 / 5.0 in my major. "
1pay8b,1,2013-10-27,[Serious] What things do I need to know before I start considering getting a PHD (after getting my MPH a few months ago)?,brighterdaze,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1pay8b/serious_what_things_do_i_need_to_know_before_i/,"I graduated in August of this year with my Master of Public Health in Florida. My undergraduate degree is from another university in Florida,completed in 2009, and is in education. 

I was just talking to a good friend of mine (who coincidentally was the same friend I talked to and who encouraged me about going back to school for my Master's like 2 years ago). He recently finished his PHD in Biomedical Engineering and is now an AP at a decent school in Florida.  He was able to fill some gaps of understanding I have had about the Doctorate process and also served as a major help for applying to grad school when I went forward with it in 2011. 

I am from an uneducated/poor family background and it took a long time for me to get a grasp on how these degrees work, how the processes work and what exactly they mean. For instance, when I graduated high school I thought that if you didn't have good grades you could never get into a University. I didn't know until a few months at a community college that I could transfer to a U. This is how little I knew and so I am genuinely asking what other PHD/Doctoral students can tell me to point me in the right direction if I decide to make the choice to go back to school, yet again.My understanding of college and grad school are obviously a *little* (haha) better than they were now but I still feel like I don't know anything about all of this. What should I know before I start setting my sights on this goal? I am not 100% sure yet that this is something I will move forward with but I am trying to gather as much information I can about it to make the right decision for me.

**Some additional info about me that might help your advice to me**

**My passion:**
Due to a lot of my family history I am very interested in research in the RX addiction field. I developed a RX prevention program for my university as my graduate internship over this past summer. The program consisted of doing a complete literature review on youth/college age non-medical prescription drug use (NMPDU). I used this information to develop educational and evidence-based presentations and strategies to target this issue. I live, eat and breathe this stuff as it's is something that has affected me in various ways and I feel like I have the passion to really build something there.

**Current situation:**

I am starting a decent ""adult"" job in public health in a few days, which will be my first career-related job. My work history isn't that impressive (nanny for an NFL player doesn't exactly do anything for my resume, even though I wish I could add I took the job because the pay was great and it helped me pay my bills through school). I have some other random job experience (real estate data company 2+ years fulfilling a number of roles in a few different positions). I am currently volunteering for a breast cancer support organization as well as another social service organization that focuses on victim advocacy. 



My husband is military and wherever we end up March will be where we stay for 4 years. This obviously plays a HUGE role in what my plans are and so I am having to really use the next months to determine exactly what I can do if I decide to go forward with my PHD. I am 26, have a few more years that I would be willing to wait to start a family and so getting a PHD and getting situated shouldn't interfere as long as I get through the program within a reasonable amount of time.



**With that wall-o-text I seriously hope you're not asleep on your keyboard and that you might have a word or two of advice for me.**

**Where do I start? What questions do I need to ask myself about this to determine if I can do it? What precautions do I need to take? *Are the only PHDs worth earning the ones that you don't go into debt for?* , How do I know I have what it takes? How did you know? What was your experience?**

I appreciate any serious feedback that you guys have. I feel like a professional student. And I love learning. My background and feelings of lack of knowledge and experience brings me down a few notches and I don't always believe in myself. Helping me realize whether I have the potential or not would truly help me move forward in whatever direction is right for me.

**Sorry if this is jumbled and nonsensical, I should've been in bed hours ago but now I am thinking about school again and here we go again**

TL;DR: Recent MPH grad needs your advice on whether or not a PHD is for her, and what she can do to decide on that.

1pavjr,0,2013-10-27,Thoughts,[deleted],self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/1pavjr/thoughts/,"I've been feeling down recently, this will probably just turn out to be rambling but w/e.

I'm a first year college student in the US, grades haven't been too bad (except Calc II, tough class).  I'm not worried about paying off college or having to take out a student loan, most of that's covered for between money from parents, my internship, scholarships, etc.  I'm not worried about being able to find a job or what I want to do once I graduate college.  I'm a Com Sci major, I enjoy programming along with music production/audio so something along those lines.

I'm an awkward person I tend to think, never had a girlfriend, haven't even kissed a girl.  Had a couple prom dates and whatnot from high school, even had a girl tell me she liked me and wanted to go out.  That didn't end up working out, even though I was all for it.  Later found out she thought I only wanted to date her because I wanted a ""first kiss"".

I'm really into music, songwriting, etc.  Played in a band with friends that split up because of everyone going to different colleges.  We played a couple of local places here and there, nothing too big.  I made some music on my own that I want to play around campus once I find a couple of other people willing to play with me.  I've been to a local music festival here, a student club for ""musicians"", and a couple of open mic nights around town but haven't found anyone yet.

Would love it to be able to find a girl who's into the same kind of music, or at least devotion to music, that I could strike up a conversation with.  I did meet a girl who is also a DJ for the student radio station here and I (somewhat awkwardly) invited her to come along to the local music festival going on that weekend.  She said she was most likely busy with homework.  Via after friending her on facebook I found out she has a boyfriend.  I still talk with her weekly when I go in to do my radio show, there's laughing and smiling so I'm not concerned with coming off as creepy or weird.  Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.  I'm surprised if you're still reading this, I don't think i'm too exciting.

I guess why I've been feeling down recently is I just want to love someone.  In high school and before I've been able to push aside the fact of not having a girlfriend easily because relationships really aren't too serious then.  Now people I know from school are getting married, finding the love of their life.  I feel pressured.  I feel like an antisocial loser.  I'd like to think I maintain good hygiene, dress somewhat decently (pretty normal).  Clean shaven, skin fairly clear, ordinary haircut.  I am a bit shorter and look a little young for my age, which has actually bit me in the ass a couple of times.  I've had a girl I liked a while back tell me she just wanted to be friends because she didn't date guys shorter than her.

Not looking for advice really, just wanted to say what was on my mind.  Been pretty lonely, and I guess more so this weekend.  Lots of video games alone in my room after hanging out with the usual guys for a little bit today."

First of all I would like to apologize if this is the wrong sub to post this. I was unemployed for a long time, but recently I got a temporary job to replace some interns. After being there for 8 days (it was the time requested by them to my temporary employer), I received an invitation to work there.
The job is alright, although the income is pretty low. But I'm not complaining since I was getting really depressed for not working, and feeling sick for being a parasite, but I digress.
I consider my self a hard work employee, and I admit that's because work it's the only thing that keeps me distracted by this awful disease.
Anyway, I wasn't hired to be a sysadmin, but instead a service desk/technician on site, which I don't mind since I don't have the proper skills to be a sysadmin.
So my job consists of changing workstations, laptops, resetting some AD user accounts, configure some VoIP phones, etc...
But I consider myself a pretty hard worker and an achiever, and I was looking for some advices, tips, to automate my work and being more productive. I would be very thankful to you guys.

tl;dr: New job, want to impress boss, and make things run smoother!

In the great state of California, we have the finest collegiate educational system in the world.  With our UC (University of California), CSU (California State University), and CCC (Caifornia Community College) systems , we provide top notch educational opportunities.  Also, our Computer Science programs in our schools are among the worlds best.

I want to leverage our educational system to help California redefine our interal Active Directory infrastructure for our schools.  Today, our schools independently create Active Directory domains which are not connected.  Therefore, we as a state loose opportunities to share valulable resources for students.  To combat this, I am accepting proposals for an Active Directory design which links all of our collegiate school system together.

All porposals must clearly show AD forest(s) and account for each of the different school systems.  They can be geographical, per system, or combinations of both.  There might be other logical seperations which are innovative and make sense.  Any separate Organizational Units must also be identified.  Exact numbers (especially with community colleges) are not needed but groups of schools must be clearly identified.

Proposals can be from single individuals or teams (up to three members).  Winning entries will get school credit and fly to Sacramento to meet with our IT team.  Winning teams or individuals will also have summer intern opportunities for further design or possible implementation of the design.

We need all entries by Oct 22nd at 6:00 PM in room 1432 at NVC in beautiful Napa.

Good luck!

Sincerely,

Governor Jerry Brown""

I started my transformation back on April 29th, after I had gotten home from my one month internship that was required to graduate my college program.  6 months in and I feel like a brand new person!

I started off by using the treadmill we had at home (conveniently in my room none the less).  I would start off by running for as long as I could, which usually got me to the 8-10 minute mark, then I would take a few minute break and walk until I got up to half an hour total.  I did that for the first month and a half or so until the treadmill broke, and then I was forced to run outside, which I hated.  Not only was it a little embarrassing to be jiggling my way around outside, it's also a lot harder to run outside than it is on a treadmill!

After running for about 2 or 3 weeks, I decided to get a gym membership so I could stick to cardio equipment.  I used the elliptical and treadmills, with the occasional stop on the stair masters.  I tried for an hour a day, 7 days a week, but there was the odd day when I really wasn't feeling it and cut my workouts short.  3 months or so later I added weight lifting to my workouts, so now on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays I'll warm up with 20-30 minutes of cardio, followed by lifting. Then on Tuesdays, Thursdays and weekends I'll do an hour of cardio.

I used myfitnesspal for the first few months, but I haven't really used it the last month and a half or so.  I cut wayyyy back on snacking, which was my biggest problem before.  I haven't drank much pop for almost 2 years now, I stopped eating fast food this year as a New Years resolution, and after a few bad weeks of gaining a little bit of weight because of drinking alcohol, I told myself I'm not going to drink again until I hit the 100 pound lost mark. 

It's pretty crazy what you can do in a few months if you just put your mind to it. A year ago if you told me I'd be able to run 5K on a treadmill without stopping or run around my subdivision (nearly 5K) in 28 and a half minutes, I would have said you're insane.  And yet here I am, sweating my ass off 7 days a week in the gym, smiling weekly every time I step on that scale and see that my hard work has been paying off.

And to think I've still got 58 more pounds to lose..."
1pfaid,1,2013-10-28,"My girlfriend of a few years didn't get her ""dream job"" and is now super depressed. What can I say / do to make her feel better?",Overheadsprinkler,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1pfaid/my_girlfriend_of_a_few_years_didnt_get_her_dream/,"So my girlfriend of a few years has a long history of depression, sometime bi-polar issues, has contemplated suicide, has been on anti-depressants and has been to therapists. I've helped pull her up and she's been in a much better place since she and I met. She's told me that I am what keeps her going, and I love her very much and would do anything for her. But now... she's spiraling downward, and I don't know where to turn. So I'm hoping you guys can help me out.

**The setup:**

About a year ago, she took a year-long internship at her ""dream job"" on the other side of the country. After several months of doing long distance, I packed up and decided to relocate and join her. She and I both left our jobs back home, along with our family and friends, to try something new and exciting. And while the first few months were hard on both of us while we settled in, I found a great new job while she loved interning with her ""dream"" company.

**The problem:**

As the internship came to a close, she interviewed for a full-time position. There were quite a few other interns applying for the same position, and she felt like she ""bombed"" the interview (which for her, is surprising because she's so good with people). She just found out that she wasn't offered the position, and has hit a depression I've never seen her in.

The first reaction was crying. She bawled into my arms, and still does when she thinks about it. There are times when she just lays there, in silence, staring at nothing. Then there are times where she will get extremely angry, yelling at me for even trying to give her words of advice. She then goes back to crying, or laying in bed in the dark for hours, it seems.

**A little more info:**

Her whole reason to move here was to work for this company. This company specializes in a very particular market, one which doesn't have many competitors (or at least, doesn't have many competitors that do as 'good' of a job as this company). She misses her family and friends back home constantly, and she hears about all their good news all the time (""Soandso got a new job!"" or ""Soandso got engaged!""). Even I recently got a great new job at a company I really admire.

She feels like moving here was a mistake. She feels like she's let everyone down (including me), by having us move here and leave everything and everyone behind. She feels incredibly alone, even when I go to console her. And I feel terrible because I simply don't know what to say.

**What I need from you, Reddit:**

I need to know what to say or do in this situation. Regardless if moving here for her ""dream job"" was a good or bad decision, I need to know what to tell her. What should I do? How can I lift her spirits and give her confidence? I want her to feel like there's always another way to reach her dreams, even if it isn't with this company. *(Note: I did just find that there are some part-time jobs her ""dream"" company offers, so I could pitch that idea to her. But they pay significantly less and don't have much in the way of benefits.)*

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

-----

**TL;DR:** Girlfriend and I moved across the country for an internship with her ""dream job."" Meanwhile, all her friends got hired at great new jobs (even I got hired by a great company). So my girlfriend also wants to be a part of everyone's good news, and make her friends and family proud. Her internship with Dream Co. ended, she interviewed for a full-time slot, and didn't get it. Now she feels like crap for having moved all the way here, only to not get the job she was so passionate about. She feels like she's let everyone down and has made a big mistake by betting everything on this. Regardless if that is true, what can I say or do to help her?

I think everyone is still proud of her, I know I am. But what else can I do or say to cheer her up?

Thanks."

The road I am on leads to my second bachelors in Comp Engineering. However, I am so behind classes I find my mind wandering back to another road, my first college degree in art. However again, I see many of my old classmates in jobs and paid internships, so I feel like it is already to late for me. The last road is to become an educator. I am pretty much transfixed on this one. I dabbled in Japanese, and I even have studied abroad. I have other friends with the same credentials already in the a pretty good teaching program. I have tutoring experience as well. 

Why am I venting about this copious amount of opportunity? I am tired of typical traditional Americans patronizing me like I am some mama's boy (I called lawyer about a recent court case.) Just in case you are wondering. I have already tried medication and therapy. They lead me to trying for a second degree which is why I really don't want to trust the health administration anymore.

Any advice or similar experiences would help. Thanks for reading :)"

Some background info is in order though. I have two B.A in Sociology and Political Science and little previous work experience. My work experience includes customer service type jobs and two stints in a book bindery. I regret not using my time wisely and not taking part in an internship; I tell every college student this now. This has led me to my current predicament. 


I have been applying for both temporary get on my feet jobs and more career oriented jobs. I get interviews for the temporary jobs and no call backs from the career jobs. I am noticing that with regards to the “jobs” a common question of theirs is my holding of two degrees and my commitment to staying with them. Without any type of feedback from the “career” type positions, my best guess is that I am either automatically screened out of the position by the application software or by a person given my lack of experience. 


While I know I am qualified for the positions or willing to give them a commitment if I am able to move up it seems I am unable to convey this in a manner to assuage their misgivings. I am happy to prove myself and start work at the bottom. I just need a chance at the opportunity at this point. With the “career” type positions I would be happy to get an in-person interview at this point to boost my moral a little. 


The question is how best can I address this situation, and what steps do I need to take in order to achieve my goal of meaningful employment?


On a related note, how best can I inform them of my informal computer experience? To illustrate, I only took a single Computer Science class in College, and yet I have looked into/learned about setting up a Windows Domain when I lived alone. I thought it would be fun and a cool thing to do. I still want to do it, so I still think it would be fun I just need the money to build a server since I would probably try and go with TurnKey Domain Controller. 


Thank you all for your help. "

I've been offered a software development internship at Epic and wanted to get some locals' opinions on the company, and, ideally, the internship itself. I'll be moving in from out of town for the summer. I have heard loads of good things about Epic, namely that the campus is fantastic and they are one of the industry leaders in HealthIT. However, I have heard a few negative things too, such as the high turnover rate, the sometimes unreasonable hours, and the lack of industry standards in some aspects of their systems (cache, Visual Basic). I think some of the negatives won't apply to me as I'll only be there for the summer. Can anyone provide any additional input or comment on what I've said? Much appreciated"

I have data for ten different cardiac parameters from around a thousand patients. 

For each parameter, I have two measurements: a ""baseline"" measurement taken at a random time when the patient visited the doctor, and a measurement taken shortly before the same patient suffered a heart attack. I want to discover which parameters (if any) show characteristic changes before a heart attack happened. 

So basically, I want to be able to do some test that will allow me to say, ""The period directly before a heart attack is associated with an increase in parameter X and a decrease in parameters Y and Z"".

Can anyone help me select a good test (or set of tests) to perform this analysis? Also, how would I be able to extend these tests to account for possible interactions between parameters (something like, ""an increase in parameter X was associated with impending heart attack, but only if there was also a decrease in parameter Y""?)

Thank you in advance."

Finally got around to building a computer (which I've wanted to do for six years now) now that I've got a paid internship and thus, some spending money. I was convinced to buy the unlocked i5 by /r/buildapc but at the moment it's running at the motherboard's automatic 4.0 Ghz overclock (I'll give manually tuning it a try next weekend).

I'm really happy about the 7950's performance - I've got it overclocked to 1045MHz and it's still running cool and stable. Unfortunately they'll probably be impossible to find when I try to crossfire in a year or two but one of the benefits of going to AMD is that I'll be able to throw in a 280x and they should work together without giving me any problems. 

Only trouble I ran into was an improperly formatted Windows install the first time, so I had to repeat the process (and redownload everything) the next day.

-Or is it smarter to do this the other way: installing only every network card drivers and then let windows update everything?

I have had  2 internships in college in IT but it has mostly been QA/System Testing/UAT Testing, and I worked on some Visual Basic code with one of the managers and run MS Access queries with another manager. But I barely remember what I did in these internships it was 5 years ago. I am trying to look up any code/details I have from those internships so I can talk about them more, because whatever phone interviews I have had they have asked about it. 

I'm don't want a front end job, I want to work back-end. I don't think I could even get a full on front end job anyways since I have no experience in that apart from writing some very basic html/css. I have had one interview for an entry level position where I feel I did decently well, but they also asked really simple questions. 

**My question is, what should I be doing to learn and showcase what I've learnt, and is there any hope that I would even have a career in programming now**. I see kids who are graduating making apps etc. for classes now. i don't have a github yet. My web app is very very basic write now. i thought since Im brushing up on Java i should also make an Android app. But I feel it'll all be too simple to put on github. It is also not that I want to do only Java and Rails, but I feel it gives me basics for OOP and MVC structures, and job descriptions for entry level seem to ask for understanding on any one of the languages/frameworks. 

It's also highly discouraging when I see my friends who graduated with me 3 years ago are either making or close t making 100k+ by now while i'm just looking for an entry level job. "

My current position is not very exciting as despite being hired as a Software Dev, we're currently doing software testing (think QA) for this contract, which is to last at least 10 more months.

My main concern is the working environment in a company like Oracle. Despite the poor career development in my current workplace, the environment is amazing. Very open and relaxed with great peers and honestly besides the paycheck it's what's keeping me here.

As per Oracle, looking around Glassdoor returns not so stellar reviews of the work environment. Also talked to a friend who did a 16 month internship for them who agreed that its rigid corporate structure wasn't so exciting and was rather suffocating.

My main appeal for Oracle is the possible rich career development it may offer as Java is my forte. But outside of that I'm not too excited from what I've gathered so far.

I have a meeting with a campus recruiter I reached out to on my own within the next few days from a Canadian Big 5 bank. I want to get into the trading division of the firm. Fortunately I’m also visiting their trading floor/meeting with traders in a week, but after my visit with the recruiter.   What are general good things I should talk about with them? The markets? The company? Myself? Their summer analyst program? This is my first time doing this.

Bit of background: 
I go to a decent school in Ontario, in my third year of a 5 year program. I had a 3.7 in first year, placed at the top of my class in a summer abroad to a very ‘top’ university. Unfortunately I bombed second year (~2.5 gpa, 2 fails in pretty key courses) after a childhood friend passed away and my academic life turned to trash. Since then though in the past 6 months I’ve really gotten my shit together. This summer I had an internship at a top boutique consulting company and did good work for a few really recognizable names. I didn’t like the field though, and am writing the cfa L1 exam in December (Confident I’ll pass, and yes I have been approved to write it). Over two courses in the summer and this semester, I’m pretty confident I’ll average about a 3.8-3.9 (I’m repeating two courses and taking a lot of really heavy econ/finance courses).  I also have a lot of finance related extracurriculars (strong competition placing, active involvement with an investing club, econ department president) and would rate my interview skills and technical abilities (ie following the markets, problem solving questions, trading strategies knowledge) to be at least a notch or two above my peers. I’m mostly worried about passing the gpa hurdle (I’m at a 3.2-3.3 right now) to get an interview. 

Any advice about anything at all would be really appreciated.
Thanks everyone.

(While I do like the idea of non-profit work, they are only tangentially connected. The work is extremely basic, boring, and not what I wanted to do for the next year, let alone the rest of my life. But, I was happy that I had something.)

Now, fast forward a year and a half later. The internship is long over and I have been working for just a bit over minimum wage all this time, still living with his parents. (We have been sleeping separately, I should mention. He gave up his bed and has been sleeping on the couch, a fact which compounds my guilt.) I have networked and interviewed, but things have gone nowhere. On the other hand, just recently my SO has started a new job. Less than a month after taking the bar exam, he applied to some blind postings online and was offered a job as an associate attorney.

I am here for advice because what should be just a joyous situation is leaving me feeling completely crushed, depressed, and filled with anxiety. I worked so hard in school and have never had a problem when I put my mind to something - good grades, research grants, etc. But, now I feel like a complete failure who can't even start my career, while my SO barely tries and gets an incredible job offer. I am stuck doing something I don't enjoy, but I can't really quit because I need the money and I don't want to piss off his mother. (Our relationship has been strained enough due to some bad things going on at work and frustrations carrying over into the personal life, which I can't escape because of our current living situation, which, if you can't tell, I am miserable about... As much as I appreciate what they have done for me, the household is extremely dysfunctional and can be an extremely stressful place to be.)

Ladies, pardon my language but I feel like a royal fuck up. I am completely depressed and anxious and I can't seem to make anything happen for myself. I feel like it is going to affect our relationship, and that it will very possibly ruin my relationship with his parents. I am at a loss here about what I can do differently and how to improve things for us and save these relationships. He had another call for an interview over the weekend, and I couldn't hide my frustration... (This isn't even everything that is going on regarding my relationship with these people, but this is what is currently at the forefront, causing me constant stress.) We are hopefully going to move out soon, and I know I'm not going to be able to pull my weight.

Do I just need to suck it up and be patient? Is there anything else I can do to improve my chances at finding a career or where my skills might be attractive....? I've talked to my SO about my feelings... is there anything else I can do that will help me not to dump my depressed feelings onto him when he should be happy? Does anyone have a personal story about experiencing something similar so I don't feel so alone? (I know other people have been in bad employment situations... I just feel like all this other relationship shit has made it worse.)

Sorry for rambling... Thanks to those of you who read this far.


TL;DR I am a fuck up when it comes to starting my career, I'm starting to hate my SO's family, and I am having a hard time being happy for his success. "

The 'next step' that I want to take, a PhD, won't happen for nearly a year at the earliest. Besides that, my other opportunities won't start for another 4 months at the earliest (other degrees, internship opportunities, anything related to my career).

I could move out, closer to where I work, but I'm not getting paid because of the fucking shutdown and my secondary job hunt isn't going well.

Of resignation, casually accepting that you won't visit your mother in the hospital because of a bullshit excuse.

As an applicant I had to write to paragraphs consisting of at least 1000 characters. The first prompt is:

&gt;1.What are you goals for the future and how will participating in the PENCIL Fellows Program help you reach those goals? Please be specific.

The second one is as follows:

&gt;2.Some students have a background or story that is so central to their identity that they believe their application would be incomplete without it. If this sounds like you, then please share your story.

These are my two paragraphs. They will be separated with 1 &amp; 2 to show the two different prompts. 

Prompt #1 Response:

&gt; 1.In the future I would like to be a successful software engineer. The PENCIL Fellowship Programs allows students to create bonds with a variety of corporations. Through these bonds interns have a chance to gain expand their knowledge and at the same time have a chance to make money for their projects and work. If I have a chance to participate in the Pencil Fellowship Program I believe that it will allow me to enlarge my knowledge on many topics as well as create connections and ties with these corporations. In the fast paced world that we live in, connections and ties are a must have essential. Not only do these help you enter college but they assist in landing a job in further fields.  The PENCIL program will place me into job learning environments in which I can gain experience, software engineering requires a lot of experience as it is field highly sought for and many companies search for the best of the best engineers to partake in their projects. Having this experience will teach me how to act in a real job like environment and help me become one of the best interviewee.

Prompt #2 Response:

&gt; Something that has helped shape my identity is being my older brother’s shadow.  My older brother has always done exceptional in school, graduating high school in 11th grade and achieving all the possible scholarships and merits that he could obtain, while  achieving the highest grades in his class. Being the younger brother, I am expected to meet up to his standards.  Having these expectations set upon me, I would like to shine and surpass my older brother in ways that he could not at his time. This motive keeps me in search of new opportunities that are available to me and utilizing all the time and materials I am given. My parents have always tried comparing me to my older brother in many ways and this is one of my other motives, to finally be praised upon. With this drive it has made me do many things that my older brother hadn’t done during his time, such as community service and extracurricular activities. Without this my identity would never be the man I am, instead this has shaped to be better.

1pi203,2,2013-10-29,"Day 0 for me, 4 for my friend... Smoking since high school, graduating college this year.",longhorn2013,leaves,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/1pi203/day_0_for_me_4_for_my_friend_smoking_since_high/,"WARNING: this is a rant/wall of text :)

I started smoking on a handful of social occasions my senior year of high school. Most of my friends had started smoking, and so I willing tried it. I didn't like it at first... But when I went to college my freshman year, my roommate and I began to smoke heavily. Vaping in our dorm room and smoking in parking garages were stupid, high-risk ways we got high.

At first, smoking was amazing. There were a number of occasions I literally laughed crazily for 15 minutes straight. It made music better. It made food better. It made movies and video games better. I went from smoking on Friday nights, to day baking, and smoking before class. The outcome after 1 year of this was that I had not met many new people after starting smoking, I had got a little out of shape, and had earned mediocre grades.

Looking forward to a fresh start that summer, I hoped to quit smoking. Luck would have it that the roommate I was assigned to at my internship was a frat guy &amp; big smoker. We smoked hard, and, while I let it, it lowered my social ambition, causing me to lose out on some experiences.

Going into the Fall, I had had a great summer. But, I moved in with 2 heavy drug abusers (more than just pot -- like popping ex multiple times a week), and it was awful. Our drug dealer &amp; tons of their random friends were always over (I had become friends with them less and less). After earning a 2.6 GPA, my parents found out I smoked, and I had to move home for a semester.

I stopped smoking for about 6-8 weeks over winter break. It felt great! After a week I felt noticeably more articulate, and my drive to do other things came back after 2 weeks. I can still picture some of the crazy vivid dreams I had... However, I slowly but surely sank back into the pattern of daily smoking. I did, however, stick with my goals and earned a 3.9, exercised more, met people, etc. I convinced myself I could smoke all the time and meet these goals -- but really this was a lie since most of what I accomplished happened in the first few months when I wasn't blazing.

Anyways, over this last summer I interned in WA, where trees are legal. Thus, I smoked heavily -- this whole time I had settled in at about the rate of 1-1.5oz/month, which was running me $250-400 bucks a month. I really began to notice an effect on my job performance -- as I would forget certain key things, or go blank in the middle of a conversation. Given that the internship was at a top tech company, I couldn't afford to be off my game. Overall, the cloudiness in my mind made the internship more stressful than it needed to be.. I took a week long break near the end, but was jolted out of it when I was pressured by a friend to smoke joints at this concert.

Weed has exacerbated some of the problems I face. I have withdrawn from my family &amp; parents. I don't really like college and feel that I am wasting my time. I have gained a bit of weight and really hate the way I look b/c of it. I need to exercise and play soccer more. I can feel myself going down the 2.6 path again (smoking all day, playing LoL, watching TV, not studying, skipping class, etc), and have to turn things around right now. 

I smoked the last of my stash, and one of my best ent pals has also been abstaining for the last 4 days (as he needs to pass a drug test). I want to quit weed this time for good. I duct taped my smoke box &amp; bong up and hid them in the attic, and am now looking forward to life without weed.

For the first time in my life I don't feel in control. I am so afraid I am going to fail, waste my life smoking, and let down my friends and family members. I am ashamed by these flaws that I constantly hide from everyone. I am sick of being a lazy stoner."
1pi0jv,3,2013-10-29,The man with me,MollsVMK,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1pi0jv/the_man_with_me/,"For as long as I can remember, I have felt a presence with me. When I was younger, it took two forms: one as a thin blonde woman who had the body of a ballet dancer and the other was a tall man in a black trench coat and some kind of hat shadowing his face. 


As a child, I never thought much about them. I could always feel when they were there. I would see them out of the corner of my eye. Most of the time, the feelings took place at home, but occasionally I would see them when I was outside. 


One night, when I was about 9, I heard sirens outside. I figured it was just a cop pulling someone over because it was common for people to blow past the stop sign by my house. However, when I looked outside, there was nothing there and the sirens stopped. My sister and I shared a bunk bed so I glanced down from my top bunk to see if the sirens had woken her up. Nope. She was fast asleep.


I tried to go back to bed but I heard the sirens again. I looked outside and still nothing and once again, the sirens stopped. I lay back down but heard the sirens and this time, there was a man’s voice talking. It sounded like he was speaking through a megaphone but I could clearly hear him saying, “Come outside! Get out now!” He kept repeating this. I was finally scared by the sirens and by the red and blue lights that were now flashing into my room… But there were no police cars outside. 


I began to sob, terrified, and my sister finally woke up. She went and got my parents. There was never anything outside and no one else in the neighborhood had heard anything. I tried to brush it off as a dream but I knew it wasn’t a dream. I’ve always been very good at knowing the difference. 


About a year after that experience, my family moved to a house that was alone on top of a hill. It used to be a farm but the property was donated to the city to be used as a park and my family moved there so that me dad could be the park ranger. 


I would still see the man out of the corner of my eye form time to time, but the woman never came back. For a few years, I didn’t even see or feel the man’s presence but about a year ago, I started to feel it again, this time when I was in bed alone. I would be on the edge of sleep when I would suddenly feel someone watching me. It would happen all the time, too. His presence gave me an overwhelming sense of dread and terror. I don’t know how to deal with it. I would even feel it when recently when I slept at my boyfriends apartment or at my dorm. My university is only a 40-minute drive from home so I figured the close proximity is what kept the figure near me.


Now, I am on an internship in a state halfway across the country and I have not felt the presence since. However, I am dreading going home because I don’t want to feel it again. I am also transferring to my sister’s university, which is in the same town as mine. I say this because her school is famous for its haunts and she has had her own experiences. She even had experiences in our old house as a child.


I never felt in danger until the time with the sirens but now, whenever I feel the presence, I just feel like I’m surrounded by evil. That man in his long coat and hat. "

I'm 27 and an only child. When I was about 4 years old, my parents and I moved out of our home and into my (dad's mom) grandmother's to help take care of my grandpa who was dying from cancer. 

Eventually my grandpa died. At my grandmother's insistence, my parents and I stayed at her house because she did not want to live there alone. My parents were bad off financially anyway, so it really worked out for my family.

I grew up around this old bitch. She constantly promised me things then never did them. I guess it was my first dose of reality as a little girl. It still sucks to be promised a puppy when you're five years old and it never comes to fruition. Not a ""we'll see"" type thing, but she would actually say ""we'll go down to the shelter on Friday and pick out a dog."" She was always extremely specific in her promises so it made you feel like she would actually follow through. 

I've dealt with her shit my whole life. She would constantly accuse me of stealing things (I never once did and gave her no reason to). She always made me run her errands and do everything aside from wiping her ass for her. 

I got a job after high school and took some time off before going to college. I really jerked around in college but finally got my shit together and got my Bachelor's with honors. This year I'm finishing up a double Master's degree. Every year I've had a 3.5 GPA or higher - I've genuinely worked my ass off in school and in my internships. 

Every time I've tried to move out of the house, my parents begged me to stay. My dad is a high-stress kind of guy and he gets really upset when I tell him I'm leaving. I don't want to cause my wonderful father undue stress. 

They actually need me to stay because my mom works two jobs so she's gone all day and my dad works day-times. My internship is in the morning before he leaves and my classes are in the evening by the time he gets home. Basically, they need someone to stay at home and make sure my 90 year old bitch grandma doesn't set the house on fire (this has almost happened on more than one occasion) or fall down (when she falls she can't get up, then requires two people to lift her because she weighs a million pounds and won't help herself up at all). 

Basically, I'm stuck here. She's a disgusting old bitch. Any time there's a cake, she sticks her finger in it and licks the frosting. Any time someone brings home some food, she takes bites off of it and ruins it for everyone else. She leaves perishables like milk out on the counter instead of the fridge. If I'm cooking something on the stove, she takes a spoon and eats out of it and puts the spoon back in. She constantly leaves messes for everyone else to clean. I have to hide food in my own house if I want it to be uncontaminated. 

She feeds my dog poisonous things no matter how much I ask her not to - I count my lucky stars he hasn't died yet. When she actually does decide to wash her clothes she uses all the detergent. She's constantly telling my boyfriend to do things for her then treats him like complete shit and excludes him from everything.

She's my dad's mom. She only has one other child, my dad's sister. I'm my dad's only child. His sister (let's call her Lora) has three kids. Grandmother basically forced Lora into a marriage for money. Grandmother has always shown preference to Lora and her kids, yet didn't ask them to come live with her when her husband was dying. Any time we do something to slight her that we're completely unaware of, she goes running and crying to them to make us jealous(?). 

Thing is, Lora and her kids are worthless and treat her like shit. None of them have amounted to anything besides having multiple abortions or going to jail. They only call Grandmother when they need money, and she gladly gives it to them. For example, every year we have Thanksgiving at my mom's sister's and invite Grandmother. She decided she didn't want to go anymore, so Lora tells Grandmother that she'll come get her and take her to her house and have Thanksgiving. Doesn't happen. Last year we have Thanksgiving at our house and I cook EVERYTHING, Grandmother decides she doesn't want to come out of her room and sits there and pouts all day after I did all the work and invited Lora's shitstain family. This bitch couldn't turn sunlight into drama. 

I'm financially in a shitty situation. My internship is unpaid and I'm in the last few months of my classes. I owe my school $800 that I don't have, at all. I was going to try to figure something out, try to wedge in some work around my hectic schedule to pay this balance off. I happened to be ranting about it one day (about three weeks ago) when Grandmother heard me ranting. She offered to give me $1,000 to help and for Christmas. I DID NOT ASK HER FOR HELP. She offered. I told her she didn't have to that I would be okay. She insisted that I always come to her when I have a problem and that she'd be so glad to help me.

This really made me happy. I have two sisters on my mom's side of the family (I wasn't raised with them). Sadly, these two sisters haven't done much with their lives and are extremely poor. Between them, they have five kids. Every year I try to make their Christmas a good one since no one else will - their fathers aren't in their lives. One of the children was sexually abused by one of the fathers, the other has had several medical problems. As an educator, I pick out toys and activities that will enrich them and that they'll enjoy, not just silly knickknacks. I love making them happy with books, dough, craft sets, coloring supplies, etc. I was upset that I wouldn't be able to give them such a good Christmas this year because of my situation, but my Grandmother was going to be my ray of sunshine so I could do it this year.

Apparently two days ago while I was gone, she berated my parents about my financial situation. She asked them how much they planned on helping and told them I wasn't her only grandkid. My parents didn't even know about my situation because I didn't want to drop that on them, ugh. 

Today she broke me. She asked me when I needed the money by and how much it was again. I told her I needed it by the first, and that it was $800. She tells me all of the sudden that one of Lora's kids need help too because he's in college. First of all, he gets a free ride to college because his dad was in the military. Second of all, his yearly tuition is $7,000 compared to my $24,000. Third of all, his parents are financially much better off than my parents. Lora's kids have come to her needing bail money that never got repaid, abortion money, house/car payments, furniture money, cell phone money, etc. They CONSTANTLY need money from her. While yes my parents and I live with my grandmother, we don't ask for money at all. We cook, clean, run all her errands, pick up her medication, etc in exchange for a place to live. We're collectively live-in servants that get paid in-place for a home to live in. 

I mean yeah, you could argue need based versus fairness. If she were just trying to be fair that would be fine too, I guess. But the point is, she promised me $1,000 to help me by the first. She backpedaled and said she couldn't do it anymore at all because Lora's kid needs beer money or something. I snapped and just told her I never even asked for her help, that I didn't want it at all.

I don't know what to do in this situation anymore. She's constantly pissing me the fuck off and it's not healthy for me. My boyfriend and another friend have both offered me a place to live. But she also needs basically round-the-clock care and my dad really needs me to stay. 

I'm so stressed out that I don't know what to do with myself anymore. I just want to punch the old bitch in her fat wrinkled face. "

I receive a lot of computer science courses through the Information Technology side of the degree, but I hoped that my accounting side would make me more attractive to employers for a fiancial software type position...

Apparently not. Recently emailed a recruiter basically asking for tips on why I wasnt brought in for an interview for a fiancial software developer internship. She basically told me her and all the other software industry recruiters look for mainly computer science majors and that the accounting part won't give me any kind of advantage in this industry. I am now thinking about changing my major to Computer Science, but I am still not sure what I should do. I plan to go see my advisor soon and see if it would be a option or where to go from here.

Any advice from y'all out there?"

I have been looking for a co-op, both for the experience and money. As I live an hour and fifteen minutes from the nearest large city (LA), there are very few local companies to choose from. 

I was able to book a co-op with a small fundraising foundation, but it has nothing to do with software development and mostly helping with computer related tasks. They have a website made on sitecore, and a database system made by Allegiance, so obviously no coding for me to do.

The only allure would be the $10 h/r pay, which would help a lot at the moment. But I am worried that this sort of thing couldn't even go on a resume. If so, should I take the internship? Should I keep looking for something else? "
1ph8yi,118,2013-10-29,What do you mean I can't double discount?,rugbygirl24,TalesFromRetail,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/1ph8yi/what_do_you_mean_i_cant_double_discount/,"**Background:** I work the front desk at a high end hair salon in the USA. Whenever the company hires a new person they put them through a roughly 9 month long paid internship program to get them up to the ""standard of excellence"" expected from each technician. During this time they are referred to as junior stylists/colorist. The juniors are able to take appointments during this time but the prices are about half of what the least expensive full price haircut/color would cost with a full priced technician. The salon operates on a level system, meaning the longer a tech has worked there generally the more expensive their prices to reflect their skill level. The salon is also departmentalized so stylists only cut hair and colorist only color.


So seeing a junior for a service is a great deal. You get high quality work done for half or more than half the price of full priced services (most juniors have worked in other salons so they have experience and they are also supervised by a mentor who checks their work before the juniors guest leaves). Also anytime a new guest comes in they receive a thank you packet of coupons for being new to the salon and to give them and incentive to come back. These coupons do not apply to junior services as they are already heavily discounted, although it does not expressly state that in the fine print on the coupons, people frequently give us a hard time about this. 


**Story:** When I had just finished training and was working my first closing shift alone I get a phone call literally 3 mins before we close (10pm). I pick up with my normal pleasant greeting, get no greeting in return, just a ""yeah, I want to see a junior colorist."" I asked what kind of color service she needed to get done and told her the days the junior worked. That was the first problem, the days the junior worked weren't good for her schedule or someone had already booked an appointment at the time she wanted. 


I'm doing everything I can to make this work somehow but she is getting more and more frustrated with me. She then tells me she wants to book a time 30 mins before close, not a time I offered as available. I calmly try to explain that we do not book color appointments that close to closing time because it will take 30 mins to apply the color and another 45mins to an hour for it to process. By the time she would be shampooed and blow dried that would be about an hour and half past close and we simply do not book color appointments that way.


This is when she lost her damn mind. She starts yelling at me, saying ""So you just kick people out the door as soon as you close? This is ridiculous! I'm trying to come in and give you my money, I've been on the phone with you for 15 mins (it had been 5 or 6mins max) and you can't seem to work the computer!"" I once again calmly tried to explain that no, we do not kick people out as soon as we close but we do book color appointments in a way that allows for them to end before or right as we are closing. She then proceeds to go on a huge rant about how she'll have to miss her grandsons baseball game and he'll be so upset and blah blah blah. All I'm thinking is I don't care please just give me your name so I can book this appointment and go home!


She finally gave me her name, I put her down for an appointment that would allow her to leave halfway through her grandsons game and before getting off the phone she says ""oh wait, I have one of those new guest coupons!"" My heart sinks because I know exactly which coupon she's talking about and I was also fairly certain it would not apply to a junior service. The coupon is for $20 off color which would make the $31 service she wanted $11, a service that at its cheapest full price is $60! I tell her that I am pretty sure the coupon would not apply as the junior services are already heavily discounted and she starts to read me the fine print on the coupon in a snarky voice, saying it says nothing about junior technicians. My voice starts to shake as I once again try to explain that I am almost positive the coupon will not apply and she loses it again, this time attacking my personally saying I am the worst customer service person she has ever had to deal with, she can't afford it she can't use the coupon, she is gonna have to miss her grandsons baseball blah blah you suck blah blah. When she finally stops I tell her I will have my manager contact her in the morning. She tells me one more time how incompetent I am and hangs up.


I called my manager immediately on the verge of tears and still semi shocked at what just happened, I had worked customer service before but never had someone treat me that poorly. My manager is able to calm me down, tells me I didn't do anything wrong, and that I was absolutely right, this crazy woman cannot use the coupon for a junior service. I will never understand why people think it is ok to be so rude to customer service employees. 


**Edit:** Sorry I'm such a noob at this! Hopefully this formatting is better and I tried to cut some of the fat from the story.


**TL;DR** Woman wanted to use coupon on an already heavily discounted service and called me the worst customer service person she has ever had to deal with."

I have had an internship in Austin since March as well as a brief position TAing for CS on Hong Kong. 

So here's the deal:


- job offer from JPMorgan ( app dev): 28/hr plus signon bonus. My family lives there (houston) so I will have a free place to stay, a car, and be able to see.friends. They want an answer by 11/4 and really want me

- Bloomberg just offered to fly me to NYC for an interview sometime in the next few weeks...after my JPMorgan decision is expected. A former intern from my school said to expect 30/hr and there will either be a small stipend for housing (2000) or putting me up in the NYU dorms. Would have to pay for all my own food and extra expenses though of course compared ot being home.

- current internship is at at a research lab. 15/hr. They want me to stay for the long term and will pay for grad school but its more QA and not want I want to do. I work there full time for summer and part time during the school year.I think the best decision would be to quit now instead of staying another semester.

So.....what would you do?


__________________________________
EDIT: 
JPMorgan is in Houston, Bloomberg is in NYC

I talked to two people from my school (UT Austin) who already interned there and said they liked it alot. They were given 2000 stipend for housing (covers nearly half for housing in manhattan is you are lucky) but that they said they were trying to provide complete housing the next year in NYU dorms.

It is my understanding that Bloomberg would be more prestigious perhaps? One of them worked at Microsoft right after Bloomberg. I am thinking of extending my jpmorgan decision deadline if possible. 
I will find out about Bloomberg in 4 weeks.

Microsoft came to my school yesterday (10/28) and gave a little pitch about internships and full time work there. Obviously they are looking for software people (I asked about hardware, they couldn't really give me a good answer...).

If you are interested in an internship at Microsoft, they said now is the time to apply as they are looking for their next round of interns now. They said that around January or so they're usually full up so now is the time to do it!

If I remember correctly, they usually do something along the lines of 6 to 12 month internships, and are especially looking for students who are ""a summer away from graduating,"" which means Juniors at a minimum.

First lets take a look at my current financial situation:

-I make 57k a year

-I have 30k in savings

-I have 8k in debt.

-I have little job security at the moment, which makes this tricky.

To elaborate on my last point, I went to a two year college for electronic engineering. While there I landed a pretty sick internship, which after I graduated turned into a full time job in the computer science field. I had to have 3 VP signatures to bypass HRs education requirements for that job since it required a bachlors degree. I would like to purchase my first home, but if I were to be laid off in the next year, which given the companies recent performance is very possible, I will take roughly a 50 percent pay cut going back to my actual field.

My question is what price range is considered fundamentally sound given these circumstances. My parents are pushing me to buy a nicer house which in my area they are considering 100-125k. I may have found a nice starter home for 55k that needs some maintenance including siding, but overall was well taken care of. I dont know whats a better practice. On one hand I would much prefer the nicer home, but on the other that much debt scares the absolute shit out of me.

EDIT: I know there are tools to determine your affordable price range, but I don't trust them. It seems that they overestimate your range a bit.

That's the number of hours I got to spend with her and realized I love her, and it's breaking my heart.

When I was an intern, I saw this girl I have a crush on at school. She graduated one year before I would have, and not really expecting her to be my supervisor for my 486 hours required to pass my on the job training course.

A couple years later, she was the senior web developer and server admin at [office] and she was the one in charge of the OJTs.

I got to know her as the hours went on. We chat and talk at lunch and any downtime. We had the same likes and dislikes, and we got along better than most of her co-workers did with her.

Then it got awkward for me.

She likes to wear dresses to work, and I have a thing for shapely white legs. I would blush when her leg brushes mine when she wants to point out something on my PC. When I accidentally dropped my fork between her toes and I instinctively grabbed it, my right cheek brushing her leg.

I would blush and curse myself when I try to take a peek of her on my monitor or just glance her way. I felt guilty.

But the thing is, as the hours grew on I was not looking at the physical side anymore, but her heart. The way she smiles and complement me when I did a great job. The gratitude she gives whenever I do little things for her. 

Since I'm the only one with a car, I let my coworkers carpool. At the end, it would only be the two of us, talking and chatting.

When I went home, before I get our of the car, I always look the passenger seat and there's an ache in my chest because even though we are very compatible, we will never be with each other.

My 486 hours are up, and we talk and text and message eachother, but she doesn't see me get depressed at the fact that I'm in love with her and it's breaking my heart.

I've been looking around, commenting and such on /r/longdistance for a while and I've decided to post my story here. I live in the Netherlands, and she in Sydney, Australia
My name is Harm.


**Pre-dating**


Let me start at the beginning. When I was 16 I was kind of lonely and I was addicted to a game called FlyFF. I played this a lot and I had so much fun. I was in a guild(a group of players) and after a while I got kicked out which made me sad and mad, I didn't have that much friends at school nor in my town (none actually) so the game was basicly all I had. A few days later I joined another guild and the persons in that guild were really nice to me there was 1 person that was in particular nice and she invited me over to help and borrowed me a lot of expensive stuff right away. After I was done with helping we hanged around on Skype for a while and we had a lot of fun playing http://omgpop.com/ the next day I talked to her more and more and I found out her name was Lin and she lived in Sydney, Australia. 

This all happened somewhere in early September in the end of September I headed to Paris with school and I brought my iPad along to talk to her (we weren't dating at this point) because I was in love with her. During a trip through Paris all I could think about was getting back to the hotel to swing on my iPad and talk to her... 


**Dating**


A few days later, in one of the nights I stayed up till 2AM just to talk to her (duo to the time difference and we were screwing around, and we ended up dating on the 5th of October, 2 days before my birthday. After a while we stopped playing FlyFF because it just sucked and we started playing other games, first S4League then some Left4Dead2 and later /r/leagueoflegends together. 
We skyped for hours and hours, even slept with the headsets on just so we could wake up and hear eachtother, our record was 28 hours and it only ended because Skype disconnected.  
After roughly half a year I decided I really liked her and I really wanted to visit her and I told my parents that I wanted to go to Sydney, So I went to Sydney for 4 weeks. It was the first time I fly, first time I leave Europe and I went alone. 



**The first trip**


I was leaving the Netherlands from Amsterdam to Singapore and then through Adelaide to Sydney. The trip took 34 hours and I was so tired when I landed because I couldn't sleep on the plane. All these thoughts rushed through my head, how tall will she be? Will she be excited? What will she smell like? 

When I landed I rushed through the airport, through the customs and through a black tunnel. At the end were a few desks and a hallway that goes around the corner to the arrival hall. I walked around the corner and I took a quick look through the hall and I saw her jump up and run towards the point where I would exit the hall. I calmly walked through, trying to act cool (and I was tired), and when I saw her I hugged her and I fell a tear rolling down my eyes, I remember the smell of her shampoo and I had this weird feeling, this unreal but familair feeling. *It was amazing!* We walked to the trainstation and I remember hearing her voice and noticing it was different from what I heard on skype we went on the train towards her house. When we arrived I fell down on her bed and she laid next to me as we cuddled for about 2 hours, I was so happy I could finally touch her.

The strangest thing is that everything felt so familiar I knew this girl but yet it was so new and refreshing! This feeling is the best and I LOVE it!

These 4 weeks ended up in a lot of "" firsts "" , the first date, the first movie, the first kiss, the first time on the beach, the first time shopping, the first time McDonalds together. All the things we usually couldn't do. 
Its so strange to do all these things, I mean, watching a movie together without having trouble with the sync or sharing the chips... Its amazing. 
(I wrote a blog about it, It is in Dutch but hey, http://harminaustralie.blogspot.com/ 

After those weeks I had to head back to the Netherlands for an internship. I headed back while it was winter (what they call winter in Sydney) in Sydney and I headed back in September to the Netherlands, which means the Winter in the Netherlands.... This was so depressing. I had an internship for half a year and then a half year school. This was a bad period we missed each other a lot and after months we started fighting an awful lot, I don't really know why but I knew that I couldn't do this much longer. 

After the half year school, and the next half year, starting august 2013 till January 2014 I would have to have another internship and I could do this abroad. I started organizing an internship to Sydney 6 as soon as my internship mentioned earlier ended. I ended up paying an agency to get my internship and I booked my ticket to go to Sydney. I was so happy, I told everyone and I couldn't sleep. I would be able to have my first Christmas, first anniversary together and New years eve in Sydney, TOGETHER!


**The second trip**


I would leave at 8AM and my parents would drop me off at the airport I couldn't sleep... We left at 12AM where I would fly to Paris -&gt; Canton(China) -&gt; Sydney with 24 hours travel time this time and I flew over. 

When I landed in Sydney I knew where to walk where to go and I went through the customs really fast thats when I noticed I had a missed call, she couldn't get a train ticket to the airport because the fares changed since the last time. She was at a station and called me, I told her to calm down, she called her mom to pick her up and drive her to the airport but I waited 10 minutes before she came and picked me up. I was so happy again. I was looking forward to time we are going to have together. 

Later when we were going somewhere we came across the very same station where she called her mom to pick her up. She told me earlier that there was a guy that was comforting her and even offered her to buy a ticket for her because she couldn't afford the ticket. We saw this same guy and he remembered her he told me in an indian accent "" This girl loves you very much! she cry and cry and worry! "" this was so heartwarming, she cared so much about me... I love her

No I am in for 3 months and a bit and I will be heading back on 17 January to the Netherlands. I live with her in her moms house, I work 40 hours a week for free, its an internship... 

I am planning to emigrate to Australia, I love it here! people are awesome and the weather is nice and last but certainly not least /u/Linsky is here :)

Sorry for the long post but I just wanted to write a story. I realise its all over the place but thats just because I wrote this with the emotions I felt/feel. 

Gday from Australia,

I just want to share it with someone who gets the struggle, and if no one replies, it still feels better to type it all out. WALL OF TEXT INCOMING:


Im a college junior. After some pretty good success after finding r/Seduction last year, I've been in a rut for the past 6 months…this pussy drought is as dry as the Sahara. To make a long back story short, one of my good friends and old boss needed 2 interns to replace me when I left, and he wanted two cuties. So I found him 2 sorority girls through a mutual friend. He hired one immediately, but the other he did not have the time to train and put it off. I felt bad for her since she quit her old job for this internship, so I offered her another job working under me with my friend, Jake, who owns a small business (I also work with him doing his financials). I know, I know, don't shit where you sleep; however, this was before I was interested in her.


Fast forward to last Friday: I pick her up to meet Jake to discuss how she can help us. Afterwards I invite her to dinner, which I made into a small mini-date. I thought she seemed very interested. Our convos never died, we people-watched and made elaborate stories, the convo turned sexual, and she seemed to get along with me. We even joked she's going to be my intern: cleaning my car, grabbing me coffee, etc. I let her drive my car in steptronic for her first time (great kino) and she even mentioned that she wanted to do some of our shared interests or adventures together and when I'm 21 we are going out drinking. Seemed like she had a good time and dropped hints of interest. I dropped her off afterwards and realized that I was really into her, and assumed she was into me. We were going to meet with Jake again in exactly one week too.


Texted her today to jokingly grab me a coffee and meet up and chat. Turns out she still bought me a coffee to be a good ""intern."" I figured I'd ask her out to do something and turn it into a date. Pretty much what happened after some generic conversation and inside jokes:


Me: ""What's going no this weekend, just napping and netflix like you always do?""

Her: ""haha no, on Saturday I have this sorority thing for 5 hours, it's really long..""

Me: ""Then clear your schedule Friday after meeting with Jake, we are going out.""

Her: *kind of looked down and mumbled* ""you need a fake ID then""
(She just turned 21, i have 4 months to go""

Me: ""Well lets just go do something more fun that doesn't need one""

Her: ""Maybe…""


It got kind of awkward towards the end, but while we were leaving she seemed normal as if nothing happened. She said she'll see me at Jake's this Friday and then left.


So I'm still not really sure what happened…I made some rookie mistakes: responded poorly to the Fake ID shit test, didn't push the idea of the date more, didn't escalate the first time, putting the pussy on a pedestal, going for a girl I now work with, etc, etc, etc. 


Feels good to just get this confusing, awkward situation out. But I don't really know what to do now…act like nothing happened, brush this off and try again but more assertive, or confront her about working with each other if I want to bang her. Oh well, on to the next one! 
I appreciate any advice, insight, or criticism or the read!


TL;DR: Hired a girl and became attracted to her. Decided fuck it, asked her out, got rejected, don't know what to do next.

1pfu19,3,2013-10-28,I've been shafted by my employer.,Hibiki_D,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1pfu19/ive_been_shafted_by_my_employer/,"A small backstory:

I have been a devoted employee of a cable access television station for over 6 years. 5 of those years I have been part time mainly just due to the structure of the company. Then, after the departure of my superior, our department was reorganized into having 2 production coordinators and a field producer (20hrs PT) instead of a production manager, a production assistant (me 30hrs PT) and a field producer (10hrs PT). Exactly one year ago I was hired as one of those production coordinators along with the field producer at the time. I had a good offer of $28k with benefits and the potential of adding and additional $2k after 6 months.

I am happily married with my wife of 5 years and we also have a 2 year old son. We've done our best to live life comfortably with what we have. My wife makes considerably more than me working as a sales rep for a cell phone company. It doesn't bother me that she makes more money than I do, and it never has.

The other production coordinator was a great guy to work with. He's about 5 years younger than myself and about a month ago he left work to live with his long time girlfriend and intern at an ad agency. This will become relevant in a moment...

My job as a production coordinator is pretty straightforward. We mainly cover live school and government board meetings in our coverage area, we teach and guide our new and current volunteer producers on how to properly create a show to be aired on our channels, and we also loan out equipment to those same people. We are considered a very vital and respected service in our town.

For the past month or so, my work load has been exceptionally heavier than before. Not only am I doing the work of 2 people but we have also been concerned with finding a new production coordinator which easily takes up half of any work day due to meeting with my executive director to organize interview questions, look over resumes and meet with potential candidates.

We have been in the process of updating our equipment including new work computers for myself and our new production coordinator that will be starting in a couple weeks. I decided some time ago that I wanted to change desks since I've been in the same spot ever since I was first hired and felt like I needed a change of view. I spent the entire day today setting up and downloading software for our new computers as well as cleaning out and organizing necessary items from my old desk. Once I was finished cleaning out mine, I then proceeded to look though my old coworkers desk to see if anything needed to be cleaned. That was when I found his offer letter...

He was hired a week after me for the other position. To be perfectly clear, we both have the exact same job and was hired at almost the exact same time and I have been working here longer than he was. If you recall back to earlier in my post, the salary offered for my position was $28k with the potential of becoming $30k after 6 months. My coworker was offered the exact same position for $31,200 (exactly $15 an hour).

I have been under the impression this whole time that myself and my coworker were going to be equals and share responsibility since the former structure didn't work. I have been happily doing my job for over 6 years. I have always been under the impression that this place was a great place to work. There was never a time where I woke up and went ""Crap, I have to go to work..."" Myself and everyone else get along great and there has never been a hint of hostility.

Do they not have enough faith in my talent? Have I not proven myself to be an excellent employee over the past 6 years? While my wife and I pay bills, keep our son happy and keep a roof over our heads, my coworker has had and extra $3k to spend on a DSLR camera and a monthly subscription to a cloud service for Adobe Creative Suite while living with his parents. I couldn't possibly afford that any point while I was employed without putting a strain on my family's budget. HOW IS THIS FAIR!?

I have never felt so depressed, enraged and betrayed before in my life. This honestly makes me wonder why are they keeping me around since it certainly feels like they aren't appreciating my services. If it looked like I was under performing, why haven't they mentioned that at all to me? Now I honestly doubt I will ever get that extra $2k to help my family.

I just really don't know what to think..."
1pfsr5,4,2013-10-28,"""If we would have met later I mightve proposed, but were too young now"" Post-breakup from (21M) to me (20F) (2 years)",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1pfsr5/if_we_would_have_met_later_i_mightve_proposed_but/,"pre-TL;DR: This isn't a post asking how to win my ex back. Just venting and maybe wondering what outside perspective thinks.


My boyfriend and I dated for almost 2 years, from my freshman to the start of my junior year. Other than having rough spots during long distance over the summer we were an awesome couple, very loving and always having fun doing the normal college scene of partying plus I got him to do fun things like restaurants and museums. We broke up a month ago. I stupidly tried to do the friend thing, in a thinly veiled from myself attempt that maybe, he would want to get back together with me. Wrong. I'm depressed, suicidal and according to my counselor socially isolated so it was a shit show without him. I rationalized to myself I would rather be friends with him, friends with benefits, then not have him at all.


This hasn't worked. I'm sad all of the time, every time he leaves I just automatically want to say ""I love you"". I still love him. He told me when he broke up with me that he felt like he was too young to be in a relationship with me, that he did not know where his life is going (he is a senior at the university we both go too) and that he is not mature enough to make a decision like this and that he hates the responsibility of making potentially life-changing decisions. Keep in mind I never once said anything about marriage, though we did talk long-term in moving in together after he graduated, but he always seemed on board. 

Until all of his pig-headed newly single roommates moved in. He wanted to live his last year in college in the typical party-style that MTV shoves down idiots throats as ""teh real college XXXperience WWOOW!"" Of course, you can only have a real college experience without a girlfriend, so I was kicked to the curb like a dog. Even though I explained to him that, yes, this may be long term, this may just be a college relationship, why throw away what beautiful thing he had now, he defends his choices by saying he's too immature to decide and then gets annoyed when I say that his reasons are moronic. While dating I never mentioned marriage or any of that bullshit-- the closest I ever got was saying that every girl has a wedding board pinterest, and even adding that that doesn't mean I am ready to get married ANYTIME soon. He admitted to me that he was going through almost a 'mid-life crisis'.


But the whole spiel was ended with a, ""I see you as a long term girl."" He's said that to me multiple times post-breakup. I asked him drunk last weekend and he hit me with the title. The next day he said he was drunk, that he didn't mean it like that, but he's told me a hell of a lot of truths while drunk. It just hurts me so much that he could think that way, that apparently I'm worth a long term relationship, but he's so fucking stupid he CHOOSES to be immature and thinks that it's a valid excuse.


I fucking hate his guts and want to ruin his college career. There's a tiny dead spot in my heart that is telling me to call his internship and tell them to drug test their interns or send his mother a heartfelt letter begging to get their son help and offering them the list of illegal drugs he does. I want him to get run over by a car when he comes back from a bar coked up and drunk. And I love him too. I want him to come to my dorm with a corgi and a heartfelt apology begging for forgiveness.


I know it's not going to happen. I gave myself today to text him. He barely replies anyway, though he said multiple times that he wanted to be friends. But I realized he's shit at being friends anyway, and I don't want him as a friend. I want him as a boyfriend. So I'm not going to text him anymore, I'm not going to contact him. I deleted his facebook, removed his number... it hurts a lot. I feel like I am being punished for something I didn't do. I'm still so confused how someone so loving and sweet could turn such a 180, still say I'm a long term girl, but still refuse to want to be with me. Next to the tiny spiteful spot in my heart is a spot that says maybe if I don't talk to him for a while, he will come crawling back after his liver fails and he realizes his hairline is way too high for his age bracket. But I realize too that if someone prefers to drink themselves comatose every weekend and defend their choices because they're too immature to make decisions, then fuck them.


tl;dr ExBF explains we are not together because he is too immature for a relationship, drops a huge ass bomb on me. i blocked his fb, deleted his cell, I'm not going to contact anymore, I deserve better."
1pfnzw,1,2013-10-28,I feel like my memories are going to haunt me for the rest of my life.,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1pfnzw/i_feel_like_my_memories_are_going_to_haunt_me_for/,"Background: I started dating a girl last December. She had just gotten out of a four year long relationship and we fell in love extremely quickly. I had never been in a real, serious relationship before and I didn't know what to expect. Everything moved so quickly. By the time May came around we were basically living together. 

I never told her I had a history of depression or anxiety because I was never sure how committed I was to being in a relationship with her long-term. We always worked really well together when we were together but when we were apart things got pretty difficult at times. I'm not pretending we had the greatest relationship but I thought things were going well.

When I graduated in May and moved an hour away for an internship my depression came back and I have never felt anything like it. It started like something I had gone through in the best but it got progressively worse as the summer went on. I knew it was causing my relationship to fail but I couldn't work up the nerve to tell her what I was going through. By the end of the summer, I had only managed to make myself visit her one time and she had spent nearly every weekend coming to visit me. As the summer progressed I fell so far into my routine that I never left my apartment except to go to work or to the gym. I broke up with her on Labor Day because I thought our relationship was too far gone to salvage. I managed to cry when it happened and that's something I haven't done in years. The next day when I woke up was the first time I felt anything for over 3 months and I realized I had made the biggest mistake of my life. I turned down a job to leave the state because I wanted to try to get back with her. She was the only reason I made it through this summer. We talked almost every day for 3 weeks after we broke up when I told her I wanted to get back together with her.

She recounted what I put her through over the summer. How I didn't say I loved her for over a month. How she used to save texts and reread them to make sure they were interesting enough for me to respond back to. How I didn't talk to her for days at a time. All those things she told me are going to haunt me for a long, long time. I confessed to her my depression and she told me that if I had said something a week before or if I had come back the night we broke up, she would have said yes. She told me she wasn't sure and that she kissed one of her friends the night before but she told him she wouldn't be able to date him until she was over me (according to her she didn't enjoy it either). We talked and she said we could get back together and she spent the night. The next day after she had gone home she said that it was a mistake to get back together and she wasn't sure. For the next 2 weeks, we talked every day and went out a couple of times and I thought things were improving. I took her out on a picnic as a surprise and afterward she told me she didn't think she could ever date me again. I told her I couldn't speak with her anymore. 2 days later she texted me and told me she missed me so we started talking again. Again, we talked every day for the next 2 weeks and went out on a couple dates. 

She then called me after she got back from vacation and told me she was over me for real this time. We still talked almost every day since then but a week ago she refused to see me because it ""would be too hard and hurt too much"". We stopped talking and again she texted me to say that she missed talking to me. We talked every day again and she texted me on Friday to tell me that she was sorry about what happened over the summer and that she didn't know what I was going through.

On Sunday, my childhood dog passed away and I talked to her the entire day today. I found out from a friend tonight that she seemed really close to that guy friend she had been talking to since things started getting really bad in July. I called her and asked if she wanted to tell me anything and she said no. So, we started talking about my dog and a little about feelings. She said she thought I was doing okay and I told her that I missed her. She said I'm sorry. I then asked her about her weekend and she talked about it a bit but wouldn't mention who she was with so I asked her about it. She said.. oh I was with ""him"". So I asked her if she had anything to tell me and she said is this what you wanted to know? She forced me to ask her precisely if they were dating or not and she said yes so I told her thanks, that's what I needed to hear.

And now I'm here. I just feel lost. I feel hurt that she wouldn't tell me this without forcing it out of her. I'm disappointed she wouldn't give me a chance to show her that I could be the man she always wanted. I'm not looking for pity. I'm not looking for sympathy. I just needed to say this. I don't have anybody to talk to and I'm not a very good writer. I skipped over some of the details because there was a lot of sad stuff I don't want to think about. I'm just so confused.

I should have seen this coming because it's the exact same thing that happened when we started to date. I don't even have anything bad to say about her really. I knew she had low self esteem. I knew she needed someone to put in effort. I knew she didn't handle her emotions well but I wish I could have been the guy to do that for her.

I'm scared to go to sleep because I've had nightmares of this since we broke up. I'm scared my depression is going to come back worse than before and I don't have her to be my guiding light. I was always so sure she would come home to me.

Sorry for the wall. Thanks for reading. :\"
1pff67,8,2013-10-28,How do I improve my salary?,chubigans,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1pff67/how_do_i_improve_my_salary/,"Hi there. I am a new graduate (I graduated last December 2012) and I'm flummoxed by the difference between my salary and many of the salaries I see here. I graduated with a 3.8 GPA from a semi-decent school (UCF), I had internships with NASA and Lockheed Martin as well as a year of research experience in a robotics lab. I'm very confident with multiple programming languages including C#, Java, Python, PHP, JS and I'm very adept with MySQL, memcached, mongodb and MVC . I love to program and I work 40-50 hour weeks at my job, which is for a 8 person company.

Unfortunately, I'm currently making $50k a year (in Florida). I would be happy with this amount, but I see other people in similar situations getting big salaries like $80-$90k a year. How can I get there as fast as possible? I interviewed with multiple companies in Florida before accepting my current job, but none of them offered more than $55k. 

My current plan of action is to enroll in Georgia tech's online masters of computer science, in the hopes that I can get hired on by a bigger company at a higher price point afterwards (my goal specialization would be machine learning and scale-able web architectures)"
1pfems,13,2013-10-28,Advice appreciated: weighing financial stability vs. travel/life experience,PooPatrol,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1pfems/advice_appreciated_weighing_financial_stability/,"Hi r/personalfinance!

Quick background: I am 29 years old. 2 1/2 years ago I had about 15k left in student loans and absolutely no money whatsoever. No emergency fund, no credit cards and was doing anything and everything I could to just pay my rent each month. It was tough.  This situation wasn't due to a lack of education or skills, it was due to the loss of my job in the non-profit sector as a result of the economy crashing. 

Fast forward to today. I've transitioned into the tech/startup world and have done well for myself moving from an intern to the operations lead of a great company over two years. I make decent money, have great benefits and if I wanted I could probably move to another company and do even better for myself. Financially things now look like this:

***Salary = 60k*** 

**Assets**

Emergency Fund = $12k

401k = $18k

Roth IRA = $8 k

Car paid in cash = $3k

**Debts** 

Student Loan = $7k left

CC debt (paid in full every month) = $1.2k 

***Net worth = $33k***

***Credit Score = 800+***

So here is my dilemma. I am 29, am in a very serious relationship (with someone who has over $120k in student loans) and really want to spend 6-12 months traveling utilizing a work study visa in AU and NZ before I turn 31 (the cutoff for this type of visa). I feel like now is the time (maybe the last time) ill be able to travel like this as later we will need to really buckle down, pay off her debt (hopefully in a few years with our combined income) and then start thinking about kids/home/etc. Additionally, I've got a chronic health condition that will not get better and later in life I maybe limited in my physical ability to do certain things, will need insurance and an organ transplant. Thats assuming I am able to stay relatively healthy and stress free over the next couple of decades to avoid kicking the bucket early :)

At the same time, I feel like her debt, my current success and the future are also reasons to stay and keep working and maintain as much financial stability as possible. I am afraid that if I leave the current trajectory of my career and have a big gap in my resume that I might not be able to pick up where I left off in my early 30's. I find it very difficult to balance my desire to pursue extended travel with my desire for a stable financial future.  I could pursue my career and I am quite sure be making much more than I am now or I could pursue my life and have my financial security in the future become more of an unknown. I've got a year and a half until I am no longer eligible for the visa, so I could plan accordingly....that said, not having stability freaks me out. 

I guess what im trying to ask is whether there is a way to have both? Has anyone ever had the same experience? Were you able to both live your dreams and be financially stable?
 
Thanks in advance for any input. /r/personalfinance rocks and has seriously gotten me this far. Without this subreddit id be totally lost. 

**TLDR:** I want to travel/work/live abroad for 6-12 month, but am afraid of how this will impact my career, financial stability and job prospects in the future (big gap in my resume)."
1pks3q,72,2013-10-30,"Found out the girl I've been seeing is a prostitute , don't know to do.",[deleted],AskMen,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/1pks3q/found_out_the_girl_ive_been_seeing_is_a/,"I met this girl on the beach in late August. She was all I wanted in a partner, completely beautiful, educated, and determined and just an all around great person to be around.

Certain things about her made me a little weary, she grew up in an awful neighborhood, dated guys in gangs, had a sibling who was high up in a particular gang, and got murdered rather brutally. She seemed to have gotten away from that lifestyle, being one of the few people from her community to finish his school, then she left for college to get away from it all.

To put it simply; I don't know if anyone here is familiar with the term, but she was what they call a ""hoodrat"" when she was younger. 

I mean that's fine, everyone has a past, and as long as you move on from it and better yourself, good for you. I'm not really the type of person to let that get in the way of what could be a good thing.

I noticed that for the past couple of weeks she has been aloof and distant, and has not even wanted to spend a night with me, I tried to talk to her and ask about it but all she would say is she needs space, etc, etc. Fair enough, I could understand that. We got close rather quickly and maybe she was pulling back a but because she got scared.

Yesterday we agreed to meet up for dinner after she got out of her internship. We have a couple of drinks afterward, and when it comes time to part I ask her if she'd like the night, she says yes.

We get to m place, I try to initiate some fun, she denies me and goes to sleep.

I think it's worth noting at this point, that about a month into seeing her, I noticed she had two cellphones. One of them was mostly off all the time, and she said she carried it around because she recently got a new phone and still had a bunch of contacts in the old one... Why not just boot it up and sync your old data to the new one I thought, but whatever.

Anyway I'm not proud of this, and I've never done something like it before, but I went into her purse and looked through that phone. I just had some sort of feeling that something was off.

All kinds of messages from johns, apparently she has ads up on various sites. What in the fucking fuck?

At first I was livid, I wanted to wake her up and throw her out of my apartment. This was like 5 30 am and she had to be up by 7. I managed to compose myself and kind of just sat in a stupor on my couch till she had to leave.

I did not say anything to her; I don't even know what I could say. I think I should just eliminate her from my life entirely and get tested ASAP.

In retrospect, and maybe this is wishful thinking, but maybe she was pulling away in the last few weeks because she felt guilty and wanted to come clean to me? She would always say how much she liked me and loved being around me, but maybe the guilt got the best of her.

What do you guys think is the proper course of action here? I freelance for a living and luckily did not have much to do today, ended up polishing off half a bottle of whiskey so far. Feeling sorry for myself all day. I've had plenty of trysts and flings but this was the first girl I actually felt something real for since I split with my fiancé two years ago.

tl;dr: found out girl I've been seeing, who I liked a lot and wanted to turn into a serious thing is actually a hooker.

I am going through the fall recruiting process as a junior in Portland, and I just got an offer yesterday from Deloitte to be an audit intern over the summer of 2014. Today I also interviewed with Moss Adams in Medford, and think I have a pretty good chance for that as well (I am one of the few if not the only one interviewing for summer, this office mostly does winter).

I'm really leaning toward Deloitte, but I live in Medford which is why I originally was considering Moss Adams. Does anyone have some input on this? Here are a few things I'm trying to weigh out.

-How significant is starting out in the Big 4? Would it likely pan out with a better long term career, or would I have similar prospects with Moss Adams? 

-Does anyone know what the pay would be like? Money is not my only concern, but if I take the Portland internship I would have to pay for rent/food and transportation would be pricier, whereas in my hometown I could live at home. Would Deloitte probably offer significantly more than Moss Adams?

-Related to the above question: I'm doing an office visit at Deloitte this week, would it be inappropriate to ask about $ at that time? 

If anyone has any other things to weigh in about, it would be welcome. 

Thanks!

1pkhaa,3,2013-10-30,"I need to get this off my chest. First sincere commitment to quitting, Day 2",wasteofpaint88,stopdrinking,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1pkhaa/i_need_to_get_this_off_my_chest_first_sincere/,"I’m a 23 year old female. I have a bachelor’s degree and recently finished the internship program necessary to get certified in my field, which is related to healthcare. I’ve been looking for a job for 2 months with no luck. I only work at a restaurant in the evenings, Friday through Sunday. Naturally, I have a lot of free time on my hands. Even on the days I do work, I get out early enough to partake in the typical weekend festivities anyway.  I’m ashamed of how I spend my time. I sleep 12 hours a day, and I’m basically anhedonic  except when I drink. 

For the past month I started to seriously keep track of my alcohol intake and the results were slightly shocking to me. At least 5 days out of the week I drink, I’d say on average 4 drinks each time. Sometimes I can keep this down to 2 drinks, but those are the days I specifically set out not to drink. Two drinks really don’t bring me the feeling of enjoyment I’d like, and 4 drinks seems to be my “sweet spot” so to speak. But on nights when I tell myself it is okay to get to that level (ie parties), I go way past it to 7-8 drinks. So as it is, I ALWAYS drink more than I intended to.  

I’m normally a very anxious person. Waking up from a morning of drinking, even if I’m “lucky” enough to not have any physical symptoms, I’m filled with a tremendous feeling of dread. Even when (I think) I can recall all the interactions I had, and none of them are that embarrassing, I still feel terribly ashamed. What I’ve realized through self reflection is in my sober life I have a wall up, a barrier that keeps me from expressing my feelings to people. I drink because I like the conversations that can develop in that environment, the heart-to-hearts. When I’m intoxicated I feel I can finally say all the things I’ve been dying to say. But I wake up and feel embarrassed for having said them, because sober me doesn’t feel any benefit of that self-disclosure. Either my friend forgot what we talked about, or now judges me for it. Hell, even if they do remember I still don’t feel any better.

Having moved back home after living away from college, my social circle has dwindled. It consists of two high school friends, and whoever I happen to be dating and their friends. This leads to a lot of nights spent at home, where I live with my parents. Even if the day starts with me telling myself I will have a good day at home alone, by 9 pm I’m itching to make plans to distract me from the anxious thoughts that creep in, the restlessness. I don’t always drink on these nights but at least 1/3 of the time I find myself at the grocery store at 11 pm, buying a bottle of wine and putting it in my purse so my parents don’t see it as I walk in. 

I’ve done tons of stupid stuff when drinking, but not anywhere near the worst. I don’t want it to get to that point. These past few months I’ve been wishing for a job so I can get back to helping people; if I was doing something meaningful with my time I’d save myself from drinking. However, I know if I had a full time job and lived away from my parents I’d be drinking way more than I currently am. 

So that’s it, I didn’t drink yesterday. I am not drinking today. Maybe one day I might, but if I’ve learned anything from lurking this sub intermittently for 1.5 years I’d be doing myself the biggest favor to never drink alcohol again. Made an appointment with my therapist I haven’t seen in a year, but that appointment is over a month away. Counting on you guys and my close friends to support me through this.

This is my first semester here, and I was looking for internships earlier.

I went to a job fair, and a few weeks later I got a call for a Western Digital internship.

I met with four engineers for thirty minutes each, answering programming questions and questions on my resume. There were a few problems...

1. They had an old high school resume that I accidentally uploaded. I reuploaded my new one, but they brought in my old one. My fault for not bringing extra copies.

2. I was not really expecting anyone to call me since the job fair was over a month ago. They scheduled the interview the very next day, and I did not prepare myself well enough because I had homework and studies.


3. The engineers did not know much Java, which is what I'm learning. They only knew C and C++. They are similar, so not much problem, but I thought it was worth noting.


A lot of questions were asked that I honestly did not know for some reason. They asked if I was familiar with compilers, embedded systems, or operating systems, but I was not... They are all upper division classes that I will eventually take, but not for another year.

So basically, I bombed the interview. The head engineer asked me to write out code on the whiteboard for an entire linked list class, and I just froze and my mind was blank. I was making stupid mistakes everywhere, and I cringe looking back.

They emailed me today saying I did not have the required programming skills to be an intern.

The HR specifically said:

"" You just didn’t have the required programming skills required for their particular role, but the team did enjoy meeting with you and would love to consider you in the future once you gain some of those skills.


Please continue to apply to any positions that interest you on our website.""

Feels bad...

So what now? Should I just quit looking for internships and focus on schoolwork until I'm ready?

They asked me a lot about projects - should I just focus on a project outside of school?

I would have really loved to work at WD... I feel so stupid. I constantly get the highest test scores in my programming classes, but when I'm on the spot I just freeze up. Any advice?

1pkb49,0,2013-10-30,My story,throwout1707,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1pkb49/my_story/,"Let me start this with a preface, I have summarised most areas to try and shorten it:

Up until I was 17, I was active every day. Football, climbing, running, scuba diving, swimming, scouts, hiking, anything I could do I did. I was an A grade student and had a great circle of friends and was just starting my last years of school. I had never been in trouble and was generally thought of (looking back) of a very promising human being.
I had just started going out with a girl when I turned 17, she was 1.5 years younger and really cute. She lived in the village next to me so we would walk to each others houses after school and hang out, our parents got along well and everything seemed to be great. We were getting a little more serious and emotionally attached, then after 7 months of happiness she turns around and tells me she is ending it. 

Nothing else, all finished in 5 seconds. 

Now you may think, come on, you are 17 and it was just 7 months relationship, get over it. I tried and I couldn't - I was absolutely and irreversibly destroyed. I ended up missing school, got straight E's on the last exam's I took and quit all my activities. Each time I tried climbing I was scared shitless after 5 meters. I didn't go out with my friend's anymore and grew apart from all of them, I stopped eating and at my smallest I was 42kg - pretty low for 177cm. I stayed in my room on the computer the whole time, for almost a year. In short, my confidence had been thrown into the deepest trench of my mind and was not in any hurry to move.

During the time I started at another school and dropped out again after 1 month, I took a desk job for 6 months and then stopped going. After a year I started  another course in IT (as by now I was pretty good with computers) but I had almost 0 motivation and after 2 years I scrapped through with the lowest grade and 1 friend.

I then worked for a year in a woodwork factory doing manual labour to earn some money. None of the people were within 15 years of my age and I talked to about 3 of them the whole time. After that time I saved a lot and flew to a random place on the map which happened to be Italy. I travelled solo for almost 3 months, trying new things, meeting lots of people and visiting new places. I saw the whole of Western Europe and ended up flying home when my money started to diminish. 

Through an old school friend I got an internship when I was back, I didnt like the job but I didn't have much choice. Here I met Kelly. She was so bright, beautiful, smart and kind. I almost instantly fell for her and would talk to her for ages about anything and everything, 2 weeks later we were going out and I was actually full of happiness. After 5 years I was not hating myself everyday, instead I was quick to wake up to see more of her and go outside exploring and experiencing. After 6 months her internship finished and she was going back home to Germany, I talked to my parents and 1.5 months later I too was in Germany living with her and everything was going perfectly.

Which brings me to the present time.

It has been 1.5 years since I moved to Germany. I had one job working from home but then the company went bankrupt and I had to find something new, the first thing that came up was another internship at an ancient, dying website. I am still here 9 months later.

I hate going to 'work', the tasks are dull. No one in the company has any motivation or wants to be there. My colleagues are nice, but I am the only native English speaker and it gets really tiring when they are more interested in finding the correct word, than asking how I am or anything about me. I am smart, and I am not trying to sound arrogant. I was always told at school that I am often bored by assignments and lose focus because it is all too easy.

I am actively searching for jobs, I have a decent CV in regards to experience and skill set. But because I never went to University/obtained a degree, I am certain that they never even properly get seen, people just see no degree and throw it in the trash. After so many bullshit generic emails along the lines of; ""We are sorry to tell you that another candidate has proved a better fit, but with your skills we are sure you will find something soon"" I am totally losing the will to even bother.

I am falling (if not already) back into the abyss I was already in before. I don't want to sleep so I stay up late, then I dont want to get up so I make the alarm snooze for 30mins. I am always tired no matter if 4 hours or 12 hours sleep. I have no energy and no motivation to do anything. 

I am still in the flat with Kelly and she is the only reason that I actually bother to do anything. But I know it is seriously straining our relationship and I don't know how much longer it can last. I often think she is better without me, I am holding her back because I am such a liability. She has a great, well-paid job and wants to see the world, to move to a nicer flat, to go away for weekends while I am barely earning enough to have €50 spare at the end of each month after expenses. I want to do things too, each time I tell her that I cannot, the expression in her eyes kills me, it really hurts deeply to deny something to the person you love.

I don't want to be like this, I want an aim, a purpose, a goal, a dream, something to head towards. I was asked where I see myself in 2 years time at an interview and I made up an answer. In reality, I don't see anything, nothing at all. I try and think of anything I would like to do and I really struggle.

When I walk to the train to and from 'work' I often wonder what I am doing with myself. Is the world and the few people I am connected with better off without me? Should I just disappear and let everyone else get on with their lives, after all what do I have to offer to anyone. But I know it will probably never happen because I don't have the cojones to actually do anything.

I try and change, to be more pro-active and resourceful, to workout and achieve something. I always stop after a few weeks (sometimes I don't even get to 1 week). It has been so long that I actually finished anything that I don't even remember what success feels like. I buy computer games and stop 3/4 of the way through even if I enjoy them. I buy model figures to assemble and paint which I havent touched for a year even though I was doing really nicely. I bought a playstation 1 and some old childhood games and havent played it at all. I cannot face to go back to anything I enjoy without the fear of it hurting me again - even concerning inanimate objects.

I know I am depressed, and I hate myself for failing again. For not being able to keep myself above ground.

I just want to feel driven and motivated. To feel like I am doing something good and that there is a future for me...

I just want someone to share this with. Thank you for reading.

1pk8tk,1,2013-10-30,PSA: Remember to save your W2s. All your contacts from the job etc.,[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1pk8tk/psa_remember_to_save_your_w2s_all_your_contacts/,"I recently accepted an internship offer for one of the largest companies in the world (Fortune top 30) and I failed the background check due to them not being able to verify my previous employment. 

They use a 3rd party company to do all of this and the 3rd party didn't call those numbers on the application, they just looked for W2s in my file. 

* One job was with a government department and my W2 was technically under a different department from the same county, I failed with that company.
* Another company outsources their IT so I was paid by a different company than what was on my application, I failed with that company.
* Another company never sent in a 1099 or W2 because I made $598 and the cutoff is $600, so I failed with that company as well. 

SAVE YOUR W2s! Also when it gets this far, give them the exact number of your manager (including work cell phone) so you are completely open about it. Explain the situation and turn in your W2s. 

I didn't have my W2s readily handy because I go to school outside my home state so I then had to drive 2 hours one way to an IRS office and get my tax transcripts for the past 5 years or so. Save the trouble and save them in a safe place that is readily available. 

Hopefully none of you have to deal with this and once you get to certain sized companies they actually do verify every little thing you put on that application so never ever lie on it!

I just emailed the Security Background Officer at the company with my W2s so I don't know how it will turn out but I feel way better about this now than when I received the call and was freaking out about not having an internship for this upcoming summer (I previously called my 9 other offers to tell them I accepted somewhere else)."

First off I will start by saying I have never been to Bonnaroo. I'm am obsessed with live music and the culture that surrounds it and one day hope to fuel that love for others! 

 I am a freshman in college and have never attended a festival before. I have heard nothing but amazing things about them and especially Bonnaroo! I love the outdoors. I love people. I love music. I can think of no better place! The past few years I have not attended for a few reasons, but that's for another story. 

Because of my interest for the entertainment industry and management of festivals or venues, I have been looking into internship opportunities. I read about C'Roo, but have a few questions. They say that you can learn a lot about the industry working behind the scenes

I definitely want to get the festival experience. My worries about C'Roo is that I will be working so much over the weekend that I won't be able to,
especially because they cannot stay in GA (to sleep). I have read of some potential internships but do not know of the likelihood I would receive them, although it would be an incredible opportunity. 

Do any of y'all have advice or past experiences that can help guide me? Thanks in advance! "
1pjz12,0,2013-10-30,"[QUESTION] Can I get some advice about nutrition? Specifically, how to know if you are under-eating",michellexmary,xxfitness,https://www.reddit.com/r/xxfitness/comments/1pjz12/question_can_i_get_some_advice_about_nutrition/,"First off, yes. I have read the FAQ! :)


I have been lifting weights seriously for about 1.5 months or so. I had started before the summer with the Bodybuilding.com Live Fit program, and had completed 4 weeks of that before basically tanking and hardly doing anything the 3 months of summer (working an internship plus $$ = tired and lots of eating out!). Since being back on campus, I have been good about getting to the gym 5-6 days a week. For about 4/5 weeks I've been loosely following the Live Fit program to get my strength back up and my lifts back to where they used to be. I'm now more strictly following the program (Phase 2, lifting and cardio), including the nutrition. 

My real question I guess, is how do I know if I am eating too little? I always used to assume I overate (obviously, as I have put on quite a few pounds). But now, starting this week I've changed up my eating and starting tracking calories with the Lose it! app. I calculated my BMR and TDEE with the link in the side bar, and with exercising 5-6 days a week and trying to lose weight (20% deficit) I should eat around 2450 calories.  Problem is, what I am now eating with this program is waaaaay below that calories wise. I'm talking, *maybe* 1800. 

**Any advice?** For reference, I am 5'7, female, weigh 246 lbs and am 30 years old. I can give an example of what I am eating if that helps too. This is already too long. 

Thanks for reading - this is my first time submitting but I read this sub regularly... like, every night. :)"

*Visual Analytics

*Visualization and Visual Communication 



My adviser suggests this track **'Computer Systems'**, he just said 'it's the best one'.


*Compiler Construction 

*Design and Implementation of Object-Oriented Systems 

*Operating Systems 

*Introduction to Computer Networks 

*Parallel Computing

*Microcomputer Interfacing 





And this one **'Networking and Distributed Systems'**, seems like what would be most helpful for my internship. 

*Introduction to Computer Networks 

*Computer Organization and Architecture 

*Parallel Computing 

*Grid Computing 

*Introduction to Information Security and Privacy  


Any advice? Since these classes will make up my last year, I'm very nervous deciding on them. Thank you.


edit: Added based on TheGSwat's suggestion- I would like to go into making web applications. The picture I have in my head right now is a job with a big company where I go in every once and a while, but mostly work at home supporting/creating their applications. Also I'd like to be able to put out websites and apps on the side. Idk how realistic that is as a goal...I'm a girl so being able to work from home without damaging my career path is something that's important to me, since someday I'll probably be stuck at home with a kid for a while.

1pjmpa,8,2013-10-30,"Where do I go if I have public accounting experience, but despise auditing? Third-life career crisis.",asletk,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/1pjmpa/where_do_i_go_if_i_have_public_accounting/,"Apologies for the upcoming rant/wordvomit...

Experience/credentials: 

* BS in Accounting, MAccy in Financial Accounting
* Two internships; internal audit in industry (retail &amp; consumer) and ""business consulting"" firm
* Two busy seasons in financial auditing (mainly private issuers) &gt; transferred to IT audit &gt; currently in the middle of second busy season in IT auditing (public issuer); Big 4 firm
* Licensed CPA in NJ
* CISA examination passed - waiting out two-year IS auditing experience requirement (three years waived due to financial auditing experience + advanced degree) for licensure
 
I think it's time that I get out of public accounting - the recent few years' worth of PCAOB regulations and subsequent documentation standards, toxic work culture, and lack of personal time outside of work is really starting to wear me down. I may have gone into Big 4 as a Type A, ""do or die"" go-getter, but I'm rapidly spiraling down the road to apathy and lack of motivation. As a whole, I find auditing (internal and external) unfulfilling, with little-to-no value apart from earning the partners a few extra bucks toward their third yacht.

I originally got into accounting because I was halfway decent at it in high school/college, and felt that it was a stable career that would allow me to finance my hobbies/interests. At this point, I &gt;*tolerate*&lt; accounting and could see myself doing it for the rest of my career, although it would be somewhat unsatisfying.

What I'm more interested in, and would be potentially more risky as it's not as ""concrete"" of a career path, is work related to financial systems implementation/project management - basically, a bridge between the end/business users and the IT department in an industry setting. I think it complements my interest in IT/information systems/general geekery better in the long run. However, I'm not entirely sure if my skillset is properly aligned, or where to even start to work towards achieving said skillset. This was one of the main reasons I transferred out of financial audit to IT audit - I thought that the transfer would help me build this potential skillset, but in hindsight have been pretty disappointed. ITGC testing is the pits.

Ultimately, I feel that barring unlikely-but-yet-realistic nervous/emotional breakdowns as my anchor client is easily one of the worst in this group, I'm going to stick out the rest of this busy season and then start looking outside of the firm for opportunities. Perhaps internal audit in an industry role for a year or two, and then segue into a lateral shift into a more technical/appealing role.

Any thoughts/advice?

tl;dr: I hate auditing and want to get out of public accounting quite badly, but don't know what opportunities are out there for me."

For a little background, I'm a CS junior, had one internship. The internship wasn't particularly challenging. I've had some project classes, but most of those big projects were directed, with next to no design decisions or technical challenges being had.

Always a good thing?,SpectralCoding,sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/1piopd/young_and_my_career_is_moving_up_fast_always_a/,"I graduated from the university a year and a half ago and during my senior year I got a rather prestigious IT internship in my town: Datacenter Intern. Upon graduation I was immediately hired on in an automation position building installations for ZCM (an SCCM equivalent). This in-itself is rare as most people work up from the help desk, to desktop support, then to a position such as mine. After being in this position for a year and a half one (of two) of our Linux Administrators left for personal reasons.

I applied and beat out two internal candidates and one external candidate. Today the lead sysadmin offered me the position. I respect his opinion and told me that I should think hard about accepting the position. Nothing-to-sysadmin in two years in this company is unheard of and they're expecting some back-lash from some people who have been in IT for a while. They're prepared to handle that and stand by their decision.

He basically let me know that moving to what some consider to be a more senior IT position so early in my career can inhibit my success to an extent. We talked about my long term career path (specialization in a certain field and perhaps consulting eventually). He mainly cited that being members of ""lower"" teams (such as my current one) for a few more years could definitely benefit me in the long run. I told him I would think about it and I would let him know.

Any insight into those of you who moved up the ""ladder"" faster than normal? Any suggestions? The company is amazing and I couldn't imagine working anywhere else.

I just graduated and finishing my internship that focuses on ASP.NET MVC. I've been interviewing around and I'm given two options right now. A Jr developer at a financial investing company or (being from San Francisco) work in a startup company. 

Things that I have thought of. 

**Corporate:**

**Pros:**
- Probably higher pay

- Learn finance and investing

- stability

**Cons:**
- may be too formal

- C#, ASP.NET, Microsoft software. doesn't interest me that much but I guess I'll do it. 

**Startup**

**Pros:**
- much more laid back. (Vacation/sickdays. Coming into work late)

- pay could be okay
- probably uses technology I'm more interested in (python/ruby/Django framework)
- Possibly take on many roles exposing me to learn many things

**Cons:**

- might not mean as much if startup fails

- too stressful

- possibly low pay

- job insecurity? (Read online I could get fired whenever if startup is doing bad, not sure though)

Could much wiser, more experienced developers provide me with input on your life experiences? Thank you!"

03:20 - The guy with the twisted ankle comes back, 6 hours later. He has finally had his head scanned, and has been sitting there for hours waiting for someone to check the result. He’s fine. They put a backslab on the ankle and leave him for the bone doctors. 

03:30 - Man comes in with scalp lacerations. He is extremely confused and abusive, but is it because of the alcohol or because of a brain injury? We aren’t sure, scan him. 

03:40 - Same story. Scan him. 

03:45 – Same fucking story. A woman this time. 

04:20 - I walk out into the pit; “Dooooctor” a man lying in the stretcher moans. I tell him I’m not a doctor. “Man, the pain is too much”. I pick up his notes to see if he has been given any pain relief. I get a tiny splinter of glass through my finger from the broken windshield he went through. My finger is bleeding, not good. I squeeze the glass out and pour alcohol disinfectant over the wound. I ask the senior if it’s ok, is it an HIV risk, and she reassures me its not. I double check he is HIV negative anyway.  

04:50 - The drunks have filled the pit. They all need a special mix of what they call “Rocket Fuel”, and so everyone is working together to get the drips up. My guy is shouting abuse at me as I talk to him. He pisses his pants and laughs at me. I try and get the needle in, but he thrashes around and starts hitting me. I back off, breathe, and come back in for another go. This time he grabs me tries to bite a chunk out of my cheek, only barely missing. I explode. JUST FUCK OFF I yell, and slam him to the bed angrily. The other doctors see I’ve lost it and jump in to help. With two on the legs, two on the arms and one on the chest and head, they eventually get the line in. After it’s all over one of them comes over to me, pats me on the shoulder. “Don’t worry about it man. It happens.” I’m gutted. 

05:00 – 07:00 – I only recall bits and pieces. I remember at one stage just standing there freezing cold, trying to unclog the blood from my zipper so I could zip up my hoodie. I remember a guy who had been pistol whipped, and the end of his nose was hanging off. They told me to sew it back on, but I was saved by the plastic surgeon who thought it was a bit beyond me. I remember trying to sneak a nap in the bereavement room – the place where they tell bad news to the family. They have the nicest couches in there. I got interrupted by a bereaving family. “I’m sorry” I mumble as I stumble out. 

07:00 – End of the night. I’m falling asleep on my feet, but I still need to go and help on the wards. I walk around in a daze, listening to chests, taking blood and filling out forms, checking blood results.  

08:30 – Middle of ward round, one of the interns gets called away. A heavily pregnant lady had gotten 30% burns the night before and had been admitted. Now it sounds like she might be having contractions. “Can you cover for me, just hope that it’s Braxton-Hicks!” Turns out they are, and she ends up delivering a few days later on the ward. [When I left the unit they were still treating her burns.]

11:30 - A little boy of 10 years old is on the ward. He is deaf-mute with no family, just a concerned passerby who brought him here because he had been having seizures on the street. No one has any idea what is wrong, so Trauma take his care over. Over the next few days he gets put through the medical wringer with everything investigation they can do, many of them painful and invasive. He sits there in the corner of the ward, drooling, staring at you as you walk past with nothing behind his eyes. It’s heartbreaking and unsettling. Today it’s a lumbar puncture. We give him some panadol and ketamine, then one of the interns hold him while I put the needle in.

13:00 – I finally walk out the front doors, blinking in the crisp sunlight. Somehow I make it to the shuttle bus, and 30 minutes later I am shaken awake by the driver. “You are home now, you sleep at home, not here” he smiles.

I am in my dietetic internship and the hospital I am working in is letting me wear a CGM through Tuesday morning. The CGM allows me to track my blood glucose levels throughout the day, and I plan on following some LG principles for a few of the days. I'll keep a food log with meals and times and should be able to provide graphs showing how my blood glucose changes during the fast, feed, and during exercise. The study is blind so I won't be able to upload results until after the trial ends on Tuesday. Here's a picture of the sensor. http://i.imgur.com/fvfJGd3.jpg

**Update**

**10/26**
So after 1 day finger sticks have showed a range of 20 points(70-90 mg/dL) so not too exiting, but all testing occurred at least 2 hrs after meals/during the fast. I'm using these tests to calibrate the CGM, so I probably won't do finger sticks when blood glucose might be changing rapidly. Diet was a little weird today due to a family party. Ill go into the details and meal timing once I have the graphs from cgm.

&gt; **Workout B from 31minutes guide**
&gt; 
&gt; Had some nasty shoulder pain after the bench press, but overall it was a good workout.

&gt; **Bench Press** 

&gt; * 135lbs 1x12
&gt; *  225lbs 1x8 
&gt; * 205lbs 1x9

&gt; **Incline DB** 
&gt; 
&gt; * 65's 1x8
&gt; * 60's 1x10
&gt; 
&gt; **BB bicep curl**
&gt;  
&gt; * 80lbs 1x10
&gt; 
&gt; * 70lbs 1x12
&gt; 
&gt; **Tricep pulldown** 
&gt; 
&gt; * 130lbs 1x6

&gt; I felt the burn in all the wrong places so I ended the workout and did light theraband shoulder work.

**10/27** Day 2 overall went well packed 200g of carbs into a 15 minute window so I'm interested to see if I have any kind of spike on Tuesday. Had to rely on whey quite a bit today but my body seemed to tolerate it well.

&gt;**Workout A** 
&gt; Shoulder pain continues

**Well the data has been compiled and drum roll... My pancreas doesn't wait to make insulin/my liver thinks it is cool if I run a little lean. I have many images with diets overlaid and some with average data. I was slightly hypoglycemic (&lt;70mg/dL) almost nightly which probably has something to do with hormone levels changing during sleep and my large evening meals. Monday was a rest day/low carb day and my blood glucose dropped below 70 on 8 occasions 3-4 of which occurred after my first meal.**

1pi7qy,108,2013-10-29,A student's diary of a 30 hour shift in the ER of a major hospital in a developing country - PART 1,vaime,talesfrommedicine,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfrommedicine/comments/1pi7qy/a_students_diary_of_a_30_hour_shift_in_the_er_of/,"*This tale from medicine was sent in to our student magazine by a student fresh back from an elective in Africa - upon finding this subreddit I had to share it. It is exactly as recieved, but with any identifying details removed to ensure anonymity of the hospital, the student and the student's university. Enjoy.*

Having been originally sucker-punched into medicine during high school by reading the romantic and adrenaline-laced tales of war doctors, I wanted to get my own taste of trauma during my elective. I chose to go to [a very large hospital in a developing country].

It was mental. As an overseas student, you essentially function as a doctor because of the huge patient load. 
During one of my 30 hour shifts, I tried to chronicle events, the patients I saw and helped resuscitate, as best I could. 

07:00 - I walk through the front doors. The scent of the Pit hits me – old foot sweat, fetid pus and a special ingredient I still haven’t been able to identify. I walk through the resus bay on my way to the doctor’s room, past a young child half inside a morgue bag, still warm from dying of burn injuries. The relatives are grieving around him, while arguing with hospital staff about whether they can harvest the organs. 

07:01 - “There you are, get some gloves on and get this guy stitched up.” He has been stabbed in the face with a broken bottle, big deep cuts across his forehead and face. “You sure?” I ask – pretty sure this guy would be sent straight to Plastic Surgery at home. “Yeah it’s fine, just make sure to stay away from his eye when you do the eyelid, and line up his ear and eyebrow properly.” I grab the suture pack and get to it. The scissors don’t cut, the forceps don’t grab. It’s like knitting with a knife and fork. 

07:45 - 6 year old boy has been hit by a car on his way to school. His left thigh is swollen to the size of a party balloon – he has broken his thigh bone. He comes in gritting his teeth, not a sound. “What a brave little kid” I think as I help cut off his school uniform, to reveal a worn-out Batman costume he was wearing underneath. It’s only when we have to cut that off too that he starts to cry. 

08:20 - A taxi has gone through the wall of a house, killing the girl sleeping inside. The front passenger died on the scene. The driver is comatose. We rush him to the resuscitation room, put a tube down his throat to let him breath. We put a catheter in – he is urinating blood. The FAST scan of his chest and abdomen shows large amounts of free fluid inside. We take him to theatre, but it’s too much, his liver, spleen and kidneys are in pieces. He dies on the table. 

10:00 - I come back to the Pit, and there is a bit of calm. One of the interns tells me that when I was in theatre a lady came in who had mangled her hand in a kitchen sink waste disposal “Mate her hand was hanging onto her wrist by nothing but biltong”. I start to see some non-urgent patients.

10:05 - a chap with headaches after being beaten in the head with an iron pole 3 days before. I ask the important questions, examine him to rule out the serious things, then tell him that a few headaches probably are to be expected, and send him home with pain relief. 

10:30 - A man with a wedding ring trapped on his sausage size swollen digit after being cut on the finger 5 days before. I anaesthetize his finger and slice off the ring with the nifty tool. 

11:00 - A guy with a swollen left eye and a bleeding eyebrow. I ask what happened. “My girlfriend tried to bite off my eyebrow.” The mind boggles. I probe the story further – turns out the same girlfriend bit off his ear in 2009, he had to have a new one reconstructed. Human bites are notoriously filthy, so he needs antibiotics for a while. As I’m cannulating him I tell him that the relationship might not be too healthy and its time to move on. 

11:30 - A lady has spilled acid all over her lap, with deep dry burns across her thighs and buttock, maybe 15-20% total body surface area. Nasty, but not life-threatening. Not much we can do for her until the chemicals wear themselves out – they don’t have any neutralizing stuff here. I send her to the ward. 

12:15 - A middle aged man who has sliced his palm and fingers with a circular saw. I test all his nerves and tendons – his hand is still working fine, it’s just bleeding and a little mangled. I stitch him up carefully, and it looks nice afterwards. He is happy. “I’m glad I got white doctor” he grins. I tell him for the umpteenth time that no, I’m still a student. He is still glowing.
 
13:15 - Lunch. A treasured 15 minutes. 

13:30 – A man comes in after being dragged behind a car by an angry horde after being caught in the act of a crime – #mobjustice. He has degloving injuries to his thighs &amp; buttocks, and his scrotum has been torn away, leaving his testicles completely exposed. 

14:15 - I’m walking to the radiology room to follow up some scan results. I am stopped by a man in the waiting room. “Hey doctor” he calls. Look friend, I’m busy. And I’m not a doctor, sorry. “Quick boss, quick.” Ok fine, what is it? “I’ll trade you gun for your stethoscope.” [Gestures towards butt of gun sticking from his belt.] I hurry away.  

15:30 – The pit is busy. I’m trying to help out seeing the non-urgent cases, and notice the homeless man I noticed a little earlier is still here. He has wet gangrene of both his legs, he stinks, and he is drunk. No-one in general surgery wants anything to do with him. The waiting line is long, there are other patients to see. He eventually gets bored, drops his pants, and starts playing with himself vigorously. STILL no-one bats an eyelid, and he is left there vigorously jacking it for at least half an hour before a nurse decides to step in. 


16:30 - A young man with the first gunshot of the night. The first shot grazed his arm, the second went through his thigh, in-and-out. He is stable and not bleeding much, so we x-ray him. The bullet has smashed his thigh bone apart, he will need surgery. We put him into traction and pass him onto the orthopaedic surgeons. 

17:15 - A 16 year old kid trapped in a house fire. Many people living  here have rudimentary shacks for homes, and rely on open fires for warmth. Winter is just kicking in, which means more and more fires, and more accidents. This poor lad had 60% partial-full thickness burns. As we do the immediate resuscitation, I can hear the senior doctor talking angrily with the Burns Unit over the phone. They won’t take him – 60% is their cut-off. She slams the phone down. “Cover up the burns, keep him warm, and then move on” she sighs. He died later in the evening. 

18:00 - Old guy with a massive inguinal hernia comes in with burns all over his football-sized scrotum. Another open fire. This time the Burns Unit take him. 
 
18:50 – A man stabbed in the temple region a few hours before. He has a sore neck, severe headaches and has lost consciousness a couple of times. This is bad. I can’t feel a fracture in the skull, but he is tender over the c-spine. Neck collar him, and order the brain scan. 

19:40 - A middle aged guy who got kicked in the nuts a couple of weeks ago now comes in with pain and swelling in his scrotum. I can get above it, it’s not a hernia. He gets an ultrasound scan, which shows the testicle has died and is now festering. I call the surgeons and they book him in to cut it out. 

20:40 - I’m eating dinner, and watching the news with some other docs. Nelson Mandela is still sick in hospital, and the whole nation waits - everyone is hoping he hangs in there until his 95th birthday. 

21:15 - A guy who got knocked over by a car, twisting his ankle and hit his head. Can’t remember the incident, remembers waking up to his concerned mates standing over him. Scan the brain. I fill out the forms and go to talk to the radiologist, who sighs, signs, and says “Ok sure we can scan him, but he’s gonna be waiting for a while.”

22:00 - A car hijacking. The three assailants chucked a rock through his window, and then forced opened the door. Guy comes in with stab wounds to his palms from where he tried to defend himself from their knife. He gets yanked out of the car and yelled at while he’s on the ground. He manages to get up and start sprinting away, but they catch him and put the boot in. He has his front teeth kicked in, a sore neck, painful ribs and spine. His ankle is badly swollen. His head is fine and pupils are reactive. My clinical discernment out the window, I just order him a whole bunch of xrays for wherever he is hurting.

22:40 – A guy comes in who has been taken an axe to the face. His parotid gland is handing out, and is squirting arterial blood. “Asher, put some stitches in there quickly to stop the bleeding, I’ll be there soon.” I put one in. That bleeder stops, but it starts up two more; it’s like a Hydra. I eventually give up and get the registrar, he gives it a shot, but no luck. By now he has lost about a litre of blood, and his whole face has swollen up to the size of a grapefruit. “Ok let’s get him to theatre.” We go and quickly write the forms, do the phone calls, and come back. He has gone, just up and left to no-one knows where. He almost certainly died on the streets just outside the hospital.  

23:30: “STAB CHEST, LETS GO”. A man has been stabbed just above his heart, and he is deteriorating fast. Everyone runs in. Get the airway, get intravenous access, take an ABG, put in a catheter. He’s still crashing, his oxygen saturation is going down. His neck veins are distended, his heart sounds are distant, and his blood pressure is in his boots. Unwavering, the consultant steps up, grabs the scalpel and slices open the chest; with what looks to be a hammer and chisel he cracks open the ribs. Blood splashes out all over the doctor’s scrubs as the pressure is released, and there it is; the man’s beating heart is laid open to the air. I’m dumbstruck, it’s unreal. I can see the purple lung pumping up and down on the other side. They start giving him blood but it’s for nothing, there is a hole in the heart and it’s all leaking out. They book him for theatre but it’s academic. I hold the heart between my hands as it beats slower and weaker. He dies. 

00:05: “GUNSHOT CHEST”. It’s a young guy covered in blood, brought in by the paramedics. I drop what I’m doing and run over with the other students and doctors. Looks like it has gone straight through front to back and out through his shoulder blade. The bullet has torn through his right lung, deflating it, but aside from that he is ok. He is struggling to breath so they give him morphine to calm him down, and pump him full of oxygen. “Your first chest drain for the night.”  

00:30: “GUNSHOT CHEST”. Almost a carbon copy of the previous guy, shot front to back through the right lung. Same drill, put in the chest tube. He does well, too. There is a row of stationary bikes on the ward where the guys with chest drains all do their time in the next few days after their injuries, an they usually go home in a a day or two if their injuries are uncomplicated. 

01:20 - The drunk people start rolling in. Young lady was in the back seat during a car accident, and is in serious pain. She is making a big fuss as the paramedics pull her from the stretcher to the bed; obviously stressed out and frustrated at the endless stream of intoxicated people they have seen tonight, they are shouting at her to keep calm and cooperate. She gets put on the bed, and I look at her legs – one of them is shorter than the other and rotated inwards. “Stop pulling her hip, I think it’s dislocated!” I urge. They back off, and wait for the xrays. Sure enough, the hip joint ball has popped out and is buried somewhere in her buttock. “Good spotting” says the doc working with me, and I mentally high-five myself. 

01:45 - A guy in his mid teens has been clocked in the face with a brick. His whole side of the face is mashed, and he is struggling to breathe. They decide to intubate but they are struggling because there is something in the guy’s mouth. After some poking and prodding they realise what is happening – the brick broke the eye socket so badly that the orbit has fallen through the bottom into his oropharynx, and is blocking the doctor’s view of the throat.

1pn6eb,12,2013-10-31,"Its my birthday, I don't think I have ever been this down before.",throwawayhalloween24,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1pn6eb/its_my_birthday_i_dont_think_i_have_ever_been/,"I dont usually do things like this (posting online) but I am reaching the point of having very few options. 

Almost 6 months ago life was really good. I was about to marry the love of my life, I had a dream job lined up (DSP/Electrical Engineer, I was about to get payed to do something I loved. 

I was really proud of the person I had become. I treated my SO really well. I was there for her, I took her out as much as I could. I cooked all the time (huge hobby), I loved making her food. I was always there for my friends. Even the ones who were only needy. 

My then fiancee had a lot of problems. Her parents and her had a huge split, I was the catalyst (they are racist, hyper-controlling, etc.). She was also molested by her brother, and they didnt really do anything about it. She leaned on my a lot in those times. I was always there. She got emotional almost every day. I knew she could get better though. She just needed someone to believe in her. So I comforted her and never gave up. I loved her. I mean I really loved her. 

We ended up meeting up with her parents and a counselor to talk through things about a month before the wedding. She felt like she needed to. I thought it was a bad idea. I told her, but she was pretty set. So I supported her. I figured there were some pros, she could get better at facing her fears, could come out stronger, etc.

Afterwards, I was so shocked that she thought I did a bad job in the meeting. 

Soon after she broke up with me. I was so shocked. I fought for her with everything I had. Each minute lasted hours, I really just cant describe how long life was. It was a lifetime of horror trying to sleep. I didnt eat. I simply stopped. I am pretty skinny, I lost 20 lbs. That sucked, I could barely climb the stairs. I was athletic before that. I did everything I could to get her back. But she moved really soon after that. Wanted no contact. 

I started working out, got fit. I kept waiting for that job to start. I did my best to push through it. I succeed at almost everything I really try at. I was doing ok. Given the circumstances I was doing great. But I knew I was on thin ice. If that job fell through I would be screwed. But in my mind then, I didnt see that as a possibility. 

Then the impossible happened. They said that they didnt want me. Crushed doesnt even begin to explain. All the feelings I fought off came back. I became loneliness. I became depression. Worst of all I became hopelessness. I didnt even know I was hopeful on a daily basis when things were good. But you know when you become hopeless. It changes everything. 

Now I am stuck. I still see her everywhere. I had the worst dream last night. I dreamt we were happy together. 

I think about suicide every day. Every hour. I dont tell my friends except one. I sorta told my best friend. He lives 4 hrs away. But I knew based on how I brought it up his instinct would be to relate instead of being shocked since he was suicidal once. 

If you are worried, I wont do it. I had an acquaintance who committed suicide. It really hurt me for months. And he was only some guy I played Ultimate with ever fortnight or so. Albeit I did kinda teach him how. So I have no desire to go through with it. I just lust after it, because at least then I wouldnt be in pain. Its kinda tied into the hopelessness part. 

I dont know what to do. I think if I got a job and moved I could solve a lot of these problems. I apply to jobs online, I have probably sent out about 300 applications. No luck. In January I will have been out of work for 1 year and I hear I will ""expire"" because of it. I stress out about it every second Im awake. 

Its odd because I have a great resume (2 yrs of internships, 4.0 in grad school, some research). One weird thing I have noticed, if I was happy I would be optimistic because of this. Thinking I would have a better chance at a job. But now I just think/feel that the universe hates me and confirms that I really am hopeless.

Do you all have any advice? "

I placed an order with WeedGirlz last night for their XJ-13 strain because I hear XJ-13 is potent as hell and high in THC.  Also waiting on orders from BudCentral (In transit since 21st) of his NY Sour D and White Widow.

I'm pretty new to weed, just really starting in April, I loved my indicas during summer when I had nothing to do but watch Netflix but now I'm in school with upcoming internship and I need some sativas in my life.  

So I guess I've got a few questions:

1. What are your guys' favorite indica strains? sativa strains? hybrids?
2. What vendors have had your favorites? Which have them now?
3. What grade bud do you usually go for? and at what price is it usually for about an oz?
4. How do you take your meds?
Extra Credit: Post pictures of your meds cause I love weed pics :)

For me my top was Northern Lights for Indica and Sour D for sativa.  I tried some GSC and I didn't like it as much as the Sour D but it was of lower quality so who knows.

I use a vape for my meds in case that helps anyone.  Like I said I am super new to the science and everything of weed but it really does fascinate me.  I tried to search first and didn't really come up with exactly what I was looking for so I thought I would post it up and see what people thought.

Thanks guys and have a great day!"

1pm8qt,5,2013-10-31,"Me [22 M] with my ex [20 F], anxiety attacks when I see her on campus",oneeightydigi,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1pm8qt/me_22_m_with_my_ex_20_f_anxiety_attacks_when_i/,"Hello. This is my first time posting here. My ex and I dated for five months. She was a truly wonderful woman. Aside from being extremely academically talented(both college seniors despite her age), a gifted mathematician and a programming sorceress, we also shared the same values and interests(punk rock being a major one, both Jewish, both dedicated to hard work). She did what she said she would do, and would be where she said she would be. It was a kind of commitment I had never had before from someone. We went on an adventure to NYC to see my favorite band, and going to shows was one of our favorite things to do. She met my parents and they liked her very much. She is a unique and very special woman. I felt so grateful and honored to be her boyfriend. 



I have a history of depression, and when we first started dating I was in remission, calm, self-assured, and confident. But as time wore on and I was unable to find an internship, I began to relapse. I slept too much, was irritable, and said thoughtless things. Even though she'd overcome some adversity herself, I acted as though she were inherently better than I, and that my problems could not be solved. I was convinced that I'd never be able to afford the tattoo I always wanted and that I wouldn't be successful once I got out of school, things that were simply irrational. She felt unloved and was did not confident enough to communicate that I wasn't being good to her(I don't blame her for this, as we're both very young people). It took me a month or two to realize it, but my relapse was the likely cause of this relationship ending. She had to leave because she didn't want to go back down that terrible road again. I am doing my best to become a healthy, self-actualized person with high self esteem, and I never want to be depressed again. I am seeing therapists, reading self help books on self esteem, doing breathing exercises to stop ruminating, trying to eat and sleep well, and doing my best to graduate from school and find work afterward. I believe I am a good person, very attractive, passionate, loyal, sincere, and that I deserve to be loved and feel happy. 



I believe that I completely fell in love with this woman. Not the idea of her, not the idea of being in a relationship, but her. However, my mental illness made a healthy relationship improbable. Despite the fact that she is in another relationship right now(and she should be, and I'm happy for her), I still have feelings for her, and I have anxiety attacks when I see her walking the other way down the street. She's very triggering to me, but because we are in the same program, I will continue to see her several times a week until we graduate. Therefore, I have to talk to her and try to normalize things so that I don't panic when I see her. It's destroying my ability to cope with my problems and make progress. I want to be friendly acquaintances and nod or wave to her when I see her somewhere, although I'm very scared of not being forgiven. Maybe one day, when I'm a healthier person(and I WILL be a healthier person), I'd like to come back into her life again. I acknowledge the fact that this may or may never happen.



My questions are: 
1) Do you have any advice as to how I can explain myself, and ask for some kind of reconciliation?
2) Is there any way to stop feeling such pain and anxiety when I see her casually walking around? My breathing exercises only work to a point, and while I'm working on this at therapy, I'd like to hear your advice.
3) Have you ever lost someone you really loved or were a great match for just because of one or the other's mental health problems? How can I feel better about it? 


---

**tl;dr**: I met a wonderful woman who I was an excellent match for. My mental health got in the way, and now I'd like to reconcile so that seeing her on campus does not interfere with my progress. I also struggle with the idea that I could have prevented this, although I forgive myself for what I did and didn't do. I really need to feel better about things."
1plgzx,5,2013-10-31,Breaking up long distance with my 23[m] boyfriend; am I [21m] doing it right?,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1plgzx/breaking_up_long_distance_with_my_23m_boyfriend/,"So I broke up with him after months of churning it over in my head. A part of me can see us together in the future, whereas a part of me had a few minor, but recurring doubts about our relationship. We have nothing in common, he isn't as thoughtful as I like sometimes, and our sex life is sometimes a little one-sided. Other than that, he is kind, affectionate, handsome, and wonderful to be around. He sees me as a life partner, whereas in my internship in another city I must admit that I was finding myself looking at other men. 

The part of me that wasn't sure wasn't willing to wait another year to find out if he was right for me - without even seeing him - and so I have ended it.

Understandably, he is confused and upset, because to him this appeared completely out of the blue. I told him that the distance had made me doubt my feelings for him, and that I am very confused (because I am) and need some time to think about this. 

I've asked him to give me some space, but he is messaging me every day asking to Skype and he is looking to me for comfort in the break up. He says that he just wants to see my face, and it makes me very upset that I am hurting him in this way. How do I communicate to him that I want a clean break without hurting him?

A further complication is that we're going to see one another at Christmas. It may be possible that my feelings have simply been waning due to 6 months distance and shoddy communication - there is a chance that we'll get back together when I return...but then I have to leave again for another 6 months. 

Should I cut off all ties now, and forget about that possibility because it would put him through even more emotional anguish if it didn't work out?

Thank you for your time,
your sincerely,
a very stressed man

**tl;dr**: Long distance relationship ended because of distance/poor communication and lack of confidence in feelings on my behalf. He isn't taking it well and still wants to speak to me daily. We're seeing one another at Christmas. How do I end this in a dignified way, without hurting him too much?"

However, I got a call back from company B which I applied to on my own, and they invited me to come in for a one month paid internship.  I went to my school to ask for the permission forms, and they refused to give it to me.  Instead, they told me that I'd have to give up the position with A if I want to intern at B, because if A finds out, it will make the school look bad and it's a shitty thing to do overall.

I understand where they're coming from... but isn't that how job hunting works?!  I found a way to intern with B without missing class (which means I don't need the permission forms), but I feel like I'm committing a terrible crime or something...  

I really don't want to give up my position with A unless B guarantees me a job, but I also feel really bad now.

1pl9d0,6,2013-10-30,"Me[23M];my GF[21F]2years, she always wants to be with me, I am always guilty for everything and I don't know if I should break up with her",grammar_level_yoda,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1pl9d0/me23mmy_gf21f2years_she_always_wants_to_be_with/,"Hey there,

when I got to know my current gf about 2 years ago, she was a happy and funny girl, with a pretty good self confidence. We had a lot of fun together and the sex was really good. 

But now the situation is quite the opposite. She isn't that confident anymore, and the sex became totaly boring and we don't have as often sex as we used to have in the beginning. Not even close to that amount. 

I am a guy who needs his free time. Where I am alone and can enjoy being alone, I mostly play some video games, or read a book then. While my gf would be all the time around me if she just could do it. Happily, we are both studying at the moment, but in the little free time I have, I have to study... I am also now in an internship, where we can only see us every second Weekend. She is pretty sad about that, but I am surprisingly happy with that. We skype nearly every day and are chatting the rest of the day. It's okay for me, but not at all for her.

The worst thing about our relationship is, that she gets pissed pretty easy. Really, really easy. At first we fool around together, then I say something against her (while the fooling before was just against me)
and she is pissed. Totally. (Just an example, there are so lot more scenarios where she got pissed and I didn't even know why...)

When she is pissed, I cant argue with her. I can't talk with her. I don't even know if she is listening to me. She is totally blocking. Worst of all: In every argument it's my fault. No matter what. It doesn't matter if it was nobodys fault or even hers! No, I am always guilty that she is just feeling bad and that we have a conflict now. 

On top of that, when we go out with some friends, she thinks she can do whatever she wants. She hates when I talk to another girl for more than 5 minutes (super jealous!). But its okay for her to talk to other guys for hours, even touching their sixpacks (I don't have a sixpack, but she likes it) in front of my eyes. If I am pissed then, it is... yeah you are right: my fault. I didn't get her points at that evening, but it was totally my fault...

You know there are not always these bad moments. We still have fun together, and i like to be around her. But when we have a dispute again I just don't know what to do... At these exact moments I'm always saying myself: ""Just breakup with her, and this ends now and forever!"". 

Somehow I can't breakup with her. And I don't know why exactly. If I think about it, I always imagine her, crying, and feeling really bad. And this makes me sad. So I always ask myself: Am I still in love with her? Or do I just don't want her to be in that hell of a situation? We are also planning a trip together with some friends, I don't know if I just don't want to make it comlicated for everyone who is involved.

I'm totally aware of the fact that I won't get an answer here. But maybe some of you were in a similar situation and maybe you have some advices for me then. At least I wrote this down to maybe feel a bit better now.

At least I want to say sorry for my english. I hope you get my points, but feel free to ask if something isn't clear. Thank you for reading through my boring problem.

**tl;dr**: She wants to be always with me, while I need some free time. She gets pissed really, really easy. And I totally can't argue with her, due to her blocking any communication making me guilty for everything. There are good times though. I don't know if I still love her, or if I just don't want to breakup with her, because it would break her heart.

1pl08t,1,2013-10-30,PUM.Hijack.TaskManager removal seemed too easy,LonestarPSD,techsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/1pl08t/pumhijacktaskmanager_removal_seemed_too_easy/,"I'm currently interning under the network admins at my college and we had a ticket come in some time ago reporting that Task Manager was greyed out/unavailable in one of our computer science labs that uses it quite heavily. A tech told me that they already ran MalwareBytes and it reported ""PUM.Hijack.TaskManager"" and that the issue would come back after removing it through MBAM. I was also told that the issue isn't present in Safe Mode or with the system detached from network. They were able to load another process manager software to view the running processes and didn't see anything abnormal. 

Today I was tasked with getting the issue resolved. I disconnected a known infected machine from the network and noticed on login (local admin) that I could get into Task Manager just fine. I did an MBAM scan anyway and it reported 3 unrelated PUPs that I got rid of. I restarted the machine and redid the scan and it came back clean. After plugging it back into the network and logging in with my intern admin account, right click taskbar &gt; Task Manager was greyed as reported and manually starting taskmgr reported that it was disabled by the administrator. One of the sysadmins had previously logged in with his domain admin account and got the same error so it was definitely a problem. 

With the machine on the network, I ran MBAM again and got the PUM.Hijack.TaskManager as reported and noticed the ""HKCU\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System|DisableTaskMgr"" registry key was referenced in the log. I went to it and the value of DisableTaskMgr was set to 1. I changed it to 0 and PROFIT! Task Manager was available again and it stayed available across reboots and logging in with local admin/intern admin/student accounts. I repeated the same process on a couple other machines with the same results. I felt great until later on when I really got to thinking about it. It was too easy. Yes it was just a PUM (Potentially Unwanted Modification) but *why* was it set? Scans with Security Essentials came back clean (even before the reg edit) and after I modified that registry key MBAM no longer returned any threats so I thought all was golden. In the back of my mind though I'm thinking a simple registry edit can't be the fix. What else can I run besides MBAM and MSE to confirm there's no infection? 

Ninja Edit: I would like to add that the virus is isolated only to the computers in this lab and these computers have been connected to the network for some time with this issue so it's not spreading. "
