She's doing an intern-ship in my country, primarily so she has the means and opportunity to stay here with me longer (we met when she was on her uni exchange). I love her and think she is both beautiful, has a wonderful personality, and that we complement each other well. However, while I'm trying to be a cultural relativist most of the way some things do irk me. Specifically, her approach to work.

Most of the people in the company she works in are from her home country and so is her boss. She tells me that it is customary never to question the boss where she is from and therefore she always does  overtime in the office - often many hours more and for no extra pay - and pretends that it's not happening. She doesn't like doing it, but she doesn't want to do anything about it either.

I've tried voicing my concern that she's letting her boss control her life outside of her contract, but of course she gets angry and says that ""I don't get it"" and that I shouldn't solve her problems for her. And then, after telling me how tough it is to work these long hours for no pay, she tells me that she doesn't really mind doing it. From what she tells me, they have a big budget and can easily hire more workers, they just choose not to (and it's easy to see why, when they have an employee willing to work for free). She has also postponed and cancelled existing dates we had because her boss needed her somewhere else, so it also sometimes has a direct effect on our life together.

My latest suggestion is that she just casually brings it up (""soooo, about those extra hours I worked yesterday...?"") and see what he has to say about it. IMO there's nothing wrong with being curious and exploring your options, but even this she won't do out of fear of repercussions. Keep in mind, this is her first 9-5 job so she has no prior experience with how a workplace is supposed to be in her own country, only hearsay.

I find this resignation in her attitude incredibly unattractive, much more so than if she were to get fat or some other superficial change. And even though there's this golden rule that you're not supposed to fix your girlfriend's problems for her, it's also makes me angry when she deems the situation hopeless and doesn't do anything about it herself.

What should I do?



**tl;dr:** Asian girlfriend doesn't know how to say no to her Asian boss and blames it on culture. This frustrates me because I don't want her to be a pushover and he has no right to make her work for free."

I met a girl back in my first year of college in a big city. When I met her I had already put through all the plans and paper work to transfer out of this said big city to another more tropical location. So she knew from the start that I wasn’t going to be around for long. We hit it off big time, and next thing I knew, I had to leave. I took a while back home to prep to make the big move, and kept in touch with her every day and night. She visited and I visited. Things were amazing. Then I asked her, partially joking because of the absurdness of it, to move with me. It would be easy we were going to the same school and it was simply a transfer. Surprisingly she said yes. 

We were in separate apartments at this college, but you could say we lived in 2 rooms together. I mean it was amazing, we got along perfectly. We ended up with some seriously shitty roommates, and all the drama they brought on ended up making us want to get out. Knowing absolutely no one in this new place, we decided to get an apartment together. I guess reflecting back it was a big decision, but it was so fluid, it felt perfect. I didn’t even realize I lived with her until maybe a month or 2 into it. All the little things that people complain about when they move in together, they never happened with me and her. I was in love for the first time in my life.

The economy tanked late 07, and I was working at a Real Estate agency, just as a paid intern. So you can assume what happened next. I got laid off. Not those bills were an issue, but I had to cut back on any extra spending. Things were still going very well in the relationship, so I went on finding another job. It didn’t happen for maybe 3 months. Strangely enough I talked my old boss at the place I was laid off into bringing me back on for fewer hours. It was perfect; I had a ton of time for school and just enough to pay the bills, although I didn’t have much money for other things…

Looking back on it, this is where the change happened. She started to look at me differently about then, I feel like she thought I wasn’t worth what I used to be.  School also was getting extreme, and taking up my time. She knew because I had made it perfectly clear that school was my priority. I felt like things were different because I still seen here every day. It wasn’t like I seen her once a week should I have not been living with her.

She did get a job, and worked a ton of hours; she would spend her entire paycheck on clothes and makeup. It just continued to get worse. This was a new thing she did, and I assumed it was just a phase. I would try to help her with school but she hated school more and more. I ended up sounding like a parent sometimes, trying to get her not to skip. Honestly I know most people will say I shouldn’t of done that, but she was on the verge of failing classes she didn’t want to attend, and unlike her BFF’s who say “Lame just skip it” I actually cared about her well being.

We were on our last quarter, and we both set up our classes so we could go back to the big city to do our internships. She missed family and so did I. Plus there was better work there, or so we thought. I got an internship early on, because I knew it would be tough. She didn’t, and she didn’t really try. When we moved back, I got my own place because she didn’t save up enough money to live with me and help pay anything. I even told her she could live with me any way since I have to pay rent regardless…(wonder how that would of turned out). So she lived about a 40 min bus/train ride from me. I visited a ton it was great at first but things started to get weird. 

We both are having an awful time finding jobs, and she has yet to do an internship so she hasn’t graduated. She didn’t want to visit me anymore. She wanted me to come there, and I was getting pissed at her inability to meet half way. She told me she didn’t want to get married, which is acceptable, but didn’t match what she said previously in our relationship. I was already strained because she told me she never wanted children. It’s not like I knew if I did, and I definitely didn’t right now or in the next few years.  I mean I feel like I want to have one kid later in life, I want to do something that selfless. So it was a diverging path. 

I broke up with her on Valentine’s Day (fucked up right?). I made the cut, and I FEEL LIKE A BOWL OF SHIT! So here I am 3 weeks later still ultra depressed, more than I ever have been in my life. I will be fine, maybe even optimistic, then I will get hit with the most horrible wave of depression that I can feel ripple through  my body (never had that before). I am still friends with her on facebook, and I stalk my fair share, I CANT HELP IT. She is partying with her friends who she told me she didn’t really like, and now she is talking to hideously ugly guy (no bias here, he really is ugly). She still hasn’t finished her internship class, so she hasn’t graduated. 
The whole thing is killing me because she acts like I didn’t just spend 3 years with her, and that I didn’t take care of her, and I never hurt her. I am over here dying and she seems like she is having an ok time. I need to know reddit, (those of you who have read this far) what I can do to feel better. Keep in mind I am still broke right now, so bars are out of the question until I have something fulltime. I am not looking to just bang some random chick (I wouldn’t turn it down) . I just need to stop this horrible feeling of depression.

**TLDR: I am depressed because I think I did the right thing in breaking it off with my girlfriend of 3 years who I lived with. She on the other hand is doing a little better, and already talking to new people. HELP ME UNDERSTAND HOW TO NOT FEEL SO SHITTY!**

Fuck I don’t even type this much for homework…

This is difficult though, since there isn't a lot of guidance from my uni's department (which is medchem/synth-oriented). There are also a very limited number of internships or co-ops available in modeling, comp. chem, or even informatics.

I decided to try and dual major with CS to develop my theoretical and practical programming skills, but that hasn't really come to fruition yet.

While I'm sure I have to wait and see how things go in PChem 2 (which for us is quantum mechanics), I was wondering if anyone could give me any advice or more of a direction, since no one at school has been able to help much.

For the record, I've done passably in GenChem, OChem, and Bioanalytical, and I'm doing ok in PChem 1 right now, and I love programming though it doesn't always come naturally. My math could certainly use work but it's not bad. I'm more well-rounded than exceptional in any one area.

EDIT: Thank you all for your advice. It seems to be too late to apply to most of the REU colleges for this upcoming summer, but I'm glad I finally know something like this exists so I can get a jump start on it for next year.

A little background about mysellf:

I am a computer science student who is extremely passionate with coding, and I've been a freelance web developer for 5 years now.

As a freelance web developer, I've moved from PHP -&gt; Django(Python) for all projects now, and as an experienced web developer, I am extremely familiar with relevant technologies such as CSS, JS, HTML, etc. I could go on whole day about this, about the frameworks I use, django pluggables, etc. But lets just keep it as such first.

My recent portfolio includes tuttobelo.com , www.ocbc.cyclesingapore.com.sg , amongst others. 

As a programmer, I'd like to think I'm pretty robust, and am in fact now working on http://code.google.com/p/subsynct right now.

Having mentioned the above, I'm looking for a company (preferably a startup) in Sweden that might need an experienced developer not to be a hardcore coder to an existing solution, but as a craftsman for solutions. That is to say, I'd hope to be able to contribute to the company with my expertise, and not just be a regular code monkey.

As such, there are really 2 spectrums of companies I'm looking at:

1) Web Startups such as Spotify which are really technologically driven and am focused and powered by technology itself.

2) Marketing companies that focused or open towards the direction of producing creative solutions to the internet aspect of marketing :)

I'd really appreciate any direction you guys can throw me, and if need be, I'd be more than willing to substantiate myself with a CV, code-review, or an interview :)

Thanks for your help guys! I look forward to seeing your beautiful country in 4 months!

I recently finished up my undergrad in visual communications, and I've been spending a lot of time right now looking for jobs.  These jobs have ranged from full on graphic design positions, internships, to barely related jobs like clerical positions in media companies.  I've applied to non-profits, for-profits, government, etc.  I've even tried freelancing, but no one is taking me seriously.  I'm riding on roughly a ~$20k school loan debt right now, and this month is when repayment started.  It really isn't bad, but without gainful employment it's starting to hurt.

I'm debating on grad school right now.  It's up in the air because I'm not sure if it's beneficial for a designer (ie. I'm told things like an MFA is best for teaching, and the like), but I do want to go for personal reasons.  Part of my desire to get into grad school, also, is to also hide behind academia for a little bit to ride out this economic climate.  Most deadlines have passed, but the Academy of Art University in San Francisco has rolling deadlines, but I haven't heard the most savory things about it (ie. no portfolio requirement for admissions, no real standard for grad admissions).  Not a lot of schools have spring admissions, so it looks like I'm gonna have to wait a while.  I just don't know if I should wait and try for the programs I want, or just to go to grad school the moment I can, ok quality or not.

To fill this gap year, I'm debating portfolio schools.  I don't really know much about them, and I don't know if they're a good direction for me to take.  I'm not sure if they're a good intermediate step between now and a grad program or a job, or if it can take the place of a graduate education, but I'm anxious for things to happen.  I feel incredibly stagnant, very intimidated by my financial situation, and nothing really affirming my abilities.  If I had to assess myself, I think that my work as well as my work history should land me squarely in junior or, at least, entry-level, but now I don't know.

Short of it all, I feel very lost.  I'm still applying to jobs, I know I want to go to grad school, but I feel like neither are within reach, and I don't know if the in-between steps will help or just end up costing me more.  Thoughts?"

I think I would like to enroll into something [like this](http://www.brandeis.edu/gsas/programs/comp_ling.html).

I'm taking a course in Information Retrieval taught by [Pavel Braslavski](http://kansas.ru/pb/index_en.html), which is as close to Computational Linguistics as I could find at the undergraduate level at my University.

My GPA is not too high, I don't have any papers published nor attend any scientific conferences.

So, currently I am taking a break from college (only did my 1st year in computer engineering), and decided to go back to my country. I've been looking for internships to get some actual experience in a corporate environment. I ended up turning down several offers from small local companies because their internship durations didn't fit my personal plans of going back to resume my study. My ideal internship is 3 to 6 months max. So, one day, I'm sitting at home browsing reddit, and this guy calls me to know if I'm interested in a temp job as a Development Analyst at a pretty big internet content company (it's as big as Yahoo in my country, but more local, just as a reference). The pay is better than any internship, since it's considered an entry-level. I will even get the opportunity to travel later to their headquarters for meetings and stuff.
Today it's my 4th day at work, signed the contracts and everything. I haven't done any work really, just been sitting at my desk and experimenting with their cms. They still need to formally introduce me to the rest of their team and I need to go through some short training and video conference with people from the headquarters. From what I saw, the system here is all running very smooth and most of the stuff my team does is automation, site maintenance, making new channels for news, etc.

Yesterday, I was at my desk and another company calls me because they saw my resume in an online database and were very interested. I've always wanted to work there, but I made the mistake by saying ""I currently have a job, but I'm still interested, will you e-mail me further info?"" I didn't even get the person's name or extension number and the guy didn't e-mail me. I called the number back and the lady couldn't help me since their HR department is huge with sub departments and since I didn't have the guy's name, she couldn't do anything.
I don't know specifics about what the internship at this company will be like (pay, hrs, what type of programming), but I am sure that it's more computer science related, it has like 10x the annual profit and it's multinational, with headquarters in Silicon Valley, and people who intern there always say it was a blast.
Should I call them back again and try to find out who contacted me?

So what woud you do in my situation?"

Do you know any car rental companies near San Jose that will rent to people under 21?",errbody,needadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/bfxt6/hey_reddit_do_you_know_any_car_rental_companies/,"I was lucky enough to find an internship for the summer, but I'm going to have to relocate for it.  (Actually, I don't really mind.  San Jose sounds awesome.)

I think I found a decent apartment where I could stay for the three months I'll be there, but I'm having lots of trouble coming up with a way to acquire a car.  Most of the large chains don't rent to people under 25, and I found a few local places where the age restriction is 21-and-above.  Unfortunately, I'll only be 20...

Any ideas, Reddit?  Maybe there are some local places that I haven't been able to find, or perhaps there is an entirely different option.  In any case, any help would be greatly appreciated.

EDIT: My apartment would be about thirty minutes from the office, so biking would be infeasible.  And I'm actually not sure how good the public transportation is in San Jose, but I imagine it must be decent.  Maybe a San Jose resident can comment on the quality of public transportation there.  I do agree with what AnnArchist and coolmrbrady had to say: renting for three months would be too expensive.  However, I think purchasing a vehicle is unfortunately out of the question."
bg3gj,1,2010-03-21,How should I prepare before starting a business?,chalks777,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/bg3gj/how_should_i_prepare_before_starting_a_business/,"**tldr;** *I'm planning on starting a business developing websites for small companies this summer.  If you have general business advice or advice specifically in the area of web development, I would greatly appreciate hearing it.*
    
    
**A little background:**

I am a student (age 23) at Purdue University studying Computer Science.  I have done quite a bit of work with the standard web development suite outside of school (i.e. xhtml, css, javascript, php, mysql, etc).  I also enjoy my classes.  Algorithms, databases, heck even compilers gets my heart racing.  Let me make this clear: I **love** what I do.

I've done some planning already, and have been thinking about this a great deal.  My father owns a small print shop in Indianapolis and is willing to let me use part of the building for whatever I need.  I will do the majority of my work there, and it's perfect for meeting any clients.  It's also close to my desired market: small business owners.

The product I would like to offer is essentially a website that looks sharp with a small content management system (CMS) on the back end customized to each client's particular needs.  I've already created the backbone of the CMS and can easily extend and modify it.  My goal is to be able to create a website that the client can modify to a fairly broad extent without having to know any programming language.  The main issue that I have with this is that it eliminates recurring income... a client doesn't need to pay me (or bother me) to make changes!  I can't decide if that's a good thing or not.

As for technical ability, my strong point is code.  I can program all day long without breaking a sweat and have fun doing it.  If someone wants something I haven't done before, I have no problem learning how to do it (rapidly too).  My weakness is design.  I can recognize good design, but _creating_ a good design is much more difficult.  Additionally, I've found that the designs I enjoy are a little bit too minimalist for most people's taste.

Last but not least, I know this will be a LOT of work.  I'm ok with that.  In fact, I relish the prospect of spending all my time slaving away at this.  _I even quit playing TF2 O.o_



**Questions** (most of these are heavily subjective):

* What questions should I be able to answer before I start?

* What pricing is reasonable for this kind of work?

* I could conceivably do an internship this summer instead of starting a business.  In your opinion, is entrepreneurship more or less rewarding?

* If I have a more design oriented friend working with me, what sort of employee/partner/co-worker laws are there concerning taxes and whatnot?

* What's your favorite color?  Mine's green.


Thank you!"

I know, people mostly have family, but I'm not particularly close to mine.  I've had a few childhood friends in grade school but never found them to be anybody I could really connect with.  High school, I did to myself...actively placed myself as a loner, but really felt I couldn't develop any real friendship with anybody.  I tried to befriend some one who could have been a good friend but this person was a bit aloof.  College, I faired a bit better, found a few people who I at least had similar attitudes and interests, but never really connected on a deeper level. 

But, near the end of college, I did an internship.  Met somebody who went to the same college as I, same major as well.  I think we really connect very well.  I've joked that I'm the boy version of her.  And she thinks so as well (she's mentioned that she only says that to me too).   Problem is that she had a boyfriend at the time and we both think we knew we had a crush on each other at the time....sooo ::restraint::  We get back to school after the internship, we share classes, but I think she restrains herself from really connecting with me (out of *fear*?) because she had that boyfriend who eventually has become her husband... :\  (i still talk with her, almost daily)

Anyway...so now I'm working, increasingly becoming disinterested in my career choice, at a (engineering) firm with a large age gap between the experienced and the (few) new comers...so haven't really found many coworkers I could potentially befriend.  
...blah....   -_-;

Opinions? Experiences? Tips? you know the drill.

bho60,124,2010-03-24,How to get away from web programming?,Minishark,programming,https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/bho60/how_to_get_away_from_web_programming/,"I'm looking for some career advice. Basically, I'm sick of making boring corporate web sites and lame web apps. I need a change. Problem is, all my professional programming experience so far has been on the web in some form or another. I've done CRM work in ASP.NET, ""Web 2.0"" apps in Ruby on Rails, and front-end development in HTML/CSS/Jquery. 

My first introduction to programming was a course in C++ about 10 years ago. I went to college for Computer Science and did some pretty fun projects. I started doing web programming because it was something new, and something they didn't teach me in school. It's what I did during summer internships, and what I did for work after graduating. Now that I've been doing it for a few years, it's no longer new. It's boring; I feel like I've been solving the same exact problem over and over again. The technology just doesn't excite me any more. 

I originally got into computers because I thought they could make the world a better place, but I feel like I've lost my way towards that goal. None of my past web development work was done because it was an interesting problem to solve, or because it would make the world a better place; it was all done because it seemed like the easiest way to make somebody some money. I want to get back to those computer science-y problems that got me excited about programming in the first place, problems that have some scientific or social value. My question is: How do I do that? 

I've been looking around for jobs that might interest me, but it seems all I can find are either (a) lame web programming jobs, or (b) ""senior"" positions requiring 5-10 years in some language or technology that I have no professional experience with. Don't get me wrong, I've done plenty of C++/Java/Python programming for school projects or for my own projects, but nothing on the job. 

Do I just keep working on my own pet projects and hope an interesting company hires me based on these? Do I accept a crappy job at one of these companies with the hopes of moving up someday? Do I go to grad school and do Computer Science research? 

I'm leaning more towards the last option, but I don't know. I'm still young (in my 20s). What advice would you give for someone in my position? "
bhuw7,9,2010-03-24,"Reddit, what advice do you have for a poor college student?",marylandication,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/bhuw7/reddit_what_advice_do_you_have_for_a_poor_college/,"Welp, I'm feeling a little bit overwhelmed with my life lately, and I thought I might as well ask Reddit, since I'm kinda' running out of ideas.

Here is my situation:
I'm a full time student, aiming to graduate at the end of the Fall 2010.  The problem I've run into is that I'm soon going to be homeless and broke.  The context is that I've been living at home, paying (cheap) rent to my mom, who is also on harsh times.  She was told today that her job is being terminated in June.

I make about $120 a week working (during the semester).  I spend the rest of my time (except for one day a week that I take to myself) in class, doing homework, or sleeping (no girlfriend, gave up friend time about a month ago because I've been too busy).  Given my mom's situation (is it relevant that she's a widow?), I don't have a co-signer for any loans, as they won't accept her.  Most of my money has been going towards my mom, gas, bills, and the household that's going to disappear by the end of the summer at the latest, due to foreclosure (pretty sure this is inevitable at this point).

I've been working my dick off trying to get any kind of internship (computer science major, if that makes any difference) that might be able to offer me more than $10 over the summer (I guess it also needs to be local to be effective, unless they offer me a stipend), but if that doesn't happen, that's $400 a week over the summer, working full-time.

I will need at least $1700 for tuition in the Fall (this is after the Pell Grant and government loans I qualify for, that's also not including books).  I have (after paying bills that I currently owe) about $1000 to my name.

All those numbers put together, I came out with:
-Roughly $120 a week (probably less on some weeks, as I'll need more time for school once finals come around) for the next 8 weeks.
-Roughly $400 a week for about 13 weeks after that (that takes me to the end of summer, and the beginning of Fall semester; tuition will be due by this time)

Coming to a grand total of about $7160, with the money I have now.  Take away the $1700 for tuition, that's about $5460 total earned by September, assuming no emergencies.

Now, if everything goes 'okay', we'll be able to live the same for at least the next 8 weeks, so I can come to the beginning of June with about $1300 (the money I have now, added to the maximum money I'll earn each week, subtracting the minimum amount I contribute to the household and bills) at the start of summer.  At this point, I feel as though I need to be ready to be kicked to the street (but what about my mom and siblings (did I mention siblings?) you ask?  I have no freaking clue, but there won't be enough money from her retirement fund to support me).

Here is where I'm starting to feel screwed.  Walking into June with ~$1300 to my name, with a job paying $400 a week over the summer, I'm not sure how likely it is that I'll make enough money to last me until December.  I'll need to pay for rent, food, bills, and all of that crap by myself.  Assuming I can keep all that to ~$1000 a month (need to find somewhere to live that can make this possible) that leaves me with ~$2200+~1300= ~$3500 at the end of August.  After tuition, that leaves me walking into the Fall semester with ~$1800.

~$1800, with however much money I make each week (let's say ~$120 to be consistent?) to make it to December.  I don't know wtf I'm supposed to do.  Keep in mind, this is all best case scenario (aside from 2 things:  Being able to live in the house a little longer than June, and not getting an internship/better paying job) excluding any kind of emergency (I'll no longer have health insurance, car accidents, etc).

Other points of interest:



-Foreclosure has been creeping on since last year, I don't think we can we can keep it at bay much longer with this situation.

-I'm currently filed as a dependent on my mom for taxes (for some reason this makes my tuition less than if I were independent?  I looked into this a while ago, I'll check again with the new circumstances).

-I guess I could sell my car, that would cut down the cost of living with the gas and insurance bills gone, but its KBB value is only ~$1700, and I'm not optimistic about a buyer.  I could try anyway?

-Military isn't an option; don't meet qualifications, apparently.

-I could start pawning some of my belongings, but I don't have much.

-I can't work more hours during the semester; budget cuts or some bull crap.  Summer won't be a problem for work hours though.

-Maybe I could get a night job over the summer?

-Mom does not qualify for cobra (I think that's what it's called?  The health insurance thing?).  I'm giving up medication because of this, but I'm pretty sure I can get by without it.

-No rich uncles.



TL;DR:  I need to live from the start of September until mid December off of ~$1800  plus ~$120 a week.  How do I do it?

EDIT:  Thanks for all the advice, guys!  A lot of good tips on how to not go hungry...

On Tuesday, I left my phone behind in a diner. I searched high and low before returning to the diner, where the waitstaff informed me that no one had seen it.

I have an iPhone (which I've always kept locked) and I'd enabled GPS tracking after reading an article in our local paper (the TBT) about a woman and daughter whose phones had been stolen and later retrieved using Mobile Me network and iPhone GPS. So I opened up the page, and there was my phone, way across town by the university in a place I had NEVER been before.

Fuck.

So I call my mother and ask her to escort me to the police station (it's in a BAD area and I'm a 115 lb 5'2'' woman). I walk in, explain everything to an incredibly bored looking female cop, and she interrupts me to say, ""We don't DO lost phones.""

We don't do? This isn't a fucking hair salon, it's the police. I held my tongue and informed her that I had the LOCATION of the phone, but she said, ""I'll get a supervisor, hang on."" I hear a brief interchange between her and another male cop, and he says, ""Isn't there, like, an intern for this?"" before they go off together.

Hour and a half, two hours go by, and I turn to my mother and say, ""I don't think that the supervisor is coming."" She agrees and we leave. I promptly lose my shit.

So I came home, wrote a polite-yet-angry letter to the TBT about the incident. [Here is the link](http://imgur.com/xV7tZ.jpg). I made it into an image so my name wouldn't be attached. They printed it on Friday.

At around 3:00PM Friday, my mother received an apology from a Major Someone (I'm sorry, I cannot remember his name for the life of me) and they assigned Detective H. to retrieve my phone.

I now have my phone in my possession. It was in a city two hours south, stolen by the girl who waited on my table. My phone was renamed ""Twan Phone."" I have no idea.

I really felt helpless after I left the station that night. When I wrote that letter, I wasn't even sure it'd be read. But thanks to the TBT bad behavior was corrected, and I've definitely learned that the pen is mightier than the sword.


TL;DR : My phone got stolen, the cops treated me like shit and refused to help though I had a GPS reading of its location, I wrote to a local paper, they published it, the cops apologized, I have my phone back now."

I've been in a 4+ year relationship with my first girlfriend.  It's been a little weird from the beginning.  I liked her a lot in the first few years but she didn't want some people know about us.  We don't communicate very well because I think we are afraid of hurting each other's feelings (maybe it's just me).  It's gotten a bit better recently.  This year I went on an internship in another country.  Before going I broke up with her, but we got back together because I though I would not be able to meet someone who likes me as much as she does.  We actually broke up an got back together again not too long ago.  Long distance is killing it for me.  I'd like to meet other people. I think the fact that she is my first girlfriend is making it hard to decide what I want.  I don't want her to be my only girlfriend but on the flip side I still have feelings for her.

I think either way feelings are going to be hurt.  I think that is one of the reasons I got back together with her because I saw how sad she was when I broke up with her.

I don't feel like I've learned any practical knowledge because of the liberal education method they employ here with the saying ""well you're smart enough to learn anything you need to"" but this doesn't hold any weight with employers.

I had small internship with a startup company that bombed, I volunteered to work in Africa one summer, and I ran a student-run business on campus that did pretty well but I never got a great internship because I never had great grades compared to my classmates (I don't think I should have gotten in/gone here). I feel (and have been told by many people) that I'm more socially intelligent and I have strong interpersonal skills, than I am book smart and that doesn't translate very well into gpa, especially when your school is the only one int he country deflating grades and turning As into Bs to create the most competitive academic environment imaginable. Now I'm trying to figure out where I fit in when I graduate and I feel like I'm so behind.

I wish more than anything that had a practical degree like marketing, business management, etc but I don't and I don't have the money to go to grad school to pursue one. I really want to find a job that I like but my ideas seem to change every day and I always seem to be overlooked because anyone who recruits from the ivys only wants the best and if they don't recruit from the ivys then they want a practical degree.

I am 22, do design work and have ridden a wave of congratulatory compliments for my work throughout school. My work was always held high by both my teachers and other students. I lived with my girlfriend throughout college, we got along amazing, and she was my best friend. My parents constantly talked about how independent I was, and how hard I worked. 

I really have poured my heart into my work, and put myself out there. I obtained an internship very early on in college, my sophomore year. I was the last person working for the company the day it closed late last year. I have also freelanced throughout college, and have kept clients for years, I assume because they liked working with me. The freelance was never steady, just “every other week” kind of work.

I moved to a bigger city (I lived there shortly once before) with very big plans. I knew the bad economy would make things tough, but I was actually excited to fight the good fight. I had made it through college very frugally saving up a nice lump of money to allow myself time to settle in. I picked the best priced studio apartment, with all access to public transportation, and a great set of neighbors. I sold my car, and moved in. Like I said, I planned big, and I like to think I planned it out well.

I moved there in November. Since then, my world has literally come crashing down.

My girlfriend moved in with her family here in the city, so we were separated but visited as much as we could. Things went south quickly. She ended up not being able to stick it through with me, she upset me one too many times, and we began to fight. I broke up with her a month ago, she only seemed happy when some kind of money was being spent and that doesn’t fit my description right now.

I have yet to find a job even worthy of paying any bills. My savings is dwindling down. I read job posting websites all day long, look for new posts in my related field, and even non-related. I apply to them all. I have been told I am over-qualified, and under-qualified. I have had very few interviews, the ones I did get, I did very well at. They still never lead to anything besides freelance work. Worst of all is, most the time I apply for a position; I never hear a word back. I may have a job here later this week, but the excitement wore off when I did a quick calculation and found out it will not be enough to pay rent and student loans let alone buy me food. I will take it, but I can’t see any long term anymore. If I can’t find something, anything, I will end up having to move back to the small town life with my parents, which is career suicide for my field.

I feel so worthless, my heart is broken. I cannot find a job and I am begging to think it is simply because I am not good enough. I have tried to start running; I have lost weight, gained muscle, I look better, and feel better physically. I just can’t get myself out of this depression. I am usually such an optimistic person.  I find myself getting waves of depression so strong that I feel like throwing up. I usually just lie down and cry until 
I am numb. I just have the overwhelming sense of failure and its inevitability. I have never felt like this before in my life.

I read reddit and all the posts of people in similar situations and try all of the given advice, but I feel as though I haven’t taken a single step forward.

Comp. Sci or Financial Math in mind

4.8/5 GPA (weighted, unweighted is like 4.4 or 4.3 iirc)

So far I have taken one real SAT:
2010 composite  (710 math, rest were sub 700 I forgot exact scores)

&gt; I am expecting to score 2100 or 2100 equivalent as I take more ACT/SATs

Extracurricular Activities:

* math team 4 years (attended state once so far, projecting one more time this year and another time senior year)
* JETS (junior engineering something something) 2nd place in regionals, going to be co-captain of comp sci next year
* water polo, one year during sophomore year
* some swimming club
* internship at UIC (local uni in chicago) - I built a timesheet application over the course of 2 months and helped at the toxicology research lab
* working on rosetta-stone clone like program with a friend, expecting to get it online and functioning
* expecting to get internship at a big Chicago company this summer
* expecting to attend an engineering camp (WYSE) at a univ this summer
* worked as a private math tutor during the summer

&gt; I'm planning on taking the SAT subject tests as well; not sure which to take atm ( thinking Math II, physics, something else )

&gt; Number wise my application is fairly weak, but I am hoping some of my real world experience will give me an edge when applying to reach and uber-reach ( MIT in mind ) schools.

* Rensallear (not sure about spelling)
* Carnegie Melon
* U of I ( Urbana )
* Rose-Hulman
* Madison

I'm about to graduate but I still think it's ridiculous how employers take advantage of students since I know the work I'm doing for them (mostly web development/design) is worth enough to make a living from, so it's like I'm stealing a job or contract from some future professional me with a degree only because I can only work 3 days a week, get labeled as a student, need more *experience*, and am apparently unqualified for my output since I lack a degree."
