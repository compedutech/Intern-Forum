1z87zr,1,2014-02-28,"Top tech company vs your typical business (as it relates to IT), couple of questions?",berlinbrown,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1z87zr/top_tech_company_vs_your_typical_business_as_it/,"I work in IT (about 15 years now).  So most of my question is geared towards the IT arena.  I have worked mostly in the South and only brief experience with SF/Silicon Valley.  And of course, we all pine for working at Google.  And I try my best to follow the industry everywhere as much as I can.

Also, my post is a followup to this post about interns:

http://www.glassdoor.com/blog/25-highest-paying-companies-interns-2014-interns-earn-7000-month/?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=hipaidinterns-14&amp;utm_content=hipaidinterns-14

As far as I can tell, most typical IT firms and big business operate like a ""big business"".  What does that mean?  You hire based on experience, typically a lot of experience.  Sometimes you hire based on word of mouth for a potential candidate.  You use technical recruiters.     Your upward mobility is based on how long you have been at a particular company, not necessarily your skill level.  You don't use interns.  You don't hire young.  Innovation is always passed over in favor a product the big company pushes on you.

I guess, my post is about, a lot of these companies you hear about in the news like Google, Microsoft, they seem to innovate and come up with new ideas and new techniques but most OTHER companies, just operate on a standard kind of business model.  Hire people, they do their work.  If they don't, fire them, start all over again.  With Google, search out top universities, hire young, use new ideas, try new things.  

And here is the question.  Why can't those big companies operate like Google?  Why don't the other companies take risks?

**Typical big company observations:**

* Doesn't hire young
* Doesn't use interns
* Pay raises, upward mobility is based time spent at company, not any type good work
* No new innovation on most anything
* Standard top down hierarchy structure.  Usually the top guy is the oldest
* Likes to spend a lot of money on software, hates open source
* Employees work there for years and years, or decades
* Universities?  Huh?  Why look there
* Uses technical recruiters
* Likes contractors
* Likes outsourcing on the cheap
* Less flat structure

**Top software company observations (Like Google, MS):**

* Hires interns  
* Hires young   
* Hires recent graduates  
* Encourages learning and education   
* Pays well   
* Incentives based on good work   
* Innovates, tries new things across all areas  

...  

I know everyone likes Google.    But some of the things they do, isn't completely new.  For example, I have worked at large companies but they don't even consider recent grads or interns.  Why not?    It seems like a great idea to bring in new talent.  In fact, I work at companies where the youngest guys are in their 40s. 

As it relates to this subreddit.  How do we find the truly innovative companies that aren't necessarily Google?  Do they exist?  Why don't they exist?

And to be honest, I read about all the stuff that companies like Google do.  They have Google Video sessions and allow employees 20% time to work on their project.  I can't imagine the typical business in doing that.  But why not?  Or a technology oriented commented.   Google contributes to open source.  Why can't big business do that?

One thing that big business does do, they are trying to use social media, like facebook and twitter.  A lot of big companies are moving in that space, in their own way."

1z8v2l,1,2014-03-01,Has weed ever made you depressed?,[deleted],trees,https://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/1z8v2l/has_weed_ever_made_you_depressed/,"Hi friends.

I have smoked marijuana everyday for the past 3+ years. Before I get started, I just would like to say that I think marijuana is wonderful, in many, many ways. 

I moved 1 1/2 years ago to CA from TN.  I know a huge amount of people in Tennessee, all of which were 420 friendly. I didn't really have anything serious going on in my life then, as far as career and school life goes. So, my life was pretty much just hanging out, partying, smoking, being in the company of great people every day.

Now, here in California, I am working one full time job (non paid intern), one part time job (to get as much cash flow as possible), and I'm also a full time student, but my smoking habits haven't changed much. I never smoke before work. I absolutely adore my job and my two jobs, I wouldn't change a thing about them.

Here's what a typical day looks like for me:
8 AM - up - Go to work.
Get off work anywhere between 3-6PM, come home.
Smoke a bowl.
Do homework.
Smoke another bowl. Hit a few people I know up.
Make tentative plans.
Due to both of us being stoney, we either get too lazy to meet up or by the time 10:00 PM rolls around, I'm too exhausted from the day and smoking to do anything.

This is every day for me, including weekends. I used to go out almost every weekend. And don't get me wrong, I meet up with friends and we hang out and smoke together and stuff, but about 40% of the time, one of us backs out.

Initially, I really loved the alone time, because I never had any of it before. I have really learned so much about myself over this past year and a half, that I would have never learned had I not had that time to myself.

But now, after many nights of the same thing, it seems to be taking a huge toll on me and I'm getting depressed by my lack of social contact.

Now, I know that weed is *not* the direct result of my issues. But, I've just noticed, it plays a huge role into what I end up doing for the night. Lately, I notice if I smoke a bowl, I feel too tired to even open a book and study, let alone go out and do things. I've been slacking around the house, with my friends, my artwork, my music and in general with things I do outside of my work day.

I'm normally a very motivated and determined person, but with this downward spiral I seem to be creating for myself, weed is not helping whatsoever.

Anyways, my question is, have any of you felt this way after prolonged usage? Am I right in thinking that quitting smoking weed for awhile might help?

I am taking a break for awhile. I hate being depressed, especially when there are so many reasons for me to be happy. I need to get out more and get my social life, and I know that that wont be possible if I keep smoking."
1z8xom,3,2014-03-01,Should I wait for an opening at my dream company or take another opportunity that may be coming up?,tealandlace,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1z8xom/should_i_wait_for_an_opening_at_my_dream_company/,"Okay, so basically, I'm a recent grad (grad date in Jan '14) and I've been searching around for a full-time position in my field. I've been sending out applications for full-time paid internships, temp work (in my industry), and full-time positions. I've had pretty decent success with calls back so far, most likely due to how extensively I interned during undergrad (about 3 years straight, at all sorts of different companies).    
  
Okay, so onto my question -- should I wait for an opening at my dream company or take another opportunity that may be coming up?    
  
I previously interned at my dream company and loved it. It is everything I want in a career. I am still in contact with my old supervisor (who has since been promoted) and keep in touch with a handful of other people there as well. I recently had my old supervisor forward my resume onto HR for an open position and the interview went really well. However, the HR person told me that this particular position may not be as good a fit for me due to a couple factors, but that he would forward me onto the department hiring and see if they would be interested in meeting with me. He also said that he knows a couple of openings in other departments should be coming up over the next few months that he believes would be better suited to me, my interests, my personality, and my experience. He is interested in making sure I have the *right* position, and that I just don't take something else that may not be as good a fit just because it's open.    
  
Okay, so the other opportunity -- I've been applying to a few other companies, but there is one in particular that I am interviewing for and believe I have a fairly good chance at. I have a resume with *exactly* the kind of background they are looking for and the HR person and I connected over a mutual company we both interned/worked at, so I definitely think she's pulling for me. I passed through the initial interview and have another set for a few days from now. Okay, the downsides -- it's a full time paid internship ... so not a permanent role. It's also not exactly in the industry I want to work in (and they are not a big name ... which matters for the future), but I would have the opportunity to work with a really great client that I am interested in. Okay, so the pros -- it's paying REALLY well for my industry, the pay is pretty much equivalent to what my dream job pays it's entry level roles. Also, they said that it is a 3 month commitment, with the option to extend to six and after six months, you are evaluated for full-time employment ... which the last 4 interns have all gotten jobs after internship completion. At this point, I am not too interested in working there full-time. Yes, I know I haven't had the second interview come up yet, but this company intends to move quickly and I could imagine them picking a candidate sometime early next week.  
  
My question is, IF the internship offers me a role, should I take it or wait for another opening at the company I actually REALLY want to work for? Of course, that's not guaranteed either, but I feel like I have a good chance with being a prior intern, a recommendation from my previous supervisor, knowing some other employees who work there, having a good rapport with HR, and all my past experience. I just don't want to end up taking the internship if it's offered and commit to 3 months, then have my dream company have an opening that I'd want to go for. What do you think?  
  
Sorry for the essay.  
**TL; DR - Should I wait for an opening at my dream company (good chance of getting it due to prior internship there, experience, and connections) or take a possible FT paid internship (great pay, but not exactly what I want to do long term, 3 month commitment)? I'm worried that an opening might come up at the company I actually want to work for, when I'm interning at the other place and will miss my opportunity if I do so.**"

* I got myself a job as a help desk analyst in my college's help desk after 1 week in college. I was previously a student aide in the tech lab for my high school for a little over 2 years. After 7 months, I got promoted to full-time. I worked well above my pay grade because I always volunteered to take on projects or learn something new. I helped in training MBA candidates on the systems available at the college and I saw a need for a new hire reference manual so I created one. I also traveled to other campuses to sub as a supervisor when needed. 

* I left the job to pursue school full-time and got a summer internship at the DMV. They put me in the front (which I later found out was against the rules because I wasn't certified) to speak to clients. I speak two languages so I usually translated for those that didn't speak English well. I have a ton of patience and in the end they urged me to take the city exam so I could work there after the summer. 
* I found a part-time seasonal retail job. I was the person to open the most credit accounts in the entire department for the three months I was there. Guests asked for me by name and in the end, the manager there too wanted to hire me full-time but I only found out after I landed another retail job.
* The second part-time retail job was as a stock associate. My manager saw potential in me and although I wanted to stay in the warehouse where I was training because I saw opportunity there, she took me along with her to a new flagship store. She would often leave me as the supervisor for the stock floor when she wasn't there and I arranged shipments and created lunch schedules. I even convinced her to let us arrange days off among ourselves so when someone needed to call out, we could just arrange for someone else to step in for us so we wouldn't be missed at all. This is something that most places have but my manager had different ways of working.
* My last and current job is the one where I've had the most responsibility in respect to my position. I am once again a help desk analyst and my manager has me working on two projects. I've been here almost two years and I feel great that he trusts me enough to let me manage these projects on my own. I asked him to show me how to do reports so he can take some things off his plate. He'll start teaching me next week. I am consistently one of the top three if not the top employee every month and my boss often gets compliments from callers about me.

I asked for a performance review recently and he laughed because he says no one else would request one on their own. I wanted to know what are things I could improve on and he earnestly told me that out of all his analysts, he is happy he has me on board. He told me that what sets me apart from the rest of my colleagues is that I care enough to want to do my job the whole way and more. He continued and told me that when I don't know something I will figure it out and let everyone else know too as opposed to others that will just pass a problem onto someone else if they've never seen it before.

-----------------

**TL;DR:**  
My work ethic and motivation to grow and learn more has gotten me noticed by my superiors. This is despite the fact that my colleagues have way more experience than I do. I obviously can't bring in my manager into interviews to sing my praises so how can I let interviewers know that I am a great employee even if I do not have the most skills on paper?

I've always been anxious about doing well in school but I feel like my anxiety has become a problem in the past year. All of last spring I felt like my heart was jumping out of my chest, like I had too much coffee and looking back at it I realize now that I was depressed too, even though I didn't really realize it at the time.

 Things have felt like they are better this semester but there are days that I don't want to get out of bed because I feel so tense and anxious. I had to cancel on someone I research with yesterday because I was feeling so badly in general. I barely have time this semester for myself. If I'm not studying, I'm at my internship and vice versa. I want to get all these things done, and I know I could but I feel like the anxious part of me drags me down and tells me I can't do this, I should stop trying, and I should just give up on everything.

1za2yw,2,2014-03-01,Post Graduation Jobs,deathstardown,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1za2yw/post_graduation_jobs/,"Hi Reddit,

I am an economics major who will be graduating this December with a degree in Economics from the University of Wisconsin-Madison. I am looking to find a job in the financial services industry. I wanted to know what advice you would provide me in finding an entry-level job at a financial firm wherer I would have forward mobility. For example, if five years from December of this year I wanted to go back to University and pursue an MBA, which firms would provide me with an opportunity to do that. 

Companies that I have a strong interest in working for are Fidelity, Tradeking, Vanguard, Intuit, Bain &amp; Co., Boston Conulting Group, CitiGroup, JPMorgan, Wells Fargo, Goldman Sachs, &amp; Merill Lynch. I know that this is a very random mix of companies; some are investment banking firms, while others are brokerage firms. I am primarily interested in which companies offer the best employee benefits (health benefits, vacation time, &amp; retirement matching) apart from base salary. 

Some of the classes that I have taken in University are the following, if this might help align my interests with any of your recommendations:

Risk Managements &amp; Insurance, Analytical Public Finance &amp; Policy, International Business, Operations Management, Intermediate Microeconomics &amp; Intermediate Macroeconomics, The Statistics of Economics, Principles of Financial Accounting, Principles of Microeconomics &amp; Principles of Macroeconomics. I have also taken a trove of classes in the liberal arts area, so Ihave very strong writing skills. Some of these classes include: British &amp; Anglophone Literature, Interracial Literature, Contemporary Moral Philosophy, and an Ethics and Moral Philosophy class. 

I think that my primary interest would be in client-side consulting or banking. I also have very strong skills in the technical aspects of computers (operating systems, some coding, making computers; I suppose this is not very relevant). 

I am looking to study for any investment-related exams that I would need before getting my first full-time job during the summer (my semester ends in May). With the companies &amp; areas I listed above, would you recommend that I get sponsored to take the Series 7 exam, or the Series 63 exam? I am considering pursuing a summer internship with Northwestern Mutual if doing so would be able to help me accomplish this.

Thank you for any of your thoughts, ideas, or suggestions,

""Hey, what's up, is everything okay?"" ""Uhh, Dina, have you heard from your dad lately?"" ""Yeah, uhm I spoke to him two days ago, I was supposed to come see him sometime this week but between the snow and the cold weather, it was really tough."" ""Oh 'cause his job just called my dad and said he hasn't showed up to work in two days."" ""Did you call 911?"" ""No, we were hoping you'd heard from him."" ""Call 911."" 


Cue panic. Dad, dad, dad. DAD. What could be going on, daddy? Did something piss him off? Was he mad? Him and my mom being separated for quite some time and living on different ends of the same borough really made it tough to see him. But he's done this before though, he's done *this* before, not answering calls because *something was on his mind*. But missing work? No. No, he *NEVER* misses work. He never even takes vacations. He's got this strict discipline about working hard from his father and his grandfather.


Mom and I hop in the car to head over to his apartment. There's traffic on the way and all I could think about is the ""what ifs"". What if.. What if he did something to himself? He mentioned something about thinking he was depressed when he heard one of my cousins on my mom's side committed suicide. What if.. What if he broke something? Hurt himself? What if he died? What if what if what if what if. I'm nervously chewing away at my lip, while searching for the perfect song that'll calm my nerves. Still traffic.. Fuck. HURRY UP FOR FUCKS SAKE PLEASE. Please move. Please.


We get to the 4-way intersection before dad's block. Traffic. Then, four fire trucks, an ambulance and cop cars turn towards his block. I get out of the car and I run. I run until I can feel my asthma acting up-- I didn't take my inhalers. The cold wind is just burning me from the inside out. Fuck. I run and I run all the way down the block until I see my cousin and his girlfriend's sister outside in shock.


""What happened!?"" I try to squeeze out between a loss of breathe and that paralyzing feeling when you know something bad just happened and you just want to collapse. 


""They think he had a heart attack."" NO. NO. PLEASE NO.
""But he's still alive! HE'S STILL BREATHING!""


I run up to the door leading into the building. Paramedics outside tell me that there's an emergency.. ""No, no I'm his daughter, that's my dad up there in 1D!"" He lets me in. Time to run up 4 flights. You know what asthma, I don't have the time for your shit, fuck off.


I run up the 4 flights, seeing paramedic after paramedic thinking ""Fuck fuck fuck fuck, dad must be so scared."" Finally make it to his apartment door, where my aunt and his neighbors are waiting. We can't go in. Dad had a hoarding problem that had just gone up a notch. But instead of clocks among other antiques scattered around, it was just boxes and boxes as if he'd made plans to clear up. ""It's a tight squeeze"" they say, but they get him out after a couple painful minutes. Then there's this wave, this, this smell that just came from that apartment. The smell of refuse, since he’d soiled himself.


Oh dad :/. 


He's on a cot, shivering with an oxygen mask over his mouth. ""DADDY! I'm here daddy!"" I call out, but he doesn't respond. He's catatonic. He's emaciated. Poor dad. Then I nervously pull out my phone to call my brother, to ask if he can leave his job because something's happened. Hands shaking-- I can't even type his name. 


I don't know what to say. I give the police officers my license, my phone number and any information they need. 


Dad was driven to a local hospital a couple blocks away. The drive over there was painful. My mind is racing. We have to call *everyone*. And so we do. 


We get to the emergency room, and poor dad is struggling for air. If I can remember correctly, the human body has to take about 15-20 breathes per minute to be considered normal. He was nearing 40 breathes per minute. ""Daddy.. DADDY, I'm right here daddy! D is coming too! Relax big man, relax, you're in good hands. I'm not leaving you. I'm not going anywhere."" I see he's moving his right hand so I reach in to grab it. ""Daddy, it's little bear!"" He's holding my hand but he's moving his hand up my wrist to my forearm, and then he's moving away to try to grab something else. ""What is it daddy.. What do you need?"" He's trying to grab his left hand. His left hand isn't moving. 


Doctor comes around. Fucking emergency room doctors, I feel so bad for them. Patient after patient after patient. ""He's got an infection in his lungs, which explains the fever. We need to do a CT scan”


I notice the computers scattered about. I see dad's name. His diagnosis isn't a heart attack. It's ""altered mental state"". Oh daddy, you can do this. You can do this, *you can get through this*. 


He's in the room for a CT scan when my brother shows up. It's around this time where I realized I haven't even eaten. I have a croissant in my bag and I'm clutching this cup of cold coffee. I can't eat. 


Doctors come out with him. ""Is the CT scan done yet?"" ""No, we never got a chance to do it, we have a high-priority stroke patient on her way right now.""


Okay okay okay, so this.. Is potentially.. Promising? Right? He's not a high-priority patient.. Meaning.. The doctors think there's time. Meaning.. He'll be okay? Maybe? No, he's an old bull, he doesn't give up, he never gives up, *he'll BE okay*, he'll be sitting up in his bed in a week holding his fist up saying, ""IM OKAY, LITTLE PUNK"" in a victorious tone.


""We found bleeding in his brain...."" What? ""Bleeding hemorrhage."" What? ""Severe bleeding."" What? “We can’t treat the bleeding until we treat the infection.” I’m taking in these words but they're not hitting. I'm wondering, what's the next step. What can be done? When can he be back up on his feet?


The day is a fucking blur. Took two to three hours to transport him to a hospital in the city to get him to a neurological unit fit for his condition. I still haven't eaten, but I've gone through half a pack of cigarettes. The same brand and style that he smokes. The apple really doesn't fall too far from the tree when it comes to him and I. We’re one in the same. I’ve even got his eyebrows, which he got from his grandfather.


On the first night, interns came out to tell us that he suffered from an aneurism. Looking back on the data, and seeing that it was severe meant that it wasn’t just recently. He hadn’t shown up to work for 2 days, but the last contact anyone had with him was on the evening of Monday that week. He’d suffered on his sofa covered in his own vomit and urine for two days before we even knew. Poor dad. Poor, poor dad. We stayed there until two in the morning, talking and planning the next step— recovery. “The damage was done”, they said, and there was a very huge chance that it was irreparable. Now, I’m not religious, but hey miracles can happen, right? At least I hope so. I *hoped* he’d come out of this. We’d catch these doctors every once in a while and they’d tell us something new everyday. One day, they stopped the bleeding, the next day, they’d have his vitals under control. The next day, his mother in another country would pass away, and his brother is turned away for a visa to come visit him. The week after that, he’s got a 20% chance of a meaningful recovery. They isolate the bleeding to the right frontal lobe— we would notice changes in his personality, but his motor skills would be unaffected. Next day, he could have less than a 20% chance, but it just could be more. Next day, there could be another bleed— for the next 4 days, he’s in and out of CT scans. Next week, it’s a subdural hematoma, and the state he’s in is permanent. The week after that, he’s opening his eyes and it’s “nothing but a spontaneous reaction”. The week after that, he’s got a strong immune system but he keeps catching these infections that give him terrible fevers. He’s on medication left and right, and insulin for his type 1 diabetes. Couple days after that, they insert a feeding tube and do a tracheotomy to insert a breathing aid. A couple weeks after that, he’s breathing on his own. “Good job daddy, keep it up,” I keep telling him, over and over. He needs to know he’s doing a great job.


I stayed well past visiting hours to hang up every family picture we have, with the thought that maybe he'd look around and see them. I spoke to him as much as I could. “Daddy, it’s Dina. It’s your little bear. Look, you’ve got an aisle to walk me down. I’m *not* going to let you leave me. Do you hear me, I’m *not* going to let you leave me.” He was sedated, but his vitals would get excited. His heartbeat would jump a little, and so would his blood pressure. And if it ever got too high, “hey, daddy, daddy, relax, please relax for me, your bp is too high, I need you to take it down a notch.” He would twitch his right hand ever so slightly whenever I’d hold his hand. Fast forward to him getting off the sedative and he’s more excited now. He’s finally gone from critical to stable. Doctors have done everything they could at this point. Recovery, was up to him. Not a problem. Leave this to his little girl here. 


He opens his eyes when I talk. From what I heard, he only ever opened his eyes immediately when I spoke to him. Then again, looking back on it, everyone told me they just wanted me to speak to him, because there was a certain way he responded to me compared to how he responded to everyone else. They’re trying to get him to move and do something and all he does is furrow his brow as if he’s angry. But then, there’s me, jumping into the room, “HEYYY PAPA BEAR! GOOD MORNING SLEEPING BEAUTY! HOW’D YOU SLEEP!?”, and his eyes jolt right open and he’s got the most calm expression on his face. He moves his hands. In fact, during the super bowl, he opened his eyes, looked at me and then looked at the TV to watch the superbowl. But then he didn’t let go of my hand. I spent more time laughing and cheering him on than I did crying in that room. I’d taken care of my breakdowns for the first couple of days, for now, it was just straight positive thinking— I can help him. He can get out of this. He can do it. He’ll walk me down the aisle with my brother. He’s got another 40 something years to deal with his Little Bear, and I’m gonna make sure he enjoys every single one of them.


He’d feel my cold child-sized hands slip into his hands and he’d latch on. He’d let go to let his thumb run over my knuckles. And then he’ll move his hand to grab my wrist again. I started recording these moments. In one of the videos, I kept saying “hey daddy, heeeey daddy, how are you doing there big man?”. Then he lifts his right arm up, so I help him hold it up. He’s feeling the square face of the beautiful Mondaine watch he got me— he was into thin leather-strap watches and always picked up vintage ones for me. He’s feeling the rolled up sleeve of my cardigan.. “Oh really daddy!?” I scream out with tears of joy streaming down my face, I’m giggling. And then suddenly, he opens his eyes. In the last second of the video, one of my uncles say, “EJJJJ OTVORIO OCI” (EYYY HE OPENED HIS EYES) and he looks at me. “Heyyyy daddy! Heyyy! You did great daddy!” Then there was another time he looked at me, and lifted his hand up to touch my hair and my face and I leaned in closer so he could feel my face. Then he wanted to feel his face, so I helped him lift his hand up. Then he made a facial expression as if he’s disgusted, “Okay dad, okay I know I’m ugly, you don’t have to remind me”, eyebrows unfurrow and he tries to open his mouth. He’s about to cough, and I know his coughs are very.. Strong.. “Calm down daddy”, I say, running my hand over his head. He’s there. He’s responsive. “Look daddy, these doctors are saying they did everything they could, but recovery’s up to you. I need you to do what you’ve always told me: show *them* who’s the *fucking boss*.” I would spend the rest of the time with him playing Moody Blues, he’d tap his finger along to “Nights in White Satin”.


The last time I would see him is when he’s in an air-sealed room. Doctors think he’s got tuberculosis. Two out of three tests came back negative. While he may not have it, the risk is still there. He’s on painkillers. He’s got a mitten on because he pulled out a catheter (of course he would, and I commended him for that— “Good job daddy-o! Stick it to these doctors!”) We have to wear these masks over our faces. He’s got a DNR order on him at this point. But, there was a possibility that it would be lifted *if the doctors saw progress*. Okay, there’s room and time for progress. We can do this. 


The next week he gets transferred to a hospice center in another borough. Shit. Hospice. Then on the 28th, my brother gets a phone call. The only words that he kept repeating were “Really… Reallly? Wow.. Really? Wow.. Really? Okay, I’ll call back in a few minutes.”


He didn’t even have to tell me, I just knew. Daddy’s gone. Daddy left before I could see him again. He left before I could hang up all the pictures and play more music for him. He left before I could tell him about how I’m doing in school. He left before I could just talk to him again and grab his hand and wrestle with it. I remember one night, he would grab my hand, and then I would grab a little bit harder, and then he’d unleash this death grip like he was arm wrestling with me, “Oh really now dad, you wanna arm wrestle with me? You gotta give me a head start.” 


I left the house to say I’m going to call some friends to let them know what happened. I go outside and walk about a mile before I just break down and cry. I have to catch my breathe in between cigarette pulls. NO. This cannot be real. I’m in shock. This is what shock feels like. This was the cold look on my cousin’s fiancee’s face at his funeral. She stumbled when she walked, she needed to be held arm in arm to walk. 


This would be me at the mosque where his wake was held. 


Now let’s go back to not being religious. My parents came from a town in an eastern-European country where the majority was Muslim. When they came into this country thirty years ago, they lost touch with religion. They didn’t know of any mosques to go to. And now that I think about it, it’s not like he even went to a mosque because *he wanted to*. He never even talked about religion with his closest friends. And I can guarantee, that once we search through his entire apartment, we won’t find not even one religious text, especially a Q’uran. Needless to say, my upbringing did not include any religious influences. I would come to see everything as the cosmos in action. I know things have to happen so other things can fall in place. The one thing that opened my eyes, and I hold dear to me to this day, especially after suffering a personal loss of my own, was “You Want a Physicist to Speak at Your Funeral”. I wish I could explain my views on religion and *why things happen* but I haven’t yet reached the level where I consider myself eloquent enough to explain. 


But the entire other side of the family was very religious. Someone asked some men to come from a Dzamija (I wanna say this is the Serbo-Croatian word for mosque) to say some prayers for him. And they told me something that would make me resent Islam for the next weeks to come. “The doctors are doing 35% of the work, the rest is in Allah’s hands.” How the fuck can it be so that the doctors and the machines that are working day in and day out barely break even. And if it’s in “Allah’s hands”, then *surely enough*, his current situation was also in his hands. So fuck your Allah, I guess.


So here’s how my dad’s wake went:


WELL. The mosque. I didn’t want to be covered. I wasn’t going to sit there and be judged for wanting to be with my dad. When I admitted that I was in fact atheist, a “family member” who calls herself my “aunt” responds with “ASTAHGFIRRULLLAH, SHUT UP, WHAT ARE YOU, A SERB THEN!?” I ended up just wearing my infinity scarf appropriately just out of respect.

STRIIIIIKE ONE.


It gets even worse. 


I’m walking to the deli to get some advil. I was hit with a terrible headache and I almost collapsed a couple times. I lost all the color in my face. My mom sent me off to walk with the cousin who called me that morning in January. We are then greeted by some lady she knows. Lady looks to me and says to her, “CIJAJ JE OVA”.


In Serbo-Croatian, there is a formal way to ask someone’s name/status, and an informal way. The formal way is “Kako se prezivas?” which means “What is your last name?” and you usually ask it directly. What she asked, was the informal and *most insulting* (insulting because indirect) one, “Whose is this?” I couldn’t help it. “Oh WHOSE AM I? Oh I’m THE DAUGHTER. Who the fuck are you and what are you doing at my father’s wake?” I walked away. I left. Grabbed my cigarettes and left. I broke down. My battery had died at that point so I couldn’t get in touch with the friends who were supposed to come. Funny enough, my brother and other cousin caught up with me, probably spotted me while looking for parking. Had a good moment there, someone KNEW I was hurt, and just let me be hurt about it. He’s my rock for that. 


But, that’s STRIIIIIKE TWO.


It gets EVEN worse. 


One would think, it’s a wake, right? We need to be gathering as a family to talk about his greatest moments, the memories we have with him. I love hearing how he was so into music as I am today. I love talking about my dad. And I love being able to know exactly what he would say to something. 


All that happened in that fucking place, was a fucking party. 


Tradition has it that the casket is NEVER to be left alone. Family members have to be by the casket until it is taken out and driven to the cemetery in the morning. The women upstairs were gossiping! Gossiping about stupid things. THIS IS NOT THE PLACE OR THE TIME TO GOSSIP. This is MY DAD’S FINAL DAY HERE IN THE ROOM WITH US. AND YOUR GOSSIPING IS MORE IMPORTANT? The men downstairs, they were having coffee and eating and coming in like this was a social function. Oh and the dress code? People at normal wakes DRESS FOR RESPECT. People here wore BRIGHT colors. People wore Jordans and JEANS. This is not what you see at a typical WAKE. This is a day of mourning, not celebration. I lost my dad. I lost my best friend. I lost the only person who knows how tough my depression is cause he experienced it all first hand. Show some fucking respect. 


And respect is not what anyone had.


STRIIIIIIIIKE 2.5


Now here’s where I fucking lose it.


Because of the tradition in this shit-hole with these cancerous people, WOMEN are NOT ALLOWED TO GO TO THE FUNERAL.


Yup. That’s right. I WASN’T ALLOWED TO GO TO MY FATHERS FUNERAL. His LITTLE GIRL was not able to say bye to him the way she NEEDED TO. None of my uncles would have taken me. And I do not have a car to drive out there, otherwise nothing would stop me.


STRIIIIIKE 3 YOUUUURE OUT.


How the fuck are you going to tell me, me the person that he opened his eyes to, the person whose hands he grabbed, the person he calmed down for, the person he always talked about when he was alive, the person he loved unconditionally throughout her rebellious younger years, the person that he helped CREATE, **is not allowed to go to his fucking funeral**. He would be enraged. 


This is the last memory I have of my father, and I’m forever going to remember this as the most fucked up day ever. This is unfair. This is JUST UNFAIR. 


I stood outside when I should have been inside watching from the window with the other women. I stood outside in the cold just watching dad being loaded into the car. Aunts were telling me to come inside, pulling away at my arm to get me to go with them, telling me they wouldn’t leave me alone, but the only words that came out of my mouth was “Please, leave me the fuck alone, I can’t even say goodbye to my Father”. 


I wish I could tell my dad I’m sorry. I’m sorry that I didn’t take THIS into my own hands. I’m sorry this had to happen to you. And if I could go back in time, I would in a heartbeat. I’m always gonna love you, Papa Bear. And I’m gonna arrange a proper memorial for you, with everyone that YOU would have wanted to have seen. 

edit: forgot to include, about the casket being left with family members, women and men were not allowed to sit together. So when the men came up, I had to leave my post and I wasn't allowed to go near the casket after about 3-4 in the morning. The casket was taken out at around 9-10 in the morning."
1zadzd,3,2014-03-01,Groundwork advice needed,[deleted],askseddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/askseddit/comments/1zadzd/groundwork_advice_needed/,"This is my first post, and I need some advice. This last summer I had a internship. There were ten of us interns. There was one girl in particular that I grew close with. However, she had a boyfriend. We hung out more and more as the summer went on. It really intensified near the end of the internship, we started cuddling as we watched movies, holding hands, etc. She even moved in for a kiss one time,  but I stopped her due to her having a boyfriend. So the internship ended, and we both went back to our respective colleges. We texted back and forth a few times a month until recently when we started talking almost daily. In this recent conversations, I found out that she and her boyfriend broke up. I am going to visit her and other friends I have there over spring break in two weeks. These past few weeks have been great talking with her again, but I do her about the guys she has crushed on at her school. So my over arching question is how do I reset the groundwork so when I arrive, we are back where we left off this summer? If you have any questions feel free to ask. Thanks"

I'm currently in community college at the moment, and obtained a certificate in C++ computer programming. I'm probably transferring to UCI next fall, but I want to find a job or internship since my workload is less strenuous this semester. 

I live in Irvine, and perhaps I'm not very good with job searching, but I have found extremely limited opportunities. The courses I took at college was Java and C++(including data structures). However, when I look at jobs available, they also require stuff that I have no experience with, Javascript, SQL, and other things. 

Hell, I applied to Fry's electronics part-time and didn't get a call back. I feel like I won't be getting accepted to work anytime soon, but I really want to start now rather than later. Does anyone have tips on what job targets I should specifically be looking for? The only previous work experience I have was doing volunteer service at a public library, so I have a very limited resume. Is there something more I should be learning by myself?"
1zae74,9,2014-03-01,Stuck between Crunchbang and Bodhi,limasxgoesto0,DistroHopping,https://www.reddit.com/r/DistroHopping/comments/1zae74/stuck_between_crunchbang_and_bodhi/,"I just bought my Lenovo Y410P and have been playing around with a few distros.  Oddly enough, Linux Mint didn't boot on my laptop, but I've given up trying there.

In the past, I've only run Ubuntu and Fedora, so I'm looking for a huge fundamental change.

My three choices came down to Manjaro, Crunchbang, and Bodhi.  I didn't like Manjaro's default desktop, and pacman wasn't playing nicely with me, so I couldn't test out any other window managers.  This narrows it down to the other two options.

Does anyone have any experience with Crunchbang and/or Bodhi?  Here are a few key points I'm looking for in my OS:

- Easy-to-use key binding customization.  Bodhi's was much easier, but I'll have a lot of work to do considering their Alt F4 defaults to the third workspace instead of what it's supposed to do.  Customization also extends into the desktop; I like how Openbox allows you to easily output scripts' text onto your desktop
- Skype
- Steam
- Ease of use from the keyboard.  I try to use keyboard shortcuts as much as possible to avoid carpal tunnel (I got a decently bad case from an internship's mac)
- Stability, I'd rather not have to keep fighting my OS to make it work with me
- Speed and battery.  The Y410P is going to be decently fast anyway, but the battery life on windows is 5 hours.  I'm sure it's much less on Unity Ubuntu, so I'm hoping Bodhi/Crunchbang would do a better job there."
1zagmb,8,2014-03-01,[rant] Just ranting about my Dad,Grey-fox-13,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1zagmb/rant_just_ranting_about_my_dad/,"Hey, found this subreddit and realised just how bad my situation is. I am rather long breathed so this will be a bit longer than required I suppose and I will type things as they come to my mind so it probably wont be chronologically correct.

I currently live with my dad and my sister I am 21 male. I cannot move out because I am in an unpaid internship that I need to resume going to university. 

Contact to my mother is non existent after she left the family on my birthday and found a new man. She also has ceased payments for us. My sister is 23 and her favorite past time appears to be insulting me. Every conversation includes at least one side jab at how useless I am how I get nothing right and how I overall don't contribute to anything. She also fights with my dad They are both pretty aggressive people yelling a lot. 
I withdraw into myself being more passive. My dad warns my sister about insulting me but she never takes it serious and he doesn't further pursue it. When ever they fight it's just a matter of time until they find out just why it is my fault. I guess she is the GC in some way. 

My sister has physically assaulted me on several times, throwing cups at me even. My dad made clear that if I ever dare to raise my finger at her he will beat me to death. He overall has several double standards treating my sister lighter because supposedly girls have to be treated more careful. She gives him a lot more crap, yelling at him insulting him and overall being a brat. While I primary spend my time away from them in my room. Avoiding contact as much as possible and yet for some mysterious reason I am the fault for all his misery. He literally called me a divine punishment and that he doesn't know how he deserves it. 

He tends to put himself as the victim at all times, when we disagree with him it is not because he is in the wrong but because we are against him.

One of my birthdays he spent yelling and accusing and insulting me. Coming back every few minutes to apologise speak himself into rage and blow are fuse to repeat the game. At one point he came to me asking how it's not his fault that everything is going bad that day pressuring me repeatedly asking ""right?"" until I silently mumbled that it may be partially his fault which caused him to go berserk again. I remained silent and eventually just broke down sobbing. All he remembers of that day is how I was yelling at him the entire day.

Asking about family counseling was the same result he considers himself more intelligent than any therapist and hence they wouldn't be able to help him. And he made a point of how they wouldn't be honest anyway because they would be on my side.

I suffer(ed) from depression and had drastical plummets in school because I remained in my bed for days not going to school. While depression and other mental issues are not too rare in my family he made the point quite clear ""You are not depressed you are just lazy"" Even though he himself was on sick leave for 3 years due to depression.

I am currently sick and I spent all day coughing up my lungs and blowing my nose every other minute. When I told him I am sick his answer was ""I don't believe you"". Also my birthdays have lightly traumatised me and I generally go into severe state of depression the days beforehand amounting to me not being able to eat for 3 days prior. When my dad found out about that he told me that I am just doing that to hurt him. As well as everything else. 

Even my decline in school was just to make him hurt. And when I don't do something instantly it is just to spite him. He is overall impatient, doors are no limit to him he opens the door in a fluent motion with the knocking. Saying he wouldn't want to wait in the hallway for ages like an idiot. So privacy or safety in my room is not a given. The door lock doesn't work and the middle section is a half transparent plastic. He already broke one of those. He tends to hit walls and objects when he goes into a fit of rage.

He is VERY racist having a hissy fit if a black person as much as appears on TV in a commercial complaining about why someone would want to see that face or behavior. While always making clear he is not racist and gives everyone an equal chance. He also considers women inferior by default and needless to say he does not believe in gay rights. So the full prejudice package.

A successful conversation for him consists of a long monologue. As long as he can talk about a topic of his choice or fight about something he wants to talk and talk. In a serious conversation about the issues he reacts hostile if interrupted. In a casual conversation he will pout and refuse to further contribute to the conversation if someone else dares to contribute. Anyone who doesn't agree with his opinion is short sighted not considering all sides of a matter or simply doesn't like him needless to say he always has his opinion and refuses to budge no matter how much evidence speaks against him.

For example he strongly believes that marriages are losing in worth. I showed him statistics that marriages last longer these days. He didn't even think about reconsidering his stance.
He is very insulting and sarcastic. He is quite literally not capable of answering a question in non sarcastic way (while at the same time that is obviously behavior he doesn't do anymore according to his words.). He is a hypocrite in that area as well for some time calling me ""asshole"" was an acceptable nickname. While he already exploded in rage when he once tricked me in a game and I called him ""rogue"" in a playful voice.

Family activities are always a tense experience because even if it appears casual and friendly on the surface, one wrong word and everything detonates. He always says how he has improved but that is simply not true. He tends to go mad over the slightest issues he made a cake and wanted me to tell him what I think of it. Before I had taken a bite. I told him to wait until I took a bite which triggered a cascade of insults accusations of being selfish etc etc. When I eventually wanted to leave to my room he pushed me around trying to force me to sit back down. He overall uses his force liberally and has thrown me out several times. I tend to be barefoot and short sleeved at home. Which means once in winter I was thrown out literally into the snow barefoot with short sleeves. By the time I could come back in I couldn't feel my feet or arms.

He believes himself to be the only person I can rely on he literally told me I have no friends that no one would be there for me and that my entire world revolves around him that he is the only one who would ever be there for me and the only one I can trust.

He used to beat me and my mother. Obviously beating my mother stopped after she left us. And when I started fighting back and gave him a black eye he has drastically reduced the amount of physical violence. He is a head taller than me and double my weight (not in an obese way) And yet he constantly reminds me of how I beat a defenseless old man trying to guilt me to feel bad about the man who beat kids and women. 

He constantly says how he is sorry but that is not true. He keeps repeating the the behavior apologising more to himself. I stopped accepting his apologies a good time ago and he never cared much. As soon as he forgives himself matters are fine for him.

He is an extremely negative person I don't know if he ever had anything positive to contribute. He always complains about work, his co workers, people he talks to, games he plays, movies, TV, shows, minorities and everything else he could potentially complain about.

He told me I wouldn't be able to survive on my own. When I asked him just what there is I wouldn't be able to do without him once I move out he tried a few minor topics like cooking or washing clothes but after I made clear that those are pretty minor issues he went quiet noticeably not able to actually think of anything that would make it so hard to myself to survive.

He buys me things and gives me candy when ever we fight. While I like sweets it appears as if he is trying to buy his way out. He never owes up to his faults. When he fights with my sister the moment she is out he proceeds to bitch to me about her. He is clearly trying to set me and myself up against each other. And not to sound vain  but I was the more intelligent one of us (with the option to go to university which she didn't have) I was always more mind based while she is the emotional one. And while I can tell he is trying to manipulate and drag us down I believe her unprovoked aggressions towards me are a result of him constantly telling her what a bad person I am and her buying into it.

He doesn't let me do things around the house for example cooking because ""I wouldn't do it right anyway"" which is his constant attitude towards me. He never tires of telling me everything I cannot do and will not be able to do and any task he gives me how I will not be successful and even when it was about wiping a table as a child would afterwards go into close inspection and complain about every little spec left. He cannot compliment simply it's always ""You did good BUT..."" just like is apologies ""Sorry BUT..."" proceeding with something that nullifies it. His slogan on that is ""Either you do something right or you don't do it at all"" Which again gets hypocrite because when he does a mistake or doesn't do something right it's ""Humans make mistakes"".

He has a drastic one upper tendency. When ever someone tells something he will make clear how he is better in that. Or could be better if he tried or changes the topic to something he is better in. Unless he can point out that I am good in something because I inherited it from him. So my flaws and mistakes are a result of me being shit and wanting to hurt him while everything good I do is a result of being his son. (On being shit he literally told me that and when I told him it is hurtful he literally told me ""If you don't want people to call you shit stop being shit"" and that was NOT in a fight but completely casually peacefully told like genuine life advice).

He constantly accuses me of being selfish and only caring about myself. (I once gave a third of my money to someone who couldn't afford food for a week, I give little presents and tokens(for example game bundles) to my close friends and listen to everyones problems and try to help I have actively prevented a few suicides. And yet he berates me on how  I am an emotionless monster who doesn't care about anyone but himself. I know by now that it just means I don't care about him enough or don't cater to his whims successfully but still hearing that all the time hurts and makes me question my humanity often. I do have a severe depression and strong suicidal thoughts(don't worry suicide is not an option for me and never will be it leaves too many people wounded behind. And while I am primary living for those I want to care about and don't want to hurt it's better than nothing at all I guess).


I am sure there is more that I didn't think of or that will come to me later as it always does, but this rant is probably long enough as it is. Thank you for reading this I just wanted to vent a bit. After all he is still my dad and I wished he could just accept me and love me. One time I was toying with a heart pulse app while hanging out with the family and when my dad playfully insulted me my heart rate drastically increased. So while I try not to let it get to me it affects me and my everyday life greatly.

1zagq9,519,2014-03-01,My Father's Funeral: The Story of How Religion and Being a Woman Forever RUINED The Last Memory I'll Ever Have of MY Dad.,ichcan_deutschspeak,TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1zagq9/my_fathers_funeral_the_story_of_how_religion_and/,"At about 10 or 11 in the morning on January 8th, I get a phone call from a family member who I usually don't get phone calls from. ""Hey, what's up, is everything okay?"" ""Uhh, Dina, have you heard from your dad lately?"" ""Yeah, uhm I spoke to him two days ago, I was supposed to come see him sometime this week but between the snow and the cold weather, it was really tough."" ""Oh 'cause his job just called my dad and said he hasn't showed up to work in two days."" ""Did you call 911?"" ""No, we were hoping you'd heard from him."" ""Call 911."" 


Cue panic. Dad, dad, dad. DAD. What could be going on, daddy? Did something piss him off? Was he mad? Him and my mom being separated for quite some time and living on different ends of the same borough really made it tough to see him. But he's done this before though, he's done *this* before, not answering calls because *something was on his mind*. But missing work? No. No, he *NEVER* misses work. He never even takes vacations. He's got this strict discipline about working hard from his father and his grandfather.


Mom and I hop in the car to head over to his apartment. There's traffic on the way and all I could think about is the ""what ifs"". What if.. What if he did something to himself? He mentioned something about thinking he was depressed when he heard one of my cousins on my mom's side committed suicide. What if.. What if he broke something? Hurt himself? What if he died? What if what if what if what if. I'm nervously chewing away at my lip, while searching for the perfect song that'll calm my nerves. Still traffic.. Fuck. HURRY UP FOR FUCKS SAKE PLEASE. Please move. Please.


We get to the 4-way intersection before dad's block. Traffic. Then, four fire trucks, an ambulance and cop cars turn towards his block. I get out of the car and I run. I run until I can feel my asthma acting up-- I didn't take my inhalers. The cold wind is just burning me from the inside out. Fuck. I run and I run all the way down the block until I see my cousin and his girlfriend's sister outside in shock.


""What happened!?"" I try to squeeze out between a loss of breathe and that paralyzing feeling when you know something bad just happened and you just want to collapse. 


""They think he had a heart attack."" NO. NO. PLEASE NO.
""But he's still alive! HE'S STILL BREATHING!""


I run up to the door leading into the building. Paramedics outside tell me that there's an emergency.. ""No, no I'm his daughter, that's my dad up there in 1D!"" He lets me in. Time to run up 4 flights. You know what asthma, I don't have the time for your shit, fuck off.


I run up the 4 flights, seeing paramedic after paramedic thinking ""Fuck fuck fuck fuck, dad must be so scared."" Finally make it to his apartment door, where my aunt and his neighbors are waiting. We can't go in. Dad had a hoarding problem that had just gone up a notch. But instead of clocks among other antiques scattered around, it was just boxes and boxes as if he'd made plans to clear up. ""It's a tight squeeze"" they say, but they get him out after a couple painful minutes. Then there's this wave, this, this smell that just came from that apartment. The smell of refuse, since he’d soiled himself.


Oh dad :/. 


He's on a cot, shivering with an oxygen mask over his mouth. ""DADDY! I'm here daddy!"" I call out, but he doesn't respond. He's catatonic. He's emaciated. Poor dad. Then I nervously pull out my phone to call my brother, to ask if he can leave his job because something's happened. Hands shaking-- I can't even type his name. 


I don't know what to say. I give the police officers my license, my phone number and any information they need. 


Dad was driven to a local hospital a couple blocks away. The drive over there was painful. My mind is racing. We have to call *everyone*. And so we do. 


We get to the emergency room, and poor dad is struggling for air. If I can remember correctly, the human body has to take about 15-20 breathes per minute to be considered normal. He was nearing 40 breathes per minute. ""Daddy.. DADDY, I'm right here daddy! D is coming too! Relax big man, relax, you're in good hands. I'm not leaving you. I'm not going anywhere."" I see he's moving his right hand so I reach in to grab it. ""Daddy, it's little bear!"" He's holding my hand but he's moving his hand up my wrist to my forearm, and then he's moving away to try to grab something else. ""What is it daddy.. What do you need?"" He's trying to grab his left hand. His left hand isn't moving. 


Doctor comes around. Fucking emergency room doctors, I feel so bad for them. Patient after patient after patient. ""He's got an infection in his lungs, which explains the fever. We need to do a CT scan”


I notice the computers scattered about. I see dad's name. His diagnosis isn't a heart attack. It's ""altered mental state"". Oh daddy, you can do this. You can do this, *you can get through this*. 


He's in the room for a CT scan when my brother shows up. It's around this time where I realized I haven't even eaten. I have a croissant in my bag and I'm clutching this cup of cold coffee. I can't eat. 


Doctors come out with him. ""Is the CT scan done yet?"" ""No, we never got a chance to do it, we have a high-priority stroke patient on her way right now.""


Okay okay okay, so this.. Is potentially.. Promising? Right? He's not a high-priority patient.. Meaning.. The doctors think there's time. Meaning.. He'll be okay? Maybe? No, he's an old bull, he doesn't give up, he never gives up, *he'll BE okay*, he'll be sitting up in his bed in a week holding his fist up saying, ""IM OKAY, LITTLE PUNK"" in a victorious tone.


""We found bleeding in his brain...."" What? ""Bleeding hemorrhage."" What? ""Severe bleeding."" What? “We can’t treat the bleeding until we treat the infection.” I’m taking in these words but they're not hitting. I'm wondering, what's the next step. What can be done? When can he be back up on his feet?


The day is a fucking blur. Took two to three hours to transport him to a hospital in the city to get him to a neurological unit fit for his condition. I still haven't eaten, but I've gone through half a pack of cigarettes. The same brand and style that he smokes. The apple really doesn't fall too far from the tree when it comes to him and I. We’re one in the same. I’ve even got his eyebrows, which he got from his grandfather.


On the first night, interns came out to tell us that he suffered from an aneurism. Looking back on the data, and seeing that it was severe meant that it wasn’t just recently. He hadn’t shown up to work for 2 days, but the last contact anyone had with him was on the evening of Monday that week. He’d suffered on his sofa covered in his own vomit and urine for two days before we even knew. Poor dad. Poor, poor dad. We stayed there until two in the morning, talking and planning the next step— recovery. “The damage was done”, they said, and there was a very huge chance that it was irreparable. Now, I’m not religious, but hey miracles can happen, right? At least I hope so. I *hoped* he’d come out of this. We’d catch these doctors every once in a while and they’d tell us something new everyday. One day, they stopped the bleeding, the next day, they’d have his vitals under control. The next day, his mother in another country would pass away, and his brother is turned away for a visa to come visit him. The week after that, he’s got a 20% chance of a meaningful recovery. They isolate the bleeding to the right frontal lobe— we would notice changes in his personality, but his motor skills would be unaffected. Next day, he could have less than a 20% chance, but it just could be more. Next day, there could be another bleed— for the next 4 days, he’s in and out of CT scans. Next week, it’s a subdural hematoma, and the state he’s in is permanent. The week after that, he’s opening his eyes and it’s “nothing but a spontaneous reaction”. The week after that, he’s got a strong immune system but he keeps catching these infections that give him terrible fevers. He’s on medication left and right, and insulin for his type 1 diabetes. Couple days after that, they insert a feeding tube and do a tracheotomy to insert a breathing aid. A couple weeks after that, he’s breathing on his own. “Good job daddy, keep it up,” I keep telling him, over and over. He needs to know he’s doing a great job.


I stayed well past visiting hours to hang up every family picture we have, with the thought that maybe he'd look around and see them. I spoke to him as much as I could. “Daddy, it’s Dina. It’s your little bear. Look, you’ve got an aisle to walk me down. I’m *not* going to let you leave me. Do you hear me, I’m *not* going to let you leave me.” He was sedated, but his vitals would get excited. His heartbeat would jump a little, and so would his blood pressure. And if it ever got too high, “hey, daddy, daddy, relax, please relax for me, your bp is too high, I need you to take it down a notch.” He would twitch his right hand ever so slightly whenever I’d hold his hand. Fast forward to him getting off the sedative and he’s more excited now. He’s finally gone from critical to stable. Doctors have done everything they could at this point. Recovery, was up to him. Not a problem. Leave this to his little girl here. 


He opens his eyes when I talk. From what I heard, he only ever opened his eyes immediately when I spoke to him. Then again, looking back on it, everyone told me they just wanted me to speak to him, because there was a certain way he responded to me compared to how he responded to everyone else. They’re trying to get him to move and do something and all he does is furrow his brow as if he’s angry. But then, there’s me, jumping into the room, “HEYYY PAPA BEAR! GOOD MORNING SLEEPING BEAUTY! HOW’D YOU SLEEP!?”, and his eyes jolt right open and he’s got the most calm expression on his face. He moves his hands. In fact, during the super bowl, he opened his eyes, looked at me and then looked at the TV to watch the superbowl. But then he didn’t let go of my hand. I spent more time laughing and cheering him on than I did crying in that room. I’d taken care of my breakdowns for the first couple of days, for now, it was just straight positive thinking— I can help him. He can get out of this. He can do it. He’ll walk me down the aisle with my brother. He’s got another 40 something years to deal with his Little Bear, and I’m gonna make sure he enjoys every single one of them.


He’d feel my cold child-sized hands slip into his hands and he’d latch on. He’d let go to let his thumb run over my knuckles. And then he’ll move his hand to grab my wrist again. I started recording these moments. In one of the videos, I kept saying “hey daddy, heeeey daddy, how are you doing there big man?”. Then he lifts his right arm up, so I help him hold it up. He’s feeling the square face of the beautiful Mondaine watch he got me— he was into thin leather-strap watches and always picked up vintage ones for me. He’s feeling the rolled up sleeve of my cardigan.. “Oh really daddy!?” I scream out with tears of joy streaming down my face, I’m giggling. And then suddenly, he opens his eyes. In the last second of the video, one of my uncles say, “EJJJJ OTVORIO OCI” (EYYY HE OPENED HIS EYES) and he looks at me. “Heyyyy daddy! Heyyy! You did great daddy!” Then there was another time he looked at me, and lifted his hand up to touch my hair and my face and I leaned in closer so he could feel my face. Then he wanted to feel his face, so I helped him lift his hand up. Then he made a facial expression as if he’s disgusted, “Okay dad, okay I know I’m ugly, you don’t have to remind me”, eyebrows unfurrow and he tries to open his mouth. He’s about to cough, and I know his coughs are very.. Strong.. “Calm down daddy”, I say, running my hand over his head. He’s there. He’s responsive. “Look daddy, these doctors are saying they did everything they could, but recovery’s up to you. I need you to do what you’ve always told me: show *them* who’s the *fucking boss*.” I would spend the rest of the time with him playing Moody Blues, he’d tap his finger along to “Nights in White Satin”.

1zas2p,3,2014-03-01,"Can't move on after my long term relationship ended, have becoming very depressed and have lost motivation/loss of interest in everything",jrbartlett,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1zas2p/cant_move_on_after_my_long_term_relationship/,"Not sure what to really put here but I'll give it a try. I've dated and know a wonderful girl named K for 3 years while living in Portland, OR. We met and instantly hit it off and were shared almost all the same hobbies/interests/values/outlook on life. While we dated we got along great and were best friends also. We had our ups and down but nothing major. In July 2013 she came home suddenly after work basically broke up with me and didn't really give me a excuse about why. She said she wasn't did want to date, have a relationship with anyone at this point in her life anymore, but it was a really vague answer and whenever I would ask why she would just say I don't know I just don't want to. The breakup ended very well, I took it all in stride and didn't yell or become angry or anything and we both said we will still stay best friends and stay in each others lives. I then moved to another city for about 2 months. She did visit when I was gone and we had a great time and were just having a great time together as friends. I decided I missed Portland too much, so me and K became roommates since it would be cheap rent and we both would be able to save up money quickly enough to move out into our own separate places. So from September 2013 we were living together and everything was great, until after Christmas she started to changed and act out towards me. Since she started her new job that I helped get her at the Blue Moon Pub, she started staying out all night until 7am or so the next day drinking six and sometimes seven days a week. Her personality has completely changed, as in I don't even know her anymore, she has made all new drinking friends, a lot of single guys she is meeting, she was constantly just lying to me about everything, avoiding me for days at a time, ignoring me if I would try and contact her to see how she was doing or where she was at, she also has lost all of her hobbies/interests she once had.This was all from December 2013-until Feb 24, 2014 when I moved again.
I guess what I'm trying to say is she broke up with me all of a sudden without any before hand communication and even though I've gone out of my way to be a real friend, be there for her, doing nice things for her, taking care of her when she would get sick, trying to do activities with her that she enjoys, every time she would just shit all over me and not even have the courtesy to to tell me why she was acting this way towards me. I know it can't be easy trying to stay friends with a former ex, but I was doing my part and being a actual friend for her. 
I didn't care what she was doing since we aren't dating, but I would ask a courtesy if she didn't come home to at least text so I wouldn't stay up and worry.
I've asked her time and again in a very calm and nice way to please just be kind and considerate towards me, and honest with me and if there is anything she needs to tell me then just tell me. 
Last month we were living together I found out that she was sleeping with a guy, one of these new ""friends"" of hers. It really bothered me because she couldn't just tell me she was seeing someone, and she  kept telling me for many many months that she doesn't want to have any form of relationships with a guy including sex. 
I found out about this when there were a shit load of condoms hanging out of her bag. When I asked her about it  I said I thought you had no inclinations towards sex, she said ""it's in case"" and then she said ""Yes I've been having sex, and have been getting my brains fucked out"".
I really hope this all makes sense it's all just mashed in my head.
What really bothers me is she never attempted to communicate anything entire time we dated and afterwards when we were friends,she would constantly lie about everything, she would be so loving and nice to me and then a week later treat me like shit. The whole lying to my face about not wanting to date or fuck anybody turned out to be a lie. She claims they are just friends that fuck and he totally cool with her fucking or seeing other guys, but they sleep over with each other and hangout all the time, and do everything together. So after that I moved out a few days later.
Now she ignores me completely and is now preceding to cut me completely out of her life. She talks negatively about me to her friends and I honestly haven't done one thing to her that would be considered mean. My friends and family keep saying I'll move on and get better and that I was living in a toxic relationship with her even as friends, but I just can't get over losing such a important person in my life, and just the fact how she has treated me so horribly over these few months and the lying about everything from wanting to be friends, to lying about how she actually thinks of me,lying about sleeping with people. 
I've become depressed,physically/emotionally/mentally exhausted, loss of motivation/interests, loss of appetite, self esteem issue, anxiety, grief and sense of loss, and just moving away from Portland and my friends and my life there. 
I've decided I need to see someone to talk to and help me through this but I honestly don't see a light at the end of the tunnel. I can't even be excited about my organic farming internship that is stating in a month. I just keep thinking about her and everything that is lost and most importantly how I've loss besides my partner but also my best friend that was her.
Sorry for the long ramble"

1zawv4,12,2014-03-01,I am lost,Troglobitten,CrohnsDisease,https://www.reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/1zawv4/i_am_lost/,"Hi fellow crohnies,

I feel lost and I wanted to share my story, mostly for the sake of being able to get this of my chest. Over the past few years I have alienated myself and saw the people in my life drift away. I need a listening ear.

I am 27 and from a young age crohns has impacted my life. As I grew up I saw my dad go in and out of the hospital. He has had numerous resections and has been taking a cocktail of all sorts of drugs.
I have always been an introverted person and was never able to talk to my dad and form a bond. Because of this I was never able to form a full image of the impact the disease has had on my dad. While I have seen him at his worst, in pain and in the hospital hardly conscious, he was never open about it. As soon as he was healed he would go back to his job as maintenance in a large university. Even though he had been in the hospital before, he would get back up and go back to physical labor to provide for the family.

In my early twenties I slid into a depression caused by a slew of reasons. It influenced my professional life and as a result I only managed to work 1 full year. The rest of the time I was going through a roller coaster of emotions.

The summer of 2012 is where I felt my life would change for the better. I was able to get training by the state so I would become a valuable asset on the jobmarket. I started my training as web developer and felt good doing it. I had great testresults and I knew this would be my new start. But in early 2013 I got sick. The doctor assumed it was the flu so I stayed home for a week, ready to get back to my training. But unlike my expectations I stayed sick. I would go to the trainingcenter, only to spend a lot of time on the toilet. It was around may that I would visit a GI, who said the next best step would be a colonoscopy. 

By early summer 2013 I had my first colonoscopy that showed inflammation. It was however unclear what exactly caused it, so my doctor advised me to wait a few months and try again. She also informed me I showed signs of Marfan syndrome, so that led to tests at the cardiologists. My first ultrasound showed prolapsing heart valves and a dilated aorta so they ordered DNA tests. So in the middle of 2013, the year that was supposed to be the renaissance of my life, I was left with the possibility of both crohns and marfan.

On a small positive note, a web development company offered me an internship that would lead to full time employment. So I started my internship with good intentions but soon found out those will not cut it. My symptoms started worsening and my days at my internship would be filled with toiletbreaks and a fever that would not go away. Some days I felt so bad I would have to stay at home, and sadly my future employers noticed this too. While they always were very supportive and understanding about my illness, they could not offer me a full time job because they were unable to include me in their planning if I was unavailable every other week.

My fevers got worse, I had spend more time on the toilet and tried to bite through the pain. I had lost more weight (I weighed 52kg (not a lot for 1m95)) and my head became very cloudy. On the evening of my prep I was so sick my parents brought me to the hospital where they kept me for the following days so they could run tests and find meds for me.

In November I was officially diagnosed with Crohn's and put on medication. I was also officially diagnosed with marfan as the DNA results came back positive and received medication. I am currently on entocort (I also took pentasa for a while) and it made me regain strength and helped me limit the symptoms. Right now I need to taper of the entocort and start taking 6-MP and I find myself lost.

Some days I feel healthy as an ox, and other days I am curled up in pain. I am still on sickleave and I question myself I I even deserve this ""laziness"". My dad has had it worse than me so far, but he always went right back to work. I see people here on reddit share their experiences that are unquestionable worse than my experience. I know that I gave everything I had at my internship, and I would refuse to go home as I would sit there shivering. 
 
**tl;dr**
I do no longer know who I am as a person. Am I sick? Am I sick enough? Do I use my sickness as an excuse to stay home or am I really too sick for a steady employment. There are days that I could take on the world, but does this mean I am a valuable asset on the jobmarket that people can count on? How will 6-MP help me? What will next month be like? I do no longer know if I am a hypchondriac liar or not. I am lost."

Ultimately, I wouldn't mind working at Fixmo. Its just that it would be slightly better if I get a dev position for my first coop. 

Also do you think its wise to call one of the employers and ask what they ranked me?

EDIT: 

Here is what I think I will do:

Rank all my devs 1 (2 of them)
Rank fixmo 4 because I think that still gives me a chance to get it if I dont get any dev jobs.
Rank one of the dev jobs 5 because I would rather work for Fixmo over this
Rank one of the other dev jobs 9 because its in Waterloo and the pay is terrible.

Logic: I will aim for the top 2 dev jobs and then if I dont get them, I still have fixmo fallback.

Currently, I'm looking at University of Oregon and University of Washington, along with UH Manoa as my schools of choice.

One problem I have however, is finding myself EC opportunities within Hawaii for CS science. I've asked and looked at local colleges, but they seem really unresponsive (At UH Manoa the computer science/engineering department is quite small). At the moment, I'm taking some online courses (Edx + Coursera) and always considering taking a computer science course (4 weeks/non-credit) in the summer. There's a IBM building, but at the moment they don't seem to be looking for internships. Aside from the IBM building, all the jobs for computer science seem to be in IT. For these ""businesses"", should I just take a shot by calling and asking for an internship?

Will this be enough? If not, then what should I do?

I'm not sure where to start. I haven't worked since Jan 2012 by choice. My father committed suicide at the end of 2011 leaving me an orphan at age 23. I found myself unable to focus on work and lacking motivation so I resigned from a software engineer position in Ohio a couple months later. For the next 18 months I served as executor for my father's estate and did some traveling while trying to determine the next step in my life. Near the end of 2013, I began to feel my ambition &amp; motivation returning. After two final soul-searching trips, I decided that I was ready to restart my life and to give software development another try.

I'm not motivated by compensation but would like to be paid a fair salary/wage commensurate with my skills &amp; low experience. I'm interested in almost any paid position in software development (FT, PT, contract, internships). I just ask for a chance to prove myself, learn, and work my way up. My goal is to be able to live up to the high regard that engineers are generally held in. I don't feel like I have earned the right to use the title ""engineer"" even though I have both a B.S. in Computer Engineering from NCSU and an Engineer-in-Training certification from the NCEES. Although I worked hard for them, they are pieces of paper and I look forward to the day that I'm able to call myself an engineer with pride.

The languages I am familiar with include Python, Java, HTML, C (in order of how recently I've been using them). I do want to be more than just a coder eventually but I need to develop my skill foundation further so I'm looking forward to diving into work for awhile. 

I appreciate **ANY** advice, leads, comments, offers, and suggestions. Thanks for taking the time to read this. "
1zbzuu,7,2014-03-02,Needing a big sister...when do you know a relationship had run its course?,[deleted],TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1zbzuu/needing_a_big_sisterwhen_do_you_know_a/,"I know that this might not be the right subreddit, but you all are so supportive I thought I might get the best advice here. 


I'm 22F, boyfriend is 26M, been together for 3 years, living together 1.5 years. I'm finishing up my last year in college while he graduated last year.


I'm just having a hard time in my relationship right now and I was wondering if anyone had some advice about relationships and knowing how to move forward or not with them.


The good stuff: My BF and I get along fabulously--he takes care of me when I'm sad, makes me amazing dinners several times a week, and drives me to school, I do my best to return the favor in my own ways. We can talk like best friends for hours and hours, and just generally really really enjoy each other's company. He's super understanding and intelligent, and has made me grow so much as a person in innumerable positive ways. He and I have talked about how we would want to get married in the future. All our friends think we have a really great thing going on. He makes me smile and laugh multiple times a day no matter what. Every day we tell each other how blessed we are to have found each other and we are really love-y with each other. 


The difficult stuff: 
We obviously got together young, so we both have some concerns about settling down with so early. He just had a really tearful talk with me about how he wanted to have sex with other people cuz he's  only been 2 (for me only 3), and that he felt sort of mid-life crisis-y. I suggested an open relationship but he said he could never deal with knowing that I was having sex with other men. 


Our own sex life really isn't so great. He's really inhibited about sex (his ex was the type of partner who freaked out and screamed at him one time when he tried to do doggy-style), and doesn't like foreplay....so he tends to find porn an easier release. I'm kinkier and have had more varied sexual experiences. I thought that this was a solvable problem but despite talks about it where he says he's going to work on being less inhibited and cut down on porn...it works for a while but then stops. We have sex once a week to once every two weeks, and most of the time when we do do it it's pretty good. 


He also owes me a ton of money and isn't able to support himself without my help. Since his graduation he has been having a hard time finding enough work. He found one part-time job quickly but it couldn't cover rent, he added another and still wasn't able to. I lent him a TON of money ($2000-3000 ish) of which he still owes me almost all of it (over $2000). That's basically my whole savings and while he is finally making enough to cover his expenses and rent (as of a few weeks ago when he found 3rd and 4th part time jobs) but I don't know if it's enough to start paying me back. We bought a car together a year ago because we both really needed a car to get to internships and stuff but couldn't afford to buy one seperately. I've been saddled with all the maintenance cost and insurance costs (though he promises to pay back 1/2 once he can). His family is poor and can't help him (a few years ago his mom owed me $700 for 10 months before paying me back). I'm able to support him because my parents give me $1000 a month for living expenses since I'm in college and then I also work a part-time job about 15-20 hours a week. All the money stuff makes me feel a lot older than I really am and I'm tired, I feel like I'm not supposed to be this burdened with responsibility at this point in my life. He feel bad about it and apologizes, but it's still really hard on me.


I also worry that I'm too conventional for him/he's too unconventional for me. He wants be a musician (and actually is a really talented and driven one) but is okay will living below the poverty line for an unforeseen amount of time. I'm trying to find a job that let's me do what I want to do (help people and make a positive difference) while paying me more than 50k a year and just generally letting me have kids and someday own a house and go on vacations and that sorta stuff. Those differences in where we see our future freak me out. Also I would want kids when I'm around 30 (in 8 years) while he wants kids but can't imagine having them that early (he'd want more like 15 years when he's 40ish). For biological reasons there isn't much space to compromise as far as kids-timing goes.


I find myself wishing I was single and mingling with some regularity, I've always had a lot of options in the relationship department, and it's been getting increasing hard to say that I'm making the right choice staying with my current bf. Especially when I feel like I have other attractive options if I wanted them. But we get along on a personal level SO WELL. 


Anyone have any sort of guidance? Or been in a similar situation? I feel so lost.


TL:DR:
My boyfriend and I get along so wonderfully emotionally but logistically things are harder; he owes me a bunch of money and our sex life isn't awesome. I find myself wondering if I'm making the right choice to stay with him. "
1zcf7a,0,2014-03-02,"Me [18M] with my girlfriend [19F] of 7 months, cheated on me what do I do?",led7744,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1zcf7a/me_18m_with_my_girlfriend_19f_of_7_months_cheated/,"I have been with my girlfriend for 7 months. When I met her in high school we clicked immediately, I learned that she knew me and had fantasized about talking to me for two years but never summoned the courage to talk to me because she thought she wasn't ""cool"" enough. I had never noticed her around school until the day I saw her and became infatuated wit her and talked to her. 

After a few weeks I was crazy about her and she became one of my closest friends, she constantly told me that she thought she wasn't ""good looking enough"" for me. I never really understood that because we were so much alike and I thought she was beautiful. She felt so inadequate no matter how much I told her that she was gorgeous and how much fun I had with her. After three months I fell in love with her and wanted to see her and be with her more often than she wanted to be with me. She always told me she thought she wasn't good enough for me, but what confused me was she never wanted to see me as often as I wanted to see her. We hadn't had sex yet which didn't bother me at all, she was much less sexually experienced than me and told me she was intimidated by that. I always told her I didn't care that much about that but wanted to hang out and go on dates more often. She was very shy and wanted to take things slow with me and the farthest we went was oral sex.

About 5 months into our relationship she took an out of state internship and lived with her cousins for a month and a half. We were long-distance and communicated almost everyday. But towards the end of the internship (a week before she came back home) she told me she missed me and really wanted a nude picture of me, I was more than happy to send one if she also sent me one. But she told me like many times before that she wasn't good looking enough and she wasn't good enough to send me one back. I told her that if she wouldn't send one too than I wouldn't either and we got into a big argument about it.

After our argument we didn't communicate for three days until the fourth day when I texted her and left a voicemail apologizing for getting into such a silly argument and really wanted to hear from her again. I kept trying to reach her and didn't hear from her until 2 days after she got back home. 

We met up and I was so happy to see her after so long and thats when she told me the worst news. She was crying  and guilt ridden when she admitted that three days after our argument she made out and sucked some guys dick that she met that same day. I thought the world of this girl and knew she was very prudent and wary when it came to physical relationships until now. I was heart broken and crushed and drove her home while she begged for forgiveness and said she felt awful for doing it.

I have never been put in this situation before and have no clue what to do I am in shock. I know I am young and have a lot ahead of me but this girl meant so much to me and I don't understand what just happened! Do I even bother talking to her and try to mend the situation or am I to young to have to continue a relationship with this much baggage and pain?


---   
**tl;dr**: Girlfriend that was ""sexually inexperienced"" and felt inadequate had the same amount of intimacy we had with a stranger. I love and miss this girl but should I try to mend a situation this messed up?

UPDATE: I messed up she came over this morning and we had sex, I guess as a way to show her commitment towards me. She said that she thought we broke up because we didn't talk for a few days. WTF?"

I have PCOS. I’ve been just all over the place crying and being miserable. My boyfriend and I are from different religion and my mother had found out that we are friends. In my religion is a little difficult to date, number 1 because we are not allowed to and number 2 we shouldn’t even talk to men, unless its an emergency. My parents are conservative Muslims and I am the oddball out. I respect them but they seem to not understand who I am and how I’ve become. They don’t understand what PCOS is and what it does to me. Nobody gets it. The reason why I’ve been more sad recently is that I keep forgetting to take my medicine, I can see how it changes my mood when I do forget, I’m just very miserable. It makes my tummy rumble and my back aches. I even get headaches. On top of all the physical pain I also have a mother and brother who are hovering over me. They don’t let me release any of the stress. I don’t get to go out with my friends and I do not get to hang out with my boyfriend. It’s been like this for 2 months. I don’t know what to do and I know it’s taking a toll on my relationship. How do I get out of this and how can I remain patient with others and myself around me? I’m always sad and it’s been like this for the past two months. I’ve been lying to my parents since I was born it seems like and there’s no way they understand me. The walls are up and I know everyone has crazy family. I’ve tried talking to them but there’s always a religious code that I’m breaking every time I talk to them about my dreams and what I want to do with my life. I can’t concentrate on my school or the internship that I’m doing. I go to the gym after classes just so I can release some stress. I’m not allowed to work full time and I’m not allowed to work on the weekends because she thinks that I lie to her. She made me call from one of the families’ house phone just so she knows that I’m at that family’s house and that I’m babysitting for them. I’m lost and I feel like I’m here by myself I want to accept that and just move on forward. I am 22 turning 23 in April. I have until Dec 2015 to graduate from school. Thank you for reading and hopefully someone can tell me something to give me some type of hope cause right now I have none.

[both of us 20M]",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1zdmkt/my_boyfriend_of_six_months_got_anxious_about_our/,"Goodness, this is going to be long. And my emotions are still all screwed up, but here goes.

So here's the backstory: both of us are juniors studying Computer Science at a nice state school, well known for its CS program. I have been there since I was a freshman, and he transferred here between semesters sophomore year from a lesser-known school with a not-so-good CS program. In the beginning of our junior year (beginning of last fall semester), we met in the hallway, started talking, exchanged numbers, and went on a date.

It had been pretty amazing since then. We've done a lot together. We've gone to school events together, invited each other to parties, and eaten at all the nice places around town. Our personalities just kinda clicked, and everything felt right when we were around each other. Both of us were convinced that each other was ""the one"".

But both of us each have a huge issue in our lives, and these are problems that will never go away which we just have to accept and deal with:

* His parents don't accept his sexuality. They are very traditional and conservative, and whenever my boyfriend talks to them, he can't talk about our relationship.
* I have Asperger's, and I'm aware that I will never see the world around me (and relationships with people) the same way everyone else does.

These have mostly been benign issues. I have learnt to deal with my Asperger's and can function normally in society for the most part, but I frequently need my alone time. He is hundreds of miles away from his parents, so he doesn't have to talk to them frequently.

---

A few months ago, we both found amazing internships in the SF Bay Area. We thought it would be a great idea to live together for the summer, because housing over there is expensive as fuck, and we might as well. We found a nice place for a great deal, and jumped on it as soon as possible (again, housing market). This planned living situation was a given for the next few months. After the summer, we would continue to live apart at school.

But over the past month, my boyfriend has been having a lot of anxiety about our future. This anxiety has slowly been building up and up, and he released it while walking home from a party. As we were walking through a quiet residential neighborhood, he began to let his mind spill on me. He felt we were moving too fast, and that we've made a lot of commitments too early (especially about the living situation). It was really difficult for him to say this, and we were both in tears. We walked to his place and continued to discuss.

He doesn't feel like he's in a position to have a long-term relationship right now, despite what he feels for me. He's told me he loves me, and he really likes the relationship we do have with each other, but he's convinced it's not the right time for it. I understand why he feels this way, but naturally I feel shitty, because I never really considered there to be a ""right time"" for a relationship.

I let him sleep on it, and in the morning he still felt the same. It was a tough decision, but we broke up. I didn't want to do it, but I knew that in the end it would make him happier, and that would be better for the both of us. I'm trying to work with him on his anxiety issues, and tomorrow, I'm going to introduce him to the staff at our school's LGBT center and help him get a therapist from the school health services.

I love my boyfriend, and I still want to be together. But I know that's uncertain and for the most part out of my control. My question is: how can I be there for him? Am I doing the right thing by pointing him to mental health counseling?

Usually they have a phone screening with a recruiter, then if you pass that one phone interview with an engineer, and then another only if you pass the first one. Why would the skip the first step and combine the next two steps for me?

Then I realized in my research that this position was never advertised this year and they don't seem to put out a public statement saying they're hiring for it. The recruiter told me they're hiring for the IT resident program which is a post grad position, but will cut it down to an internship for select candidates. What the heck? It is KILLING ME wondering why my interview process deviates from the standard plan.

1zelts,0,2014-03-02,Me [21 M] no idea what to do with long distance shenanigans [22 F] HALP!!!,Pnd5488,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1zelts/me_21_m_no_idea_what_to_do_with_long_distance/,"Okay. So I met this girl in the community college that we both attended, like 10 months ago we started to spend time together to get to know each other. I initially wasn't looking for anything then after a while realized it had potential to go somewhere. But I still took my time to make moves etc mostly because we are both not as experienced in relationships.. ANYWAYS 

Three months after we start getting to know each other she has to move because she transferred to a different school, it's in the same state but like a 7 hour drive. So this school is SUPER competitive and requires a lot of time and work.. So initially she just leaves and things were just left the way that they were aka just us getting to know each other.

So we continue talking and she's always busy and never has time to talk to me etc having a bunch of things to do but i put up with it because i think there's potential for a good relationship... But things get slightly better and she starts to make time to talk to me..

So holidays come and she comes back to her parents for a few weeks we ended up spending a lot of time together, i got to know a lot more also her family etc etc so eventually she has to go back to school. Initially it was okay she would make time to text, call and skype...

But then eventually little by little she started to reply less, take longer to reply and im here like an idiot sending good morning/night texts and it's to a point where she is not even responding because she is 'soo busy' because of a combination of a being in a super competitive school, being a leader in an association, and also having internship interviews. 

This story is getting way too long.. okay so it got to we wouldn't talk for a whole week and i would try to reach her and she would just say sorry im so busy this week etc so then instead of feeling like shit all the time i just decided to drop it and completely ignore her and not care lol but then now that i decided to ignore her she started texting me al these sweet things and  me asking me how come im not replying etc...

So pretty much.. I'm looking and willing to do anything for a good relationship and she's a perfect candidate but she's just too busy.. So I decided to drop it and after I've ignored her for almost a week she finally stopped trying to talk to me. 

SO HERE COMES THE QUESTION... First I'm I crazy for expecting so much from her when we are not even officially together? Second.. Did I do this right? Is there a better approach? Should I have talked to her about it? Well I kinda tried but she was busy...

---   
**tl;dr**: Started dating this girl she moved away still cares about me but never has time to communicate, i decided to just stop going after a relationship with her. Good decision? Does it need closure?"

Still holding steady, back home for 6 months before heading back to Ontario for next hockey season.  Hoping to lose at least 30 pounds in the 6 months I'm at home and be under 200 pounds when I get back to Ontario!

As for what I've done to lose the weight, I've always been a bigger guy, all through school and college I was the funny fat guy I guess you could say.  Last summer I decided now that I had graduated college and was looking to start my career as a sports broadcaster, it was time to really put my mind to losing weight.  I have been working out regularly (at least 5 days a week) for probably 5+ years now, but could never lose weight because I was always snacking.  Not horrible things, but just stuff like crackers.  

When I got home from my internship I started running on the treadmill we had at the house, and tracking my calories with myfitnesspal.  I would run for as long as I could (usually 8-10 minutes) and then take a few minute break, run for a few minutes etc.  Eventually I worked my way up to running for 15 minutes, then 18 minutes, and now I can run for half an hour without stopping.  Sure enough, the weight flew off.  Down 10 pounds in the first two weeks, and 20 pounds in the first month.  Of course it slowed down, and I hit a major plateau around 235/236 pounds that I just could not get out of.  I was stuck there for probably 6 weeks or so, man that was frustrating.

I exercise every day of the week.  Over the last 10 months I've probably missed 14 days total of working out, and most of those weren't by choice.  If I don't exercise in a day, I just feel like I've wasted my day, and could have done better.  I'm now doing Insanity since I can't afford a gym membership until I get a job, and man is it tough.  I just did day 3 today and I already want to die haha. I'm taking pictures after I'm done the workouts everyday, and hopefully after the final day there will be a noticeable difference from day one.

Thanks for looking, I hope everyone is staying on track with their weightloss goals.  This subreddit has been an awesome place for inspiration, and I'm glad to be a part of it!"
1zev3t,4,2014-03-03,Should I finish my degree? (Internship offers from 2 of the Big 4),[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1zev3t/should_i_finish_my_degree_internship_offers_from/,"I'm currently a 4th year computer science student set to graduate May 2015. I go to UBC which is consistently ranked in top 50 in the world, but not particularly for its computer science curriculum. I feel as if a degree from this school wouldn't mean much. 

I have interned at NVIDIA in the past, and gotten a return internship offer; they were also willing to make a full time offer. 

You might have noticed it's odd I'm a senior but still a full year away from graduating -- I was supposed to graduate in December 2014, but both Amazon and Facebook made an internship offer. Because I don't want to lose either opportunities, I'm taking a term off to do both; Amazon in the summer, Facebook in the fall. Both companies are okay with me doing this. 

Here's the thing though. I hate school. Yeah sure, a lot of us do, but I really hate school. This school has done nothing for me, I'm on academic probation, and my GPA is ~2.6. I need an average of 57% this term or else I'll be required to withdraw and there's a real possibility of that happening. I've invested so much time in interview prep that I've neglected school work too much, and I feel like I'm too far behind to catch up at this point.

I know I can do good work from my experience at NVIDIA. I'm confident I'll be able to perform well at the next two internships and have return offers from at least one of them. But I don't know how they will react if I drop out. 

Currently, I am putting in the minimal effort to successfully finish my degree but I'm worried about the worst case. So I guess the question I'm trying to ask is, I'm almost done, I might as well finish my degree but what happens if I get kicked out? Am I screwed? 

EDIT: Alright I'll finish my degree. I think I was just frustrated and had a spur of giving-up attitude. 

EDIT2: I GET IT I'M FINISHING MY FUCKING DEGREE GUYS. STOP FIGHTING."
1zewbx,1,2014-03-03,things are turning up now that Feb is over!,[deleted],LongDistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/1zewbx/things_are_turning_up_now_that_feb_is_over/,"February is always a really hard month for me because my birthday, the day I met my SO, Valentine's Day, AND our anniversary are all in the same month. It's sad because these are days that would be such incredible and happy occasions IF we were together. We haven't been together for a Valentine's Day since 2010! This year was particularly hard because this is the first year I am away from home for my birthday (attending college), and our 5th year being each other's valentines. To make all that even worse, in the middle of the month he got offered a summer internship in Indiana, another 100+ miles away from me. He asked me if I thought he should do it, and if I'd be okay with it. I couldn't deny him the opportunity to do something that could be really really great for him, and his future. As hard as it was to accept it, I'm really REALLY happy for him, and I'm proud of him for taking on such a challenge and accepting this incredible opportunity. On Feb 26th we celebrated our 4 year anniversary...apart... but it was still a very happy occasion. And now that we've made it through hell month, I am so butt-wigglin happy that he is coming to visit me on Saturday!! His spring break is the week before mine so he will be off of school and able to come and visit me on my campus, AND to make a good story BETTER, my professor cancelled one of my classes so I will be able to come home early for MY spring break and see him before he goes back to school! That's two weekends in a row! Gah I'm just so excited. We though spring break was going to suck because they didn't line up, and I am traveling to Rome, Italy over my spring break, but it has really worked out perfectly and I couldn't be more excited to see him. He's the love of my life and I just can't wait for this weekend! I can hardly contain myself, I just had to share the joy. ...and I'm sorta kinda hoping he sees this, just so he knows how happy he makes me and how excited I am for our big upcoming reunion(s)! I love you bean :) See you soon!"
1zeyao,5,2014-03-03,"Me [22M] with my girlfriend [19F] of 2.5 years, I just cheated after a rough period.",thorawayaefjn,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1zeyao/me_22m_with_my_girlfriend_19f_of_25_years_i_just/,"I have been working in a different city for the past 4 months on an internship for a bank. Half way through my girlfriend dumped me. No talking, no real reasons given, deleted of Facebook, never wanted to speak again. I was completely broken. I mean really broke: I was in a new city with no friends to talk to in a cold crappy room, and I was suffering from a lot of anxiety daily from starting a new job. I just spent weekends and nights sitting on my bed. But weeks later she rang me again, and apologised, said she had some bad stuff happen to her and was finding the stress too difficult to cope with the distance between our cities. She knew she had been unfair in how she dumped me. We resolved and got back together

I've never been a popular person, but I really hit it off with the people at this place I was working. On my last day they threw a surprise drinks session for me in town, and I just felt like a million dollars. After drinking far too much, I ended up meeting with this group of gay people (both guys and girls). I'm not gay but they were friendly, and I started going around the gay bars with them. Again, this is so unlike me. I was still in a suit cruising around with a bunch of fashionista gay people (I had never gone to clubs just a few months before..) and I probably stood out like a sore thumb. But I was having just such a great time dancing and laughing with new friends. When a random guy started acting rude to this one girl in the group I stood up to him (again not really like me), they were all like 'you're staying with us for the whole night!'. 

Anyway my flight was going to leave the next morning, and one of the gay girls said 'you can just crash at my place'. I hadn't hit on her once or anything, and wasn't expecting her to want anything, as she was 10 years older than me, far better looking, and very clearly not into guys. We ended up talking, drinking and smoking for another three hours until the sun came up. I don't remember how, but we ended up kissing. Which then led to the bedroom, and we had sex. 

In the morning she was still friendly, but made it clear that she didn't want me to tell anyone, as I was the only guy she had done anything with and didn't really want her friends to know. I told her not to worry, I knew none of her friends and was leaving her city for good in a few hours. So I flew back home.

I don't even remember her name. 

I don't really know where this is going, but I already know that I don't think I'm going to tell my girlfriend, not for the foreseeable future anyway. Part of me thinks it's because when she dumped me it was over the new years period. She went to a new years festival with all her single friends. I saw photos of her with her arms around guys. She then got back in contact with me when she got home. When we got back together we just didn't talk about it. I don't even want to know what happened. She was single, so of course she did nothing wrong even if she did.

The more likely reason is that we're so good as a couple and I can't destroy my relationship on this one fuckup. As horrible as it is to say, it's nearly impossible for her to find out. No one knows except me and someone else who wants to keep it a secret, who is now hundreds of miles away and I will never hear from again. Me and my girlfriend, except for the random breakup haven't had even a bump in the road. 

I've done something horrible, and maybe the reality of it hasn't hit me yet. But I'd be lying if I said that it was one of the happiest nights of my life. Not the cheating, but just meeting everyone and feeling popular.

I'm back home now, and I guess now I'm one of those guys who I never thought I would be. Sorry for the long and self-important post. I know I'm just dressing up a 'I got drunk, cheated, and wont tell' story. I thought that typing it all out would give me a degree of clarity about the situation, but I guess I'm either too stupid or wrapped up in the turbulence of the past 3 months to make up my own mind as to what to do. I love my girlfriend so much, and there will be no going back to her if I let her know.
---   
**tl;dr**: I did something stupid but don't seem to be realising the consequences. I just want to ignore it and I'm sure we'll be happy. I know the answer is 'you have to tell her', but I still wouldn't mind getting some input first. Thanks for reading."

After our undergraduate degree, we moved to London where I went on to do my Masters and he was looking for a job (he is from London). After my masters I tried to find a job too but couldn't and so I had the opportunity to come to Dubai where my parents live and try to find an internship opportunity as it's easier here. In the meantime I met another guy in Dubai whom I soon started seeing even though I hadn't officially broken up with the guy in London. I was completely uncertain about where my life is taking me and our relationship and therefore I had this guy here in Dubai (call him Carl) who was the best sex I ever had. That is basically how it started, we were fuck buddies as he knew I had someone back in London. Finally in February 2013 when I went back to London for my graduation, James and I decided that we shouldn't get in the way of each other growing and developing and so it was a mutual decision to break up. It was heart breaking for me as I really loved (or still love) this guy. 

I came back to Dubai where I was offered a permanent position at the company where I interned and became more focused on my time with Carl. Sooner than later, he wanted to become official and not be just fuck buddies. I agreed, particularly because James had turned very cold since I left London and was not speaking to me much..

Few months later I get a long email from James explaining how he feels and how he loves me and how he needed some time to try and get on with his life.. We start talking again, I love talking to him as he was always my biggest support in life.. Before I know it we are even sending naughty pictures to each other (I don't know why I did this because I had lost that sort of physical passion with him and my sex with Carl was so damn good). I then went back to visit London in July because I have friends and family there. Obviously I see James too (who has no idea about Carl). Although I don't feel comfortable sleeping with him or anything I do it anyway because seeing his face alone melts my heart and I'm worried that if I don't sleep with him I will lose him. Also, I have a very good relationship with his parents who treated me like a daughter. I love walking around London with him and holding hands and going for dinner together... I'm so sad to leave London but I know Carl is waiting in Dubai for me..

Fast forward few months and Carl finds out about everything.. About how I cheated on him and how i'm in contact with James (Carl checked my laptop.. this was bound to happen)... I tell James everything because I'm too scared that Carl will send him a dirty email explaining everything otherwise which he had threatened me to do.. James gets very upset but after a week of silent treatment tells me he also had somebody he was seeing but after my visit in July he stopped it because he was so into me.. He says he can forget about it.  As a first reaction, I cried my ass off to Carl because I was so upset I hurt him and didn't want to lose him (If I didn't have James in my life I would have been perfectly happy with Carl). Since then he has forgiven me but obviously he wants me to completely cut James out of my life which is understandable. I'm not sure I'm ready to do this though as James and I used to talk about me finding a job in London and us moving in together to our own place and future plans.. I'm not very happy working in Dubai and I have been trying to apply for jobs in London as I think from a career point of view it's better for me.. But I do worry what if moving back will not make me happy in the end? What if whatever James and I had worked in the past when we needed each other for mutual support on our studies etc but in terms of day to day activities we are quite different whereas I and Carl are the same - into working out together, preparing healthy meals together, travelling and checking out new trending places... Carl's family is pretty weird though and they have a very weird relationship. They are also super stingy (probably normal for Swedish people)..

Please help me Redditors! I don't know what to do? Is it weird that after being a year with Carl I haven't been able to forget about James? Or is it because I never let James go completely that I didn't give Carl the fair chance he deserves? I honestly don't mean to be playing with people's feelings (although I know I am doing just that..) but seriously I am super confused with my life right now and I'm so sick and tired of the constant stress.. Right now I am on a break with Carl after he insisted I remove James from my facebook.. I don't want to lose James though because he doesn't deserve it, he never did anything wrong to me and he was such a big part of my life..

Please help me!!!

I really like some feedback from reddit to see how I did, and like to share with u guys my experience. **Thanks for the great support!**

EDIT: 
Hi Reddit, I just **updated** my app,(might take sometime for play store to show up) based on you guys' feedback, they are really useful, I appreciate it and for the continual support!~~. Here are a list of changes I made:

* Fixed Flashlight not working on some phones
* (If you are very lucky cause the of flash still doesn't work please~~ email me to let me know. Thanks for support!)
* Removed permission for GPS access.( I am 50% sure the compass still works with it. Please let me know if I'm wrong.)
* Added Settings to configure if the flashlight will turn on/off on application start-up.
* Updated power button image with better resolution.

What I learned from this:
First of all, I did know a bit of programming before I started making apps, so I wasn't a complete noob, but I started with reading books about android developing since I knew almost nothing!
The first thing I learned was how to make a event handler for a button and things picked up from there, and I thought I was ready to start my app. At that time, I wanted to start something easy that I won't be overwhelmed with all the features, so I decided to make a flashlight app.Time went on, after about a week, I showed my friends mine prototype, and their first reaction was ""it looks stupid"", ""there are tons of flashlight apps out there"". I wasn't too depressed at that time, since I knew I was a noob and the app did look stupid.(I wasn't too stuck in my design box, if you know what I mean). Then I asked them what could I do to make it better? and they suggested me some valuable features. I added the features, and showed my friends again. Their reaction was still ""it looks stupid"". This time I thought to myself,""You need to learn some graphics design"", and I didn't know what I got myself into. So the next two weeks, I was drawing pictures every night,( during day-time I have an internship) ""Google &amp; Youtube &amp; stackoverflow"" are my best friend when learning something new. For me, Drawing pictures was frustrating, I draw something, then I ditch the picture to draw something else. After when I almost give up on drawing pictures over and over again, I noticed my biggest problem, **Different Screen Sizes**, sigh*. Using the android SDK emulated device was both slow and sometimes the scale won't be the same on the actual phone, so the layout would look different than what you see on the emulated device....GRRRRRRR. So I went to my ""*best friends* for learning"" again and I found a Software called **genymotion**, which emulates major devices faster and with correct scale to real size. genymotion helped me a lot to test on different devices, and soon after here I am, trying to get more feedbacks, and what better place to get them then on Reddit? lol (I might post in other forums as well =P)

So I went to my ""*best friends* for learning"" again and I found a Software called **genymotion**, which emulates major devices faster and with correct scale to real size. genymotion helped me a lot to test on different devices, and soon after here I am, trying to get more feedbacks, and what better place to get them then on Reddit? lol (I might post in other forums as well =P)

If you read this far. Thanks for the support!!~ I would really appreciate your feedback &amp; bugs on my app at the top of the post."

Questions|Answers
:--|:--
[Sooo...is the House of Cards representation of congressman any accurate (i.e. coke, partying, irresponsibility, etc\) or is it just sleepy old men?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zfxgx/iama_former_senior_staffer_to_a_member_of/cft9zze?context=5)|It's not even remotely accurate in my experience. The best and most accurate portrayal of staff culture and how process works is Veep.  That show nails how all of the climber sycophants, policy geeks, and creepy special interests gum up the process.  
[So much for the bad guys.  Who are the good guys?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zfxgx/iama_former_senior_staffer_to_a_member_of/cftfxjp?context=5)|People who vote. People who stay informed and work in their daily Lives to make change.
[As someone who has very little knowledge of congressional-staff-culture outside of House of Cards, I'm very intrigued. Could you go a bit more into detail about what was accurate/inaccurate?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zfxgx/iama_former_senior_staffer_to_a_member_of/cfthg20?context=5)|In HoC? Nothing really. House of Cards is not a show about politics. It doesn't really try to be. It's a pulp scandal story.  Watch a few episodes of veep. It's 100% accurate.  
[I find it oddly hilarious that you speak of the sycophants that gum up the process and then became one yourself by trade.  Well played on feeding a broken system and getting yours in the process!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zfxgx/iama_former_senior_staffer_to_a_member_of/cftsu1m?context=5)|Oh we've met and you know about my personality?
[Granted the West Wing follows the West Wing, but how does that show compare to real life (if you have seen the show\). ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zfxgx/iama_former_senior_staffer_to_a_member_of/cfti1h1?context=5)|To me, it's aaron sorkin speaking at us through characters.  Veep is 1000x more accurate, albeit still covering the administration. 
[One thing about VEEP is it seems that even the Vice-President wasn't immune to stupid mistake, comments, or gross incompetence. Would you say that is the same for Congressmen?  Oh what are your predictions/your congressman's opinion on 2014/2016? Or do you not discuss that much?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zfxgx/iama_former_senior_staffer_to_a_member_of/cftiium?context=5)|And as far as VEEP: I've spent entire weeks fixing mistakes I didn't make.  It's pretty spot on. 
[What kind of field are you lobbying for?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zfxgx/iama_former_senior_staffer_to_a_member_of/cfta3om?context=5)|Big oil, increased off shoring of money, less oversight of PACs, etc...
 |(But really, infrastructure investments)
[For what it's worth, I thought it was hilarious.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zfxgx/iama_former_senior_staffer_to_a_member_of/cfvlxbf?context=5)|Thank you.  I don't know how I could have been more clear that I was joking!
[I would much rather not have a reason to be frustrated. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zfxgx/iama_former_senior_staffer_to_a_member_of/cfthbzr?context=5)|Me too! But it's not my fault the system is broken.  I didn't come in and break it 4 or 5 years ago.  I tried my hardest to always act out of idealism.  
[Hold on, how do you lobby for ""safer bridges""? Who pays you to lobby on behalf of public safety?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zfxgx/iama_former_senior_staffer_to_a_member_of/cfthm9x?context=5)|I don't advocate for safer bridges specifically. I advocate for safer infrastructure broadly.  Baby jesus pays me for doing god's work. And a non-profit organization. 
[Why do you specifically say 4 or 5 years ago?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zfxgx/iama_former_senior_staffer_to_a_member_of/cftm8gj?context=5)|Because it was broken for 100 years before I came?
[Saying 4 or 5 years ago makes it seem like it wasn't broken before then, not that you came to work with congress 4 or 5 years ago. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zfxgx/iama_former_senior_staffer_to_a_member_of/cftqtv1?context=5)|Sorry for the lack of clarity. It actually broke the day I started working there =P.
[I believe what he's trying to express here is that you are difficult to communicate with. Your ability to transfer inflection through text is sorely lacking.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zfxgx/iama_former_senior_staffer_to_a_member_of/cftpzaw?context=5)|Sadly, we do not use in line comments to modify our speech in english, as most other languages now do.
 |That's a joke. No other languages do that.
[I read that as the House is where you go to start out and the Senate is where you go for the perks and to retire. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zfxgx/iama_former_senior_staffer_to_a_member_of/cfttb4z?context=5)|Retire in the senate? I'd rather have the worst case of herpes of all time.  I think both are where you should go to leave, quickly.
[If you think like that, then why be in politics at all? Most people (I would like to think\) go to bring change for the better. Can't expect it to get better without putting in effort to change it. If herpes is what it cost, then herpes it is.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zfxgx/iama_former_senior_staffer_to_a_member_of/cfuj4rc?context=5)|Right but ""bringing change"" while a noble goal as a staffer, can be done in many ways.  Your usefulness in shaping policy on the inside may wear off, and you may find yourself more effective focusing on narrower issues from the outside.  Or leaving DC and working locally.   
[How does the whipping process typically work? Any examples of strong-arming or horse-trading to secure a vote you can share?  I have an image of Frank Underwood going to work on someone.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zfxgx/iama_former_senior_staffer_to_a_member_of/cftaesr?context=5)|I was never at the receiving end of this.  There just haven't been that many crucial votes where one Democrat was going to make or break the legislation's success since I came on board.  I think prior to the tea party wave, when legislation was actually moving, this was probably far more common.
[How common is pay to play? Is it done with an envelope of cash (how it works in my state legislator\) or is it funneled through proper channels and campaigns?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zfxgx/iama_former_senior_staffer_to_a_member_of/cftauxo?context=5)|The two worlds are kept separate by law.  No campaign business can be conducted in a member office, and [lobbyists can no longer just walk around handing out checks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAC2xeT2yOg).  Both offices I worked for had outside contractors who dealt with their campaign finances, and they only communicated with my Chiefs of Staff.  The member is obviously aware of where his or her financial support is coming from, but because I worked for safe members, I don't think money drove their policy nearly as much as interests within the state (businesses in the district, ethnic groups, etc).
 |*Edit* I didn't really answer your question about pay to play: in both offices I worked ANYONE from the state could get a meeting with staff.  Both bosses would personally meet with student groups when possible.  Higher level meetings with the bosses tend to a bit more...selective?  But not necessarily based on who is giving money.  If a CEO of a business in state is coming in to talk about concerns, they meet with the boss.  If a group of folks who want the U.S. to put an embargo on olives want's to talk to us, staff handles it.
[I am curious if one was to talk to the staffers, how much influence would that actually have? I'm just picturing a summary being given to the boss that he bushes aside to deal with the big requests from big lobby groups.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zfxgx/iama_former_senior_staffer_to_a_member_of/cftk432?context=5)|It's the worst. Hah.
[I am also very concerned that these older politicians really have no idea or concept of how technology and the internet really work.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zfxgx/iama_former_senior_staffer_to_a_member_of/cftk432?context=5)|I've changed my bosses minds on issues.  I literally got into screaming matches over keystone and sopa/pipa with my seniors.  Good staffers have a lot of influence.  Maybe not more than powerful lobbyists, but it doesn't mean we cant try our hardest. 
[You might be amused at a UK series from years ago, *Yes, Minister,* about the relationship between an MP and his staffers. It makes it pretty clear that staffers actually run the government. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zfxgx/iama_former_senior_staffer_to_a_member_of/cftri07?context=5)|I will totally check it out. That sounds great. 
[Do you view yourself as part of the problem or part of the solution?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zfxgx/iama_former_senior_staffer_to_a_member_of/cftcrhx?context=5)|I don't view MOST staffers as part of the problem.  I think the majority of them really do believe, in an idealistic way, in the work they are doing.  I think the problems are our campaign finance laws, our election laws, and our shitty fucking media that treats the whole thing like a reality show instead of doing their jobs.
 |As for myself, you know, almost everything we do is a moral decision.  Did you look at the tag on your shirt today to see where it was made? Did you buy gasoline? What city was your food grown in? Who picked it? How did it get to you?  We are all part of a problem despite our sometimes best intentions. 
[I finally convinced my dad after years of trying that fox news is NOT fair and balanced.  I felt like I had won the superbowl.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zfxgx/iama_former_senior_staffer_to_a_member_of/cftgwi1?context=5)|Fox news is awful. I don't see MSNBC as *much* better.  News channels should not advocate on behalf of a party, but instead on behalf of the truth. It's so conflicting when corporate conglomerates prevent them from doing so. 
[*I think the problems are our campaign finance laws, our election laws, and our shitty fucking media that treats the whole thing like a reality show instead of doing their jobs.*  What do you think is the feasible way of fixing those issues?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zfxgx/iama_former_senior_staffer_to_a_member_of/cfthwvb?context=5)|Your guess is as good as mine. It's so overwhelming. 
[I liked how one poll showed that most people trusted The Daily Show the most where political news was concerned. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zfxgx/iama_former_senior_staffer_to_a_member_of/cftk28y?context=5)|Well if you watch one episode of the daily show and 30 minutes of MSNBC, it's immediately clear who is being objective.  Sadly, it's not the ""news"" show.
[I blame media consolidation for most of that. There aren't enough competing voices. A decade ago, I worked very hard on that, including going to D.C., to hold the line on media ownership caps. We already took a huge hit on that front in '96, and we're determined not to let it get even worse. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zfxgx/iama_former_senior_staffer_to_a_member_of/cftlfcd?context=5)|Gods work. It needs to be broken up.
[Do you think Internet freedom and the transparency of organizations like Wikileaks is changing the ""reality show"" spectacle of American politics. Are they aiding in making the TRUTH more pressing to the masses?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zfxgx/iama_former_senior_staffer_to_a_member_of/cftk915?context=5)|I don't think the masses have any idea what wikileaks is =(
[Well, they've at least been well-introduced to Julian Assange - the alleged rapist, sexist, and paranoid conspiracy theorist (as portrayed by popular media\). There has to be a level of basic recognition at this point. Is there a genuine tension among white house staff with regard to waiting for new cables to be released? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zfxgx/iama_former_senior_staffer_to_a_member_of/cftkjru?context=5)|I don't work with white house staff at all, and on the hill, I don't think anyone knows/cares/pays attention.  It really is an administration headache more so than a congressional one. 
[A ""headache."" That sounds like an understatement to me.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zfxgx/iama_former_senior_staffer_to_a_member_of/cftkqfj?context=5)|Hah. Probably is. 
[What is something small you were asked to cover up? Examples, ""I hate shaking hands, like pizza with no sauce, or extramarital affairs are neat.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zfxgx/iama_former_senior_staffer_to_a_member_of/cftddcs?context=5)|One of my bosses wouldn't let us take meetings with a particular lobbying firm because they were ""a bunch of whores"" (financially, not literally prostitutes).  He made us take meetings with them in the cafeteria so they and their clients knew where they stood with our office.
 |I probably have more examples. If I think of something I will come back to this. 
[How'd you get the job?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zfxgx/iama_former_senior_staffer_to_a_member_of/cftavq2?context=5)|I worked for free for 6 months to prove my worth to an office and was eventually hired.  Blew my savings.  I think its similar to other fields where demand far outweighs supply. 
[Interesting that you see it as ""demand for jobs"" as opposed to ""demand for workers"". ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zfxgx/iama_former_senior_staffer_to_a_member_of/cftft3e?context=5)|I probably just worded it poorly but demand for jobs definitely outweighs the supply. 800 resumes came in for my last position.
[Do lobbyists really have as much direct control over politicians as reddit likes to think they do?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zfxgx/iama_former_senior_staffer_to_a_member_of/cftcd6i?context=5)|Yes/No.  I don't think *most* people understand what lobbying looks like. Lobbyists help give people a footprint in Washington D.C.   Some corporations and interest groups have in house lobbyists, and some hire firms like The Podesta Group to work on their behalf. I can give a lesson on how policy is crafted from cradle to grave if people are interested, but shortly: lobbyists aren't the problem.  Campaign finance laws are. 
[I've gained a basic understanding of your views from reading your responses...or so I'd like to think.  I'd read your lesson one way or the other.  How would one get started working in your industry?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zfxgx/iama_former_senior_staffer_to_a_member_of/cftcva0?context=5)|In lobbying, work on the hill.  People talk a lot about the revolving door (although I would argue that returning to the hill, then to lobbying, ad infinitum, is the revolving door), but lobbyist are paid because they understand the process of policy making, and it is hard to gain that knowledge without firsthand experience.  
[In divided government and as a minority party member, is the focus more on shaping public opinion rather than policy making?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zfxgx/iama_former_senior_staffer_to_a_member_of/cftb5qj?context=5)|In a divided government, everyone is in the minority.  Holding one chamber still means you are sending legislation over to another chamber to die.  So yes, I think people take votes on bullshit bills they know are going nowhere simply to message to their base.  It's the absolute worst part about working on the hill right now, and is 95% of why I quit. 
[Disagree, taking votes gets people on the record and draws distinctions between the two sides, giving constituents a clearer choice.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zfxgx/iama_former_senior_staffer_to_a_member_of/cftbq2z?context=5)|Right, I agree in principle, but they are taking votes on legislation they love to have fights over but that very few of them would ever vote for if they thought it had a chance at passing. 
[In your opinion, how can we eliminate/limit corporate greed playing a role in who gets elected and how those representatives vote? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zfxgx/iama_former_senior_staffer_to_a_member_of/cftaxao?context=5)|I don't have a solid answer on this.  While I can see how it affected the process day to day, I don't have a policy background on the issue.
 |1) Limit campaigns to 16 weeks.
 |2) Public financing of elections.
 |3) Open primaries with instant runoff ballots.
[I'm surprised to see these kind of suggestions (particularly the first two\) from an insider.  How do you see public financing work? Does every candidate get money? Is there a signature threshold that must be reached? Is 16 weeks for all levels of government?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zfxgx/iama_former_senior_staffer_to_a_member_of/cftkeld?context=5)|To be honest, I am not super versed on electoral policy.  I have read proposals I really like, but I don't have any specifics to point to without doing some reading first. 
[Why are the oldest, most technophobic, out of touch members of society able to dictate sweeping laws in fields they have absolutely no area of expertise in? Why are old white men who got useless degrees 40 years ago making laws on bleeding-edge medical breakthroughs, internet protocol, communication standards, etc? How often do you think ""good god my boss is a moron""?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zfxgx/iama_former_senior_staffer_to_a_member_of/cftha0i?context=5)|I respect both of my former bosses, but they were old enough to be out of touch with modern technology.  Some older members are SUPER in touch.  It's weird how it lands on some and not others.  It's one of the most frustrating things on earth, having people who have no idea what they are talking about shaping particular policies.  Like when a room full of men hold a hearing on abortion with all male witnesses.  Way to go, Congress!
[Do you find Chuck Schumer's flip phone as funny as I do?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zfxgx/iama_former_senior_staffer_to_a_member_of/cftjv50?context=5)|Does he have a flip phone? That's terrifying. 
[How much does a House staffer get paid?  How often can that change?  Does upward mobility imply jumping ship to either lobbying or a Senator's staff?  What makes a successful staffer?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zfxgx/iama_former_senior_staffer_to_a_member_of/cftb690?context=5)|Congressional salaries are publicly disclosed.  If I recall correctly, average pay for a senior policy staffer are in the high 50s.  
[Chosen at random, Rep. David Scott \(D-GA\\) has an LD that's on track to make $80k. Plenty make more than that.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zfxgx/iama_former_senior_staffer_to_a_member_of/cftdh46?context=5)|I don't doubt it.  I never looked at other staffer's salary because it was too disheartening to know how little I was paid.  
[I am interested in changing the election process itself, specifically by enacting Approval Voting.  There are reams of evidence that this reform can improve governance, specifically help both incumbents (by avoiding the Spoiler Effect\) and voters (by letting them always vote for their honest favorite\). Do you have any advice in how to convince members of Congress that something relatively esoteric like voting systems is worth their time?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zfxgx/iama_former_senior_staffer_to_a_member_of/cftby71?context=5)|Sadly, I don't.  I am a huge believer in open primaries and instant runoff voting, but I think it just has to come from the local level and move up.  Change on that level is unlikely to come from the top down. 
[Thanks for the response.   Knowing there are people involved in Congress at any level who are aware of these issues gives me hope.  If you have a minute, I'd like to try and convince you that Approval Voting is better than Instant Runoff Voting.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zfxgx/iama_former_senior_staffer_to_a_member_of/cftcakc?context=5)|Awesome. Bookmarking the link now!
[Maybe you could require larval politicians to pass a citizenship test. That might weed out the Michele Bachmans and other airheads from running. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zfxgx/iama_former_senior_staffer_to_a_member_of/cftk0mj?context=5)|If stupid people want to elect stupid politicians to represent their stupid beliefs, thats the system we have and have to live with. For better or worse. 
[Spoken like someone who doesn't have that witch campaigning in your back yard. ;\)  Oh wait, you said you were from Virginia? Meh, you got plenty. :D ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zfxgx/iama_former_senior_staffer_to_a_member_of/cftkbht?context=5)|Not from VA.  West Coast.  Sorry to hear it, but she'll be gone in months!  I do think its sad that the electoral process rewards people like her in the primaries.  An open primary with instant runoff ballots would probably prevent her from making it through to a general. 
[1\) Did/do you enjoy a career in the political arena in general?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zfxgx/iama_former_senior_staffer_to_a_member_of/cftcnoc?context=5)|1) No. Not really. It's frustrating working in a career field where people believe they have total carte blanche to attack you personally for working in (as is entirely evident by some people in this AMA).
[Thanks for taking the time to answer.  I was hoping you'd say Hong Kong or Australia.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zfxgx/iama_former_senior_staffer_to_a_member_of/cftcx4w?context=5)|I literally know nothing about either government.  I am not a smart man =P.
[Sure you are! I don't know much about either as well.  I mentioned them b/c they are extremely economically free. I support the free market, that's all. :\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zfxgx/iama_former_senior_staffer_to_a_member_of/cftdamu?context=5)|Obviously the US could stand to learn a lot of lessons from our friends overseas.  We are slipping in almost every measure.  Unfortunately, I think that will have to come from the energy of Americans on the ground growing tired of how stacked the system is against individuals.  While there are many members of Congress who support good ideals and put their names behind it, its the minority.  
[You mentioned infrastructure investments. Can you be more specific? Roads &amp; bridges? Fiber optic networks? Gas and water lines? ETC...](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zfxgx/iama_former_senior_staffer_to_a_member_of/cftax4m?context=5)|Roads and bridges.  =)
[How scared should we be about driving over these crumbling bridges in this country?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zfxgx/iama_former_senior_staffer_to_a_member_of/cftbfy1?context=5)|REALLY fucking scared.
 |[Link to www.infrastructurereportcard.org](http://www.infrastructurereportcard.org)
 |Like...terrified.  
[That's kinda what I expected and yes I'm terrified every time I pass under a bridge here and see that orange spray paint circling a big chunk of concrete missing or a big crack in a bridge.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zfxgx/iama_former_senior_staffer_to_a_member_of/cftbr5f?context=5)|I legitimately wish I had a better answer for you!  Actually, there is good news. That D+ *is* an improvement over the previous grade!
[Any idea what the appetite for new infrastructure to relieve congestion in our biggest cities is? Do you see real change in federal budgeting or major projects likely to be approved?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zfxgx/iama_former_senior_staffer_to_a_member_of/cfth9d9?context=5)|Internet I know absolutely nothing about.
[Also, same question for internet (FCC? Google Fiber? net neutrality?\)and waterways (WRRDA\) if you have any insight.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zfxgx/iama_former_senior_staffer_to_a_member_of/cfth9d9?context=5)|There is a HUGE appetite for new infrastructure but the highway trust fund, which funds most federal-aid highway and transit projects in this country, is nearly bankrupt and there's not a huge appetite in this congress to find a way to fix it.  We'll see how that goes in August.  
[You'd think someone would do a study to show that new/wider/better roads and public transit would save more money in the long run (less time and fuel wasted\). Then someone would translate that into plain english so a politician would both understand and believe it. Am i describing your job?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zfxgx/iama_former_senior_staffer_to_a_member_of/cfthki5?context=5)|Kindof.  It's not a question of whether or not safer roads and transit improve public health. It's an ideological question as to whether or not the federal government should help foot the bill for it. 
[What was the most comprehensive piece of legislation you worked? Do you think current bills have gotten out of hand in terms of length and the number of amendments added?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zfxgx/iama_former_senior_staffer_to_a_member_of/cfte6jf?context=5)|Amendments, yes. With so called ""must pass"" bills, there are so many non germane amendments attached for various reasons. And often times members will attach ""poison pill"" amendments to kill legislation they are opposed to or to gum up the process.
 |I don't think bills are ""too long"" as many people charge.  Amending or updating the us code is not always simple and sometimes requires long lists of technical corrections, insertions, and amendments. It's also worth noting that bill text fits in incredibly narrow margins. A 2000 page bill, in reality, is maybe a 10th of that.
 |I've authored several bills. Nothing over 60 pages. Mostly basic adjustments to existing policy. No appropriations or increased budget authority on any of them.
[My god, thank you for explaining what legislative text looks like on the page.  I get so tired of the ""there's no way they had time to read that!"" argument.  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zfxgx/iama_former_senior_staffer_to_a_member_of/cfu7am7?context=5)|To be sure, NO members read bills.  That's not an objective statement of fact but I'm almost positive. Staff and committee staff do though, and that counts for something.
[In general, how much of a members' vote is based on direction from leadership (""we want you to vote yes/no""\) vs. other factors (constituents' preference, member's own personal conviction, lobbyist's desires\)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zfxgx/iama_former_senior_staffer_to_a_member_of/cfta4i4?context=5)|It depends on the member and the vote.  Before votes are called, the whips office sends out an email blast to all of the staffers with vote recommendations unless the issue is highly controversial among the party (keystone, for example).
 |My bosses generally voted with leadership, but not specifically because leadership advised us to. We have also voted against leadership on some key votes.  When that happens it is generally either driven by completely different ideological positions on one specific issue or because *cough* lobbyists *cough*. 
[Can you elaborate on the last bit? Do lobbyists legitimately convince your boss to change a vote on it's merits? Is it because they need the campaign cash? Somewhere in between?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zfxgx/iama_former_senior_staffer_to_a_member_of/cfth5dt?context=5)|Let's say a vote is coming up on a bill that democrats generally favor to give greater labor rights to toll booth workers.  But we haven't heard a word from the toll booth workers, so we assume they aren't in our district, and we HAVE heard from the highway authority who arent opposed to the bill in principle, but they are worried that the way its worded could have unintended financial effects, and they ask us to vote for it.  Way may normally vote with leadership, but because of who we heard from on the issue, we might decide to buck them.  Particularly if the highway authority has been a strong partner in the past.  
[Why not vote based on what is the objectively better choice? Who cares what the Highway Authority has to say, they clearly only care about saving money. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zfxgx/iama_former_senior_staffer_to_a_member_of/cfthp8j?context=5)|It may be the better choice.  I just made that up.  But ""the better choice"" is not an objective measurement.  
[What kind of educational background and prior work experience do you have, and is your background typical of congressional staffers?  Regarding the legislator you worked for: How was their personality compared to the image that the general public sees? Did they seem to believe in what they were doing?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zfxgx/iama_former_senior_staffer_to_a_member_of/cftaubi?context=5)|1) I have a bachelors degree in political science. Almost everyone on the hill has a bachelors degree in political science. (Which is kindof a bullshit thing, in my opinion, but there you go). Lots of lawyers.  Lots of grad students with degrees in public admin and public policy and foreign affairs.  I have background in international development, which was entirely unrelated to my policy portfolio, and rural development in the U.S., also unrelated to my policy portfolio.
 |2)  I liked both of my bosses a lot as people.  I think the process is totally fucked and makes people do things they don't believe in from time to time.  From our election and campaign financing laws to how ineffective our news media is at holding people accountable.  I could talk a lot more about this subject. 
[Has your experience made you more or less likely to consider running for office?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zfxgx/iama_former_senior_staffer_to_a_member_of/cftcqlc?context=5)|I have literally never considered running for office.  I am a painfully introverted policy geek, not an a-type politics person.
 |But lets pretend I wanted to run before working on the hill. I wouldn't now. 
[What did you major in?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zfxgx/iama_former_senior_staffer_to_a_member_of/cftfqg3?context=5)|Political science with a focus on environmental policy.
[May I ask where you went to college?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zfxgx/iama_former_senior_staffer_to_a_member_of/cftntsl?context=5)|Somewhere very mediocre. Not in the top 90.
[Oh okay. As a high school junior interested in politics (and environmental policy\) you can probably guess why I'm interested. Thanks.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zfxgx/iama_former_senior_staffer_to_a_member_of/cftrmz8?context=5)|If you go to a great school, that's great. Going to Harvard will *probably* get someone to take a second look at your resume before they toss it in the trash.
 |What WILL get you looked at is coming here, working hard as an intern or junior staffer, and having people advocate on your behalf when you start applying to jobs. Happy to answer any questions you have on here or over PM.  
[You say you're a staffer, yet you are upset by personal attacks &amp; misplaced anger?  Shenanigans.  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zfxgx/iama_former_senior_staffer_to_a_member_of/cftga84?context=5)|Honestly, it was such a small part of my experience. Most people I worked with were awesome.
[I envy you that.  I work as senior staff for the TX lege.  A large portion of our job involves dealing with furious constituents asking questions somewhat similar to what you're getting.  I've actually got 2 death threats saved on my voicemail pending investigation.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zfxgx/iama_former_senior_staffer_to_a_member_of/cftgm53?context=5)|It's hard to blame people for being misinformed. I try to be empathetic. The news, aside from the daily show and npr, certainly isn't doing it's job.
[I understand you don't want to be a recipient of anger. However, don't you think you contribute to the problems by engaging in, and profiting from, the system? I've talked with many financial industry people who are nice people with good intentions but they have been so conditioned in believing what they do carries more social utility than it actually does that they're entirely incapable of objective assessment of the value - or even worse, purpose - of their role. I see politicians and those who engage in that spectrum as very similar. They have extremely inflated views of their roles. I'm an engineer and it bothers me intensly to hear politicians - mostly attorneys - talk about STEM careers when they have zero clue on the subject. Zero. When Obama recently said the Dem's are doing ""God's work"" it reminded me of Blankenfein's testimony on Capital Hill where he said exactly the same statement. They're - financial industry and political class (politicians and career political engagers\) - cut from the same cloth. Do you see the similarity?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zfxgx/iama_former_senior_staffer_to_a_member_of/cftdv7x?context=5)|Wait for it...I am not a politician.  I am not your member of Congress. Nobody voted for me. I am not Obama. I do not represent fundraising dollars or donated dollars.
 |And if you think I am profiting from anything, you should come to DC and have a look at my pay stubs from the last 5 years.
 |And as a quick aside, if you don't think you too are engaged in and profiting from a system of corruption, have a look at the tags on your clothes, the pay folks make in retail at the shops you shop at, where your energy comes from, where your food comes from and who produces it.  I am in no more of a moral position as a former staffer than I am as a citizen. 
[Mind the ignorance but I'm from the UK. So what is lobbying and how does the process of lobbying work ?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zfxgx/iama_former_senior_staffer_to_a_member_of/cftgwnn?context=5)|Lobbying is petitioning the government to take, or not take some specific action.  Anyone can lobby their member of Congress simply by advocating for some position.  But a professional lobbyist is someone who has connections to the legislature or administration, understands the process intimately, and can help give people a footprint in government.
 |As an example, lets say business X in ohio finds out the government is going to require a product be used for some reason (I don't have a great example here. How about industrial diamonds?) and they happen to produce industrial diamonds.  But china produces them for less money.  So they may hire a lobbyist to come in and say ""great idea, but can we slap a make it in america provision on that?""  In theory that will make them far more competitive, so its worth the money they spent to hire that lobbyist. 
[I'm currently interning on a congressional level (remedial office/constituent work\) and working in my statehouse (same type\) as a senior in college. I'd be interested in your basic credentials. Degree, previous experience etc. but I'd also like to hear what you have to say as far as the intangibles and strategies for breaking into the job market go. Of course connections make a difference but I work with a lot of people that picked their guy from the state level and worked 3 sequential campaigns just to get him into Congress, as current and recent graduates.  I don't know whether to take whatever I can get or ""pick my guy"" and work my ass off essentially for free just to get him and myself a job. What have you found works best for you? What do you think naturally sets you apart and what are some things anyone can improve on?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zfxgx/iama_former_senior_staffer_to_a_member_of/cftl3xz?context=5)|1) There are *no* remedial jobs.  Don't speak about yourself or your work like that to anyone.  Are you answering calls? Great, that frees up someone above you to pursue policy initiatives.  Answering constituents? Now they feel like they have a voice in government. It is ALL good work.  2)  Make your own connections.  I didn't have connections when I moved here (my parents dont donate to politics, or work in politics, or have any voice in it.)  But I worked hard, met people, asked for their advice, and followed the best of it.  3) Take what you can get to get your foot in the door.  You can work for a mental slug and still be an incredible staffer.  In fact, lets say you do work for someone less than ideal who other members dont respect. But then they see amazing legislation coming from that office. They KNOW the boss isn't writing it.  Just take what you can get and go kill it.
 |4) Be the best staffer you can.  Meet everyone. Work hard. Don't ass kiss.  Lead from behind when necessary.  
[On a scale of one to ten, ten being maximum corruption and one being completely devoid of all corruption. Where do you personally view Congress in general to be?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zfxgx/iama_former_senior_staffer_to_a_member_of/cfte18z?context=5)|I don't think you can separate Congress from the vague idea of ""the system"" that surrounds it.  I'd say the system is inherently incredibly corrupt when it comes to how power is represented.  The day to day operations of Congress (policy making and voting), maybe 4?  But our campaign finance and election laws? 7 maybe?  Relative to some other countries much better. Relative to Sweden? Not great.
[What is your favorite part about living in DC? I spent a few months their on Internship, and I love the city.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zfxgx/iama_former_senior_staffer_to_a_member_of/cfte2fj?context=5)|Leaving for vacation =P.

What things did you like? Did you feel that it was a competitive environment that made you stretch? Alumni, were you able to find work within the first year of graduating? Where did you find work, if you did? How have your peers fared in the job market? How much was tuition? Are there suitable internships for 2L and 3L students? Are the professors reputable and known outside of the western states area? Etc. Any insights are welcome and much appreciated."

1zgess,1,2014-03-03,A dongle? The hell is a dongle?,[deleted],talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/1zgess/a_dongle_the_hell_is_a_dongle/,"Before I begin this story, I need to preface a few points for you guys so you can properly uh... experience, this situation.

* I am an intern at a local repair store.

* My town is very rural. The techs at the different businesses/schools are all friends and will help each other out if someone has a hefty work load that week. (there's only like 4 certified techs in the entire town.)

* I'm your average intern/college student. Hoody, presentable pants, back pack full of necessary things. A little bit on the hefty side. Kinda clueless and prone to confusion.

* I'm still pretty sure this didn't actually happen. I must've been day dreaming.



The start.

Average day as an intern. Running scans and testing hard drives. Mr.Bossman gets a call from the tech at the highschool. He's been slammed recently with a new computer lab to set up and embroidery printers for the advanced home ec students.

It's early in the morning and we're not too busy today so Mr.Bossman decides to close up shop for a little bit and take his trusty side-kick ActuallyRich for a learning experience. 

Fast forward an hour and a half. I've set up all the wiring for the embroidery printers and now I'm starting to work on installing the appropriate software while Mr.Bossman and the home ec teacher just shoot the wind.

Lunch is getting close. Mr.Bossman decides I'm trustworthy enough to install software by myself without causing some sort of space-time anomaly. Mr.Bossman heads off to grab lunch and miss home ec teacher goes back to her office.

Que the beginning of a strange and embarrassing encounter.

For this software there is no ""company license"" one disk for everything. Each computer(3 of them, 2 printers for each. Don't ask I don't know.) has it's separate cd and cd case. Little did I know, each instance of this software **requires**  a USB security verfication thing when you reboot the computer to verify the software. 

Like I said, don't ask, I don't know. 

Things are going well, all three of the computers have completed the pre-reboot step. Then each computer prompts me for a reboot. I'm the kinda guy that talks to myself while working on a computer. [(duck syndrome)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging) 

""A reboot for printer software? Uh... okay I guess.""

Proceeded to reboot each computer. Each computer starts up fine, and on each computer a window pops up prompting me.

*""Please insert the security dongle.""*

""A dongle? The hell is a dongle...""

I don't currently have internet access so Google is out. I don't carry my A+ book around. Mr.Bossman is picking up lunch. Might as well ask the Home Ec teacher yah? 

I'm an intern. I don't usually work with customers directly. I'm currently on the job. 

***I'M NOT TRAINED FOR THIS!***

So I shuffle over to the office door. Knock three times, as seems the most polite number. She calls me in.

Me: Uh, excuse me. Do you have.... the dongle?

Teacher: Dongle?

Me: Yeah, the computer is asking for a dongle. I thought you might have it. 

Teacher: *sly look* Are you trying to tell me something ActuallyRich?

Me *clueless*: Uh... yeah. The dongle. Need a dongle for the computer.

Teacher: You don't have to play games ActuallyRich. It's okay if you find me attractive.

Me: Uh... uhm... what? I just need the...

Teacher: I think we should maybe talk about this more later. Would you like to go to dinner tomorrow?

Me: Uh... I just want... uhm... the dongle. I uh... I'll just wait for Mr.Bossman to uh.... to get back. I think he uhm... he might... the dongle. The dongle. 

Teacher: The dongle.

Me: Yeah... the dongle.

The following silence. Sweet tap dancing baby Jesus, I didn't know what to do. I just avoided eye contact and sidled out like some socially deprived gray clad crab.

Mr.Bossman explained what a dongle was. Just a USB drive. I know that now. I've learned an important lesson.

I'm also pretty sure miss teacher lady expects me for a date tonight.

We are two american students with internships in London between June and the end of August who are looking for a room or two rooms to rent! I think the person this will work best for is a student who will not be staying in London in the summer. If your room is big enough for 2 girls (we don't mind sharing a bed) or you have a flatmate who will also be leaving, please let me know!


We want to be in zone 1, closer to charing cross station the better, and our total we can spend is 1200pm. (600 per room if there are 2 rooms!)


Thanks for looking! If you know of anyone who's looking to sublet during this time, I can PM you my email!

We would love to live with students because they would be around our age and I think we could have a lot of fun!

1zgl7l,0,2014-03-03,EMSKR How to Know Wether to End-it or Stick-with a Long-term Relationship,mrdude42,everymanshouldknow,https://www.reddit.com/r/everymanshouldknow/comments/1zgl7l/emskr_how_to_know_wether_to_endit_or_stickwith_a/,"I've been in a relationship for almost 4 years now. We both love each other but we've gotten to a point where that may not be enough anymore. We started out great. We had fun. We had a lot of sex. We were happy. But I fucked up early-on and that made her lose some of her trust in me and I've never been able to completely recover. For clarity, lets just call her Diana. I should also mention, we are 8 years apart in age. I’m in my late 20’s and she’s in her early 30’s. 

When Diana and I first met I was just getting out of a 4-5 year relationship with another girl. Lets call her Alison. (i know. i'm a serial monogamist.) I was trying to be a nice guy to Alison (looking back that was a stupid idea) but it seemed to come at the expense of my new relationship I was starting with Diana. She was not liking that my ex was still around in my life. Eventually, Diana and I had a few arguments over Alison still calling me sometimes and so I decided to cut Alison completely out of my life. The problem was this was kind of too-little too-late. There was nothing going on between Alison and I after we broke up but Diana couldn’t understand why I would even still want to be friends with my ex. Even after I cut off ties with Alison, Diana still found a few of Alison’s belongings in my garage on a shelf and she was mad that I didn’t go through and toss everything out. It was hard for me to find everything because Alison and I had been together for so long I didn’t even remember everything I had. Finally, I went through all my stuff and made sure there was nothing. I even deleted all Facebook pictures that had Alison in them and unfriended her on Facebook. It was a complete purge of my ex. Looking back I think I should have done from the get go. So that problem was finally solved but it had left a permanent scar on our relationship.

Fast forward a couple years, we’re doing good. Then I find out I’m not going to be able to graduate college on time. Not even just and extra semester but its going to take probably 3 more years because I had changed schools 3 times and changed my major 4 times. My transcripts were a mess of transfers and classes that didn’t count for my current major. So I had to make the tough decision of dropping out of college. It really sucked. I mean, I’ve never been an A student but I thought I could at least get my degree. Diana was definitely a good student. She graduated a year early from high school, got her bachelors, and then got a masters degree a year early than normal. So when I made the decision to drop out of college she was not happy. I found out more recently that she was also really upset because I had made the decision without talking to her about it yet. So that was another fuck up on my part. 

So I wasn’t in school anymore and I was just working construction with my family business. She moved in with me in a nice condo free of rent because I was managing the whole building so that was a good deal. We lived there for a couple years but she always had wanted to move back to NYC. I always thought about moving to NYC too so eventually she got an offer in NYC so we moved.  Now we’ve been living in NYC for about 6 months and things aren’t too great. We haven’t had sex in over 2 months now. I’m working an low-pay internship and still looking for a full-time job. I’m not writing this because I want to complain or say its all her fault or anything. I just don’t know what to do anymore. I feel like I fucked up a lot by unknowingly being selfish for so long and created all this baggage that she can’t get past. 

Basically, out relationship has degraded over time to where she is the bread-winner in the relationship. I pay 1/4 of the rent every month and take care of utility bills. But she pays the rest of the rent and buys groceries and pays when we go out. She makes a lot more money than me so thats just how it ended up. Also, I feel like our age difference is an issue that she can’t get past. She always brings up how I’m so young and so now our relationship has turned into her feeling like a mother figure while I feel like she treats me like a child. And I don’t blame her for that because I feel like in the beginning of our relationship I was like a child. I’ve grown so much being with her because she pointed out a lot of my flaws that I was oblivious too before. Like my lack of ability to communicate my feelings and my passive aggressiveness I got from my family be so passive aggressive. I much more aware of how I treat others and her especially but I wonder if it is too late now. I was so ignorant before of how I was hurting our relationship by making important decisions with out even talking to her about them and by starting a lot of things and not finishing them. Like dropping out of school, not finishing a few projects I said I would, and still not having a good full-time job. I’ve been really trying now for the past couple weeks after we had our last big fight. We almost broke up but we didn’t.

Part of me wonders if I haven’t left because I have no where to go in NYC. All my friends and family are 3,000 miles away. I don’t think that’s the case though. I’ve actually done the math to figure out if I could survive being homeless for a while until I find a job in the city to support myself. I know some of my new friends and coworkers would let me crash at their place for a while too. It’s just a matter of figuring out if this relationship is repairable of if I’m just kicking a dead horse. I love her very very much and I know she loves me. She stayed with me even when she wasn’t happy because she thought I would change but unfortunately I didn’t realize she was so unhappy until now and now she’s tired of it. She complains that I only noticed because we stopped having sex. And that’s true, I thought we were ok until we started having less and less sex. 

To be honest, the last 2 weeks have gotten better since I decided I was going to change. Now that I’m aware of what was making her so unhappy. I’m being more motivated. I’ve gone to several job interviews. I’m being more thoughtful and trying to make her feel special with little things, and I’ve stopped bothering her about sex. If she wants to come to me then that’s cool but I’m not going to bug her about our lack of sex for the time being. I’m trying to be patient. I just wish I was aware of this much earlier. That I wasn’t such a dumb kid just a few years ago.

This ended up being way longer than I thought it was going to be so I’ll stop here. I just don’t know what to do. What do you think?"

[Also, bloody floors and haunted warehouses?? Please elaborate!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zg35f/iama_past_intern_for_american_apparel_and_ive/cftcg4y?context=5)|I was in the IT Dept.  Bloody floors: some guy in the factory was sick one day and he started to throw up blood. He walked all the way across the factory while throwing up, so that whole pathway had blood all over it. All of the sewing workers were screaming and running away, because they were scared. It was intense  Warehouses: They have a basement below one of the warehouses and security guards constantly quit their job because they report seeing a girl with no head during their night shift. The basement is creepy by itself, for example there is a room that was shut off with hinges on both sides, and chains to keep it closed. We went into it, and there was a red rug with baby dolls aligned in a circle. It looked like some straight up cult shit haha.
[Srsly wtf.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zg35f/iama_past_intern_for_american_apparel_and_ive/cftht69?context=5)|I have no goddamn idea. When I initially saw the door, I just thought: ""Oh hell no. That shit is weird."" Me and one other guy were the first ones that had gone into that room for a while, because no one wanted to open it and go inside.
[Where did that room come from? just left behind from previous owners?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zg35f/iama_past_intern_for_american_apparel_and_ive/cftht69?context=5)|It looked like this but with chains and door hinges on both right and left sides:  [Link to www.polyvore.com](http://www.polyvore.com/cgi/img-thing?.out=jpg&amp;size=l&amp;tid=24176156)
[Where do i sign up.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zg35f/iama_past_intern_for_american_apparel_and_ive/cftkg8a?context=5)|Haha, are you ready to join the Scooby Doo team?
[What's with the image shift of the company? I think I bought my first AA hoodie something like 7 years ago and back then, the advertising was much more tame..the quality of the clothing was also higher.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zg35f/iama_past_intern_for_american_apparel_and_ive/cftd396?context=5)|Well, thats what Dov (the founder) wants because, mostly, hes a pervert. I don't know why the quality of the clothes went down, but im guessing it is because the company has been in decline due to its lack of control. Dov really wants to control everything.
[American Apparel: Overpriced Spandex or genuinely good company?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zg35f/iama_past_intern_for_american_apparel_and_ive/cftbvw0?context=5)|Alright, this made me laugh. Its a terrible company. Flawed in a million different ways. But I wouldn't say anything is overpriced. The company is just chock full of weird ass people that are, most of the time, not entirely smart. (Not including the IT Dept., they are smart. Real smart.)
[Well, at least the clothes are made in the USA, which is exceptionally rare.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zg35f/iama_past_intern_for_american_apparel_and_ive/cftg9h9?context=5)|Thats true. I really like how they hire not-so-fortunate people, and actually give them a chance to make their lives into something. Given that they get paid lots more than other clothing producers.
[*Flawed in a million different ways.*  What's the biggest or most interesting way it's flawed?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zg35f/iama_past_intern_for_american_apparel_and_ive/cftieqi?context=5)|Well, when the CTO left (the person that brought up web sales a ton), Dov tried to take over the web portion of AA, and web sales plunged about 75%. He was saying, ""oh, I can do it better, just watch."" Then he made himself look like a fool. It was actually pretty amusing. So, I would say Dov is one of the largest flaws, but at the same time, he runs the company like no one else could. Its a really weird thing to see.
[Can you elaborate on a description of these ""not so fortunate people? Are they people with criminal histories? unemployed? homeless? bad credit?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zg35f/iama_past_intern_for_american_apparel_and_ive/cftgsvc?context=5)|Homeless, recent immigrants (lots of the time illegal), and unemployed.
 |Now, let me clarify something here before people get all upset. AA doesn't hire illegal immigrants with the knowledge that they are illegal. Many of them turn in fake papers, and lie about who they are. A lot of companies have this problem. At one point, I worked with the company to fish out the illegal papers, and to find these people. AA always fires them, because it is illegal to employ them. Just clearing something up :)
[What bad decisions did Dov make that swung web sales so greatly in such a short time?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zg35f/iama_past_intern_for_american_apparel_and_ive/cftkq7o?context=5)|Specifically, im not sure because I had left the company by that time. But my previous co workers were telling me that he just couldnt manage the people that were on it. The team needs management, and when they didnt get it, the whole thing just collapsed. His methods of ""managing"" were yelling at people and telling them to ""get shit done"", making everyone stressed because they had to meet ridiculous deadlines. It was all sorts of bad.
[I almost forgot--thanks for doing the AmA.  Reading through it, I picture an adventurous IT intern sneaking off to the basement with an innocuous messenger bag, filled with 3 days worth of food, a flashlight, sleeping bag, and night vision goggles.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zg35f/iama_past_intern_for_american_apparel_and_ive/cftgzu3?context=5)|Haha! Thats funny, because I actually went down there with my laptop bag full of snacks from the vending machine, and a flashlight on my phone. You pictured it very well! I was telling the guys around the office: ""does ANYONE want to go down there with me"" and they were all like: ""its too creepy"", so I just went down by myself! I wish I had NV Goggles, that would be so awesome.
[For my next question i would like to ask - are these said employees receiving a wage comparable to other employees? For conversations sake can you answer the question in regards to other AA employees as well as employees of any similar/competing companies? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zg35f/iama_past_intern_for_american_apparel_and_ive/cfth7hh?context=5)|Well, the AA workers that produce the clothes make a set wage, and then on top of that, they get paid extra for however many clothes they make. The set wage is a bit over minimum wage. (I believe it was around $11 per hour). Now, as an intern I was paid $10 an hour, so in comparison, they made more money than I did, and they make more money than most clothing producers than any other company. Dov is a really great guy to the workers who make the clothes, and his generosity shows.

[""Give ya a dollar if you spend a whole night down there.""  I picture it playing out like an episode of Scooby Doo.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zg35f/iama_past_intern_for_american_apparel_and_ive/cfth6q7?context=5)|Who would be the guy that takes the monster mask off at the end? haha.
[Thanks for the answer. It's something ive wondered from time to time.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zg35f/iama_past_intern_for_american_apparel_and_ive/cfths44?context=5)|Of course! It really is an incredible company.
[You would have to simultaneously be Fred, Shaggy, Scooby, Daphne, and Velma.  Scrappy is your call.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zg35f/iama_past_intern_for_american_apparel_and_ive/cfthdj4?context=5)|Oh damn. Thats a tough job, but im sure we could catch the bad guy then.
[Have you seen the album? Can you take some pics of it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zg35f/iama_past_intern_for_american_apparel_and_ive/cftgbfh?context=5)|I cant take pictures of it, because he hides it somewhere. A lot of my co-workers have seen it though. They are all 100% sure that its real. Hes just a really really weird guy. And also, Im not really willing to see that sort of stuff anyways. 
[Are you sure they weren't all just giving you a hard time?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zg35f/iama_past_intern_for_american_apparel_and_ive/cfth79p?context=5)|Yeah, I'm positive. Because I'm related to one of these employees. (not going into the relationship between me and the employee)
[Did you get the job because you were related to that employee?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zg35f/iama_past_intern_for_american_apparel_and_ive/cftkbw6?context=5)|Not really. I still had to go through all of the interviews and testing. I wouldn't have been hired if I didn't show that I was a value to the team.
[Is it true that AA owns a hotel room in each city with an AA store where executives do drugs and screw the employees?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zg35f/iama_past_intern_for_american_apparel_and_ive/cftezm5?context=5)|Yes and no. They do have hotel rooms and business apartments in many cities, but the executives dont screw employees or do drugs. If any employee is under the suspicion that they are doing drugs, then they have to take a drug test. BUT, as for Dov, he probably has sex with a lot of employees. Hence all of his sexual harassment lawsuits. I doubt he does drugs too.
[What was your favorite/least favorite memory of working at American Apparel?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zg35f/iama_past_intern_for_american_apparel_and_ive/cftcwxl?context=5)|My favorite memory was working with the IT Dept. They are funny and welcoming (nerf gun wars, pranks, etc.). But I cant say that I have a least favorite memory from working there. I can tell you that Dov yells at just about everyone. He makes people cry, and all that junk. Hes just greedy, and wants everything his way basically.
[You seem to have a very mixed view and opinion of Dov. Earlier you said he was a genuine and generous person, whereas now you say he's greedy. Is there a special reason for this?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zg35f/iama_past_intern_for_american_apparel_and_ive/cftkk1i?context=5)|Yeah, it is *really* hard to label him. People call him a ""Greedy Jew"", and I agree (with no offense to Jews, he is just Jewish). But, on the other hand, he supports gay rights, and went on campaigns to support it, he hires unfortunate people, and he tries to support immigration reforms. He is a great man. I cant begin to tell you how hard it is to explain him, he is just *weird*. 
[Are you still an AA customer? Would you advise to buy from them as opposed to their competitors?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zg35f/iama_past_intern_for_american_apparel_and_ive/cftd7qo?context=5)|I still love their stuff! I think its great. But, there are better places to buy clothes too. Such as Urban Outfitters. Basically the same style of clothing, but without sexual ads and a crazy owner. haha.
[But are Urban Outfitters clothes made in the States?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zg35f/iama_past_intern_for_american_apparel_and_ive/cftgap9?context=5)|I dont think they are. American Apparel is one of the last. There are a couple of companies that do, but they aren't as large as AA.
[Urban outfitters is shitty quality and super overpriced. That's my opinion anyway. And the style is like going to a thrift store without thrift store prices. Stupid. Not you, just urban. Sorry for being kind of randomly rude I just really don't like that store/company! ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zg35f/iama_past_intern_for_american_apparel_and_ive/cftkb5h?context=5)|Yeah, I guess its sort of you like it or you don't. You know? I haven't gotten many clothes from them, so you might be more qualified than me on them, but from what I see from the outside, they seem pretty similar.
[Could you give em their names please.  I know New Balance makes their socks and 1/3 of thier shoes in the USA.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zg35f/iama_past_intern_for_american_apparel_and_ive/cftjjsn?context=5)|I don't know any big names off of the top of my head. It is probably pretty easy to search up.
[It might be different for different stores. There's an AA and urban just blocks from each other in university city and they are pretty different. I like a lot of Urbans style but there's always something wrong with the quality or fit for me, I'm also a girl so I can't speak for the men's clothing.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zg35f/iama_past_intern_for_american_apparel_and_ive/cftl85p?context=5)|Urban and AA are usually always pretty close together (store wise). The womens clothes seem, like, loose and laid back. I'm not sure on how women's clothes fit, but I don't find a problem with what I have for men's :)
[What's the weirdest experience you had while working there?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zg35f/iama_past_intern_for_american_apparel_and_ive/cftcl08?context=5)|The basement for sure. I responded to someone elses question about it. Those basements, man. Creepy. Most employees don't want to go down there anymore.
[Can you elaborate?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zg35f/iama_past_intern_for_american_apparel_and_ive/cftd9av?context=5)|They dont want to go down there because its reported that there is a little girl running around without a head. Lights flicker, and rooms are locked up with chains, and boards that are nailed to it. Also! There are lots of mannequins down there, including baby ones that just creep you out. I dont know how to explain it.
[*They dont want to go down there because its reported that there is a little girl running around without a head.*  What the hell are you talking about? Are you high?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zg35f/iama_past_intern_for_american_apparel_and_ive/cftdsgr?context=5)|A ghost. Not a real girl. I'm sure the police would have been there by now if she were real hah.
[If it was a real ghost wouldn't the ghost police have been there?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zg35f/iama_past_intern_for_american_apparel_and_ive/cftfbz0?context=5)|Im surprised that there hasnt been a ghost busters joke yet. But who knows if the ghost police were there or not. Im sure we could ask the Ghost Hunter guys to find them haha. 
[Spoiler alert: ghosts aren't real.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zg35f/iama_past_intern_for_american_apparel_and_ive/cfth0oe?context=5)|:0.
[Next week on Supernatural, Sam and Dean face the inner chambers of American Apparel.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zg35f/iama_past_intern_for_american_apparel_and_ive/cftieoe?context=5)|Oh god. I would love to watch that, I feel like it would be pretty damn funny.
[I've been looking to alternatives to AA for a long time and haven't found any -- are there any you would suggest? Is there any talk within AA about the competition, or is there simply no one?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zg35f/iama_past_intern_for_american_apparel_and_ive/cftdu9m?context=5)|There is really no talk of competition within the company. And as for alternatives: AA is known for a lot of basic designs, like plain t shirts. But you really can't find plain t shirts of that quality anywhere else.
[Yes, sadly i have found that to be the case. The closest people have told me were canvas/bella shirts but their non-sweatshop status is dubious.  Do you think the company would do better without Dov in charge? In other words is this a profitable business model without a maniac control freak at the helm?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zg35f/iama_past_intern_for_american_apparel_and_ive/cftedhq?context=5)|The company would burn to the ground if Dov wasn't in control. No one can run his company better than he does. Dov is a really good business man, but on the other hand he's terrible. It is extremely difficult to label this man. I don't know how else to put it.
[You a 50/50 or tri-blend type of gal?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zg35f/iama_past_intern_for_american_apparel_and_ive/cftfr8h?context=5)|If you read the top, I said I'm a man lmao. But I like tri-blend. It feels like fucking heaven.
[Sorry about that..forgot that detail as I worked down the thread before I posted.  Tri-blend is the tops I agree, despite the strength of the necklines beginning to decline 2010-present, it still fits great and you get 40+ washes out of them easily.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zg35f/iama_past_intern_for_american_apparel_and_ive/cftgb2l?context=5)|Oh yeah. They are just the softest of the softest. I adore those things.
[Is it true he wanted photos of all his employees and fired the ugly ones?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zg35f/iama_past_intern_for_american_apparel_and_ive/cftgnli?context=5)|I'm assuming you mean ""fired"", but no. He doesn't ask employees for photos. Now, there is a rumor that he hires only good looking guys and gals for the retail stores, which I believe because they are, for the most part, not the brightest (no offense to the smart ones, if you're reading. There are plenty of smart retail people). 
[They took my picture to send to hq with my resume when i applied at my local store.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zg35f/iama_past_intern_for_american_apparel_and_ive/cfthxy2?context=5)|Probably for your ID badge, or account info.
[Why would they need that when i applied? they didnt hire me btw.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zg35f/iama_past_intern_for_american_apparel_and_ive/cfti1ip?context=5)|Im not sure. I interned for the IT Dept, Im not sure what they needed it for. 
[They only hire people who look the part. the picture is for whoever is in charge to decide if i look enough like one of the models in the ads. im not ugly or fat, but im not a hipster so i wasnt even given an interview. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zg35f/iama_past_intern_for_american_apparel_and_ive/cftiol0?context=5)|Well, im sure its not completely based on that. Its definitely not like that for the warehouses, that must be retail stores only. But, you know, Abercrombie and Fitch are just about the same. Im positive they do it too, and they arent the only ones. I probably wouldnt get hired to an AA retail store either, and Abercrombie for that matter.
[Any insight into why the clothes aren't made very well anymore? Seems like half the stuff in the store will have hems or sleeves that are sewn crooked. Do they just not give a shit about QC? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zg35f/iama_past_intern_for_american_apparel_and_ive/cftc2f5?context=5)|Well, I'm not sure about that. The only thing I could possibly suggest, is that the workers are paid by how many items they produce. So, the more they make, the more money they get. I'm sure this causes them to get a bit sloppy at times from speed sewing haha. 
[Why were you an intern for 2 yrs? That seems very long to me.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zg35f/iama_past_intern_for_american_apparel_and_ive/cftgb1z?context=5)|Well, I'm not out of high school yet. I had just gotten the opportunity to work there to make some money on the side.
[Former Online Store Customer Service Rep here, just wanted to say hi!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zg35f/iama_past_intern_for_american_apparel_and_ive/cfthfwj?context=5)|Hi! I was paid ($10 per hour) I usually worked 10-12 hours a day, but they let me work when I wanted, and from home, if I completed the work they assigned me of course.
[My questions: Were you paid? and why did the online store crash ALL THE TIME?!?! ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zg35f/iama_past_intern_for_american_apparel_and_ive/cfthfwj?context=5)|The online store USED to crash a lot more because our maintenance guy would not keep the server room cold, so it would get real hot. But, they have that fixed now. The site crashes frequently, probably because we were pushing out the new website, and there were kinks and bugs that needed to be fixed that werent caught in the QA stage. (My best guess. I dont work there anymore, so I couldnt tell you why it still is crashing, if it is)
[That sounds terrifying!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zg35f/iama_past_intern_for_american_apparel_and_ive/cftg1mp?context=5)|[Link to la.racked.com](http://la.racked.com/uploads/AmericanApparelToyFactory_2013_1.jpe) Part of the mannequin warehouse.
[Also, do you know the ghost story behind the girl running around without a head? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zg35f/iama_past_intern_for_american_apparel_and_ive/cftg1mp?context=5)|Im not sure if anyone knows the story, really. There is always a security guard that watches the entrance to the basement, and whenever I go down there, they always are like: ""Be careful, that place is scary"" or something along those lines. Im not one to be terrified of ghosts, nor have I actually seen the little girl (because she is only seen during the night when the guards patrol the basement) but just the size of that massive basement is breathtaking, its so open, cold, and dark. With the exception of a couple of flickering lights. I havent seen one part of the basement, and I actually refuse to go down it, because its all the way at the very end, and you go through this doorway, and you turn right. When you turn right, you find yourself looking down this real creepy hall, and im telling it looks like its straight out of a horror movie (like a murderers lair), and as you look down the hall you can see some moonlight shining through the grates that are a part of the street above. At the end of the hall there is a chain linked fence that stops you from going any further, but on the other side of it theres just a wooden chair in a open room. It creeps me the hell out haha.
[Oh hell no ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zg35f/iama_past_intern_for_american_apparel_and_ive/cftgeol?context=5)|I had a couple pictures on my old phone of the whole basement, but im not sure where theyre at. If I find them, I'll post them.
[Any idea why the models on their ads sometimes look like they really don't want to be there?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zg35f/iama_past_intern_for_american_apparel_and_ive/cftcr7i?context=5)|Well, a lot of photos are taken casually. AA selects pictures that have the casual look, and you're right, maybe some of the people that are in the photos really don't want to be there at that moment. But mostly, its just casual photos. 
[What are your thoughts on thigh high tube socks and thong leotards?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zg35f/iama_past_intern_for_american_apparel_and_ive/cftj8ti?context=5)|Well, if I were a girl I would wear thigh high socks, because, honestly, they look pretty damn comfortable. Thong leotards: I don't even know what to say. I wouldn't tell my girlfriend to get one, but I think they are alright. I have nothing against them, they're just different.
 |Why do you ask?
[The socks because they look awesome lol, and I wonder if they're comfortable.  The thing leotard because how the hell does someone think of that and who wears that lolz.  I guess someone must be buying it though?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zg35f/iama_past_intern_for_american_apparel_and_ive/cftjknq?context=5)|Yeah, I guess people buy those. The socks are very comfortable. I've tried the knee high ones on before, just to see how they feel and they are pretty nice socks. 
[Lol should have went for the thigh highs.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zg35f/iama_past_intern_for_american_apparel_and_ive/cftjy6h?context=5)|Well, I wouldn't wear them. The only occasion I would even wear knee high sicks is if I went snowboarding or something involving the snow haha. 
[Is everything made in the US still? Labels and advertising can lie and I really like the idea that all AA stuff is made in the US.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zg35f/iama_past_intern_for_american_apparel_and_ive/cfthp0m?context=5)|100% of it is made in the US. Absolutely every clothing item.
[I've heard things about the owner. What kind of practices and policies has he developed at the company that assist his creepy ways. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zg35f/iama_past_intern_for_american_apparel_and_ive/cftbs71?context=5)|Well actually, he's not as bad as the media makes him out to be. For example, the HQ is right around the corner from skid row, and he would go out there and employ a lot of homeless people. But, the creepy side of him, is that he dates a lot of employees, which creates a ton of drama within the company.
[Haunted warehouses. Tell me more.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zg35f/iama_past_intern_for_american_apparel_and_ive/cftfq6l?context=5)|I mentioned one of the warehouses earlier in the thread: 
 |&gt;Warehouses: They have a basement below one of the warehouses and security guards constantly quit their job because they report seeing a girl with no head during their night shift. The basement is creepy by itself, for example there is a room that was shut off with hinges on both sides, and chains to keep it closed. We went into it, and there was a red rug with baby dolls aligned in a circle. It looked like some straight up cult shit haha.
 |But there is another one thats not haunted but it gives me the creeps. AA's mannequin warehouse (yes a warehouse to store the thousands of mannequins that they bought) is pretty god damn creepy because there is row after row of mannequins (sort of like the terracotta army in China.) The funny thing is, no one really works at that warehouse (maybe about 10-15 people) so it seems empty. There are mounds of baby mannequins piled up on top of each other without limbs. (that I found funny) But, overall that place is just filled with echoing noises and lifeless mannequins. I always think I see one moving in the corner of my eye, but its kind of bound to happen when there are that many around you.
[Uniqlo.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zg35f/iama_past_intern_for_american_apparel_and_ive/cfte1vz?context=5)|Yeah. I agree with you. How is the quality of their clothes? I've never tried to get anything from them before.

Work, school stress, and other personal issues kept me from creating anything meaningful as a side project during my final semesters of CS undergrad.

I've been trying to teach myself new things and work on new ideas at home over the past several months, but responsibilities and other distractions in my personal life, as well as fatigue from spending too much free time (in addition to my 8 hour work days) also on a computer, have all really put a damper on my efforts. 

I often dream about what I could accomplish if I could free up those 40 hours per week, if only for a few weeks. I just wanted to see if any one has done  this here for any of their ideas, and how it worked out."

1zh60u,2,2014-03-03,Will you just shut the fuck up for a little bit and give me a little peace!!!,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1zh60u/will_you_just_shut_the_fuck_up_for_a_little_bit/,"You are probably the most annoying, self-important bitch I've ever known.  You try to control any little thing that has the tiniest importance in anything.  So, I'm trying to figure out everything for my summer internship this summer.  I'm trying to get one in a pharmacy, and have to get the pharmacist to sign some papers from my university to get everything to work out.  I was gonna call either today or tomorrow to set up an appointment, but knowing that it's the first weekday of the month (generally the busiest day for a pharmacy) I knew the pharmacist would be really busy, so I was going to call a little later, after everything died down.  My mom has just been like, ""why don't you call now.  You can't wait too late.  It's not nice to call too late!""  Despite the fact that the pharmacist will leave at 7 at the earliest, and since it generally dies down at around 6:30, where he'll have a little bit more time to talk.  I ended up calling about 20 minutes ago, and while he was nice about it, I could tell he was really busy and didn't really want to deal with it at the moment.  But then it got worse.  I go into the living room where she is, and asks how the call went.  I said everything was fine and I'm going to meet him sometime this week.  She then proceeds to say that I don't give a shit about getting a job or internship or anything for the summer, and that all I care about is screwing around and playing videogames (which I only do because there's nothing else to do around here).  She then calls me stubborn because I didn't want to call at the ""right"" time.  And the thing that pissed me off the most is that she said the reason I haven't gotten a job in 3 years is because I don't care and she essentially gave me too much freedom to do it on my own.  The real reason being that the economy still sucks around here and no place was hiring.  I must've applied to at least 20 jobs a year.  


--


Then she says that maybe she should've had more control over that.  Are you fucking kidding me?!  My entire life you've tried to control everything!  If I have to do something like go buy clothes, you always say that you wanna fucking go with me to see what I chose and make sure it's okay.  I'm 20 fucking years old!!!!  When my brother got depression years ago and got sent to a therapy center or whatever it was, you said it was the rap music he listened to, but I'm pretty sure it was your constant fucking nagging and trying to determine everything we fucking do; the only reason I say this is because about a year after he got out of that, I got really depressed and borderline suicidal for maybe 2 or 3 months, and the only thing I could pin it on was you!!!  


Or how about how you never let us fucking do anything.  I still remember when I was in elementary school and would get birthday invitations, I would get so excited in kindergarten when I first got one.  Then I go home and you say things like, ""No you don't wanna go.  Then you have to buy him a present and he might not like it...""  And it would continue like that for years.  I would get excited every single time and a similar story would happen.  In about 3rd grade when I got one, I would just think to myself, ""oh, another one.""  Then I'd put it in my backpack and throw it out when I got home without even showing anyone.  I finally got to go to one in 5th grade, and I'm pretty sure the only reason that happened is because the person's mom met my mom at the grocery store or something and told her about it directly.  At that point you had to let me go because then what would his mom think.  That was another fucking thing you put in my head.  Whenever I tried to be outgoing when I was little, you would always say, ""stop that.  What are other people going to say?""  And it was like that for years; if I tried doing anything that even a fucking normal child would do, you'd say that.  To this day I still have confidence issues because of that.  I didn't have the balls to ask the girl I had a crush on for 3 fucking years to prom because everytime I was going to ask her, that fucking statement just popped up in my head and I would avoid it.  When I graduated and everyone was having parties over the summer, I didn't even bother asking for one because I didn't expect one. It's like whenever we would have birthday parties for us as kids, you would invite family like uncles and grandparents, but wouldn't ever let us invite friends (I use that term loosely because they were pretty much just schoolmates). When dad ended up asking me if I wanted a graduation party, and I asked what we would have, he said ""whatever you wanted.""   I nearly cried at that statement, because he's always been one who tried to give us normal things; granted he was more passive so it never really played out. And when that happened it was already near the end of july so I thought there probably wasn't any time to set one up.  But for kicks, I ask you what we could have. Knowing everyone else had things like outdoor activities like a volleyball net or other basic fun things for my friends to do.  I asked and you said, ""No, if we get a net then we'd get holes in the lawn and we'd have to buy stuff.""  I'm fucking sorry.  I didn't realize the fucking grass was more important than doing something nice.  We have money; we're not broke so I don't see why the money issue is important either, especially when we never had any other parties either.  

You're also really fucking cheap.  You would barely give us anything new.  I only remember wearing hand-me-downs until I was probably in 10th grade.  When I was around 6 or 7, on president's day when my brother and I had off for school, we went to a dollar store with dad to get something he needed.  While there, he let us each get a toy (for like a dollar or 2 each).  I remember I heard you yelling at him for buying us that because it would just end up under our beds or lost somewhere.  He didn't say anything at the time, but I remember talking with him a few weeks later, and he thought that was stupid because they were each a fucking dollar.  Meanwhile you go to k-mart or wal-mart and buy shirts for a dollar or 2 every few fucking days and never fucking wear them.  You still do that, though not as much, and they're still laying in your fucking closet.

So don't fucking say you gave me too much giving us too much freedom.  You literally tried to control everything I do for pretty much my entire life.  If nothing else, that's why I love college so much.  I'm away from you and can do things at my own pace instead of when you want me to.  I'm slowly getting over the ""what would other people say.""  I have actual friends that I hang out with instead of just schoolmates.  

edit:  there's one more thing I wanted to say about you.  Whenever people disagree with you, and it could be something incredibly fucking trivial or maybe something that's somewhat more important, and not everyone agrees with you, always always get really fucking mopey and say, ""Nobody cares"" or ""Why is everyone so bad.""  Well I'll fucking tell you why everyone is so ""bad.""  Because we don't have to fucking agree with you.  You try to control everything and the second people disagree then all of a sudden you're the victim.  Well fuck you!

1zhf2c,1,2014-03-03,Going back to the gym!,sararooskie,PCOS,https://www.reddit.com/r/PCOS/comments/1zhf2c/going_back_to_the_gym/,"Hey all,

I just wanted some support and cysters are the best at that, as we all know! 

I am a 20 year old college student in California. I was overweight all throughout my teens and finally got it under control after two years, realizing that I had PCOS. 

Last year, I piled myself with way too much stuff (got custody of my 13 year old brother, moved in with my long-time boyfriend, took way too many units, got involved on the board of too many organizations, and took on two jobs). This last month, I have been asked to take on more responsibility; teach a class, run two internships for teens, and other things. 






Needless to say, I have had no time for the gym, I have been stressed to the point of break-down, got on antidepressants, and haven't been able to focus on self-care. I made poor eating choices (lots of potato and pastas to satisfy a picky teen, grab-and-go snacks between meetings, etc.)


I gained 30 pounds in a mere year. I was devastated. After years of counting every calorie, exercising every day, and being image-obsessed, I forgot how easy it is to gain weight with this darn disease!


Anyways, the last two weeks I have been painstakingly sloughing away responsibilities until I have finally widdled my way into having one hour of free time every day and one FULL day off per week. I know this doesn't sound like a lot, but it's better than literally less than 20 minutes of free time from 9am - 11pm every day.  

Anyways, the last few days, I have been back at the gym and it feels awesome! The heart of me knows that I made the right choice... but... 

I just need to hear that I made the right choice by putting my health first, because I let a lot of people down by backing out of teaching courses and shying away from responsibilities. I made a lot of people doubt and not trust me.. but I know this is something I need. That's not crazy and selfish, right?

Just got a crushing rejection and I wanted to see if I am in the wrong. Let me explain:

I had an initial phone screen with my dream company about a week and half ago for a summer internship. They scheduled a Skype call but abruptly cancelled it about 5 minutes before it was scheduled to take place. We scheduled another call and I thought this phone screen went really well. I was prepared, I felt chemistry with the interviewer, and I solved both (relatively easy) programming challenges quickly and efficiently.

Several days after the interview, I sent my interviewer a quick thank-you note since I really did enjoy the conversation we had. He said that he enjoyed the conversation as well, and indicated that I could expect an invitation to interview onsite.

I didn't hear anything from the recruiter so I asked for a status update today and was sent a stock rejection letter about 15 minutes later. Was I being too persistent? Or did I just count my chickens before they hatched? Is it out of line to let my interviewer know what happened and see if he'll go to bat for me?"

1zhmtm,1,2014-03-03,dealing with work related anxiety,bird_pecking_keys,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1zhmtm/dealing_with_work_related_anxiety/,"I want to preface this by telling a little about myself. A couple of years ago I started culinary school. It wasn't a dream of mine, it was out of necessity. I needed to get a job, I needed a roof over my head and food to eat. School would provide that, with the help of funding. But that is why I went. 
      About a month into my schooling I was beginning to realize what passion I had for this. It became my obsession, to work in a great restaurant was all I could think about day and night, recipes swam through my head, and I absorbed a new world of information as quickly as I could. I wrote a paper on a chef at a restaurant here in chicago where I lived. I sold my car, and I ate at the restaurant. It was very expensive, over $300 but the food changed the way I saw dining. It became a piece of performance art, from the tastes, to the smells, to the lighting, to the music, it was just a perfect little chunk of the universe and I wanted to be a part of it. I asked to do a ""stage"", a night of free work in the restaurant, a great experience for young aspiring cooks and chefs who are willing to put theirselves out there and ask for a chance. 


I didn't have much skill, but less than 6 weeks into my school I was inside of a michlen star restaurant's kitchen, working with some of Chicago's greatest. I was awestruck, starstruck, and 1000% out of my element. I couldn't eat at staffmeal, and by 10 PM after 7 hours of running plates up and down the stairs hundreds of time I was at my limit. I asked to go home and was invited to come back again. But I didn't follow up for a few months. 

Then further into my school career, I was in need of a stage, and an internship. I saught out the chefs of this restaurant and was allowed to do a stage again. This time I staged for two days and at the end they told me I was hired as an intern, the internship didn't start til summer, but I didn't sleep for three days afterward. I was so excited. My mind couldn't stop racing. It was uncomfortable. But I was happy. I was finally proving something to my family that I really cared about what I was doing, and was a hard worker following my passion. 

Fast forward a few months, I did my internship. I worked long hours, I worked 70 + hours a week unpaid. And they stuck me on expediting after being there less than a week. I was esentially the heart of the restaurant, and the communication between front and back of the house. I hadn't thought that was what I was going to be doing, but I was so excited to be given that responsibility when I was so green. On a bad Saturday night, it was often my fault for the wrong food walking, or for the kitchen missing a fire. I took it to heart and always blamed myself any night the restaurant had a bad night. I cried in bed the two days I had off, and couldn't sleep and my mind wouldn't stop processing the night and how I had fucked up. I felt like such a failure. But my work in the kitchen prepping went well, and every day it felt like I could get more and more done. Sure they gave me the simpelest tasks, but I never complained and I always got them done quickly. Rather than giving me anything more challanging to do, they would just have me spend hours doing tedious tasks like peeling chickpeas. I didn't care, I was part of it. I wasn't happy, but I was on the way to making my dream come true. At the end of my internship I asked to stay longer, because I had more time before my school term started, I could have had a month vacation, but I kept working unpaid, and as I realized in the time leading up to the end that they had absolutely no plans to hire me, even though they were hiring, and they hired two new people who hadn't done an internship. I cried every night and I couldn't sleep. I had worked so hard to have my dream taken away. I was crushed. I had such bad anxiety that I had to call off for the first time because I couldn't get out of bed. When my internship was over I tried staging at some other michlen star restaurants. They were even more prestigious than the place I had done my internship, and I was so nervous I left one half way through, and didn't even go to the other one. I took a job that a friend hooked me up with making pizzas and other simple pick ups for a couple weeks, but then went back to my internship site and begged for a job. They hired me on to expedite but this time as a FOH position so I had to wear a suit and walk food. I was hired to work fridays and saturdays, and to expedite. But my manager kept pushing me to come in on more and more days, so I had to quit going to school and I messed up a 5 thousand dollar semester. But I put my happiness and quality of life on the line for this job that I wanted so badly. 
I improved the system that they used to expedite. I was finally really starting to master expediting. My manager pulled me off of my station and made me a table silverer. He gave my job to an idiot. He took credit for the system I made to measure guests satisfaction. Everyone is so venomous. I close my eyes and I hear the workers yelling. I close my eyes and my head spins and I wonder what went so horribly wrong. I found out they do not have a plan to ever let me back into the kitchen. I feel like my heart is ripped out. I can't feel anything. I can't sleep. I get a twinge in my chest. I want to think about other things. I want to talk about other things. I don't want to worry about work all the time. I finally made the decision to look for another job, but my family is giving me such a hard time.  They don't understand what I'm going through, they have never experienced this level of fine dining and they don't understand how it could be so demanding. They think I am just a waitress. They say just keep holding out. But a week ago I climbed up my fire escape and almost jumped off my building. Sometimes I feel like if I don't work here I don't have anything to live for, maybe I should kill myself. But i can't handle it. I can't feel this anxiety over this job constantly. I will kill myself one night if I cant somehow separate myself from this job, I became too obsessed with it in relation to my self worth. 

I have an interview for another job. I am planning on giving my two weeks notice. I am going to say I can't do school and work at the same time, but the truth is, I could if my anxiety wasn't so severe in regards to work. I don't know how I'm going to work up the courage to give my two weeks notice. I don't know how I'm going to punish myself for giving up. I just want all this to be over. I wish I could disappear. I don't want to be a quitter. I just can't handle this job. "

Should we move in together?,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1zi1vn/me_28m_with_my_girlfriend_26f_really_need_an/,"Nine and a half years ago, I met my girlfriend, L., online, on a now defunct pirating platform called DC++.


We started talking and gradually became inseparable. We were both going through a rough time. I had just moved to Madison, WI, alone, and she was my only friend. We spent maybe 7 or 8 hours a day online together, and when we eventually fell in love; it was gooey and magical, and bittersweet.


She lived in Texas, and I lived in Madison, and we had no money whatsoever.


Seeing each other became little more than a daydream.


A year passed. She eventually met someone else. I was completely devastated at the time, yet we remained friends, until two years later, when we met physically for the first time in Rome, Italy. The next two weeks were the best of my life; we spent every moment together, waking and sleeping.


But she had to go back to Texas, and, once again, we fell apart.


We both dated other people, and we stayed friends, periodically professing our undying love to each other. We made absurd deals: not married by 40? We’ll marry each other, etc. I moved to TX, to be near her, and we were best friends for a while, this time in person, but she was seeing someone at the time, and it felt awkward, and we got into a fight (can’t remember why).


We stopped talking, and I moved away.


It was 2 more years after that, as she was finishing her undergrad, that we met up again, this time in NY. She was a little different now, a little harder, more focused.


We spent a glorious summer together while she was in NY. She had her internship during the week, and I had work, but the weekends were ours!


Anyway, after she left again, I completely fell apart. There is no way to describe the pit of hell into which I descended. Days on end without sleep, weeks without food.


Eventually I felt better, worked on my career, went back to school, and when we started talking again around 4 years ago, L. and I became best friends, almost as though nothing had happened.


Fast forward to today. She’s in Texas, and I’m in PA. Our relationship over the past two months has gradually developed into something more like what it used to be, except different because we’re both older and wiser (and maybe a little more screwed up), and perhaps especially because this time neither one of us is broke.


We are going on vacation together in April for a week, and if everything goes well (which it will! It always has before) we want to move to Seattle together and be roommates and finally be together.


I know we have screwed this up in the past, but we really want this to work. She thinks we should take it slowly and not call each other boyfriend/girlfriend for a while, even though we’re very intimate and sexual (as much as we can be online), and even though we’re exclusive and as committed to each other as we can manage given our distance.
She wants to take it slowly, because we haven’t seen each other in 5 years.


Anyway, my question: is moving in together so soon a good idea? (Please for the love of god guys do me a solid and say “Yes.”) And is calling each other boyfriend/girlfriend at this stage of our relationship a good idea?


I haven’t been with anyone in 4.5 years. I tried to date, but I’ve pretty much been celibate this whole time. I just couldn’t. She is the only woman I’ve ever loved, and I’m honestly quite scared.


**TL;DR:** My GF and I have been on and off for almost a decade. Long distance right now and will have a chance to be together soon. But it will require we move in together right away. Should we do it or not?"

1zicni,1,2014-03-04,Started new job last week and may now get the chance to interview for a better one. Jumping so quickly? Am I think this through correctly?,fuckugumby,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1zicni/started_new_job_last_week_and_may_now_get_the/,"Quick background:

- I'm two years out of college and just changed careers
- I'd only had one job, which was my first one out of college. It was at a big name company.
- I did well at my last job. but unfortunately got laid off despite my performance being some of the best in the entire region. Couldn't help it because the company slashed the entire office in a cost-cutting move.
- Pay was on the low-end of entry-level for that job despite my quality work. Position also had no room for growth, hence the reason for my career change.

I was pretty bummed about getting laid off despite doing outstanding work. After getting laid off, I interviewed for a few months and then accepted a job offer in February. I just started last week. We'll call this Company A.

Company A info:

- It's a small company that's growing very quickly in my chosen field. To give you an idea, they already have a nice, big office downtown that they're outgrowing, so in a few months they'll be moving into an even bigger one a block over that's still under construction.
- This company is not a big name company like my first one was. However they may be recognizable if you follow the industry closely. They're popping up more and more often.

- The pay is entry-level again, and will only be $0-5000 more than my first job. Also, instead of having salary/benefits like at my first job, I'm basically an intern, getting paid hourly with no benefits. I'm told that we are guaranteed to be converted to salary/benefits as long as we gut out the first three months. The flipside of that is that they're training us pretty thoroughly.
- Conversations I'm having with people who have been there for a while indicate they are definitely good with promotions. So while I may not like the work now, there are some positions I'm eyeing that I may have a shot at in the future.
- Despite the current position not being great and getting worked hard already, I like my coworkers and the company seems to treat everybody very well. Definitely was not treated this nicely at my first job.

So prospects seem decent at this current job at Company A. I'm actually happy enough at the moment and if nothing else was going on, I'd be content to hang tight here. 

Well, I have a friend who works at Company B. Before I accepted the job offer at A, friend at B let me know that a position may be opening up within B that she could help me get. I give her my resume without thinking much of it and now I'm told that I'm going to get contacted by HR this week. 

Here's Company B's info:

- Huge company. Big name.
- Position at B is much closer to what I want to do compared to my current position at A.
- I've heard mixed things about how the company culture is, though they generally skew towards positive as opposed to negative. Generally any complaints sound like the ones that exist at any big company. Maybe tougher to move up?
- Starting salary is supposed to begin at least 20000 more than what it was at my first job and 15000-20000 more than what it could be once I become salaried at Company A. I'm also a salaried employee right away, with benefits.

Fortunately, I don't have to make a hard decision yet. I haven't been contacted by B's HR yet. She may not call me. Even if she does, it'll still take some time to interview and go through that process, so if I leave it'd be after a month or two or three instead of after a few weeks. Training for the position at Company B is not supposed to be until June.

Is it okay for me to think about switching given how much better the pay and position sounds at Company B, who is also one of the biggest companies around? Should I hang on to Company A because of its impressive growth-prospects and because I just started there? How would I even take time off from A to interview with B? Am I too preoccupied with pay after how low my salary was at the first job? I'd love your guys' input."

Weekdays, midnight, rush hour.  The first week, they were so drastically different it was like another country, different patterns, customs.  Then that Wednesday it all started to groove.  The rhythm of the street lights, parking, slipping in and back out, and then back home to check the camera feed.  It took longer and longer to even find myself in the footage.

The stroke of genius, if I may, was finding a different bank - - not a different branch, a totally different bank, completely unrelated to my Practice Bank, with similar layout and software, yet equivalent Staff Laziness.  Same drive, same walk, they were practically neighbors.  The thrill was that it was all going to happen on my first visit to the Mark.

That last week was perfect.  I'd follow the route, sweep through the building, exit West on the dark side, and walk AROUND the actual Mark, picking up more and more details, and more and more confidence, every single time.  Then, back to the apartment to hack into my job, re-route the IP Address, even trigger visits at my gym via the card reader, all the while maintaining my virtual presence back home.  

Blending in, living a nondescript life, going un-noticed for so many years, first out of necessity, then dismissiveness toward those who'd ignored me - - I finally found a use for it.  A sheepish smile, cocked eyebrow, apologetic everything.  Picking the right clothes, the right line at the airport.   Seeming distracted,  making obligatory small talk, flirting with men and women.   Then magically disappearing.  No eye contact.   Swaying gracefully through crowds, there and gone, like fog.  

Identification came far easier than expected, albeit much more expensively.   But American TSA didn't blink, nor anyone at Heathrow, nor TSA the second time.  It all became a bit of Method Acting, and I should say it was indeed fun at bars and casinos.   Repetition.  Repetition.  Then came the Day.

Thank God for the perpetual gray of Winter, at least I could count on that.   Not too flashy, no jewelry of any kind, nor hair product.   Just Blend In.  Same route, same walk, even hit the bathroom on the way.   West Exit, cross, walk directly in, and pick my window.

But -  the windows were unmanned.  Empty chairs at every desk.  The fuck, is this place being robbed?  Are they all locked in the safe?  Two more steps and  it all made sense.

They held their fingers up over their mouths, crouched down, eyes darting.  Every eye squarely on me.   I wasn't wearing Kevlar because I am not a violent criminal, but the shock of that realization bent my shoulders forward and I froze, waiting for the fat voice of a Security Guard.  Instead, the hand on my arm was soft, and she spoke in a kind, Customer Service Voice.

""Can I help you, sir, we seem to have a few too many on break...""

I spun around and could feel her eyes on my forehead, tracking my sweat as she smiled kindly.  At once, twenty voices pierced my side.  I availed myself of her arm and dodged behind her as they lurched for me.

""SURPRI-ISE!""

She tumbled directly into them.  The stout marm leading the pack spun wildly into the intern flanking her, and their dance, while impromptu, seemed quite focused.  The tray of miniature cupcakes spun with them, and at least five of the dozen met their fate squarely in the leavings of a quite large, quite antiquated paper shredder.   It was precisely at that moment that most of us came to the simultaneous conclusion that either the cupcakes or the paper shavings had been soaked in kerosene for a good while, because the entire desk became a pyre of tit-high flames with the landing of a single lit candle.

Long slivers of flame jumped from their stow, into the air, lunging at staffers whose expressions of dread foretold their fates.  Somebody was going to get their ass fired.

And as two valiant, clearly cheating husbands stamped out the blaze along with the flung waters and wet breath of said security guard, all eyes were again upon me. 

Another day, another time, another city.  I want to go home."

How hard would it be for me to find a full-time job upon graduation with a BS in CS (3.5 GPA) and no actual internship experience? 
1zje7k,10,2014-03-04,The nFamily,spicypepper942,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1zje7k/the_nfamily/,"So where do I begin? First, I'd like to thank all of your for reading/contributing to this subreddit. I just stumbled upon it last night and after lurking on Reddit for several years I've finally jumped in to participate in this discussion. 

I was raised by an nMom and nDad (I think he is my mother's conarcissist/enabler) and all of my siblings now exhibit narcissist behaviors, my DH says it's miracle I turned out the way I did. It was DH's encouragement that finally got me to seek out a therapist, which has been the most beneficial thing I've ever done for myself in dealing with my family situation. Even though my nMom chastised me at first ""What do you need to see a therapist for?!"" my lovely therapist brought to my attention that my family's behavior is NOT NORMAL, that I have a right to boundaries and a right to choose who/what interactions I participate in.

Growing up was not fun in my house for me. My parents made things very difficult for me and still do. My parents put constant pressure on me to succeed, even in grade school (For instance when I got my first B in 7th grade, I was screamed at because ""KIDS THAT GET B'S DON'T GO TO HARVARD!) and now even as an adult I have crazy expectations for myself and I know that anxiety was implanted in me by my parents since the day I was born. They also kept me in 3+ extra curricular activities at all times as a kid, but was only allowed to do what they approved - for instance I loved the arts but I couldn't participate because it conflicted with my sports schedule, which my parents were convinced would pay my way though college (it didn't.)

My nmom is also a hoarder, but complains constantly about her house being a wreck. As kids we were constantly forced to clean despite us having a housekeeper, all the while my nmom did absolutely nothing but yell at us and spank us if we resisted or questioned why she could sit in the kitchen and watch TV while we scrubbed baseboards. Family and friends have stopped visiting over the years due to the state of the house, not to mention that my nMom will also make guests clean for the first day or so upon the arrival. Yea.

I could go on forever, but over the years I've been consistently lied to, had financial aid money for college stolen from me, and have had the entire family pitted against me (especially now as I have been through therapy and can assert my own boundaries.) I have no relationship with my siblings as my nmom's jealousy of me and my nDad's relationship has made her turn them all against me. I remember one particular argument I had with nmom and my (possibly) nsisters over how mad they were that I ""left them to deal with nDad"" and his drinking issues when I went off to college. They accused me of ""living it up"" despite the fact that I worked two jobs, held an internship and went to school full time because those promises my nDad made about taking care of me through college were - surprise! - not fulfilled.

Recently, my nMom has ignored my rather significant professional accomplishments (like, won't even SPEAK about them) and also disregards a very serious health issue I am dealing with right now. For instance I was telling her how I couldn't afford my very much needed and expensive medication last month, and rather being a normal, concerned mother she said ""Well I can't afford mine either!"" and dismissed it and then went and got her hair done. But if someone asks how I'm feeling, you can bet there is going to be a dramatic 5 minute long pity party thrown by nMom about how hard my illness is on her. They still demand command performances and forced interaction every holiday and act like the world is ending if I can't make it up for one Easter (I live a few hours away and my health issues do not make it road trips easy for me.) They'll arrange family events without consulting me and DH and just tell me to ""Be here, this day, this time"" even if said event is 3 hours away and I can't even get out of bed by myself. nMom also has a knack for hour long phone conversations and completely ignoring any statements made about needing to get off the phone. I have been able to enforce quite a bit of boundaries that have helped, but as narcissists like to do, those boundaries are constantly pushed, the guilt trips are inflicted when I stand firm, but I am familiar with this cycle now and just focus on standing my ground with them.

I could go on forever about the abuse I received (and still do) from my nfamily but what I am really trying to figure out right now is how to maintain my lc, possibly even pushing towards vlc or nc for a while. There isn't any one thing in particular they've done lately to make me consider this, it's just that the amount of stress DH and I are dealing with right now doesn't need to compounded by their need to manipulate us on a daily basis. DH is wonderful, and is not afraid to stand up to them for his sake or mine (thankfully there hasn't been a big blow out yet, but that's what I'm trying to avoid.) DH sees the continual abuse I take and it infuriates him. We're also having to deal tens of thousands of dollars of debt my nparents have bestowed upon me over the years by refusing to make any payments on any bills that were ever incurred on me when I was their dependent.

So basically, hello. Thanks for reading. I know I'm rambling but other than my husband and therapist there aren't many folks I can talk to that can relate - my nfamily is really good at putting out the ""Oh we're so sweet and nice!"" vibe while spewing vitrol behind everyone's back so it's hard to explain that to people who think my parents are just ""really nice folk."" If they only knew."
1zjeup,10,2014-03-04,Waiting to hear back from a company who told me I'd hear back either way,Zorpix,GetEmployed,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetEmployed/comments/1zjeup/waiting_to_hear_back_from_a_company_who_told_me/,"Said company told me I would hear back from them sometime last week, whether I was getting the internship or not. I had a technical knowledge phone interview then was called in for a personal interview. I sent my thank you email the day after and have been waiting since a week before last thursday. They said I'd hear back within the week, but I'm starting to think they might've just decided to not reply anyways.

Do companies say ""We'll contact you either way"" and then not contact you if you're not hired?"
1zjfgm,981,2014-03-04,{C}remation.,nicmccool,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1zjfgm/cremation/,"I come from a small town where the only jobs for freshly graduated college kids stupid enough to return home are fast food and Walmart, so I practically peed myself when Anita called me out of the blue and offered me an internship. It’s not the most ideal job, and it’s something I have to lie about when I talk to other people or I get a lot of really stupid questions -- “Does it smell in there, Cassie?”, “Do you ever, *you know*, check out peoples’ wangs?”, “Are you scared?”-- but it’s a weekly paycheck and I have the chance to stay on after a year. 

First off, I’ve got two brothers so I’ve pretty much seen it all. Steven used to bring home deer and rabbits, and skin them right outside my bedroom window. Chad, he was normal, but he’d always show up with some freak injury that he’d be more than happy to shove in my face while I was trying to eat my Cap’n Crunch. I can safely say I was a already fairly morbid midwestern girl far before I started working at Reynolds Funeral Home. 

And secondly, you can’t just turn down an offer to work in a funeral home. Forget all the dead bodies stuff, being a mort tech is a *cushy* job. I mean, that’s why they always keep it in the family! I think I work about twenty total hours a week, get paid for forty, and spend all my free time in the upstairs lounge on one of the pastel rose couches reading my kindle and avoiding Centaur, Anita’s mastiff with a affinity for humping my hip. Plus, did I say I may get to stay on in a year? I mean, that’s like a *life* gig; the golden ticket and all those other corny cliches. So, when weird things happen in a mortuary you tend to ignore them, because the perks are good. 

That’s normal, right?

Okay, so a few days ago I got called in to prep two bodies; a mother and son poisoning, which as sad as it seems is a pretty big cash cow for funeral homes. We’ll take nice safe heart attacks and poisonings any day of the week over gun shots and car wrecks. There’s no physical reconstruction, maybe a little around the mouth if there happened to be a large amount of bile or resuscitation efforts, but it’s way better than trying to jigsaw puzzle somebody’s face back together. And as in any business two is always better than one. 

We’re a small funeral home, you could almost call us mom and pop, except Anita’s husband died a few weeks ago, so I guess we’re a mom and random girl business. We don’t have a whole lot of money for sub freezes and heavy duty storage like you see on tv with the stacked drawers and stuff. We’ve got one positive temp storage in the basement with an old Mopec table, and three gurneys for overflow. The door to storage is one of those big steel insulated ones that seals when it’s shut, so when you latch it down you can’t hear a thing on the other side. Which is why the noise really freaked me out. 

I was washing down the boy, he smelled like strawberries and stomach acid, and I was lost in thought about some teen romance I was reading when I heard a shuffling sound. I said the storage was sealed shut, right? Like, no sound? Because, that’s what I was used to and when I heard it, let’s just say I jumped *over* the table like I was an Olympic freakin’ high jumper. 

“What the fuck?!” I screamed. Not the most eloquent I admit, but it got the point across. “Anita, are you messing with me?”

She wasn’t, I mean, she never had in the past and she wasn’t the type to randomly prank an employee surrounded by dead bodies. She’s like a grown up Wednesday Addam’s, but with less personality. I scanned the room slowly, looking at the empty corners first, then counted all the tools on the instrument cart. One saw? Check. Two bone cutters? Check. Two flush retractors? Check. One really big pair of scissors? Nope. 

“Seriously?!” I screamed. It came out much louder than I was expecting in the small room and I raised my hands to block my ears. In my right hand the scissors came extremely close to stabbing me in the temple. “Oh,” I said to no one. I must have grabbed them off the cart when I hurdled the boy. 

*The boy*. 

I raised the scissors up in what I thought was an intimidating pose. “Don’t be moving. Don’t be moving. Don’t be moving…,” I chanted in my head; a prayer to a god or gods or whatever was enjoying this shit-show. “Please, please don’t be moving.” My eyes cut from the instrument table to the grossing station along one wall, to the sealed concrete floor that concaved into a drain under the table, and then up the table to two tiny feet that shone a waxy pink in the harsh overhead lights. The toes moved. “They didn’t move, Cassie. You just blinked.” I stared at them for thirty seconds, wanting them not to move, but somehow hoping they would. They didn’t and I traced up the rest of the body with my eyes. “Definitely dead,” I thought. 

And then something launched itself against the outside of the door. 

I screamed. Of course I screamed. I screamed so loud I looked over to see if the woman on the gurney would sit up and tell me to keep it down because she was trying to sleep. The scissors clanged to the floor. They weren’t just dropped, they were propelled against the steel door with all the force I, the person directly referenced in the insult “you throw like a girl” because I *am* that girl, could muster. I squatted down and covered my head, because I heard somewhere that’s what you do when everything goes freakin’ bonkers, and kept screaming. 

On my third pause for air I realized that everything was dead quiet again. “Dead quiet? Nice one, Cassie,” I thought and pulled myself up off the floor. My hands brushed the fingertips of the boy on the table and I was half tempted to either hold his hand for comfort or crouch back down and start screaming again until the Army, or Navy, or freakin’ Marines blasted through that door to rescue me. “Daddy was a Marine,” I thought. 

Fuck. 

What would my dad think of his only daughter, crouched on the floor of an over-sized refrigerator, scared of some random noises outside? The trembling in my arms slowed, my lip stopped quivering. “It’s probably just Anita moving in a new table,” I thought. “Or maybe they’re replacing the propane for the cremator.” The latter was probably true. We hadn’t gotten new propane in months, so we were due for a refill. “Just poke your head out, Cassie,” I said to myself and the two cold bodies behind me. “Just poke your head out and see.”

My fingers grasped the metal latch and pulled up. Stuck.

“Fuck this, I’m done,” I said as panic started to wash over me. And then, in some rational part of my brain my dad said, “Push down, Cassandra.” I was calm again. “Duh,” I thought and pushed the latch down. The door opened outward with a soft release of air. 

The basement of the funeral home goes the full length of the building, but the building itself is not that big, so when standing at the partially open door of cold storage and looking out one can see the big gaping metal mouth of the industrial furnace the house was built around forty years ago. Brickwork lines the outside of the furnace marred black from residual blow-back after years of “cooks”. A rack of rollers stand on metal stilts and angle into the furnace’s mouth like a long, silver ridged tongue. Today the rollers were empty, but the mouth was open. Fire licked up on the inside of the furnace casting the entire side of the building in a blue-red strobe. A black shadow inside the mouth twitched and thrashed in the flames.

Twitched and thrashed.

I thought I was blinking again, I thought my eyes were lying, so I stared. My head poking out from behind the clean steel door looking across floors grooved by years of gurneys into the wide mouth of a furnace where a black object morphed to ashes and twitched. I stared until the light from the flames hurt my eyes and left rose blooms of red on the backs of my lids when they were closed. I blinked out what I thought I saw, re-saw the image, and tried to blink it out again. “Definitely twitching,” I thought. “Maybe it’s just a cross-breeze coming down through the chimney -”

And then it screamed.

A howling painful yell ripped from the throat of whatever burned in that fire. A scream of seizure and ecstasy. A scream both primal and knowledgeable enough to know that this sound was the last imprint it would leave on the world. A scream that gurgled out with the boiling blood of its throat until nothing was left but the soft whimpering pleas of the remaining dust. 

I slammed the metal door behind me and latched it shut. I slid to the floor and tucked my head between my knees and covered my head. I stayed in that position for what seemed like hours but could have been minutes when the Marines finally came knocking at the door.

“Cassie?” the Marine who sounded an awful lot like Anita Reynolds said from outside the door. “Cassie are you almost done with the wash down?”

“Almost,” I found myself replying. “Almost. Give me another few minutes.” 

“Okay,” the voice said, and then it was gone. 

I found myself standing, picking the scissors up off the floor, and putting them back on the instrument table. I thumbed down the switch on the shower head. “That wasn’t really a scream,” I said to the dead in the room. “I mean, it was definitely *not* a scream, right?” I took their silence as affirmation. I went back to washing the boy and his mother and never mentioned what I saw or heard.

I consider myself a pretty decent problem solver as well as a programmer. The thing is, is that I have no experience programming in a professional environment. All the programming I've ever done ranges from ""Go read about depth and breadth first search and implement it on an adjacency matrix of a graph"" or ""sort a pair of students by birthday using merge sort"". I can code these problems up with enough research, caffeine, and a white board and If I need to implement something such as utilizing a particular class that I'm unaware of, a google search is only a few clicks away.

This semester I signed up for a course that I believe is more ""real world"". It teaches a lot of enterprise technologies such as MySQL, writing servers, PHP, creating GUI front ends with database back ends, etc I signed up for this to try to start programming something more than binary trees and quicksorts, although I do understand the importance of learning data structures and algorithms.

As I said previously, I feel competent enough to program in school, but since I've never programmed in a work environment, I have no idea what its like. 

Is it the same thing as read a spec, break down problems into subset of problems, hit the whiteboard, google the stuff you dont know, start typing away at the keyboard? I know this might seem vague, but I hope you know what I am trying to ask."

You guys are my last resort - I'm flying in to Brasília on 29th of March from Finland, will do an internship there (6 months). Yet - I still have no place to live. 

It has proved to be crazy difficult to find a room to rent in Brasília (I'm looking at Asa Sul). :( I'm quite fluent in Portuguese too, but in spite of that I only seem to find very expensive studios to rent (most of them without furniture as well). In my case, I'd prefer to live with a Brazilian family / other Brazilian people, so would just need to rent a room.

So - if anyone here knows someone who could rent a small room (with a bed) to a really nice foreign girl somewhere in Asa Sul, that would be MUCH appreciated. I'm up for all sorts of tips as well as to where to look for a room.

Please help a girl in need! &lt;3 I promise to buy a beer or something to that person who can help me out!"

1zjtis,3,2014-03-04,Fitting in on a Team,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1zjtis/fitting_in_on_a_team/,"Hi Everyone, 

So I’m a recent college graduation working for an up and coming international company.  (That’s really all I can say about it. Don’t want to identify the company) 

I’m looking for some advice on how to strengthen the relationships I have with my current superiors. I’ve been interning here for a few months and I just got an extension and a raise with the possibility of salaried employment. 

I am somewhat shy, but still very sociable. However, I struggle with low self-esteem and just generally being awkward. I’m also gay and my bosses (and most of my teammates) are straight men who are also all a good decade older than me. We don’t have much to relate on. I’m trying to find a way to show them that I respect them and to give them a reason to invest more interest in me and delegate more work. Any Dale Carnegie inspired tips are welcome. I don’t want to be obnoxious and go out of my way to socialize, but I don’t want to distance myself either.

A bit of backstory to my internship -After coming onto the team two of my superiors were fired and I was moved onto a different team. The one I was moved from was a subsidiary of the team that I am now on. My bosses, for the most part, are very nice and professional people. However, there have been some bumps in the road of transitioning onto this team since I wasn’t previously a member and just showed up out of the blue. 

So now, I’ve got two months left to make myself irreplaceable. This is a company that I really want to work for. Any advice just on how to carry myself, how to interact, what to do and what not to do? Again I’m a shy guy just out of college trying to fit in on a team of men in their 30s with little in common with me (at least on the surface).

1zkfcz,29,2014-03-04,Okay time for me to tell you guys I graduated.,call_me_cthulhu_,BabyBumps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BabyBumps/comments/1zkfcz/okay_time_for_me_to_tell_you_guys_i_graduated/,"Okay well I'm officially 2 weeks post op today.  I really thought I was going to have this really short birth story because I was having a scheduled C-section so theres not a lot to talk about, right? WRONG.

Rewind to 2 weeks ago.  I barely slept the night before and almost drank and ate when my alarm went off at 4 am because...well...I'm a dummy sometimes.  Anyways we get to the hospital at 6:20 am and of coarse the admitting people aren't in.  So we have to wander around the hospital looking for someone to admit us and finally get back to L&amp;D a little after 7 and the nurses promptly scold us for being late while in the same sentence telling us they know we were told we didn't have to be there until 7:30 but we should've been told 7 instead.  Yep, annoying but I wasn't about to let a bitchy nurse ruin this.  It was the day I was going to meet my daughter.  After answering a million questions they asked if I wanted to be tested for HIV.  In the blink of an eye I responded **""yes""**.  For the next 10 minutes the nurses began treating my husband and I like there was something seriously wrong in the situation.  Maybe it was the lack of sleep, food, excitement, or the fact that I had been having pretty intense contractions all morning but for a second I completely forgot I was married.  Regardless of being married I'm one of those people that at a doctors appointment when asked if I want to be tested for x, y, or z, I always say yes because even though I know my husband and I aren't doing anything weird or cheating on each other my husband works a potentially dangerous job and I think better safe than sorry.  Well apparently that makes me a weirdo.  Just a quick piece of advice, if anyone tries to make you feel uncomfortable about being tested for anything they're 100% wrong and you have every right to be tested for whatever you want, like I said better safe than sorry.

Okay fast forward to my large ass walking into the OR.  Freezing cold I use a step stool to get onto the table.  The anesthesiologist comes in and tells me to lean over.  I had been feeling pretty confident about the epidural part because I got one during my last pregnancy but that was worse because it was during a contraction, right? No.  As soon as he put the needle in I felt intense shooting pain down my entire right side.  It was so intense I couldn't even talk and they kept asking me what was wrong.  I felt the needle pull out, told them what was wrong, where I felt pain, needle went back in, intense pain again.  Finally they gave me something in my IV to relax me, finished the epidural, and everything finished setting up around me.  Looking back I think they were concerned with the amount of medication they gave me because they had to do quite a few checks to figure out if I was even on the same planet as them.  

**My husband comes in, doctors come in, lets begin.**  I remember during my last C-section that with the epidural I could feel hot and cold, and feel people touching me, but no pain.  So when I started feeling things on my stomach I thought it was normal because it wasn't painful.  I'm not sure what went wrong but a few minutes later I started feeing really intense pain.  Yep, I started feeling my C-section.  They didn't want to give me anything until the baby was out (which was fine with me) so about a minute of agonizing pain later I remember the anesthesiology intern (the original one who did the epidural left) freaking out, trying to call the original anesthesiologist to figure out what to do.  She started giving me small doses of the medication in the IV they originally gave me while my doctors hurried.  I don't remember anything after a couple of doses of that medication.  

After the baby came out my husband went to her over on the heated bed but he told me that a few minutes after apparently something went really wrong and everyone started yelling about checking my urine and were being snippy with each other telling each other to hurry.  I woke up in recovery.  I vaguely remember the baby being put onto my stretcher and being taken to recovery.  When I woke up it was because whatever medication they had given me wore off and I was in the worst pain of my life.  It was overall excruciating but would get worse in waves because of top of just having major surgery I was also still having contractions or spasms.  They tried more medications before the nurse apologized telling me that **she was sorry but there was nothing she could do**.  A little while later I was just laying there hysterically crying trying to catch my breath when the anesthesiologist called back telling them to remove the epidural and give me medication through the IV and the nurses talking amongst themselves about me leaking spinal fluid.  

A couple of hours later I was in a postpartum room and the medication was finally starting to kick in.  That was when I found out that they did sutures instead of staples.  They were suppose to do staples and Ive gotten a different reason from everyone as to why this happened.  I also have no idea why the epidural didn't work.  

A few things I learned and pieces of advice I learned before being discharged:

-don't be afraid to ask nurses to help you breastfeed

-don't feel weird about having your boobs out if you want to breastfeed

-don't feel bad about having the baby in the nursery if you really need to rest.  The first night I was still confined to my bed, catheter and all, and the one nurse I had tried to make me feel bad about the baby only being brought in to nurse.  Another nurse came in 10 minutes later advising me to send the baby to the nursery for the night and to be brought in only to feed because how did the first nurse expect me to get out of bed to get the baby out of the bassinet?   She also told me it was very important I rest and I had plenty of time to have her in my room after the catheter was removed.

-stay on top of your medication! most medications are given upon request.  so if you're like me and you need to take daily medication not related to pregnancy you need to either bring it yourself or remind them early.  I'm lucky I brought my own medication from home because since the doctor didn't write it into my orders it would've taken an entire day for it to be approved.  

-if you have questions, ask! take advantage of the nurses help while you're there

**Both my daughter and I had problems following an early discharge.**  Obviously I had issues with my epidural.  Since being home I had really strange and painful headaches.  I also started having pains in my back similar to the pains I had when the epidural was being put in.  My doctor said there was a possibility I'm leaking fluid as a result of the epidural so for right now they have me drinking a lot of caffeine daily, resting, and taking hot, hot showers every night.  I'm also having issues as a result of having sutures rather than staples.  They were suppose to do staples because they were going to take out additional skin to prevent any ""overhang"" that would hurt the healing process.   They didn't take out any extra skin but theres definitely an overhang which prevents me from getting and keeping the incision completely dry.  Its slowly getting better but I have to wait until my next appointment for this to all be re-evaluated.  

My daughter was re-admitted to the hospital the following day due to severe jaundice levels.  This was worse than any pain I felt during or after the C-section.  No one tells you what its going to feel like when a doctor tells you that you need to leave you baby in the hospital and go home because its not suppose to happen.  Before you leave the hospital with your baby they need to do a series of tests including a bilirubin test and a newborn screening.  I was informed before discharge that my daughters numbers were considered ""borderline"" but they were fine with her seeing our pediatrician the following day.  Like I said before **ask questions**.  My first had a small amount of jaundice and both times I was told how common it is.  They gave me her bili numbers but I should have asked more questions to find out what that really meant and what borderline meant.  If I would've known what I found out when she was being re-admitted I would've stayed the extra day.  I would've made sure I was pumping and supplementing to get rid of the jaundice.  I would have done all of that because **better safe than sorry**.  She's home now but as a result of being in the hospital and being bottle fed (at first formula because I couldn't be there to pump then breastmilk I pumped and supplemented formula) she would not latch anymore.  Since being home shes latched maybe 3 times total.  The last couple of days she started eating more.  She tore through any stash I built up yesterday and for whatever reason (I think my ducts are clogged on the one side) as of yesterday I went from producing about 3-5oz per pumping session to under 2oz.  Today I made the decision to use formula exclusively because of this.  So if anyone has any tips on the easiest way to help my milk dry up that would be great! 

In the end I'm happy to have my little girl safe and sound at home with me.  In the end it doesn't matter if the epidural didn't work, it didn't matter how much pain I was in.  It didn't matter that I cant breastfeed.  All that matters is that my little girl is healthy and home with me.

ps- I know you all are waiting for pictures at the end but unfortunately I dropped and broke my phone when my daughter was in the hospital and don't have anything right now :("

 I've recently begun trying to better myself (physically and mentally) but I rarely get time alone to work out or meditate. Between my jobs as a server at a restaurant working to pay rent, an intern at a production company starting to learn the business of my dream job, and going to school full time, I barely have time for my girlfriend let alone myself. Notice how I wrote girlfriend before myself? Me too. I've placed spending time with her higher on priority than myself and I feel I've lost part of myself in the process.

I feel that the best thing for me is to not be in a relationship right now. However, I think for her the best thing is to be with me. I believe I provide a lot of support for her and I fear that she will be deeply saddened. I really do want her to be happy, I just don't think I'm in a position to stay in a relationship with her. I know I am going to miss her immensely and feel extremely guilty, I'll just want to run into her arms.

On the other hand, She is still young and has lots to experience and learn. I think it may be good for her in the long run to grow on her own for a while. I know that zero contact after a break up is best to move on, but I've always let her know that we're in this life together. That I will always be there to help with whatever obstacle she may encounter. She is my best friend. Aaaaaaaaand now I'm crying... I don't want to lose my best friend, but I know that she should not be my girlfriend anymore. She is an amazing girl, but I know we will not last forever.

**tl;dr**: How do I end this loving relationship that I know will not last, but still make sure she knows she is loved and cherished."

If it is possible, what would be the steps for doing so? How long would it take to earn six figure salary? The work done can be anywhere in the world, but he would be focusing on primarily on jobs in California. 

EDIT: This post seems impersonal and I don't think enough background information is provided. So here goes: I can either go to the college of my dreams for a very cheap price(5k/year), or go to another university that I like and pay over 20k more/year than the other(I would be happy there, and they would give me a good education, just not as good as the other college). Here's the catch, I would be serving 5 years in the navy upon graduation and would not be able to do internships during school if I went to my dream college. This is fine by me, I would proudly serve my country, I am just worried that I will not be able to have a career in CS (This is my ultimate goal) after not having internships/being in the military for 5 years, and that generally it will be too late to do all of the things that I wanted to do with CS (Create my own Startup, or work for a company and make a six figure salary).

1zksj8,25,2014-03-04,I have done absolutely nothing with my life during the last 5 years. I have no idea how to really get over this. Can anybody help?,babbling_brook,getting_over_it,https://www.reddit.com/r/getting_over_it/comments/1zksj8/i_have_done_absolutely_nothing_with_my_life/,"I've been doing really poorly for the past few months. I was first diagnosed with major depressive disorder when I was 16, went into therapy, got on medication and things really turned around until I went through a traumatic experience during my senior year of high school. 

I'm about to complete my 5th year of college and about to turn 23. I have done absolutely nothing since my senior year of high school. It's been 5 years without a single friend, job, internship or good memory. I live with my parents and the only reason I even leave the house is to go to class (and I usually don't even bother to go). This isn't just an episode of depression, this is who I have become.

I have no idea how to get over this and start to actually participate in my life. I am really reaching my breaking point. I need a solution other than suicide.

My health insurance doesn't cover mental health. The cheapest therapists in my area are $60-80 a session. The cheapest psychiatrists are $200 a session. My college offers 10 free therapy sessions, but I can't go to them. My university automatically charges every student for health insurance unless you already have insurance and submit a waiver. They don't go over every single person's alternative insurance, they just do random audits. They recently made it mandatory that alternative health insurance covers mental health. I can't go to the university medical center to get the 10 sessions of therapy because they are going to ask for my insurance information, see that it doesn't cover mental health and require me to purchase the university health insurance, which I can't afford (and I don't want to be forced off my parent's insurance).

My mother has been in therapy for a while. She doesn't believe I was ever really depressed. When I asked her to ask her psychiatrist if I could just go to a normal doctor to get medication, she followed up the psychiatrist's answer with ""if you really think it is necessary"".

I don't understand this. I never leave the house, constantly skip class, have no friends, no hobbies and no motivation. I have asked my mom to ask her psychiatrist how I could get medication. Nobody seems to think anything is wrong with me. I have a fantasy of killing myself so they can realize they have no pictures, nothing to say about me and nobody will attend the funeral except family.

I have never come out and said ""I am depressed and need help"", I just hinted that I wanted to try medication again. Do you think I should just spell it out and ask my mom for help in finding a therapist? I can't pay for it myself. 

Is there anything else I can try to do to get better? I really need to get out of the house more, but I hate being out. Does anybody have any advice? Thank you."
1zksym,2,2014-03-04,Credit problems (hospital bill) - effect on background check?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1zksym/credit_problems_hospital_bill_effect_on/,"Hello, I was accepted as an intern at a big financial firm in SLC for this upcoming summer, and I'm going through the process of the background check, transcripts, etc, but I received a call from their background team asking for some clarifications about some things I have on my credit report.
  
I currently have two balances in collections, one of which is a large hospital bill that I have not been able to pay off.
  
I was in a bicycling accident about 3 years ago that resulted in about a ~20k debt, being uninsured. Some supplemental insurance covered about 10 of that, and I was left hanging with the other 10. I was not able to pay it off, so those 3 bills went to collections.
  
Two of those totaled to $1,000, which I have paid off, but the other $9,000 still remain. They want me to pay off the full $9,000 over 12 months which is impossible going to school full time, making only 600 a month, 400 of which I give to my parents each month to help with bills. They remain rigid on the 12 months, and thus, the bill is still in collections.

The other amount is for $72 which is a bill from a doctor that I had a health check with about 3 years ago, of which I only received notice about a year ago saying this was in collections. My mother paid this in cash when we went in, but they still claim that it remains unpaid.

I explained this to the gentleman who had called. I was wondering what role is this going to play in my offer for the internship? How big of a deal is this, or what can I do in order to help this situation? Thanks for reading, and I appreciate any comments/advice."

I was 17, my senior year had just began. I went to some party not too long after. I got drunk like many teenagers do. Only someone slipped something in my drink. Exactly what it was I'll never know. My memory of what happened next is very hazy. I remembered being carried to a car outside of the house, and then they... You know. I was pretty much tossed around like some plaything and not a person. Little did I know that people had taken pictures of me, and pretty much everyone saw them (for the record, I don't know what happened to the pictures, I didn't exactly want to see them. That combined with no biological evidence, this would not stand up in a court of law) I was so ashamed and embarrassed, I felt so low. My classmates called me a whore, slut and everything else. No one knew I was a virgin before that night, I was still the new girl after all, how would they know? I lost what little friends I had, no one wanted to be friends with the school tramp. The only people who actually talked to me were guys who wanted the same. I kept telling myself that I should have known better, it was my fault. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder right before the year had began, and I was starting treatment.

That's when he came in my life. He didn't call me names and supported me going through treatment. Seemed like quite the ""white knight."" We bickered from the beginning, but he was the only one who seemed to care. I went to school out of state after graduation. I was struggling adjusting to a new place, continuing treatment with new doctors, it felt like a chance to have a new start. I was living in an all girl's dorm and it was great, no one knew, and there were nice to me. I was on skype with him on a Friday night when my roommate asked if I wanted to go to a party. I said ""sure, that sounds like it could be fun"" He tore me down telling me that if I slept with someone we were over, called me a slut. I felt like that was behind me, but he called me those names again. I felt horrible, even  from 700 miles away, he had a huge impact on me. I began to separate myself from my dorm mates because he told me that they were going to make me ""go back to my old ways"" He took over my life because I was afraid to lose him. He controlled everything, when I could text and call, told me to stop being so clingy. I remember having a post it on my desk telling me things like ""Only skype when he wants to, don't send more than one text at a time no matter how long it takes for him to answer."" My depression and my instability of my medication caused me to spiral down and I was hospitalized. I left the university after the semester and came back. My parents kicked me out of the house because I was a failure. The only place I could find to live was with his parents. I started going to community college. I didn't have a driver's license at this time, so they had to take me everywhere. I was not in communication with my parents at all, all I had was him and his family. They didn't agree with my medication, so they wouldn't let me take it and wouldn't let me go to a doctor, I knew I needed it, but I need a place to stay more. My mental stability plummeted. I was a mess, the only thing that kept me going is them driving me to go see him in the next town over. A couple months into this, I learned how much pot he was smoking. And not only did he smoke, but his parents did too. All day, every day it seemed. He told me ""We can never be as close as we could if you didn't"" I never agreed with it, but I went along. I didn't want to lose what I had, figured it was better than being out on the street. 

He moved back to his parent's house after the semester had ended. I was happy to have him back, but that's when the manipulation got even worse. Called me crazy, a slut, stupid, worthless. He knew what would hurt me and had no problem using it. Argument or not. He and his parents really pushed for me to smoke regularly to self-medicate for a disorder they didn't think I had. But if I ""really am convinced that I have it"" that this was the only way they would let me do it. It never felt right, but I did it. I hated it, but I was so scared of losing the only people I had. The only other people that I knew outside of his family were his two best friends that went to other state schools. When my boyfriend I got our first apartment living with some dorm mates of his, they visited us fairly often and we partook in typical shenanigans that any college students would. At the end of the term, he had gotten into a fight with the roommates and him and his two friends had moved all that was out the apartment. We moved into a studio apartment together, that's when he got really bad. He came every day from school angry. Some professor was an asshole, every small thing. I came home before he did and I made dinner and kept house. If he didn't make dinner the way he wanted too, I'd get yelled at. I was walking on eggshells all the time. I would go as far as to arrange the cables on the ground so he wouldn't trip over them, the time I didn't, there was hell to pay. He kept saying it was my fault or ""I'm just stressed from school"" He became angrier and angrier everyday and he started getting more and more abusive. I got a retail job and the local mall and that drove him crazy. I wasn't so dependent anymore. He began to physically abuse me, I remember having to cover bruises before work or school. And the sexual abuse got really bad. I was afraid of sex, I didn't like it, but I felt it was my duty as a woman. I would try and stretch out how long I could go without having sex with him before he would force himself anyway. I remember him opening the bedroom door and thinking ""please don't touch, please don't touch me...Shit"" I became so empty. He would beat me, nothing. He would force himself on me, nothing. After the term ended, I was living in the apartment by myself during the summer semester and he was living at his parent's house due to an internship. I loved it, I hadn't been on my on my own completely. I would do the smallest things, but they felt so good. I left my shoes out, I watched what I wanted to on tv, ate whatever I wanted when I wanted. I would quote to myself a line from the mask with Jim Carrey ""Somebody stop me!"" But the little bits of happiness weren't enough to stop my unmedicated bipolar disorder from rearing it's ugly head, I turned to r/suicidewatch for support. I began talking to two people regularly  , it felt good to have friends that liked me for me as opposed to being someone else's girlfriend or hated for being the school slut. I began confiding in them about what my boyfriend was doing. I would tell them and say ""but it's okay because..."" and I would say whatever excuse he had given me. One told me ""Are you hearing yourself right now? This is horrible, you need to find a way out."" I was IMing the other during a night class and he said ""I'm upset with you, you have the power to walk away. I know this sounds harsh, but you have to do what's best for you."" After the summer had ended, he moved back into the apartment. And I tried to hide my communication with my reddit friends, I also became more distant from my boyfriend. He found out and was furious, I was so empty at this point that I asked him to move out. My mother had come back into my life and was helping me pay rent. 

A few days later, my uncle had passed away. He came to the funeral, I was really surprised. He always said that he hated funerals yet here he was. After the service, we went to a family member's house where we had a brunch. While we were sitting around the tv watching a photo montage of my uncle, he sends me a text saying ""I didn't want to tell you, but I tried to kill myself last night."" I started to freak out and one of my reddit friends said ""it's bullshit, he's trying to control you"" When we got back to my parent's house, he asked me to go on a drive so we could ""talk"". The minute I get into the car, he told me to put my phone away. I went on to spew bullshit in an effort to get me to side with him. I told him he can stick that where the sun doesn't shine. He kept trying to get ahold of me, but I did my best to keep him away. And in the word's of forrest gump, ""That's all I have to say about that""

What I wanted to say was screw you guys. I'm not going to let what you did define me. I have stumbled since then, but I'm determined to get better. I'm working to become a victim's advocate for people like me. There's so much I wish I could say to you all, but you're not worth my time. Assholes. If you made it to the end, way to go, I wrote quite the novel. Thanks for reading"
1zkzg8,4,2014-03-04,Blown Resistor: I almost dropped out,LostMuon,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/1zkzg8/blown_resistor_i_almost_dropped_out/,"I am a first year transfer student from a community college in California. For about two quarters now I have been asking myself if Engineering is right for me. I always thought that I would love to major in any math or technological based field but I am having second thoughts. I am not sure if I am just studying the wrong way or if I am just not 'Busy' enough that I cannot get through everything. Thinking does not count as being busy by the way, that just makes matters worst. From being alive these two decades I have come to conclude that a body in motion does tend to stay in motion. Hence if I just study and study, there will be no motion to motivate me. The busy I am referring to is the kind that makes you forget about the stress that is waiting for you at the other end while maybe getting a taste of a social life. I have failed one class so far and after this quarter it will be three total. I am a very logical person and I know after having a couple F's in my transcript, an internship may seem nearly impossible. I thought about changing majors but I don't think that will solve anything. What I need is a good old friend to be able to talk to and vent all my sufferings to. Sadly, I realized that I have kicked most of my friends out of my life due to the time demand engineering classes have. I have attempted to form study groups, online study groups and even make Youtube videos to force myself to learn the material. My last attempt is to get a part time job and give myself another chance at being a hybrid student. The funny thing is, I had a job last quarter and I left it because I thought it was bringing me down but as I feared it was helping me get through all the horrible thoughts that school accompanies. I should be studying for a midterm I am going to have in a couple days but I have lost hope to be honest. I just gave up in that class after getting a 35% on my first midterm. In addition to that, I got a 32% on my other midterm leaving me with two F's and one B this quarter. I haven't even talked to my counselor which is going to be very embarrassing. I know engineering is for me but I question myself over and over again since I am not doing so good in my grades. I had a plan be to go into Computer Science given I have already taken several Java, C++, and Python courses and I enjoy doing the homework assignments but again, that was the case with math and physics a the community college level. Now that I am taking upper division courses I feel like the subject just lacks my interest. It's all theory and disconnected from what I am used to. We do have labs but they are strictly limited and lack room for creativity. I think I may have gone to the wrong University since I am not doing the hands-on part of what I like to do. I will continue to try my best and hopefully not get kicked from the major. I will be on probation this next Spring quarter so the pressure will be on. I just hope that I can make it out alive and one day become an electrical engineer for Tesla Motors."

I can figure out just about anything I put my mind to. I can quickly and easily learn languages and figure out how to solve most problems I come across.

Except theory stuff. Algorithms. Proofs. Recurrence relations. Automata. Random bullshit that isn't used much outside of academia (at least, my experiences from internships I've had). 

I can figure out how to implement an algorithm, but when it comes to figuring out how to formally prove anything, I'm totally lost. Today I got a homework back where the grader counted off for not having enough information on one problem and too much for another.

I don't care much about ""doing science"" in the actual sense (not the internet-culture ""I Fucking Love Science"" way). Once I have something working, I don't want to write a proof on why/how it work. IF I have time, I might try to improve my implementation, but that's not ""science""; at best it's engineering (at worst, ""dicking around"")

My question is: What is the best source for learning this stuff? I have always gotten very little from classes and have to research on my own to ""get it"" (youtube, stackoverflow, etc). This method works just fine for writing code for an assignment, but has been less than fruitful for figuring out recurrence relation and such.

TLDR: academia shit confuses me, how do I learn it?

I graduated from school in film/tv studies a couple years ago, but went back to school to study something else just as a back-up career (I was basically forced to... I have no interest in it). I've been working in the other industry for awhile, and I'm looking to get back into film/tv again. My film/tv experience is spotty at best - volunteer/internships that didn't really lead anywhere.

I'm able to see online what's filming on my city (Toronto), and have emailed production coordinators/managers for films and TV shows asking if they need interns. (I would like to work in the office closely to the PC/PM, but I'll take anything). I would think most of them would want someone to work for free, but most of them never email me back or just say they're not hiring right now/will keep my resume on file.

I'm not sure what I should do next - I really don't want to continue working in the field I'm in (I have no interest in it AT ALL), but I feel like I'll be stuck in it forever since no one will even give me a chance.

1zl2an,1,2014-03-04,Looking for tips on getting hired as a high school intern,samson_the_great,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1zl2an/looking_for_tips_on_getting_hired_as_a_high/,"I'm currently a senior in high school and as part of our graduation requirements, we need to complete a month-long internship during May and June. Many local businesses/self-employed members of the community volunteer to take on interns, but I also have the opportunity to pursue any internship of my choosing. The definition of internship in this case is rather loose; it can be paid or unpaid, or even just a regular job. 

I'm looking for something technology-oriented. My ideal job would be an intern for a medium to large company's IT department. I would like this to be paid, but am willing to work unpaid as it's only a month. The trouble is no one seems to take high schoolers seriously. That's why I'm looking for tips on how to convince companies/people that I can be useful to them.

I have very little work experience, none of it formal, although my grades are excellent (not that this seems to matter in the corporate world). I'm quite well-rounded, with interests as diverse as technology, Latin, business, and world travel/languages. I legitimately believe that I am a good candidate for many potential jobs, but I need help convincing employers of this. 

My problem isn't as much lack of competency as it is convincing people that I should be taken seriously.

Thanks for any help in advance."
1zl2ob,1,2014-03-04,Switching off SEO / ethical question,throwaway4762,SEO,https://www.reddit.com/r/SEO/comments/1zl2ob/switching_off_seo_ethical_question/,"Hi r/seo,

I have been interning for a consulting company for 1.5 years while I am finishing my diploma in marketing....been doing it one day per week and some evenings.

I got to work with the marketing team, they asked if I could help out with making website updates through Wordpress. so I looked and it had absolutely zero SEO so I have updated &amp; rewritten some of the content, done basic link building (difficult with consulting though), linked it up with Analytics, implemented Yoast across the entire site. In 12 months the search traffic has increased 3 x, overall UU traffic has doubled and pages are appearing in the first page of results on Google, Bing etc. They were super happy with the results, it made the board report in december.

I finished my course last year and asked if there were any jobs at the company, no there werent, so Ive been looking for a full time job instead and have stopped interning there. My prof says to include any projects Ive worked on in my CV so I did, when I gave my CV to the marketing director she was really shitty and said I can only say I worked 'as an intern' not on the website and that if she was asked for a reference she'd have to say I only interned there. 

Im pissed because thats the whole point of interning, to gain experience, and now i can't include it on my CV while she gets the glory for the website growth. I think its really unfair. I dont want to do anything destructive or illegal but I feel like they took advantage ie got a benefit from my work, didnt pay for it and arent helping me out in return. 

so my question is, can you 'switch off' SEO. i know that unless someone manages it properly its going to go downhill slowly. what happens if i switch off Yoast but don't delete it, for instance. 

or am i just being a dick and should chalk it up to experience and walk away.

Oh and a decent number wanted you to already know specialized programs/ skills/ software. And most of them said ""must have excellent communication and interpersonal skills"".

Okay so I am applying for an internship to gain experience for the first time and I must already have excellent skills? 

I know some say ""they are just trying to weed out people"" but if you don't somehow have the skills they want already, then where the hell can you learn the skills? Will anyone hire you? Will you get left behind? 

WTF? Does anyone else see this going on? What do? I mean I keep applying, but by the sound of it some internships will never want me. 


Feel free to share your internship experiences, application stories, and tips.

Unpaid internships: Are they really just as good as paid ones, or do they have issues associated with them? What are the issues? (Yes I have been keeping up with lost gen, but I wanted to know if anyone had a first hand experience in this.) "

1zledy,1,2014-03-04,"Need advice from you lovely ladies. I have a feeling I know what you're going to say, but I need to hear it.",Everylemontree,TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1zledy/need_advice_from_you_lovely_ladies_i_have_a/,"So I (25) have been dating my boyfriend (25) for a bit over 3 years.

From day one we have had vicious arguments. I am honestly shocked we have made it together this long because we really were, in every sense of the word, toxic. But we fell in love and the good times were good, and we made it out the other side. We both began to acknowledge our own contributions to the arguments and how our fears, insecurities, and past effects how we experience the world today. For the past year things have been worlds better. He has truly put effort into changing (he admits a large percentage of our issues revolve around his insecurities) and I am SO proud of the self work he has done. He is absurdly sweet to me, and very thoughtful. He does things for me other girls would give the world to have done for them.

The last 8 months we have been long distance because I moved away for school. This was always on the table our whole relationship, it was not a surprise but it still was painful. He said he couldn't do long distance and I expected us to break up. But we didn't. We have both been putting effort in to making it work (at least in my opinion) and I have been pleasantly surprised.

My boyfriend requires attention at a much higher intensity and frequency than the average person. He knows this, he agrees. Our entire relationship I have spent so much of my energy into reassuring him that I love him and things are great and I am dedicated to him. I am very very busy in school and he says he understands, but at least once a week he brings up to me that he is not feeling as connected to me as he would like and wants to work out ways that I can put more effort in. Over three years of trying to convince him that our relationship is stable and he can feel safe and secure within it. Over three years defending myself from suspicions of infidelity, needless jealousy, communicating more or less every move I make throughout the day, etc. To say I'm drained is an understatement.

After all the complaining he does, the only issue I have with him to this day is the fact that he constantly uses very negative statements. I have communicated to him many times, clearly and calmly, that when he does this it really hurts me. It hurts me that I have to constantly walk on eggshells and be ready to defend and prove my love for him. I simply cannot take it. He has cut down his number of negative statements absurdly, but it still happens. Last night it happened again, and I snapped.

I was texting him about how it is midterms and I feel very stressed by a mix of school, work, health problems, friends, roommates, internship, etc and I was really excited to go away with my friends for this coming weekend to get away. His response was ""A little bit of me too huh lol."" In other words, he implied that him and our relationship was a contributing factor to my recent stress, and he also said that my vacation was also to get away ""from him"". Imagine these sort of statements, questions, and implications about every day. for three years. three. fucking. years.

I told him no, he wasn't included in that (he really wasn't. I am very forgiving of his mistakes and move past our problems fairly quickly as I am not one for dwelling on what has already happened.), but now since he said that, yes he was now. Argument ensues. I tell him I am angry that he always makes things about him, even when they aren't, and it makes me feel like he is not supportive or respectful of my feelings. I reminded him that statements like that really hurt me. He said I was being hurtful and making him out to be a ""bad guy"" and that ""manipulative"" and that he felt justified to make a statement like that because he ""knows its true"". I never said or implied any of those things. HE DID. He also told me that he ""didn't think this (relationship) was working for me (OP) right now"". This X 1000 over three. fucking. years. 

also in the back of my mind always is back in December I found out he was cheating on me through finding inappropriate messages to a girl after he was behaving strangely. He said he only made out with her, and didn't tell me because he already planned to break it off. Although the last text I read didn't imply that at all... he later said that by ""make out"" he meant ""she kissed me"" and that he just refers to kissing as making out no matter what it entails. I decided to try and work past this and he begged me to trust him.

Now it is fair for me to note that there are many positive things in our relationship and I feel we have a very good connection and we enjoy each other. I won't go into detail for sake of space, but just keep that in mind.  I love him. I really, really do. I always have. But I am TIRED of having to prove it. TIRED of him always asking for more from me. It's starting to get in the way of my school work, which he says is so very important to him (my success). I feel like he is creating a self-fulfilling prophecy. He's worried so much about our relationship falling apart that ... it has made it fall apart.

How stupid am I being?"

My current major is information technology related but does not focus on anything in particular. We cover things like programming, human-computer interaction, implications of information technology, etc but I feel the skills I've acquired are not sufficient for a full-time job. 

Most of college I've felt unchallenged. I want to eventually get a masters in Human-Computer Interaction to become a UX/UI Designer but I don't think I have strong chances of getting into a program.

1zlnjc,7,2014-03-05,"Received internship offer, crappy pay though",shit-pay-throwaway,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1zlnjc/received_internship_offer_crappy_pay_though/,"Hello CSCareerQuestions,

I received an offer for a software engineering internship. I admit they do really cool stuff but the pay is shit - $10.00/hr to be exact. I'm a junior studying comp sci so I think its very important for me to have a summer internship, the pay is only one of the issues. 

First was when I was at the career fair, the recruiter was talking about how they are looking for interns because they are practically ""slave labor"". Next when I was being interviewed I asked about what I would be doing, she more or less told me ""you will be doing things around here that we don't want to do"". Next another thing they told me was that sometimes I will be doing system administration stuff like installing some software on computers and what not. They didn't say it was the main gig, but she did mention it. Other than that they were really nice. I know the things I say make it sound like they were evil, truth is I just think its a person who has no filter, as they seemed pretty polite otherwise.

Should I take this internship? Its a cool product that I am very intrigued, but some of the red flags, combined with the shit pay, and the fact that I make $15+ an hour as a waiter is making me think twice. I would have to work 45 hours a week, 20 at the internship and 25 as a waiter. This is so many hours a week, but I have no experience and have interviewed with 5 other companies and this was the only one to extend me an offer and I believe having experience is more important in the long run is what this sub preaches to students.

What do you guys think. I feel like responding and saying I need more money so I can quit my other job, but I don't know. "
1zlp5c,1,2014-03-05,Anxious about graduating and job search; not sure if I should still go to my counseling sessions.,sailboatsairplanes,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1zlp5c/anxious_about_graduating_and_job_search_not_sure/,"A few weeks ago I [[22F] started going to my college's on campus counseling center for anxiety about a number of things, but lately I've been feeling a little better. I have my next appointment next week but I'm not sure if I should still go. I don't feel like my problems/worries are major enough to need to talk to someone about it. They're things that pretty much everyone my age goes through. I also don't know if it'll help me anyway since the counselor and I just talk, and then she teaches me relaxation techniques.

I am graduating in less than two months and I am absolutely dreading it. Everyone is super excited but I can't get myself to be happy about it. I'm really excited to be done with school though since I absolutely hate it, but I've been really dreading searching for jobs and have been trying to put it off for as much as possible. I'll be graduating with a good GPA, dual degrees and multiple advertising/public relations/marketing internships under my belt, so in a way I know I'll be OK, but I can't shake the dread and I can't get myself started. I'm also just tired of applying for jobs. For the last two or three years I've had to apply and interview for new internships every semester, and it's really worn down on me.

I'm worrying about applying here in my home state for a job, and then I have to worry about trying to move halfway across the country with my current long-distance military boyfriend ~6 months later. I have to think about applying for a new job in the new place, which is even harder. So many things just seem unknown and up in the air. It's smarter to move only if I have a job nailed down, but what if I can't find one? Or if I do get a job, does it look bad that I was only at my first job for ~6 months? I can't bear to think about being away from my SO for so much longer. At the time of my moving, we'll have already been long-distance for more than a year. 

Sorry if this is super whiny. I guess I just needed to rant and get this off my chest. I don't know how to deal."
1zlv7w,35,2014-03-05,[Rant/Discussion] Self-teaching into employment is bullshit (mostly?),iMightNeedHalp,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1zlv7w/rantdiscussion_selfteaching_into_employment_is/,"Many of you are here because you take the field seriously and want to give good advice. That's awesome, and I applaud that. Software engineering and computer science are hard fields and should be a hard fields, and it's only going to get more complex as time marches on.

I've been messing with programming in general for about a year and a half. Like most who start out as self-taught, I followed a standard template of picking up a language from a cute ""Teach yourself X"" site or book, doing some stuff with it, pushing it to github, making some more stuff, making dumb mistakes, missing semicolons, and other general newbie crap. My stuff is crap, I realize it's crap, and everyone here has gone through the same feeling that all you make or ever will make is crap, crap, crap. It's a boot to your head in precise intervals.

So what's next? You put some things out that accomplish a function at least. You put the lotion on the website and make it look pretty or something. You push your limits and pick up a lot of stuff that isn't in those ""Teach yourself X"" courses. You've left the 'newbie island' for the ""free-for-all PvP island"" in this MMORPG. My plan was to wade through this crap, fix my math deficit at some point, then go tackle algorithms and data structures, which seems to be the benchmark 5K runner's marathon for newbie programmers. Eventually you put out some stuff that resembles a real, useful product. After accomplishing that, then I thought I might get a job. I accepted this and it's still very interesting to read and think about algos and DS. 

For some languages, there are books that have a similar function, flow, and reader involvement as the ""Teach yourself X"" stuff: just at an intermediate to advanced level. Most of these intermediate books read more like a reference. Like the standard library references. The references that are available online and sometimes have better writing than the books and are more up-to-date. For free. That makes these books useless. Maybe I should be writing useless books for money? Not much guidance from these books.

My plan was to get good. I wanted to be given a problem and have an off-the-cuff approach with napkin math *and* the ability to go research that problem properly *and* establish design requirements *and* come back with a badass presentation that was clean and professional. I wanted to consume basic $language programming, advanced $language programming, advanced-advanced $language programming, Code Complete, SICP, Mythical Man Month, all of those well known books, and finally, the holy texts of Knuth himself. Can you guess which of these I've read recently?

**So what's the core of this rant?** The gulf between the basics and employ-ability is large, strange, and filled with guesses and hit-or-miss advice. I'd be fine with a difficult bridge to cross, as long as there was a bridge. There really doesn't seem to be a bridge, or at least a consistent one.

This is not what I signed up for. I have a practical problem in that my job sucks. Programming was going to lift me out of a terrible job and a poorly chosen degree. ""Hah!"" said the software industry veteran. Even a measly position doing the most mundane of things would have been welcomed. 

You don't read about this on ""Teach yourself X"" sites. It's not their place because a bleak outlook could potentially hurt page views. They also aren't necessarily targeting career-changers because a bit of Python magic is useful to non-programmers. Even after I would have built practical stuff with the algos and DS's I intended to learn, it would still be tough to get a job according to the posts I was reading. They say this path is hard and they're right, but they aren't specific. This bothers the shit out of me. I don't know if I'm being helpful by pointing this out, but I know something stinks about the whole situation, and you seem to step knee-deep in it shortly after you get done with ""Teach yourself X"". It feels like a swamp full of crappy code.

The idea of self-teaching to employment is deceptive. I think it might be slowly fading out because now more business-leaders and decision-makers are aware of CS and programming as a science instead of a mystical skill. It was once a great path for people who grew up with tech. You can't be that ""computer whiz"" who fixes ""the gadgets"" and suddenly get $20/hr because the manager thinks your skills will look good in his business menagerie. That was the era I grew up in, and like missing out on cheap bitcoins, I missed a potential life-changer by not sticking with a tech career path. I chose health and found out I hated that.

However, picking a CS school that's behind-the-times can also potentially lead you into unemployment and debt. Maybe not, because apparently those graduates are getting hired anyway. The only saving grace is usually an internship, but betting your future on the success of an internship still seems like a hail-mary to me. A hail-mary not unlike trying to become employed through self-teaching. 

I'm still perplexed though, because according to some of you, even CS grads can't write good code. I don't hear much about the self-taught applicant code quality. I do hear that some self-taught guys are better than CS grads, and vice-versa. Is the frequency of terrible code production between these two similar? Do you get self-taught people at your door that have no business even applying to janitorial positions, just like you might get CS grads who can't comprehend Fizzbuzz (never mind write it)?

**Finally**, getting to employment through self-teaching is painful and leaves you utterly lost. You constantly wonder if it's worth wading through that swamp of crap that is your slowly improving code. You do slowly get better -- even respectable or clever -- but they will continue to push for CS grads during the hiring process. Save for the blessed few that are mathematically brilliant, who start young, or know someone willing to hand them a job based on faith, this path seems foolish to start."
1zlx1q,0,2014-03-05,I don't get it why am I fucked with student debt,What_Is_Love69,rutgers,https://www.reddit.com/r/rutgers/comments/1zlx1q/i_dont_get_it_why_am_i_fucked_with_student_debt/,"I just don't get it. I don't deserve this. I just tried to be as good of a person as I could be and now I feel really bad for my parents that their child has no choice but to become bankrupt and have the bank seize their house and live a live of despair, never being able to reproduce and ending the family line as a loser.

I don't blame my dad for not being able to contribute any money towards my tuition although his income level barres me from receiving better financial aid. He spends his entire paycheck on the mortgage and credit card debt and I personally watched that the credit card debt which cripples him was created from groceries, clothes, gas, and in general things that supported our family. 

I never felt entitled to a nice life. I understood as a child that living in a single family house was a luxury, fast food was an occasional treat, and by no means is brand name clothing okay to pay more for. It was quite a strange process the first time my dad would buy me candy I wanted on the grocery line or get me mcdonalds on the way home because I was hungry and wanted it. I am really grateful for our family being poor in nyc at first and progressing to a very comfortable life in a central jersey suburb. Then at some point, although very luckily never losing his job throughout the recession, my dad fucked up with credit cards and stuff and by the time college came around had no savings or monthly earnings to contribute. You can't really blame parents anyway as many other parents out there do save sizable sums for their kids educations but are dumbfounded by how much tuition has raised since they went to college once it comes time to pay. No I was always ok with living my days in a struggle and being poor. But I guess I imagined the poor life I was ok with as a simple one (small apartment, carpooling with wife, living by immigrant values: my kids will know and respect the word ""no"", and doing the best we can to laugh and love). The future I see now is somehow different in that if I am lucky and get a high paying job I will still pay $950 a month to the loan which will prevent me from ever accumulating savings or avoid stress. 

Yes the topic of stress. I have come to accept it as an unavoidable element of our paradigm. I do one of the ""hardest"" and thus most respectable majors here at rutgers which is a fuckload of stress. All my peers are stressed, whatever everyone's stressed including you reading this. So all I have to say about that is that college is preparing us to be stressed out and have no time for human connection which is what being poor is like. 

I am extremely resentful towards two groups of people: one's whose parents are paying for college. 

And here is the second group I am resentful towards, and really this is what I came here to say to see if anyone feels the same way I do about this: Low income students and the fact that they get GRANTS THAT DON'T NEED TO BE PAYED BACK and WORK STUDY POSITIONS that I am barred from by virtue of being poor. And a lot of these kids were cool in high school and got to have sex and party a lot and I didn't get to do shit and now they get to have better adult lives than me too :'(.

Fuck. I'll reveal I'm a junior now and I am extremely grateful that I am on track for graduating and haven't messed up with grades too bad and have to take out more loans to study more semesters like oh so many more unfortunate people I know. Last year was the first time I really started thinking about what $95,000 in loans will mean once I graduate (And granted I dormed my first year and have been commuting since which really fucks my social life/happiness over) and I had never become so mentally derailed in my life before. It's wierd because nobody as a sophmore could think ahead like I was and that drove me even more crazy cause everyone was in denial that they will get a job and make a good salary. During my month-long lapse into being mentally broken due to the inability to handle the magnitude of the situation I was in my heart beat fast almost all the time, I experienced insomnia and panic attacks for the first time, and in general I had never felt so in danger and unsafe ever in my life before. Luckily as soon as school ended my mom was helpful enough to get me professional help and that summer of taking SSRI's and taking to a therapist while having a more relaxed schedule actually calmed me down over time. Now I will turn 21 soon and although I anticipate drinking a lot I am not looking forward to not having access to professional help due to being retired from health insurance. The dumbest part of the whole episode was that NO ONE from my therapist, to my professors, to people working at suicide hotlines, to my peers, to my parents (they just interpreted me bringing it up ever as making them feel guilty), to my friends understood the grave danger I was in and many of them are in too. 

It doesn't matter whether you are engineering or whatever the fuck, your chances of getting a job are desperately low and any job you do get will have a much lower salary that you can hope for and much less benefits than your parents jobs as well. Even pharmacy majors aren't guaranteed a job anymore as much as the schools limit enrollment. The pharmacy school must raise the number of seats somewhat in order to raise tuition money to pay costs and they have no control over the number of positions in retail pharmacy going down as people don't retire and new places don't open up. And don't get me started about pre-med and med school and not being able to get a residency and law school. My heart really goes out to the Biomedical engineering pre-med's because not only will you not get into med school but you are training for a profession that doesn't exist! So the perfect plan of having a backup good job in case you don't get into med school that your teachers, parents, family friends and peers all sold to you IS A LIE.

I haven't given away my major but basically it is one of the hardest STEM ones. I once met this girl who is a dance major. WTF? So to be a dance major does that mean you are either from a poor family and got all grants or from a rich family who doesn't give a fuck and will pay for that? I will shed a tear for whoever is taking out exorbitant loans for a humanities or performance art. Hell even people who take out loans for majors kinda in the middle like public health are fucked with your only option being unpaid volunteering for senior homes and township health departments. You guys will have such a terrible time ahead not being able to find husbands that will accept your debt. (Am I being sexist? Idk but public health is %95 females right?)

Which brings me to what is making me pretty sad. Someday I will fall in love with a girl, I will want to take care of her, make her happy and give my life to her and have kids with her BUT her parents WILL NOT allow her to marry me because of all the debt I have to my name and my lack of savings and financial stability. Hell I kind of love a girl right now and as much self control I have not to marry her young because that is stupid for a bunch of reasons it really hurts me that if I want to, If I really really want to, I can't say fuck the status quo and parental expectations and societal norms and run away and be with this girl because I am already owned by a banker.

I don't see this story ending in any other way than suicide and basically all I can really see as a priority in my life is enjoying youth. If anything that is the ultimate mistake most people regret in their life right? So I am hell bent on having as much sex and getting as much fucked up as possible senior year because nothing really makes sense to me other than that youth is fleeting and I must enjoy it cause that's the only way to win in this stupid life. I know in any case having a job at graduation versus not will be better and thus I have slaved  over the internship search. It is brutal. I spend almost 2-3 hours everyday in one form or another applying and networking for internships. And I am so scared I won't get one and it will really seal the deal of me being destitute my entire life. In fact I am even going to another school for a career fair tomorrow but writing this rant has kept me up very late and I still have to research and take notes on the companies I will talk to. Oh well; this life is turning out to be quite the roller coaster ride of crazy hard classes, impossible money situations, and contact with people who get 4.0 gpa's (and are president for clubs and make a lot of money and do a lot of drugs) who keep me inspired and I am no stranger to being tired. (Man I really wish I could just be some kid who got a presidential scholarship and get a 4.0 every semester and just smoke a lot of weed. That would be the life)

What's nice about rutgers is somehow I don't feel like i'm the only one. Tbh it's really great how well I fit in here with being a stressed out, second generation immigrant, slighly above average intelligence,  middle class surburban, athiest, generally kind of a nice person. I feel like all the struggles ive mentioned I can find people to relate to here. And other schools ive visited friends at that are ""higher ranked"" and ""more prestigious"" are full of some socially awkward ass people as well as some pretentious rich people as well. And some of the ""lower ranked"" schools i've experienced are full of people of a way lower average IQ than Rutgers new brunswick which I missed a lot. But then again I am jealous of the people that go there because they are poor and get pell grants and don't have to worry about the debt issue I'm having. (Oh god did I say poor and stupid are correlated? I really need to stop. I have an internal conflict about whether it is OK to hate poor people)

Thank you. Good night Rutgers. Please let me know if you can relate."

Given that I'm learning an assortment of topics as a student, such as web, mobile, and architectural concepts, I find it hard to choose a path. I enjoy everything,  but I can't seem to master anything specifically. 

One of my questions: should I choose my path or continue exploring? I'm learning AngularJS,  with the intention to learn some back-end library to complete the link between the two.

__________________

When I was a kid, it was ""falling away"". Whenever someone hadn't been to church in awhile, one of us would eventually ask the question. ""Mama, where is Billy? I miss playing with him after church"". ""Oh, honey, his parents have fallen away"". 

When I was a kid, I pictured a demon snatching them — maybe it was Satan himself. A black-charred, scaly creature, rising from the depths of the earth, stealing them away and taking them with him to his lair, with lava running through it like a creek and sulphur gas seeping out of holes in the walls and rusty iron bars holding cells full of bad people like Billy's parents. Or, if not that, then there was a giant cliff atop which all the Christians lived happy and sober and down below, underneath a layer of clouds, all the apostates lie, the rotting corpses of formerly good people that were now bad people or maybe not people anymore at all. Occasionally the Christians would go and rescue some and they could come back to the field of Jesus. This is called missions, but that's another story.

I never wondered why they all left. I just assumed that a bad person came along and made all the people who fell away dirty and forced them to get drunk and do drugs and have pre-marital sex with lots of people and go skiing and hunting on sundays instead of just saturdays and holidays. A kid growing up in the church, I always thought that being a Christian was the best, except for maybe waking up early on Sunday and having to pray out loud at McDonald's before we ate any french fries. At McDonalds people looked at us funny as we held hands and bowed our heads over McNuggets and cups of pop, mine filled with Coke and my brother's with Sprite and my dad's with Diet. That part was not my favourite, but at least at church I got to see my friends and we got to sing songs and colour pictures of Jesus rubbing dirt in a blind man's eyes and making him see again. I never liked singing The Old Rugged Cross, but most of the other songs were fine, even though we didn't use instruments because they didn't in the New Testament, or at least that's what Preacher Steve said. 

Apostasy was always viewed in the abstract, this sudden and unexpected and involuntary thing that happens to people whether they want it to or not, and sometimes they come back all sad, with their lives in shambles and asking for forgiveness, but most of the time they don't. I always wondered what happened to the people that didn't.

In high school I underwent a form of correctional teaching — often colloquially referred to as the ""Young Men's Leadership Canoe Trip"" — and learned that apostasy happened when people flirted with sin and then were eventually seduced. Such language works quite well for 14 to 16-year-old boys. Preacher Frank told us that ""fornication"" started when you were kissing a girl and got a ""woody"". I am pretty sure I missed out on a few blow jobs during my teen years, because, in the heat of the moment I suddenly thought of Frank’s woody speech and then ran away to my car. My high school flings never lasted very long. 

My Christianity did not last very long, either. A few years outside of the bubble of my hometown, in a higher education institution, a Christian one, even, and my Christian beliefs were swept away into a sea of other childly myths. First it was the Easter Bunny, and then the Tooth Fairy, and then Santa Claus, and then the ideal of the hyper-masculine American male who played football or basketball, and then Jesus. 

One day, when I was 20 and had just returned from a sort of pseudo-mission trip from India (I was in charge of organising sports activities at a church camp, but did not do any proselytising), where I saw a lot of things that made me very angry, including a number of white people who were intent on saving all of the poor Indian kids from their own religious heritage, my mom asked me a question that I will never forget. We were camping. It was a cool spring day in the mountains, and she was talking to a church friend, the mother of three daughters, the oldest of which was 4 years behind me in school. Apparently my mother had been counselling her about what to do if your child decides it wants to stop coming to church. For whatever reason, my mother decided to ask me what I would do. I told her that I would not make my child attend church if it had a good reason to stop coming to church, so the child would have to come up with a coherent argument for why it was going to stop. This would likely involve reading a number of books, including most of the Bible, and books by Christopher Hitchens and Richard Dawkins. If the child then came back with a coherent argument for the falseness of Christianity, after doing a fair amount of research, I would allow that child to stop attending church with the family. 

The problem with my mother's question is that I liked my own advice so much that I followed it, not with my child, but with myself.

In ""real life"", if you can count my life as ""real"", apostasy is one of the most intentional things a person can do. It happens very slowly, and takes a great deal of time to cope with emotionally and mentally.  It starts when religious leaders and texts seem unable to provide an adequate answer to one or more important questions, and builds from there. 

In my case, it began when I had read enough research thoroughly debunking Creationism, of which my father has always been a huge proponent, and moved on from there. There is only so much God-commanded Old Testament genocide that one can justify before realising the errors of one's ways. Similarly, Leviticus provides a great deal of ammunition for the burgeoning non-believer. When one has found enough to ridicule in the Old Testament, moving on to a critique of problematic timeline issues in the New Testament is quite easy. 

There is a truism that exists within much of evangelical American Christianity that says that when you abandon God, God abandons you and your life is likely to fall apart. I continued living my life with high expectations for the future, half expecting God to rip the floor out from under me, in order to punish me for my apostasy. I even told God to deny me a full-ride scholarship to study in Dubai for a semester if he in fact wanted to punish me, but I got the scholarship. I then went to Israel for an internship and got attacked by radical Israeli settlers. That's a story for another day.

1zmo3z,23,2014-03-05,"Need advice on trimming, but still allowing for future growth (5.5 months)",Nude_Gingrich,beards,https://www.reddit.com/r/beards/comments/1zmo3z/need_advice_on_trimming_but_still_allowing_for/,"Recently, the past couple weeks in particular, I've had a number of people tell me that I should consider giving my beard a trim. Not shaving, or significantly shortening, just cleaning it up so that it looks less ragged. While I was vehemently against the idea at first, I've started to come around, and I am now considering doing some trimming/maintenance so that my facial hair will look a bit more professional.

Here is what it looks like today, after having balm applied and hitting it with my boar brush this morning:

While I am not as against trimming/shaping as I was previously, I still want to continue growing my beard longer. I just want to look presentable in doing so, especially with some potential internship interviews on the horizon.

I have read the trimming link in the sidebar, but it seemed targeted more toward cleaning up a few stray hairs here or there rather than shaping and maintaining a beard complete with different textures in different facial areas (curly, thinner, puffy cheeks vs straighter, thicker goatee area).

How do you guys think I should go about making this beard look semi-decent without chopping the majority of it off?"

1zmzph,5,2014-03-05,I was my parents mistake,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1zmzph/i_was_my_parents_mistake/,"My parents had known each other for about 2 months before my mother got pregnant. My mother had a stable job at a University in New York. She worked in a lab and was a biologist. She came to the USA from Colombia after she finished her studies there. My father was a student from Europe who was following an internship in New York. They met at a Spice Girls concert and started a relationship. After my mother told my father that she was pregnant AND wanted to keep the baby, he left her. She told him that he could do whatever him wanted or needed to do, but she was going to bear this child. Probably because she was raised a devout catholic. Before coming to New York she was against premarital sex. My father was furious. Her was man who wanted control over his life. His idea of how to raise a child began after years of living together with your significant other. He was a very diligent student and his father (my grandfather) was a teacher. He was an upstanding man with a bright future ahead of him. Raising a child at that point of his live would be terrible for him. And so he left. He came back from his internship early to finish his studies in Europe. 

My mother quit her job because she wanted to raise me herself. My mother told her boss directly when she got pregnant an d he told her that wouldn’t be able to keep her job if she was going to take a lot of time off to raise a child. And she didn’t want to leave me with some nanny all the time. After she quit, she moved in with her mother and sister in Florida. The following 4 year of my life I was raised with my mother, grandmother, aunt and my cousin. My cousin and I grew up like brothers, but we don’t talk much anymore. 
My family on my mother’s side is quite big as per usual with a Latin-American family. As a very young child I had a lot of cousins and other family members to play with. I still have many fond memories and friends I know I will have for the rest of my life. But my life in America would soon come to an end. Because my father would come into my life.

My dad didn’t tell anyone close to him what had happened during his time in New York and why he came back early, except for his own parents. But other than them, well not even his brother knew until much later. Back in Europe he felt like his life was ruined. He visited his university’s physiologist and after he told him what had happened, the physiologist asked him if he was suicidal, he wasn’t. But he did begin to believe that it was all ‘some kind of conspiracy’ against him. He lost his driver’s licence in New York and thought that some Colombian gang had set out to ruin his life. In his own words my father described how he felt as the following; ‘It was like my life used to be a 8 on a scale to ten and had become a six, just average while it should have been more’.  
4 years passed and after finishing his studies, getting a job and joining a group where they would talk about their problems, my dad got back in touch with my mom. He called her and said that he was ready to be a father. He came to Florida and was hailed as a king basically. My grandmother was very happy when she met my dad and she told him that I needed a fatherly voice. My parents agreed that we would move in with my dad and start living as a family. And so we left. To a country whose language I didn’t speak and the only person I really knew was my mother.
 
At first my mother was unsure if it was going to work out. She was thinking of going back to Florida. Mostly because she didn’t like how my dad was raising me. As I he was a very diligent person, also a very strict one. To this day my dad has a bit of a tendency to think that if he doesn’t have complete control over something, it will go horribly wrong. A scar left from, well... my very existence. So he was strict with me. Which my mom hadn’t ever been with me. So she asked what I wanted. If I wanted to stay or go back. And mind you I was 5 as the time. But I (apparently, as I don’t remember) I said to my mom that I wanted to stay. I wanted a dad and I wanted to let my dad be my real father.

And it worked out (mostly). There have been bad time (really bad, near divorce kind of times). But now I live a stable life with my parents and my brother and sister and we are a family.
I’m writhing this because I turned 18 recently and asked my parents about my past. The weeks before my birthday were stressfully stuffed with a crapfill of homework, deadlines and tests. And when my mom had to go to the hospital (she has been battling cancer for 4 years now) it was just too much. I told a teacher at my school what was going on with my mom and said that I wasn’t going to make 2 very important tests next week because I wasn’t mentally fit to do them and she took care of it. The following weekend I talked to my mom about how I was worried about her and just talked. Eventually I had some questions I’d had for years but I was never really ready to ask them. Now I was, and she answered them. A week later my parents and I sat together and they told me both sides of the story and I forgave them. I love them

My dad cried when he told me that he was sorry about not being there for me when I was born and the first 4 years of my life. The only other time I’ve seen him cry was when we found out my mother had cancer . I told him that the only thing I really care about is that he came back. I love him and forgive him.

1zn3bc,3,2014-03-05,What should I do with my money until I graduate? (Will be in college for two more years),[deleted],personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1zn3bc/what_should_i_do_with_my_money_until_i_graduate/,"So I see a lot of advise on here for people already out in the ""real world,"" and have to balance saving with expenses (such as rent, cars, mortgage, etc). However, I'm 20 years old and still in college (currently a sophomore). I wanted to know what you guys think is the best thing to do with my money with respect to short-term saving/investing taking into account the only real ""surprise cost"" that I need to plan for would be a new car if my current one breaks.


My Situation:

- I don't have any formal student loans; my parents right now are covering everything out of pocket. After I graduate college, they would like me to repay part of my education ($50,000) within a ""reasonable"" time frame.

- No debt (other than college) besides my current ~$200 credit card balance which gets automatically drawn in full from my savings account every month.

- Because I've had job since I was 14 (especially due to the internship I had last summer) and am very frugal, I've managed save up roughly $10k.

- Currently, ~$1,900 of that is in stocks I purchased last summer spread across three companies (one I would consider risky, one medium risk, and one blue chip). The remaining $8,000 is in cash, with the majority sitting in a savings account making 0.75% interest.

- I have another internship lined up for this summer would should make me roughly $9,000 before taxes and will probably (hopefully) have another for next summer making roughly the same.

- Since I am going to have very few expenses for the next ~2.5 years (and thus won't need to get to it), I have no qualms about locking away my money into a short-term bond or CD.

- Since I have a more money than I'll 'need', I have no problems with (a reasonable amount of) risk.

- I want to pay back my parents as soon as possible after I graduate (I hate owing people money, especially relatives or friends) while still having enough for a rainy day fund

- My current car has 265,000 miles, but is in surprisingly good shape considering that fact. I think it will actually last until graduation (it's a manual so the transmission is virtually indestructible, has a newish clutch, and newish struts), but regardless, I want to have roughly ~$4-5k available in case it does break.

- I want to have a reasonable amount of money upon graduating to afford an apartment (I don't want to move back in with my parents), a new car (if my current one doesn't break), utilities, etc until I get a job


Since interest rates right now are piss poor, I was leaning more towards putting the majority of my current $8k into the market. I was thinking one of the following:

- Buy $1000 worth (each) of 6 or 7 blue chip stocks that pay dividends

- Buy $1000 worth (each) of 4 or 5 riskier stocks, and pick up some long term put options to mitigate the risk. Keep the rest of the money out of the market in bonds or CDs to mitigate the risk a little more

- Put $6000-7000 in a reputable mutual fund or index fund

Also, I think the money from my internship this summer will go into a safer investment such as bonds or CDs which will act as my new (used) car fund if necessary.

Do any of you have any tips or suggestions for me on what I should do to better prepare for my future in the real world?

Thanks.

I will also be sharing the pizza (if the pizza God's have so graced me on this day) with my lovely girlfriend and our friends tonight.

I am looking at a potential summer Internship, and I will be offering many pizzas during that time so I will absolutely be paying it forward.

**Michigan** is my home, as I know it is a question I must address. As such, there are many pizza places around especially the big three.

Thank you for reading and I hope you all have an amazing [hump day](http://imgur.com/Rc35vKx)"
1zncka,333,2014-03-05,"When a mother denied her ""Make A Wish Child"", her wish",Keoki_808,TalesFromRetail,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/1zncka/when_a_mother_denied_her_make_a_wish_child_her/,"I had the pleasure of working on fall season for a very popular theme park in Florida. It was for school as kind of an internship program and I had tons of fun. It was great making guests happy and entertaining them as well.

I worked in retail, at the front of the theme park, where we pretty much handled all of the photo printings (when you enter the park, you get your picture taken, and we are the place you come to get your photos printed up). We also were responsible for printing up and setting up photo packages for those who took pictures at one of the many character meet and greets. 

It's pretty routine. Guests receives a card at the meet and greet, with the time and a number for their photo(s). They bring the card after 12 pm (which is when we get our first batch of photos), to us and we can just sell them the photo, or we can set them up with photo packages (and they could also choose to have posters, mousepads and tshirts printed up). sometimes, the meet and greet photos doesn't turn up well (blurry, the flash didn't go off, etc) and we try to call ahead to the area that it happened to see if the character was still there, to get the guest to retake a picture. Most times, the guest just smiles and says ""its alright, we have several on our own camera"" or ""we'll just come back tomorrow"" . In some very rare instances, we'll work with the character department to see if someone can bring up the character in question to take a quick photo op in our area so that the child or group can get the photo they want (usually because its their last day, or they weren't able to make it to the original meet and greet area, etc). We could be very accommodating, and of course, its all about making the guests happy. 

And this is where in the story, that I got majorly pissed at a mother for thinking more about herself, than about her child, who was a ""Make A Wish"" recipient. As many of you know, most ""Make A Wish"" children are usually terminally ill, or on their way to curing whatever ailment they have, and are offered trips, opportunities to be able to get one happy moment, in their young lives to NOT give a damn about their ongoing medical treatments. For Make a Wish recipients, we are allowed to give them their initial photos for free (up to 3) and offer a small discount on any photo packages they wish to purchase. Also, keep in mind that Make A Wish paid for the child's entire family for her to attend our Theme Park (tickets, hotel, airfare), so you'd think that the mother would be grateful.

So, it was about 2 in the afternoon, and we were expecting our first rush of Meet And Greet photo guests to arrive. A line started to form (about 20 people) and there are three of us behind the counter trying to get these people their photos and see if they are interested in purchasing photo packages. I was the one retrieving the printed photos and my other two co-workers were manning the registers. We get to about the 5th to the last person in line, which is the Worst Mother of the Century (from here on out will be known as WMC), CoWorker 1 (CW1) and CoWorker 2 (CW2)

CW1 - Hi, may I help you.
WMC - (doesn't say anything - hands over five meet and greet cards)
CW1 - Okay just give us a minute while we get your photos. 

CW1 hands me the cards and I quickly retrieve the five photos. I then saw that three of them, the camera flash didn't go off and was sad to see that it was the three that had the child in it (none of the five btw had the mother with the child with the character or any other family members, it was just 3 with the child and the character and 2 of the WMC and the character).

I brought this to the attention of CW1 and we both profusely apologized for the issue with the photos and tried to offer some solutions so that the child will receive her free photo with the character. We even offered to call down to our Character office to see if we could arrange a small meet and greet with the Character in question, and the child so that the child could get her picture. 

WMC wouldn't have any of it. She argued with CW1 as to why the pictures weren't good, and that her child as a Make a Wish recipient, and that we couldn't do our jobs. We again apologized and offered her again, that we would more than happy to see if CHARACTER was not busy, and would make a special appearance in OUR building so her child can take a picture with the character, and that it would just be her and the CHARACTER and any other person she wants to be in the photo with her. This would take all of 10 minutes to arrange, and have the CHARACTER in question to appear.

WMC still wouldn't have it. She just looked at the 5 photos, and only took the 2 good ones. the 2 that only HAD HER in the picture with CHARACTER. Not any of the photos, with her child and the character.

CW1 was just livid. She made the immediate call to just give all five to the CHILD, and we gave her some pre-printed autogrpahed photos of the character in question to her, along with some coupons to redeem at any one of the food service kiosks nearby for ice cream or popcorn. CW1 directly applogized to the child for any problems, and that if she would like to have an in person photograph session with the CHARACTER to call one of the many Customer service numbers at any of the parks, and we would help to arrange it.

WMC just walked off with her child in tow, and the line that was behind her (about 3 people) couldn't believe what had just happened.


How can anyone deny their ""maybe"" dying child, a photo op with their favorite CHARACTER?

1znet7,2,2014-03-05,Advice for an aspirant,BazookaBlitz,consulting,https://www.reddit.com/r/consulting/comments/1znet7/advice_for_an_aspirant/,"Hi all,

This is gonna be a bit longer. So, bear with me.

**My Background:** I have a computer science degree from one of the top 10 schools in the world. I'd realized that coding/geeking/tweaking wasn't gonna be my cup of tea around the end of the 3rd year but by that time I was too deep into my degree that switching wasn't an option. So, I carried through with some courses which were more non-technical in nature. 

**My Experience**: I have a year and half internship experience before graduation which was your run-of-the-mill Enterprise Software development in a small firm. And after graduation I have been doing Test Development (QA) for a mid size corporation. I have also started taking Project Management classes and will hopefully write PMP sooner or later.

**My Problem:** I understand that getting that tag of QA on your resume does more harm than it helps. I have been applying to a lot of places and from couple of places I have also gotten phone interviews.  So, at this point I think it may not be my resume but my phone interview skills. 

**My Question:** If I want to work as a Technical/IT/Product Consultant what are the steps/things I am missing at present? What do I need to do if I am not missing anything so far?

Thanks a lot in advance!"

1znga7,1,2014-03-05,Can't decide between these schools which to transfer to,[deleted],college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/1znga7/cant_decide_between_these_schools_which_to/,"I am about to transfer from my community college to a 4 year university.  I have never lived on my own so I am really excited!  I have gotten into a few universities but have narrowed it down to two, mainly because these are the cheapest.  I can't decide which to pick. 


****University of Pittsburgh****

Positives
1. it's in Pittsburgh, which is a great city!
2. it's well ranked. 63 on US News. 
3. they accepted all of my credits and I would only need to take 3-4 classes once I get there to complete my general education requirements.
4. i'm sure i could get some solid internships in the city

Negatives
1. transfers don't get on campus housing and i'd have to get an apartment
2. it's $17,000 a year for a PUBLIC school for tuition alone and they don't offer transfer scholarships
3. the large class sizes are something i'm concerned with especially because I want to get a good gpa because I plan on going to law school
4. i have heard that Pitt is a little grade deflated.  I am more than willing to work hard but I really want to keep up my 3.8+ gpa for grad school.



****University of Tampa****

Positives
1. It's in sunny Florida! I really would like to live somewhere warm for a change.  Also, it's in the best area of Tampa.
2. I was accepted to the honors college which has a cool opportunity for a few students to go to Oxford each semester along with other perks.
3. I got an $8,000 a year merit scholarship making the tuition $17,000.  This is the same as Pitt.
4. I can live on campus.
5. I could probably get a better gpa due to honors college small class sizes and it being a less competitive environment. 

Negatives
1. It is kind of far from home. 15 hour drive. 
2. MY MAIN CONCERN: it's not nearly as well-known or ranked as Pitt.  I actually only applied because they emailed me a fee waiver since I'm in Phi Theta Kappa.  I am DEFINITELY doing grad school afterwards and really want to go to a top 10 law school so I don't know how much my undergrad this will affect it.  3. The price is also a negative, it's still kind of expensive but the same price as my state school.


I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO! If Tampa was as well ranked as Pitt I'm 99.5% sure I'd go there.  But the fact that Tampa is such a regional school really concerns me that it's a waste of money if I could just go to Pitt.

Do any of you have any suggestions or advice?

1zngq1,3,2014-03-05,Terrible GPA in non-degree required classes. And I Will Take 2 Years Longer to graduate. What are my chances?,ClassicMilds,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1zngq1/terrible_gpa_in_nondegree_required_classes_and_i/,"Hi, I am a junior at a reputable state university. I took a lot of not-required-whatsoever classes before I decided to be a CS major and had terrible grades.I have a terrible GPA and by graduation I think I will end up with a 2.6-2.7 GPA. However in the 39 odd classes I need for BS Computer Science I have 3.5 GPA Is there any way I can write this better on my resume since I think good companies do like to know GPAs. I have good grades in my core classes and specially in my last 50 credits I have over 3.6. I have interest in system dev, computer security, or software dev if I cannot get masters at a good university. I did great my freshmen year but I lost interest in college because it felt like relearning highschool. I could barely afford college so I left it before I realise there are things in the Computer Science coursework that would be fun to learn in a class and I want to work in a good company. I was trying to really figure out what to do with life till then. I have been coding since I was very young as that was my hobby and I wanted to challenge myself and learn more by taking other classes.  I understood the concepts but I had no passion for most of them. So I came back to Computer Science and it has been very fun and I managed to get my classes finished for the most part. I love coding the most so I would love to work in this field. I cant afford to stay out of college unemployed for a month since I have lots of student loans and private loans so I will try to start job application right after my summer internship (which I hope I get an answer for soon). 

I wanted to know that are my chances of getting a job at a company leading in the computer science field? Would i even be eligible for interviews with sub 3.0 GPA?

What can I do more to have a chance if I am screwed? 

extra:
I have dont plently of extra stuff like solving lots of projecteuler, pythonchallenges, check-io, etc. recently I have made sample websites for fantasy football, some win C# apps, I love functional programming and passionately trying to learn more and more each day. I absolutely would love to study at a place where CS is amazing but I know I have bad GPA. I love reading books, and coding for fun more than working for school and I think that has come back to bite me. "
1znh5e,397,2014-03-05,Ukraine. How and why we ended up here? All the dirty stuff you always wanted.,trznx,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/1znh5e/ukraine_how_and_why_we_ended_up_here_all_the/,"Hello Reddit

This is a post about Ukraine, but not like the ones you see every day with news and pictures of ongoing protests or Crimea situation, but rather how it all began and why are we here in the middle of a crisis. It’s a follow up to this great post by /u/Nathan_Flomm, so give him some credit. The problem with his post is that’s the end of a long series of events, not the beginning. Long story short — we protest and riot not just because of some agreements with EU or Russia, it’s more complicated. It is a very big read (sorry), so if you don’t want the whole thing, skip to the “2010-2013” part. If you want even shorter story, go to “corruption” part. And if you want a tl;dr, go straight to “to sum up”. I’m not gonna focus on today’s events, reddit has many great posts about that, and it’s just too much controversy and false information on that, so I don’t want to dig in. People tend to react very impulsively if you talk Russia or Crimea today. Too much hype, propaganda and lies, so let’s leave it at that. 

**Introduction**. I browse reddit for a long time, every day I come here to find a post by Ukrainian about what’s happening, and I can’t find one. The only one I saw was an AMA of a protester, but that was not about history. It’s like there are not so many of us or we’re just lazy. So I replied in the post above and many people actually asked me to write it, so here I am. First of all, I’d like to apologize for the text itself, I’m totally not a fluent English speaker and haven’t got any practice in a long time, so feel free to pm me the edits I need to do to the post. 
It’s more important to understand the background on all of these event, than the riot itself and it’s outcome. People should know what is really happening in our country for the last couple of years. We will need to go way back to 2004 and maybe even the 90s, so you could understand the mentality of our people and their basic needs such as corruption. Yup. Let me put it this way: money equals power, right? But in here, money equals complete impunity. You can kill, steal, take away other people’s property and rights and no one cares as long as you pay. You can (and actually must in some cases) bribe police, judges, officials, irs, teachers, surgeons, lawyers, whoever you can come up with. If you ever watch Boardwalk Empire, it’s kinda like Ukraine in the 90s and mostly now, just with the booze.
I’m 24 and live in Kiev, not an active protester or a radical, just a regular guy, so my perspective is not as biased and has more insight on the stuff inside the country. I hope  all Ukrainians who read this can contribute to the story. Oh yeah, I’ll try to add as many links in English as possible, but some of the reports and news just can’t be found outside Ukraine, so you can believe my word or use google translate for it. I hope someone will actually read it till the end. Thank you.

**The 90s and The Family**. It all started with the USSR collapse. We call it “the wild 90s”, when there was no law, and everyone could do anything with the country. Imagine state factories, all the heavy industry and energy suppliers were taken away from the government and acquired by former Soviet elite and newly formed “mafia”, or just some bald bandits. You can read about it here([link](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privatization_in_Russia)), it's about Russia, but same goes for Ukraine. This is the time we got our first oligarchs like Rinat [Achmetov(link)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rinat_Akhmetov), and [others(link)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukrainian_oligarchs) 

All of them were or are now deputies, ministers or some sort of high officials. Oh yeah, some of them are crooks, some of them are killers, some of them are racketeers. Many of our deputies are millionaires or even billionaires, and have big enterprises (which they actually can’t own because of the gov work but who cares). For example, did you know our dear president Yanukovich is an [ex con(link)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viktor_Yanukovych#Criminal_convictions)? And he actually was in jail twice. 
The Ukrainian page of his bio tells that his masters degree in international law is fake, so our president is not only a con, but he also doesn’t have any education besides being an auto mechanic. 
His [son(link)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oleksandr_Yanukovych) is an oligarch too, and he became one right when his dad was running the office. Coincidence?
They are so called [“Family”(link)](http://uk.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C2%AB%D0%A1%D1%96%D0%BC%27%D1%8F%C2%BB_%D0%AF%D0%BD%D1%83%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B8%D1%87%D0%B0 ) (sorry, no English link), a small group of people from Yanukovich's friends and family who control a very significant amount of Ukraine’s economy. 

That’s just a fast flashback for you to understand what kind of men represent us in parliament and the world. The only people who go to politics in our country are those kind of guys — they do it for the money and legal immunity. I’ll get back to The Family later.

**2004-2010**. In 2004 we had a president election, and Yanukovich was a candidate introduced by president Kuchma. His opponent was Victor Yuschenko. In the middle of the campaign he was [poisoned(link)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viktor_Yushchenko#Dioxin_poisoning_with_Tetrachlorodibenzodioxin ). He lived, but his face was disfigured. It could’ve been a coincidence, but 5 years earlier another opposition candidate died a [strange death(link)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viacheslav_Chornovil#Death_and_remembrance) — 
And you may also know about [Gongadze](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassette_Scandal) case, in which president Kuchma was involved. No one to this day knows exactly what happened in 1999 and 2004, but since it happens not the first time, we kinda accept that president or some of his men did this to Yuschenko, Chornovol and Gongadze. There were others, but that’s a different story. 
So, as the election goes on, it becomes clear Yanukovich is winning. But we get numerous reports about fake voting: same people vote couple times in different districts, votes are being manipulated, bulletin disappear and reappear, even dead people vote for Yanukovich. Clearly, it was all a lie, so we had to stand up. It was the [Orange Revolution(link)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orange_Revolution). The result of this peaceful protest was a new election, which Yuschenko won. Timoschenko was among his allies back then. He’s a very intelligent person, he believed in compromise, in democracy and that Ukraine can be a better country. But the thing is — his “allies” and, of course, newly formed opposition had a different view on politics. He surrounded himself with controversial politicians, who didn’t pursue the goals they proclaimed at Maidan in 2004, Yulia Timoschenko got to be a PM and blew it in 2005, she and Yuschenko became enemies, Yulia and Yanukovich (former enemies) form some kind of a weird opposition, people lose faith in Maidan and all the promises, they feel cheated. The promises were simple: more jobs, more money to social programs, less taxes, less corruption, etc. They failed almost at all of that. I can’t say it’s Yuschenko’s fault, more like our community, our people wasn’t ready, especially the oligarchs. Yuschenko changed our constitution to give more power to the parliament and leave less to him, guess how that turned out?
Yanukovich and his Party of Regions (PR) form a majority in parliament by bribing and threatening other deputies. So they now could’ve lobby everything they wanted to, and if parliament didn’t suit their needs they would just block it. [Here(link)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QWQtGQdZs) you can see how our deputies fight, it happened quite often. 
The routine for a year or two was like this: a) parliament isn’t working; b) parliament is blocked with force and isn’t working c) deputies have made an agreement on some of the “bad” laws and voting for them. So we had a political [crisis(link)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_Ukrainian_political_crisis) in 2007 
And then [another one(link)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_Ukrainian_political_crisis ) in 2008. 

And this is how our parliament works. we have 450 deputies but they are too busy to attend their job, so they have special people to vote for them. at the beginning you can see there's no one in the place but still the monitor says it's more than 200 deputies present. and then they [vote...(link)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83e6FxiOd1w)
In 5 years we had 5 prime ministers, 4 times the cabinet of ministers changed and we even had to re-elect parliament, shit just wont work! The government wasn’t doing it’s job at all. All Yuschenko could do is gather opposition again and again to try and talk them into something rational, but they pursued their own goals. As I told you before, political power gives you unlimited possibilities and money, so all you want to do is stay in your chair as long as possible. People got tired of this, it was obvious that Yuschenko won’t be a president again. In 2010 election he got only 5.5% of the votes opposed to 40% in 2004 first round. Quite a drop, eh? The point of this paragraph is to tell you that no one wanted Yanukovich back in the day, but after years and years of stagnation, people were just tired of all that bs, prime minister and president fighting each other every day, parliament not working and so on. 

**2010-2013**. Yanukovich won the election. His opponent was Timoschenko, and many people dislike her because she’s too loud. Like a bitch. She’s smart and knows how to speak to people, but her personality and her past as PM draws voters from her. Yanukovich, on the other hand, is not quite smart (seriously, he’s in a lot of memes, like your Bush), in 2004 he couldn’t even speak Ukrainian (the president doesn’t know his country’s language, how’s that?), which is required to be an official (but who cares right?), but he’s seen not as bad as the others, if you can put it like that. I actually voted for him, many people did, and we were truly sorry about that in a year. The thought was like this: if the previous government was all a bunch of pussies, this tough eastern guys should be better, at least not worse. Ha. Ha. So they go full retard and do all kinds of cool stuff, like:
* They got [1996 Constitution(link)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_Ukraine#2004_and_2010_amendments_and_2014_return_to_2004_amendments) back, so president got back all his power 
* They changed the way we [elect deputies(link)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukrainian_parliamentary_election,_2012) from party-based system to mixed, where half is party-based and other half is elected in 225 districts, so it was favoring them 
* They changed the tax laws and to this day it changes every couple of months. It wasn’t bad, but it’s still ongoing and as a small entrepreneur I just don’t know what will happen in a month or next year. I could be out of business because of this.
* They raised the retirement age for men and women to 65/60 years (+5 years)
* Opposition leaders (Lutsenko and Timoschenko) went to jail. It’s not like they were clean, no one in our politics is, but this was made just to shut them up.
* [Azarov(link)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mykola_Azarov) as a pm. He’s just a bad joke. He doesn’t speak Ukrainian to this day, at all, he reads of the notes they give him and that sounds embarrassing. He confuses letters. Imagine Obama confusing O and E in many of his words. He’s an ongoing meme, and I can’t explain you the joke, but he actually once said bloodtities instead of bloodsuckers. 	
* Euro2012 was a disaster. You remember Sochi right? It was something like that — corruption, nothing is ready by the deadline, enormous budget and so on. 
* Raiders become a normal thing these days. English Wikipedia says raid is buying stock or a part of the company to undertake it. That’s too complicated. Why would you do that if you can just have some judge rule it’s now your company? The bandits could take your property, your company, your land if they want to. I’ll talk about it later.

* The so called Family took over like half of ukraine’s businesses. This is the worst. Lets say you have a business, even something small like a carwash. One day the guys will come and tell you that you owe them money from now, each month. OR if you’re business is big enough, they would just take it from you. OR force you to make one of them your partner so he could get his share. I own a small business, and this shit frightens me quite often. It’s just I’m too small to get in this kind of stuff. I’ll talk about it later too.

* Nothing is really getting any better. If I look back 5 years, nothing changed: corruption, bad medicine, bad education, no social programs, pressure from irs, insane inflation, low income. Yeah yeah I know everyone in probably every country thinks that way, but Ukraine is going down in quality of life, population is constantly dropping (from 52 million to 45 in a decade), we have massive debts and we have nothing to pay them with. Politicians are stealing millions and everyone knows about it. People get killed by officials and the get away with it. 

* They also wanted to change the labour laws to essentially make you work not 40 hours a week, but 60. Unions would lose all their power (not like have much now). And if you’re an intern, company could’ve not pay you for several months. You get a job, work there for some time and they can just throw you out and pay you nothing. 

* Kharkov agreements. Ukraine is dependent on Russian gas and oil, so every year we have to fight with them for a acceptable price. It's an indicator of our foreign policy: if we did well this year (according to Russia), we get a normal price, if we were talking to Europe too much the prices go up. At some point we had the highest price on gas in whole Europe and we had to buy more than we could consume. So we have to bargain over our gas prices almost every year. For example, couple years back we gave up half of the company that imports the gas to Russia, and in Kharkov we signed an agreement to have Russian fleet stay in Crimea for another 25 years. That fleet is one of the reasons we have that situation right now. So in return we don't get free gas, we just get a normal price as every other European country. We put up. Because there’s nothing we can do about it.

This is 2011, only a year after his election, and Yanukovich is [opening(link)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhZZdPeQGqk) a stadium for EURO2012. As you can hear, people don’t really like him already, and that’s a 60000 seat stadium. How can you win all the votes at the election and get booed in a year?

In a year he still had some support, in two years he had none, every single one of who I know regrets he voted for him, and so do I and pretty much all the people, even in his home region of Donetsk. It was getting more and more obvious that he wouldn’t make it the second time in 2015 election. But, there’s always hope, and the name of his hope is corruption.

**Corruption** in Ukraine and why we hate our officials. I don’t really know what’s the reason for this, and how we can overcome it, but the will to give and take bribes are in our blood, it’s like a mentality of all the ex-USSR people. Maybe it’s because in USSR you could only get some decent stuff if you were some high official in Party or knew someone or were a relative. Maybe it’s just because in the 90s you could steal everything you want and get away with it. Maybe it’s because even now half of our laws isn’t working and you encounter corruption on a daily basis. Let me tell you some real life stories. 

1.	Medicine in our country is free (on paper), but government doesn’t give a lot of money to hospitals and doctors. Or maybe they even do, but most of it just don’t get to the destination. After all, our health ministry officials need those new jets and mansions. So imagine you brake your leg, what do you do? Oh by the way most of the people doesn’t have that fancy insurance stuff. So you go to the hospital and they say it will cost you $500 for the operation on your leg (300 to the surgeon, 200 to the an anesthesiologist), you have to buy all the meds and rent a place in a room. I remind you, this is a free hospital. If you don’t have the money for a place in the room, they will put you in the hallway, just like that. One time I actually had to bribe a doctor to get an MRI because they thought I was having a stroke. No money – no MRI. All of this is ok in a normal private clinic, but in state hospitals you get awful treatment, old equipment, shitty attitude and you have to throw money at them constantly. In a free clinic. And what if you’re having a baby? Oh that’ll cost you $800, or even a $1000 + the meds and the bed and so on. Not like you need your money for the baby. $1000 is a decent salary in Kiev, above the average. [Link](http://ivona.bigmir.net/pregnancy/article/370672-Skol-ko-stojat-rody-v-Kieve--Opyt-stolichnyh-rozhenic)

2.	Education? Well if you need to get your kid to the kinder garden, you should get in the line before he’s even born, it could take 5 years. Or you can add some money to it, couple hundred dollars to make it faster. Should I say it’s a regular state kinder garden? And don’t get me started about universities. You want a C? That’s a hundred in most universities in Kiev. It can be more, depends on the teachers and your field. When I was choosing where to go, in one place they had 40 places on econ, 32 of which were bought out even before the exams. So we had 8 places for 173 people, my score was 9th. You can get degrees and diplomas for money, you can never attend a single lecture and be a bachelor or even a master with all the documents. 

3.	Police. If road police stops you — they want money. Oh and they actually use illegal equipment that was banned in Ukraine. If you want your drivers license, you should pay for it. I actually don’t have one, but my friends tell me that exams are flawed and you can get like two identical questions with a different «right» answers. I don’t know who is even hated more – the police or the officials. High ranked police officers are untouchables, they are pretty much the same as deputies or oligarchs. If you see a police patrol on the street, you don’t feel safe, more like the opposite – some kind of insecurity or even fear. I heard this story about road police, that they need to pay to their bosses for the equipment they use — radars, cars, visors. You take a speed radar with you on your watch? You need to bring $100 in the evening, do what you want. I tend to believe it’s true. Here’s an [article(link)]( http://roadcontrol.org.ua/node/715) that starts wih the words “drivers greatest fear on the road is road police”, and it’s about how they pick their targets to blackmail and how much they earn. But it’s 4 years old so it doesn’t represent the actual amount of money they get today

4.	Raids. As I told before, if you have something The Family is interested in, they can take it away. It's very simple, they sue you and the judge (he gets his cut) rules that this company no longer belongs to you. Next day armed guys break in, throw you out, change locks and tell you to stay out. It also happens with real estate, expensive buildings, land and factories. Everything can be taken away the same way. [Igor Kolomoyskiy(link)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ihor_Kolomoyskyi), one of oligarchs, owner of the biggest ukrainian bank [PrivatBank(link)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PrivatBank), does this and he does big. His group acquired some of the largest mining and processing state companies, mines and chemical factories. Their proccess is the same: you buy a part of the company or some shares, better if it's state owned, and then you sue them to get control of what you can get. And one of the biggest raiders is Yanukovich's son, [Aleksandr Yanukovich](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oleksandr_Yanukovych), he owns MAKO group, and has his interests in banks, building, finance and resourses. 

5.  Judges and laws. If you have money, you can buy yourself impunity, indulgence, freedom — call it as you want. If you're a prosecutor’s [son-friend-nephew-dog(link)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mazhory), it's your lucky life — you can kill people, rape people, raid people and you'll be off the hook. I know that happens in US too, I read your news, but we have it almost every day. 

 -Some guy crashed into a bus stop, people die. No one’s charged. 

 -Some deputy's assistant beat the girl up almost to death and nothing happened to him. 

 -Three guys raped the girl and burned her and left to die on a construction site. Nothing would've happened but she lived and someone found her. She told what happened and the guys went in custody. You should read it, [tragic story(link)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Oksana_Makar). 

 -Two cops and a taxi driver [raped a girl(link)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape_of_Iryna_Krashkova) and threw her out in the woods to die. they even came back to kill her but couldnt find her. she lived to tell the story, and people almost burned down the police station. Apparently, it wasn't even their first victim.

 -Judge’s assistant (by the way look how young and hot she is, and driving a mercedes suv, thats about a 70 grand car) drives over a woman, woman dies, [she's still free(link)](http://news.bigmir.net/capital/478055-SMI-Pomoshnicy-sydi-sbivshyu-nasmert-jenshiny-v-centre-Kieva-amnistirovali.). Young stupid bitches in expensive cars get in road accidents every day, actually. All of them are some kind of secretaries or assistants of deputies, judges or other officials. 

[Tenders(link)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_for_bids). Government can't just buy something of a random guy, they must justify it by running a tender and choosing the best offer. Needless to say, all the big tender are split inside The Family or their friends from PR. And that's millions and millions of dollars from the budget. And it's not like we need a car for 100k, let's but it from our friend. Not only he's our friend, but he will also sell us this car for 300k and will give us a 100k cut of his 200k profit. If we have a tender, be sure Party of Regions will win it. Here's an article in russian about tenders in [april 2013(link)](http://forbes.ua/business/1352028-aprelskie-tendery-10-pobeditelej).  For example, Aleksandr Yanukovich got some tender for coal suppliement, and sold it to the state for three times of it's normal price. That's actually happens every day. You need to buy some pencils for your Ministry? Make a company, buy pencils for 10 cents, sell it to parliament for a dollar. Not for 20 cents, that’s madness! 50 cents at least! It happens with every single item or service in the budget. This is how we lose millions and billions of tax money. For example, our roads cost more than America’s, and i wish you would never seen them! Pavement cracks in a year and you have to “repair” it over and over again. And that's more money for the guys who steal the budget money for roads. Just read the names of the [articles(link)](http://forbes.ua/search?q=%F2%E5%ED%E4%E5%F0)!

 -Company that won tender was created AFTER the tender has ended

 -Kharkov governor's friend got 400m in tenders

 -The tender for Ministry of Health is won by the head's son

 -Another tender won by her son! Incredible!

 -Yanukovich and Achmetov split the coal tender for 366m 

and so on. The building industry suffers from that too. If you need to build something, you'll need a ton of licences, bribes and inspections. Repercussion of this is an enormous price grow on any real estate, especially apartments. We mostly have houses with 20 floors, so about 300-500 aps in the building, and they say the owner (builder) buys half of them to create fake demand and rise prices even more.

Here's a real story from one of my friends. His mom owns a small shop (or maybe you should say a big kiosk), it earns about $600-700 a months, that's not a lot, but if you have several, you can live of it. One day these guys come in and says that now you will pay us $1000 a month. Of course they don't listen to reasoning, $1000 or you don’t work here. So she refused. Two days later, the kiosk was gone. For real, they got a crane and stole the whole thing.
Here's a story from me. I was sitting in a cafe near some market with lots of shops and kiosks, and these creepy men come in — bald, big, fat, leather jackets and small eyes. If you ever saw ""Russian mafia"" or “Russian bandits” — that's exactly how they looked. I couldn’t even believe this type exists in 2013

But they just sit at the next table and talk about who gets money from what kiosk, who owes them money for ""protection"" and so on. it's like a bad parody on godfather, but it's all true. Then a guy comes in and brings one of them the money. Not enough. Are you trying to fuck with me? Where's my money? Tomorrow! Or we'll talk privately! It was scary. He took a knife and cut the table with the word BRATVA, something like a slang name for bandits in the 90s. wouldn't believe that this is happening if I didn't see it.

If you write ""deputies assistant"" in Russian (помощник депутат) on youtube, you'll get all sorts of videos about raping, car accidents, drunk driving, narcotics — and that's only the first page! That's not Ukraine, but all that happens in Russia pretty much happens here too. Drunk driver hit a woman and shot  policemen? I bet he's a judge and he's gonna be free tomorrow morning! Or maybe you should try ""drunk policeman"" (Russian: “пьяный милиционер”) — drunk policeman stabs a pregnant woman, drunk policeman beats a man, drunk policeman shoots at people, drunk policeman peeing in the public place, drunk policeman hit a woman with a baby on a crosswalk and so on. Add again, that's not even the full links of the first page. 

On the other hand, people are willing to bribe. We are so used to it, that we don’t just accept it, we encourage it, because sometimes it can give you an edge over your competitor, it can resolve your problems faster, it can get your stupid kid to school etc. So for the last 20 years everyone lived with this corruption like it's a natural part of our life. But Yanukovich took it to a whole new level, he shits on everyone around him and doesn’t give a fuck about consequences, because he's sure there will be none. It was somewhat true. If you're controlling half of the countries companies, even state owned, what can happen to you? You have all the money and power you’ll ever need. And if someone’s too greedy or not willing to comply we just kill him.

We had this deputie, [Kravchenko(link)]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuriy_Kravchenko), he was shot. In his own house. Two times to the head. They said it was suicide. 
We had this other guy, [Kushnarev(link)](http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%A3%D0%B1%D0%B8%D0%B9%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B2%D0%BE_%D0%95%D0%B2%D0%B3%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B8%D1%8F_%D0%9A%D1%83%D1%88%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%80%D1%91%D0%B2%D0%B0), who went hunting with his friends and never came back, they said he accidentally shot himself in the stomach with a shotgun. Wikipedia has an interesting fact about that murder: no one knows who were with him exactly. It happens, not like someone was sad about it.


**To sum up**: no one likes Yanukovich and the Family, prime minister is a walking joke, most of the deputies and ministers are crooks, murderers and bandits, they own most of the country’s wealth and every big state or private company. More like we hate them. People are killed and no one is punished, women are raped and no one can do anything about it. Sometimes it's scary to  own a business, because it can be shot down at any moment. Social programs, schools, hospitals don't get funded almost at all. Agriculture is slowly dying, government doesn't want to buy farmers' wheat, milk or whatever you have for a decent price. Corruption is everywhere, you can do whatever crime you like and get away with it. And we put up with this shit. Somehow, we live and hope for the best. It can't be worse, right? But then it gets. Every official we ever had was stealing something, so we got used to it, but these guys don’t do it subtly or sneaky, they just grab all they can get their hands on.

But then this European agreement thing happens. It's sad that Yanukovich didn't sign it, but no one actually believed he would do it, he's too pro-Russian, and who cares what people think. Some folks went protesting. It was a peaceful protest, some hipsters and students holding banners on Maidan. If he'd ignore it, they would be gone in a couple of days, but he decided to use force. At night, armed police came and beat helpless men and women just because they were using their constitutional right to protest and to have their opinion.

That was the boiling point. What the fuck? Don’t you have enough? Didn’t you torture us enough? You steal and steal, you throw opposition to jail, you threaten you own people, you take away everything from us and we endure it. But there’s always a line. Our anger, fear and hatred had built up. On that day everything changed. People finally realised if they don't do this now we will be slaves forever. They will falsify the election and we will have the Family for another 5 years (at least), the laws are gonna be worse and worse, the money will be drawn away from the country into their pockets until nothing is left. So people went to the streets. Everywhere. At first, I didn’t believe that this would be so big but more and more people came to Maidan, it grew bigger and bigger, and no one was afraid anymore. When you're there, there's no fear, but also no anger. People are friendly and relaxed, they just walk around and try to show that they need to be listened to. 

People started gathering from other cities and live there on Maidan. People of Kiev started to bring food, supplies, clothes and even money. Businessmen donated thousands of dollars, because they knew that this is their chance to get their companies back. Many people quit their jobs or schools to be there. People understood they could have their freedom back, better laws, new faces, less corruption. And most important — NO Yanukovich. We want to be better, we want to have some sort of established economy, independence, and pride after all. And we did it. You know the rest.

1znjc3,4,2014-03-05,Law student looking for career advice from those working in criminal prosecution,corpus_delictii,law,https://www.reddit.com/r/law/comments/1znjc3/law_student_looking_for_career_advice_from_those/,"I'm a second year law student at a decently ranked law school (top 30), the top school in my region. I've been wanting to work in criminal law before I even started my undergraduate education and I've really leaned on the side of criminal prosecution ever since my 1L summer.

However, getting my 1L summer internship was a struggle. I wasn't offered anything from any of the larger established county prosecutor's offices, and I was barely able to sneak into the internship I got very late in the spring quarter through contacts with upperclassmen.

Fast forward to now and I am in sort of the same boat, except I know this summer is a lot more crucial since this is the opportunity to work with a limited license in the courtroom on the record. As before, all of the counties with established intern programs rejected me (though I actually landed interviews with all of them this time, presumably because of the 1L experience). I am being passed up for other students who have told me they actually have no interest in criminal prosecution or criminal law at all, they just want the courtroom experience for their other avenues - and this is really starting to discourage me. The most discouraging was being rejected from the office I previously worked at. While I worked in a different unit than the unit I was interviewing for as a 2L intern, presumably they were able to get personal feedback from my supervisor - and I am fairly certain he gave feedback (he was the one encouraging me to apply for the 2L internship). At this point I am desperately trying to get in contact with offices from smaller counties that do not have established intern programs, but to no avail. E-mailing and leaving phone messages aren't resulting in any callbacks.

At this point I really can't figure out why this is becoming so difficult for me. I've gone through a couple mock interviews through our campus career services and the interviews didn't identify any ""glaring"" problems and simply just had some suggestions for refinements. My writing sample is still from my spring 1L writing class, simply because I didn't really do any real substantial writing my 1L summer (except maybe a PC affidavit) and my 2L classes thus far have all been doctrinal.

My grades are slightly above median for my school, with good grades in the relevant crim classes (evidence/crimpro/crimlaw/trial ad). I've tried to participate in all the mock trial and trial advocacy opportunities available (however I was rejected from all of the school mock trial team tryouts so I haven't been able to compete in anything regional).

The things I am lacking however are: 

No demonstrated interest to public service - I worked full time all through undergrad (did undergrad part time - took 8 years) so I didn't really have much opportunity for that. 

Not that much experience working in professional settings: I have only the 1L job and an undergrad internship at the states AG office. All of my other work experience were food service jobs while in school.

And finally, probably what I suspect is killing my prospects is: i have a juvenile criminal record. And it is a felony (charges were theft 3, possession of stolen property 2, false statement). Granted, this was 11 years ago. And spending time in juvenile detention, etc is a large part of my ""why I want to work in criminal law"" story and it comes out in my interviews and I try to spin it as positively as I can, but it is what it is. I'm not exactly sure how much the offices can inquire into the record as it is sealed, but I try to be forthcoming as possible without really discussing unnecessary and embarrassing details about my juvenile delinquency. Most of my criminal professors who have experience working in prosecution think that I have a pretty compelling reason for wanting to go into prosecution, but I can't help but think this might be the reason why I am getting rejected from every office.

So at this point, my question is just really - what is the best course of action? A lot of people have said that public defense would be friendly to my background - and I would like to do that - but prosecution was my ultimate goal. Should I continue pursuing that and attempt to get in with a smaller rural office? Or bite the bullet and go into defense? Or will both sides of crim be hostile to my background and lack of demonstrated public interest? Should I be looking into other areas of law. If anything, I would at least want to work in some area where I will be spending significant time in the courtroom. "
1znm2o,2,2014-03-05,Determined to become NC. [support] [rant] [trigger warning],OnMyWayToNC,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1znm2o/determined_to_become_nc_support_rant_trigger/,"I'm really tired of living at home, I'm almost in a position to move out soon, but I'm in need of some advice as well.

**Background:** 

There were alot of ""Last straws"", but I feel that yesterday was my complete shutting down point. Yesterday I came home with my girlfriend to pick up my parents car to drive her home since she lives quite far away via bus. My mother was upstairs with a family friend. 

I went upstairs to ask for her keys, she just stood silent and muttered ""I don't understand you"". She then proceeded to say ""You don't clean your room, bathroom and do the laundry. You're home all day, but you do nothing and I'm tried of it."". She then proceeded to ask my girlfriend if she does any chores in the house and then proceed to emphasize that I'm home all day and do nothing.

The truth is, I do far from nothing and I later found out she didn't even check if I did the laundry or not. I recently ended an internship after graduating college, and I took a month and a half to work towards getting a job in the career path I wanted by constantly working on projects. Within that break I was featured in the news for a project I worked on and introduced to people who could open a ton of doors career-wise for me.

I try not to tell m parents anything I do because they always find something negative to say. When I finally showed my mother I was in the news, she got mad at me for not telling her what I was doing. Like it was bad that I hid it from her. I'm never wholeheartedly congratulated for anything, it's always backhanded.

My main reason for working to hard to achieve my desired career path is that I want to be fully independent of my parents. But to them, I always feel like they perceive me as some sort of loser. They never believe in me with anything. They always tell me that I'm not ""motivated"" or a ""go-getter"", but when you ask my friends I'm the most motivated person they know. I feel like they ignore any achievement I make. Last week I went to a career-fair and someone recognized me from the news. I told my mom that and she ignored it completely not saying a word. My father is mostly an enabler, but I feel he does view me in low regard aswell.

Some examples of my mother's emotional abuse towards me:

* From elementary school to high school she'd wait for my dad to go out every Friday night to yell at me for what seemed like hours about the state of my bathroom.

* She had been complaining about a toy box I had in my room for awhile that ""needed"" to be organized. So after picking me up from my school dance, she told me that she threw my toys in hallway infront of my room and that I had to clean them up.

* She actively tell me when she sees my cousins hanging out somewhere while implying that they didn't invite me out (even though they did ask, but I declined because I was busy). She also says things like ""I hope when your girlfriend gets a job, she doesn't think she's better than you and leaves you"".

* Always says I don't do anything in the house. Even when I do, it's not good enough because it's not within her invisible time-frame.

* Constantly states no one in the house cares about her.

**Questions**

After working hard for a career, I'm now in the position where a job that will allow me to move out is in my grasp. I just need guidance on a few things.

* When the time comes, how do I say I'm moving out?

* My parents have documents that I need like account numbers etc. How would I approach them to ask for it?

* My extended family is going on vacation next year and I already deposited saving to go too. How should I act when I eventually see my parents?

I have just recently graduated in I.T. (last year in Summer) from my university in the mid-west, mostly focusing my courses on Networking/ Linux.. and have moved to a new state on the East Coast.


I want to become a Sys Admin, but the jobs I look at, even entry level ones..want someone with 2-3 years experience.


The only experience I have had was at my internship as a Tech Support/ Computer repair guy., and that was last summer.


I have a background on Linux/ Networking and want to get into being a Sysadmin....but I have seen some friends do S.A.N and would eventually like to get into that as well. 

But, I can't even get into a job without showing experience at the moment. How did any of you guys start getting into a Sysadmin job ? 


I know certifications can help, but at the moment, I don't think I can apply for one and would just like to get hired and get some experience first.


Any advice would be greatly appreciated, I feel like I am walking around in the dark here, and not sure how to break into the business/job market.

[Not at all Oscars-related.  You have a doctorate in comparative literature from Berkeley and you could have probably pursued a tenure track professorship, but instead you became a film critic. In interviews, the narrative arc of your career focuses on your blog, The High Sign, which you started back in the early days of blogging, and the way that serendipitously transitioned into a job at Slate. What happened with academia though? I’m curious what you think of academia, and why it wasn’t for you. I know you can’t read the minds of your readers and editors, but do you think a doctorate helped get you established in the early days? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1znian/i_am_dana_stevens_slates_film_critic_and_culture/cfv7gw8?context=5)|Oh boy. Well. It wasn't me that rejected academia but academia that rejected me: I finished my Ph.D., went out on the job market for several years running, and never got offered a university job. At the time I thought this was a sign of the injustice of the hiring system in the humanities (which is, in fact, screwed six ways from Sunday) but looking back I am sure there were candidates for those jobs who felt more sure about their profession. I never loved teaching--I wanted to love it because I revere great teachers, but I'm only an OK one. So when my writing started taking off (i.e. going from blogging 1x/week at the High Sign to actually gettin' paid, initially as a TV critic at Slate) I wasn't too sad to leave academia behind, though I miss some things about it. There are a few critics who have had a similar trajectory education-wise: A.O. Scott and Virginia Heffernan both either have or went a long way towards getting lit Ph.Ds. I know I wouldn't be the writer and thinker I am if I hadn't had those years at Berkeley. They were incredibly formative.
[Does Stephen Metcalf refuse to read advertisements on the show?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1znian/i_am_dana_stevens_slates_film_critic_and_culture/cfv7gbo?context=5)|To refuse he would have had to have been asked. I think Julia and I just started doing them because he had enough on his plate hosting the show, introducing guests, doing transitions etc., and that became the norm. But at some point in my life I want to hear him reading that copy about Neanderthals and cilantro.
[The Adam Kempenaar scenario: aliens land and will erase every single copy of every film ever made - except one. And you get to choose which one survives. What's your pick?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1znian/i_am_dana_stevens_slates_film_critic_and_culture/cfv7h0k?context=5)|So this would need to be a movie that contains strong enough cinematic DNA to allow a future alternate movie history to spring from its preservation--I think for the sake of humanity you have to pick Citizen Kane, The Wizard of Oz or Buster Keaton's The General. Preferably a mutant clone movie incorporating elements of all three.
[Aside from being one of my favorite critics you're also among the coolest users of Twitter I know, and not just because you share interesting thoughts and links but especially because you take time to interact with and respond to people, more than any other person with a 5-digit number of followers I know. Is that something you actively seek out to do or does it just occur naturally? And is Twitter something that is always on (in a separate tab or on your phone\) or do you only check up on it when you're taking a break from working?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1znian/i_am_dana_stevens_slates_film_critic_and_culture/cfv7hso?context=5)|Ach Twitter. My temptation, my enemy. I spend way too much time there and yet I have trouble dismissing it as simply a distraction, because I've gotten so much out of being on there for the last 5 years: made real friends, found out about countless interesting things I would otherwise never have seen, LOL'd a million times. I periodically get disgusted with Twitter for a day or two (and try not to use it much if at all on the weekends.) But it feels integral to both my work and personal life (and yes, I'm embarrassed to say, the Twitter window is always up, sometimes multiple windows.) As for responding to people, I love doing that when I'm on Twitter just hanging out. But I don't go back and try to answer every @-reply, because that would reach a volume that would start to make Twitter feel un-fun and un-free.
[We’re 4 (some would argue 5\) years into a new decade – what would you say is the best movie that’s been released so far?  P.S. Big fan of The Spoiler Special, Gabfest and The Movie Club. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1znian/i_am_dana_stevens_slates_film_critic_and_culture/cfv7gp3?context=5)|Oh wow, best movie released since 2010? I'm so not a list maker, and choosing just one is sort of the ultimate list. But off the top of my head I'm going to go with Paul Thomas Anderson's The Master.
[What's your favorite non-Slate podcast? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1znian/i_am_dana_stevens_slates_film_critic_and_culture/cfv7jc2?context=5)|Sometimes Filmspotting, sometimes BBC's Start the Week, sometimes On Being with Krista Tippett, depending on the topics and guest and circumstances of listening. But the one podcast I never miss actually is on Slate--the political gabfest. It's the way I compensate for feeling perpetually behind in current events during the week--just wait till Friday and Plotz, Dickerson and Bazelon will explain all.
[What do you think of major film awards like the oscars and golden globes? Do you think enough recognition is given to smaller/independent films?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1znian/i_am_dana_stevens_slates_film_critic_and_culture/cfv7i14?context=5)|Ugh, this is the wrong time of year to ask me that question. I, like every critic I hope, am so awards-seasoned out right now that I just want to sit on a mountaintop for six months and contemplate a Buddha statue. Or maybe Keanu Reaves in Little Buddha.
[If you could create one new Oscar category, what would it be? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1znian/i_am_dana_stevens_slates_film_critic_and_culture/cfv7i9n?context=5)|See below re: Oscars, sick of. But I have thought about this: Maybe there should be an ensemble cast award? Or a 2nd best score category that would include some use of pre-existing music as well as new? A lot of the best scores don't get considered now because of those rules.
[Does Stephen Metcalf smell of lavender and cedar wood as I imagine he does?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1znian/i_am_dana_stevens_slates_film_critic_and_culture/cfv7mqs?context=5)|Next time I see him I'll just walk up, bury my nose deep in his preppy flannel shirt collar and sniff. No, I will definitely not be doing that. But I would not be surprised if he was the single most fragrant member of the Gabfest.
[Do you take notes in the dark? Favorite films and folks from the Golden Age? Which Pixar films missed? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1znian/i_am_dana_stevens_slates_film_critic_and_culture/cfv7ke1?context=5)|Notes in the Dark! That's the title for my biopic, guy who asked below. Yes, I do scribble stuff in the dark though I rarely look at it later &amp; would prob not be able to read it if I did.
 |Golden Age--I don't know what we're saying that is, but some of my favorite classic filmmakers are Buster Keaton, Fritz Lang, Preston Sturges, Douglas Sirk, Nicholas Ray, Billy Wilder--the usual suspects, I guess.
 |I think I've seen every Pixar movie except A Bug's Life, which I never got around to because nobody seems to love it.
[What other movie critics do you read? Are there any up-and-coming critics that you particularly like?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1znian/i_am_dana_stevens_slates_film_critic_and_culture/cfv7idq?context=5)|I never read anyone before writing mine, like most critics I imagine--fear of unconscious influence. After I've filed, especially if it's a movie that there's a sharp divide or controversy about, I sometimes check in w/ my regulars, who I guess would be: A.O. Scott &amp; Manohla, David Edelstein &amp; Bilge Ebiri at New York, Wesley Morris at Grantland, Stephanie Zacharek at the Voice, Andrew O'Hehir at Salon. (As for up-and-comers, Nathan Heller, of Vogue &amp; the New Yorker, is a heller.) But other times after I write on a movie--even if I liked it--I'm just done with it, &amp; I can't bring myself to use my limited time and energy to care about it any further.
[Pancakes or waffles? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1znian/i_am_dana_stevens_slates_film_critic_and_culture/cfv7g5i?context=5)|French toast. Though I do love a good thin Swedish-style pancake too.
[Hi Dana! I just want to let you know you are one of my journalistic lady-crushes (I find you quite charming\).](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1znian/i_am_dana_stevens_slates_film_critic_and_culture/cfv7l6h?context=5)|1) I am charmed and yet discomfited by that fact!
[What's an upcoming film you can't wait to see?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1znian/i_am_dana_stevens_slates_film_critic_and_culture/cfv7l6h?context=5)|2) I can't wait to see PTA's Inherent Vice and David Fincher's Gone Girl.
[Also - what's been your biggest challenge as a female journalist and movie critic? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1znian/i_am_dana_stevens_slates_film_critic_and_culture/cfv7l6h?context=5)|3) I'm doing a panel on women in film criticism this Saturday at NYU and wondering how to answer that very question. The truth off the top of my head is that I have not found it to be an impediment, and there's obviously a long tradition of women being well represented in film criticism as compared to other careers (for example, filmmaking.) I do find being a parent and a film critic to be tough sometimes--a lot of tight deadlines, a lot of nights away from home. But I don't see how that would be different for a male critic if he was really pitching in as a parent, which most fathers I know are.
[I love how well-read all three hosts of the Culture-fest are.  With two former humanities grad students and one J-school'er among you, I love the literary insight that each brings to the table.  That said, I find the culture of literacy seems to be waning.  Is this in our collective minds, or do you think people in general are reading less than they used to?  Am I grasping for the 'good old days' that were never there?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1znian/i_am_dana_stevens_slates_film_critic_and_culture/cfv7mwl?context=5)|Thanks for your nice words. I know I read way less now that I ever have in my life, like 15 minutes a day instead of hours--but then again, I now have a child and a full-time job, as opposed to being a grad student whose job was to read, so I'm not sure how much I can attribute to The Way We Live Now as opposed to simply life.
[Who should play you in the Dana Stevens biopic, and what would it be called?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1znian/i_am_dana_stevens_slates_film_critic_and_culture/cfv7jcc?context=5)|Someone once told me Naomi Watts should play me in a movie and I ascended to heaven on wings of angels. I think I am more of a... I don't know...Jennifer Jason Leigh? But 20% less crazy? I don't have a title either. How about The Scribblin' Samurai?
[As Metcalf would put it, hello Danaaa!  At what point in your grad school career did you decide to move into film criticism? Which is to say, at what point did you turned away from academia?  Former academic-in-training asking.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1znian/i_am_dana_stevens_slates_film_critic_and_culture/cfv7j7z?context=5)|I answered something like this below--scroll down.
[Dana! Which is your favorite flavor of Fresca? Original citrus, black cherry citrus, or peach citrus?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1znian/i_am_dana_stevens_slates_film_critic_and_culture/cfv7onh?context=5)|Is my Fresca fellowship dependent on this answer? Black cherry. No, Peach! Peach! Shit.
[Is the job of a critic really the way we think it is? Do you really watch movies for a living? What is the complex part behind that stuff? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1znian/i_am_dana_stevens_slates_film_critic_and_culture/cfv93wh?context=5)|Clearly you are a greater writer than I, because you thought of the Reddit screen name ""Osama-bin-chillin."" I am not being even slightly facetious here.
[Now, movies:  What's your view on why ""Inside Llewyn Davis"" got no Academy Awards love?  I've seen all the nominees except ""12 Years a Slave,"" and so not having seen the winner, I can't say ILD should have won, but I can say with confidence that it should have been nominated.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1znian/i_am_dana_stevens_slates_film_critic_and_culture/cfv7nv3?context=5)|As for Llewyn Davis, that is clearly not Oscar material--way too small, too subtle, too good. But there's a line from Hamlet that comes to mind whenever people talk about awards in terms of what ""deserved"" to win: ""Use every man after his dessert, and who shall 'scape whipping?""
[I love Stephen, I do, but sometimes he drops $10, $20, and even $50 words when you know that a $1 word will do. I roll my eyes in protest. Have you ever had the same reaction, and when?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1znian/i_am_dana_stevens_slates_film_critic_and_culture/cfva422?context=5)|You know, I always wanted to do that genetic test just to find out about the Neanderthal thing! I'm always fascinated by the science of early man and the speculation about what roles Neanderthals played in the lives of Homo sapiens. I would enjoy picturing my cave-ancestors by the fireside as much as the next podcast host--but those tests cost $100!
[Also, have you ever sent your DNA in, and if so, what percentage of Neanderthal are you? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1znian/i_am_dana_stevens_slates_film_critic_and_culture/cfva422?context=5)|Oh and about Stephen's vocab: take it up with him! I am sometimes guilty of using fancy words on the podcast as well. It's just nice to have a safe space where you can drop a ""chthonic"" or what have you.
[Dante Stephens, How do feel about aggregate review sites (metacritic, rottentomatoes\)? Do you think they help or hurt film criticism?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1znian/i_am_dana_stevens_slates_film_critic_and_culture/cfv7l8b?context=5)|I don't see how they would hurt--they just organize data. I use them a lot just to find out stats about a new movie, or remind myself how something went over in the past. Obviously if you start choosing your movie based solely on Tomatometer averages you're overly in thrall to data, but it's a place to go find work by critics you might be interested to read. Overall I am pro-Tomato.
[I'm regular listener of the gabfest, may be even a fan :\) do you think you and Julia ganged up on David a bit too often? OK, j/k. I know you and David, especially David aren't big fans of long-form story telling (TV dramas, TV series\), so why do you even review them at all if you've only watched a couple episodes and didn't give them a far whack? Case in point, wouldn't it be better to review True detective after you've seen the whole season rather than just the pilot?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1znian/i_am_dana_stevens_slates_film_critic_and_culture/cfv86rx?context=5)|I think you mean Steve, who is the David Plotz of the Culturefest! We always go back and forth over whether to do TV shows near the beginning or further on. Had we known that True Detective would catch on the way it did, we might have waited and talked about it more toward the end. But realistically, we are not all three going to be able to watch eight hours of TV to prep for one 10-minute segment of the show, so we try to slice off a manageable amount to talk about. 
[Who's your most underated director/film?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1znian/i_am_dana_stevens_slates_film_critic_and_culture/cfv7pgi?context=5)|Mind a blank, mind a blank ... well, of people currently working, I think Todd Haynes is an amazing director who people don't talk about/revisit enough. Nicole Holofcener gets praise from critics, but not the size audience she deserves. And among classic filmmakers, Max Ophuls is every bit as original and brilliant as, say, Orson Welles, but because he has a small filmography and worked in ""women's"" genres, he doesn't get remembered as often.
[Which is your favorite Pessoan heteronym?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1znian/i_am_dana_stevens_slates_film_critic_and_culture/cfv9kax?context=5)|Great question. Probably the one whose poetry I know &amp; love the best is either Alvaro de Campos, in his Whitman mode, or Fernando Pessoa ""himself."" But the book that first made me fall for Pessoa, The Book of Disquiet, is by the semi-heteronym Bernardo Soares.
[What do you think is the most overlooked piece of cinema since the turn of the Century? In my opinion it's The Assassination Of Jesse James etc etc. I think it's a masterpiece. That and 4 Months, 3 Weeks And 2 Days.  What are yours?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1znian/i_am_dana_stevens_slates_film_critic_and_culture/cfvc6b7?context=5)|With you on the 2nd but not the first. That movie has great cinematography but it never quite cohered for me as storytelling--Brad Pitt and Casey Affleck were good, but it was a bit too self-conscious in its myth making &amp; the script just didn't knock me out. 4 Months 3 Weeks though...that's in the 21st century pantheon so far for me.
[I was curious about your thoughts on the ""Act of Killing."" I thought it was incredible and was disappointed that it did not win the Oscar. Were you surprised at all? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1znian/i_am_dana_stevens_slates_film_critic_and_culture/cfv85ln?context=5)|Nah, The Act of Killing is absolutely brilliant but not the kind of doc that would win an Oscar. Way too bleak and un-uplifting. I'm impressed it got a nomination at all.
[Hey Dana!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1znian/i_am_dana_stevens_slates_film_critic_and_culture/cfv7r18?context=5)|Inside Llewyn Davis is the most notable one I can think of--but not a surprise. That movie is not Oscar material at all--too small, subtle, black-humored, in-uplifting.
[What is a film from the past year that you think was overlooked by the Oscars?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1znian/i_am_dana_stevens_slates_film_critic_and_culture/cfv7r18?context=5)|I mean un-uplifting.
[Have you seen River of Fundament?  If so, how does it relate to Mailer's Ancient Evenings?  Is it at all accessible to a film lay-person like myself? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1znian/i_am_dana_stevens_slates_film_critic_and_culture/cfv9k3g?context=5)|Is that the new Matthew Barney? No, I haven't seen it, but I kind of want to . From what I've seen of his work it's more closely related to art installation than narrative film--but the guy can create unforgettable dreamlike images, even if you're not sure what the aggregation of them is supposed to mean.
[Hey Dana! A while back I submitted a track to the summer strut fest that actually made it to the air (Tiny Spark - Brendan Benson\). I haven't had any luck with recent submissions. The whole thing made me wonder: who goes through the submissions? How is the list curated? Who decides which track is worthy enough of an on-air play?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1znian/i_am_dana_stevens_slates_film_critic_and_culture/cfv9qeb?context=5)|Tiny Spark was a great strut song, thanks for that! Generally our intern culls through the many (100s?) submissions and sends us a list of 20-25 songs to choose our favorites from.
[PS. Love the breathy in-take you give after delivering a long-winded, intelligent opinion on something. Makes me giggle every time. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1znian/i_am_dana_stevens_slates_film_critic_and_culture/cfv9qeb?context=5)|I am not at liberty to comment on my own long-windedness or subsequent breathy intake.
[Just graduated from college with a degree in political science and public policy, and immediately decided I wanted to be a writer. Any advice for idiots like me on finding a writing job/freelancing?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1znian/i_am_dana_stevens_slates_film_critic_and_culture/cfv7rrn?context=5)|Just saw this...I would say hold on to a (good) day job while you try to get a foothold in writing. It could take a long time before you're making a living at it. But if you really have to pursue it, do, and God be with you!
[You bring a cool philosophical and intellectual angle to your criticism that I find pretty unique. Do you find that you filter your critiques through any specific philosophical concepts? (i.e. Rawl's Veil of Ignorance\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1znian/i_am_dana_stevens_slates_film_critic_and_culture/cfv9hyn?context=5)|If I filtered anything through Rawl's Veil of Ignorance I did a good job of it, because I have no idea what that is! I read philosophy and literary theory in grad school along w/ a lot of literature, and got tons out of some of it--but I'm not consciously writing from the POV of any school of thought or criticism.
[Why did you pick The High Sign for your Twitter name?  P.S. I enjoy the Spoiler Specials!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1znian/i_am_dana_stevens_slates_film_critic_and_culture/cfv8ve4?context=5)|Thanks! It's the title of a Buster Keaton comedy short, and also the phrase for a secret hand sign used between members of a group (like the Masons or something.) So to give someone ""the high sign"" is to exchange a gesture with a meaning that no one else in the room is privy to. It was the name of my old movie blog and since Twitter is the closest thing I do to blogging anymore, I imported that identity...
[In the 48 hours after John Travolta accidentally mispronounced someone's name at the Oscars, the @slate twitter account tweeted references to its ""Travoltafied"" bot over 200 times. Did you find this as irritating as I did? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1znian/i_am_dana_stevens_slates_film_critic_and_culture/cfv8uxj?context=5)|I like that people had fun with the Travoltifier and I like when Slate does well so we can get readers, advertisers, and the means to keep on existing!
[Dana, you've mentioned a few times on the SCG that you speak Portuguese. I'm Brazilian, and I'm curious what motivated you to learn the language, and do you speak in the Brazilian accent, or the Portuguese? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1znian/i_am_dana_stevens_slates_film_critic_and_culture/cfv9og6?context=5)|I learned it in grad school, basically because I needed a modern language in addition to French, and because I loved Brazilian music and thought it would be nice to understand what Joao Gilberto and Caetano Veloso were singing about! Then I ended up studying in Rio, learning the language well enough to teach beginners (which I did through most of the rest of grad school), and writing my dissertation on a Portuguese poet (Fernando Pessoa, of course.) So I speak with a Brazilian accent but have spent some time in Lisbon too.
[Hi Dana! Huge fan of the show. I was wondering who your all time favorite cultural gabfest guest is or if you have any guests who you haven't been able to have on but would really like to?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1znian/i_am_dana_stevens_slates_film_critic_and_culture/cfv9n5d?context=5)|Well, Rosanne Cash was incredible when we had her on the other week--she kept wanting to stay longer and keep talking! I also loved Sam Anderson when we had him on for his piece on stupid phone games. He fit in so well with the three of us, I felt like we could have adopted him as a 4th gabber that very day. As for who I'd like to have on: Stephen Colbert? Lena Dunham? Steve's true love Neko Case?
[How does it feel like to be internet famous?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1znian/i_am_dana_stevens_slates_film_critic_and_culture/cfvbe4g?context=5)|I suspect you are making fun of me with that question, but I will simply throw back my head with an Errol Flynn laugh and reply: Magnificent!
[Whats your favorite ""odd"" movir?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1znian/i_am_dana_stevens_slates_film_critic_and_culture/cfvafrf?context=5)|I have a longtime soft spot for The Abominable Dr. Phibes: [Link to en.wikipedia.org](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Abominable_Dr._Phibes)
[Do you write like you will be read for years to come like Pauline Kael or do you write for the moment? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1znian/i_am_dana_stevens_slates_film_critic_and_culture/cfv8e20?context=5)|Are you trying to depress me here? I try not to ask myself whether my deathless pan of The Green Lantern will be read in 2150. I just try to bring as much of myself to each movie I write about as I can.
[Do you have any favorite music videos?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1znian/i_am_dana_stevens_slates_film_critic_and_culture/cfvbllb?context=5)|Cyndi Lauper's ""Time After Time""? Or that Spike Jonze-directed one where Björk dances with the giant cat?
[Hi Dana. What book would you like to see adapted to the big screen? Personally I'd like a Satanic Verses film though obviously that wouldn't happen so second choice might be The Glass Palace by Amitav Ghosh.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1znian/i_am_dana_stevens_slates_film_critic_and_culture/cfv9nie?context=5)|Melville's story ""Bartleby the Scrivener"" with Mackenzie Crook as Bartleby. Please, please some director worthy of Melville make this happen!
[Any good artisanal horror films you've seen recently?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1znian/i_am_dana_stevens_slates_film_critic_and_culture/cfvc2j8?context=5)|Trying to think ... since that quite good Jessica Chastain one, Mama (that gave rise to the category if I remember right) I can't think of anything that's come out in theaters in that vein. But here's a classic example that you can probably find on DVD/streaming somewhere: Alejandro Amenabar's Tesis.
[What do you think about High Frame Rate? The Hobbit was filmed in 48fps, Avatar will be 60fps. Do you think it's a fad, or something film is moving towards in the future?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1znian/i_am_dana_stevens_slates_film_critic_and_culture/cfvb5nu?context=5)|Here's my review of The Hobbit with appalled commentary on the image quality of the 48fps--unless that technology starts to evolve in a less garishly hideous direction I am not inclined to cheer it on.

[Do any other critics have a professional rivalry with you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1znian/i_am_dana_stevens_slates_film_critic_and_culture/cfv8g97?context=5)|If they did do you think I would answer that? 
[What's the significance of ""The High Sign""?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1znian/i_am_dana_stevens_slates_film_critic_and_culture/cfv8ofi?context=5)|See above--just answered that a few Qs up.
[Hi Dana, huge fan and have been for years. I always trust your judgment on movies. I think you may have saved me hundreds of dollars over the years in movie tickets. Thanks for all of the great work you've done.  My question: Southland Tales. Why did people keep making movies after the form peaked with this 2006 masterpiece? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1znian/i_am_dana_stevens_slates_film_critic_and_culture/cfvb5ys?context=5)|Never saw Southland Tales, do not in general get the Richard Kelly cult (though maybe if I saw it, I would?). Go ahead, flay me.
[Yes, Dana, DO TELL.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1znian/i_am_dana_stevens_slates_film_critic_and_culture/cfv7p0w?context=5)|I only go into the Slate NY office once a week to tape the Gabfest, so I'm not privy to the roiling hotbed of skulduggery, resentment and lust that is Slate office culture. I hear Dan Kois keeps a scandalous diary though.
[I look forward to hearing more. And if it's NYC, I'll have to go!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1znian/i_am_dana_stevens_slates_film_critic_and_culture/cfv9bn4?context=5)|Yes, there is something like this IN THE WORKS for this year! Stand by for further plugging on various gabfests as it comes together.
[I simply want to know your opinion(s\) or critique on a favorite movie of mine: There Will Be Blood.

Thanks for taking one for the team &amp; watching crummy movies so the rest of us don't have to!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1znian/i_am_dana_stevens_slates_film_critic_and_culture/cfv9kvu?context=5)|Glad you like the Spoiler!

1znwij,13,2014-03-05,I've reached the end,Mr_Alex19,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1znwij/ive_reached_the_end/,"I was the first person in my family to ever graduate from high school. Neither of my parents ever received an education, because they grew up as poor farming peasants in Mexico. They raised me, but I was never given any instruments to play, nor was I ever placed in any sports, or any drama classes or self-defense classes or classes that bred hobbies or taught any skills that would have made me even somewhat of an interesting person. I don't come from money or a background that values education or ambition. I realized, way too late into my life, that I missed out on a proper childhood. I spent my summers and free time at home watching TV and playing video games rather than going to camps or discovering an intellectual interest or participating in sports programs or engaging in any social activity. 

I've been diagnosed with a mild form of autism, and have also been diagnosed with intense general anxiety. Even if I try to connect with others, I can't. I'm just too different. Not even with my family do I feel a close attachment.

Somehow, I excelled in school and through divine intervention I attended a top private liberal arts college. I thought the world would be my oyster, but I'm not cut out for the world. I offer nothing and don't have the social skillset or any of the artistic or academic talents to mesh with any of the school clubs or its members. I was ill suited for higher society, but now I'm too educated and too ambitious to go back from where I came from.
Everyone around me is being elected to leadership positions and attending conferences and earning internships to elite corporations and organizations, and I struggle just to keep up academically.

I used to try so hard to fight. I saw myself as an isolated fighter who had to navigate the cruel, difficult world on my own. I sacrificed my health to push myself, give it all I had. But even when I put twice the effort as everyone else, I still finish behind everyone. I kept trying and fighting. I refused to go down. I needed to believe that I was worth something and needed to prove to myself that I was capable of doing something worthwhile. For everytime I faltered, I pushed and fought harder, but I still failed.

Now I've reached my limit. I'm not meant for this world. I had nothing and I still have nothing. I'm just a freak to everyone. I tried, and I gave everything to my cause, but it was all in vain. I guess I'm just some nervous, autistic low life who can barely do anything right. I'm tired of fighting by myself. I'm tired. I hate myself, and I hate my thoughts. I can't do it anymore. I just want to rest forever. I wish there was a heaven, because I don't want to be here anymore. 20 years, and nothing to my name. I'm tired of fighting, I just want to rest easy and sleep away the rest if eternity. I've never said this before, but it feels good to finally get this out of me. Now I can rest easy. "

They would always ask me ""why don't you just get a car?"". That always pissed me off because they all got their cars from their parents, who also paid for their insurance. My parents, because years of poor decision making are totally broke. 

Throughout undergrad in college, I was stuck depending on public transportation (which is shit in Miami) and asking for rides. And I HATE asking for rides. I feel like such a leech sometimes. I had on campus jobs, through which I would save money. However, my parents would always need to be bailed out and I'd basically have to start over again.

Now, I am a grad student and I'm getting paid a bit more than before. Of course, I also have more expenses (like rent for example). I am not saving at all. My money pretty much goes straight to rent and there is enough left over to eat and take the bus. I don't do anything but work, study and sleep and it's killing me. Well, was killing me.

I landed a grad level internship for the summer that pays really well. I planned to use the money from that to buy a used car and get some insurance. BUT I've recently been thinking, what if I take a loan and get the car now, then pay off the loan with my intern money? If I get a car now, I can finally take control of my schedule since I'll have more time. I'll also be able to see my friends more regularly + I'll be able to attend off campus events to met new people. I'm sure owning a car comes with it's own set of challenges, but I would rather deal with them than having a 4 hour commute every day (2 hours to school, 2 hours back). 

Any pros and cons? I've never taken a loan in my life. Not for school, not for a place to live, never. And I'm worried because loans pretty much ruined my parents. How hard are they to get? How soon do I have to start paying them back? Is it worth the trouble?"

I know that what I am about to get of my chest is not a big deal in comparison with all the deep crazy hairy ass stuff that you are used to read here, but I need to tell it nonetheless. 

Well, for starters, I do have the best life one could get. I am grateful for having all the opportunities that were offered to me by my parents and life per se. I have food, clothes, education (best they could pay), an awesome girlfriend that is always there for me, a family that no matter what are always trying to make things work perfectly. I consider myself to be a intelligent person, outgoing, funny, and I do have an easy way to make friends.

I should be happy, in fact, I am happy with my life. The point is that I can't see myself in the future with a job. I have this huge flaw, It's really hard for me to be saying this, I am a fucking lazy piece of shit. I mean, I never said no to a job. When I lived for 1 year in a different country I worked, and worked HARD, my family paid the beginning of this endeavor, but the last few months I paid everything. 

Here in my country I manage to enter in a Public University, a really good one ( It's hard to get in, everyone wants the opportunity to study in this education system with no expenses). I study law, therefore I MUST (or I should) study all the time... The fact is, I never learnt how to properly put my ass in the chair and put my mind into action...

As far as I can remember I always had this ability to procrastinate and study at the last minute, the thing is, I never ate shit for that. I was consider to be one of the best students in class. But this changed after I arrived at the university (probably due to my class being made of those other intelligent people...).

I have had great internships with great government law organizations. So I couldn't say I wouldn't achieve success if I tried. The thing is that I NOW I HAVE TO study, but I can't... I just can't... 

Every day my mom comes at me to complain about my lack of study, even my girlfriend is trying to help me... 

I don't know how to do it. If I keep this pace I know that I will be a nobody in a few years, I will lose all this ""good"" life that I now have. I now what I ought to do but it's like my body doesn't respond to my will ( is that will??? Because, if it was force of will I'm sure I would have done all these things ).

TL;DR I am a slug procrastinating piece of shit that can't find the motivation to study and meet with all the expectation...

I'd never even had a workplace romance before this, let alone relationship, and could really use some advice on what to expect, how to maintain those boundaries between work and dating life, and any other stuff you knowledgable people can add. I know it can be tough and constraining to be new to a city and in a relationship as well.

I'm nervous about how intensely strong the feelings I have for her are, and the feelings are definitely mutual.

I am a junior in high school and after taking AP Computer Science this year, I am absolutely positive about a career in CS (or some related field.) I have a good idea of where I would generally like to go to college and I have a pretty well-researched list already, however, I would like to cleanse some of my fears about my ""category"" of choice.

I'm not going to give you my SAT score or GPA and ask you to chance me to a college. My question more stems from the fact that there is a feeling from those who I have talked to that school name isn't important and I should just go to somewhere I can afford.

So hypothetically, let's say my application would be a slight reach for Berkeley/CMU or something. If this helps at all, I live in Pennsylvania, my family does not make that much money. Obviously staying in-state would be cheaper, but I've always wanted to move out to the West Coast or NY/Boston where there is a huge tech industry.

So, which path would be smarter?-

1. I am accepted into UC Berkeley/CMU/UCLA/UW/NYU etc. etc...but it would be difficult to afford/aid is low. Is it worth it to go to a big name college with a lot of opportunities for internships and employment, but take on most likely a decent amount of debt? Does not going hurt my chances of success later on?

2. I get accepted to a smaller school, say Cal Poly SLO, San Jose State, which is closer to the areas I would like to move to and cheaper, but not as ""prestigious"". Does going here severely hurt my chances of getting a ""Big 4"" internship for example, or is the chances relatively equal throughout most decent CS schools?

**TL;DR- Is going to a more prestigious university (Berkeley, CMU) worth the additional debt compared to a degree from a lesser known university near a huge startup city (Cal Poly SLO, San Jose State, SUNY Stony Brook)?**

I'm 18 and a college freshman. I was lucky enough to have my parents support my tuition for my freshman year, however I'm going to need to start taking out student loans this coming summer. The school I go to is roughly $46k a year and that's gonna add up to quite a bit after 4 more years of school is done. (5 Year Masters Degree program, Comp Sci) 

I've recently acquired a paid internship with a startup which pays pretty well for a college student, and they've been pretty successful thus far. As long as I don't blow the place up, they told me I'm pretty much set for a position in the coming years. That being said, I still have no idea how to properly approach that kind of debt. 

I have no intentions of opening up any credit cards in the future, and in turn relying on building credit from student loans (if that's how it works, idk??). My bank account is on the student(college) plan, branched off of my mom's bank account and I have a debit card, which I have no interest or fee's of any sort unless I overdraw my current balance. Our balances and money transfers are entirely separate.

Also important to note, I am fortunate enough not to have to pay for my cell phone bill and car insurance. This may be subject to change however. Any and all other expenditures such as food, gas, clothes, transportation, etc are my responsibility. 

My current assets: $150 savings(current emergency fund), $5000 car. (Paid for the car in full, in cash (my money), 2 years ago for $6500.)

So Reddit, how do I plan to pay off these student loans before I graduate or soon after? I am also quite interested in investing, so that is not out of the question. Any advice or tips are greatly appreciated. "

1zoxsj,0,2014-03-05,Hi /r/advice. I'm in a conundrum and need guidance. I'm dating an older man and my loved ones do not approve,[deleted],Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1zoxsj/hi_radvice_im_in_a_conundrum_and_need_guidance_im/,"I’d like to apologize in advance if I am in the wrong subreddit. I would also like to apologize for bad grammar, rants, my edit, and anything else wrong with this post.

Basically these past few days have had me thrown into a web of assumptions and thwarted by a boot of power. I am dating a forty-three year old man and I am a nineteen year old woman. As one might guess, my parents and older sister don’t agree with this based solely on the fact that he is older. There’s a bit more, but that’s the main reason.

Let me start the events with this past weekend. I get a phone call from my mother saying that she does not approve of my relationship with this older gentleman who I admitted to having relations with. It was a mutual choice to become romantically involved. I am legal as well. I think it would be strange if my mother had no concern, but I feel as though I was completely honest when it came to our relationship. 

This gentleman and I have been dating for about a month. We’re very close, and for the first time I feel comfortable and happy in a relationship but not overly so to the point where I don’t have my priorities straight. Things for me have been better than ever. I’m a theater major who is doing the light board op for our next show this spring, and I just got a nice internship for the summer that’s close to home. I’m doing very well for being a college freshman. I’d been happier than ever before my mother called.

After the phone call, I go to her house to speak in person. She’s blocked my boyfriend’s number and she refuses to let me leave until I give her my phone and truck keys. Now, I do not pay for insurance on my truck, or for my phone. I am fine without both, but I’d rather keep my phone in case of emergency. I’m not to get my truck back until I get insurance and tell my father about the relationship I have with this man. After giving her my keys she refused to drive me back home so, like a child, I was forced to stay in my childhood bedroom in a house I did not want to be in. If I walked too, that would be something else she could use against me.Either way I lost, and  I was trapped right where my mother wanted me.

So far I’ve looked into getting a new phone plan which I will address this Saturday. I’m very much excited to slowly wean myself away from my mother’s financial power over me. I’m going to look into car insurance next, and hopefully get my truck back. If I don’t , I can pretty well just ride the bus to work and school. I wish she could see though that she is not strengthening or weakening my relationship with this man, but dampening our relationship. The one time I told her something to avoid the current situation, and she uses it against me. It shows that I truly cannot tell her everything, and that anything I do she will twist and hold it firmly against me. Honestly, to me, this has become less and less about me dating an older man, but moreso about getting loose from her. I made that assumption without being “brainwashed” by the man I’m dating.

For now, the boyfriend and I have decided to lay low or not see eachother as much until a good deal of this blows over so that we can concentrate on school, finances, and in my case, dealing with family issues.  I don’t expect him to fight my parent’s because it’s not his battle, or duty, or job. However, he is willing to stay by my side, offer advice, and if he needs to speak with one of them he’s willing to do so. I’m just disappointed that my family, without meeting him have demonized him to such an extent. He is not wealthy, he’s going to college to finish his degree, he is by no means prime dating material, but he makes me happy. I’m in no helping him out because I don’t have the means to. Even if I did I probably wouldn’t based on the fact that I will not be used. This man is someone I genuinely care for and love, and I’m not willing to let him go by anyone’s terms but my own. 

I’m so afraid to tell my father though. I’m afraid of what might happen, but in reality I guess there’s not much to lose. I’m not willing to give up on this man because I genuinely care for him and I know he’s not a monster. I know he’s not a pedophile. I know that even if I did end things, it would only mean that my parents would not believe me and think I was lying. I might as well be honest, but I’m not sure how to approach the matter or even how to cope with it after. My father is a drinker, a redneck, a guy with about 20 guns, but a man I respect as my father.  I just want some guidance as to what I should do or say. Sorry for the long rant, but I wanted to get some of this off my chest as well.

1zoy3h,1,2014-03-05,Hillary Clinton and the Slur [ Flashback She Condemns Putin As Adolph Hitler ],[deleted],conspiracy,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1zoy3h/hillary_clinton_and_the_slur_flashback_she/,"The New York Times exonerates Hillary Clinton on the charge that she called an aide a “f***ing Jew bastard.” That’s fine by me. I don’t think it would be that big a deal if she did say it. But I do think she said it. My reasons are simple: Three witnesses swear to it, she has a well-documented history of swearing like a Russian sailor drunk on rubbing alcohol, she comes from a background where people said these sorts of things, and she’s not very good on Jewish issues when she is not running for the Senate from the state of New York.

Now, I am perfectly willing to concede that an entirely reasonable person can look at the available facts and conclude that she did not say “you f***ing Jew bastard” 26 years ago. Unless you were in the room, it’s impossible to know for sure. In other words, we each take what we think are the relevant facts, and apply our own editorial judgment to their importance. That’s fine too.
But look at what the Times considers the relevant facts. “[The] circumstantial evidence inclines us strongly toward believing Mrs. Clinton when she says she never used such language,” write the Times’s editors in their lead editorial. What circumstantial evidence? “The alleged remark took place only a few years after Mrs. Clinton’s expansively humanistic commencement speech at Wellesley and soon after she had worked in a sophisticated legal environment for the impeachment of a president, Richard M. Nixon, who did use anti-Semitc language.”

That’s it. Those are the only two relevant facts offered by the Times. Sure, they say that the remark runs “counter to her public remarks and private political conversations.” But for facts, all we get is a Wellesley speech and the fact that she worked with a bunch of Jewish lawyers (“sophisticated legal environment” is NY Times code for a passel of smart, liberal, Jewish attorneys) in an attempt to bring down a possibly anti-Semitic president. Not only is she no anti-Semite, the Times reasons, she might as well be glatt kosher.

Okay, let’s take the easier one first. She gave an “expansively humanistic” speech when she graduated from college. How many expansively humanistic speeches had Jesse Jackson offered before he declared New York “Hymietown”? For that matter, how many speeches had Bill Clinton offered on the perils of sexual harassment before we learned he’d been bobbing for interns? Was Mrs. Clinton’s speech remarkable because it lacked for denunciations of Jews? Were the valedictory speeches of over-achieving left-wing girls at Harvard and Yale dripping with references to the Bilderbergers and the Protocols of the Elders of Zion? It is consistently astounding how liberals are willing to accept the idea that other liberals must always mean what they say, but conservatives never do.

As for this Nixon thing, &lt; Sigh &gt;. Somehow the Times considers it particularly relevant that Richard Nixon “did use anti-Semitic language.” Well, how does that square with their first bit of circumstantial evidence? After all, Nixon most certainly did not use anti-Semitic language in public. In fact, the public Nixon was an ardent supporter of the Jews, even though they didn’t vote for Republicans. It seems not implausible that neither Bill nor Hillary Clinton would give a rat’s ass about the Jews if they did not rely on their votes and money. More to the point, Hillary Clinton didn’t know that Nixon was using anti-Semitic language when she worked on his impeachment. That revelation came years afterwards. The Times thinks it’s an important exoneration of Hillary because Nixon hatred is a Very High Virtue.

Now for my favorite bit of circumstantial evidence. The Times’ s editors suggest that anyone who worked with a bunch of nasty left-wing partisan out-to-get-Nixon lawyers — i.e. in a “sophisticated legal environment” — must have come away from the experience with a richer and more sincere appreciation of Jews and Judaism. I wish it worked that way. The Times staffers may remember the old “get Nixon” gang as a band of fellow Maccabees in search of justice, but it seems entirely possible that a low-ranking Midwestern coffee-fetching girl-feminist could have drawn a different impression at the time. After all, the poster child for anti-Semitism, in my eyes, is Alan Dershowitz.

If Hillary Clinton said “you f***king Jew bastard,” I don’t think it confirms Hillary’s anti-Semitism. Rather it confirms what I always believed: She is a nasty piece of work who will say anything if it will achieve her aims. A year ago, she said Palestine should be a state, because she was talking to Palestinians. These days she says Jews are the greatest thing since sliced Matzos, because she needs Jews. And, 26 years ago, she said “you f***ing Jew bastard” because she wanted to hurt someone’s feelings. What Jewish voters need to ponder is what she might say if the day comes when she thinks she can do without Jewish voters.

I will do my best to turn my story into the best book possible. Even if only a few people read it, I think it could be very beneficial to Christians doubting their faith and deciding if they should take the plunge into agnosticism/athiesm. Cheers! -Life

This is my—unbelievably sheltered, naturally bold and honest, worldview destroying and reconstructing—life story. I just hope others can learn from my mistakes and everything that I learned along the way. I know my story is not that unique in the grand scheme of things, but I want others who are hardcore Christians doubting their faith to know that they are not alone and that there is a good life after leaving Christianity. 

My parents decided to homeschool me to isolate me from outside religions and secular science based worldviews (Evolution was EVIL!). During my pre-teen years, Christianity was just a fun and mostly harmless story that gave me a framework for morality and a fairly basic worldview. Jesus was this figure that welcomed children into his lap and told them stories while they giggled. This all changed at the age of 13 when my faith took a serious turn and I took a vow to live my life for Jesus and do everything in my power to grow and become a better Christian. From that day onward, I began leading Bible studies, reading my Bible and praying every day, witnessing to my friends, reading Christian self-help books, and truly attempting to conform to the teachings that were taught to me by my father and church leaders. 

Despite my general isolation, I struggled with deep sexual guilt (youth group girls in mini-skirts!) that led to severe mental and mild physical self-abuse. I battled with bouts of depression and struggled to meet the biblical standard set forth for Biblical purity (Hormones are CRAZY!). Things weren’t all bad growing up. I played on a homeschool basketball team that won the national championship in 8th grade and against in 11th grade. I was fairly popular in my neighborhood and among my homeschool friends. 
At the age of 17, I discovered my love of writing and wanted to use it to help change the world for the better. I began work on my first book, on the topic of modesty from a teen Christian boy’s perspective, an odd topic to be sure. I finished the first draft two years later and self-published it under a company I created. It did not take me long to realize how much my views needed to mature after having a few hundred people buy/read the book and give me feedback. I abandoned this project my freshman year in college. 

The summer before my senior year in high school I was a camp counselor at an extremely fundamentalist Christian camp where I was brainwashed as a child and helped brainwash more children and teens, despite how much they resisted (* * EVIL LAUGH * *). I applied to several Christian schools around the country, including what is considered by many to be the top academic Bible school, Moody Bible Institute. When I was accepted to Moody, I was ecstatic and sent my letter of intent to attend. The summer before leaving for college I became a youth intern at my Church (very small church), where I lead Bible studies, organized services, preached a sermon, and organized a summer camp for the teens. 

Entering my freshman year in college, I had never so much as asked a girl on a date (because of a ridiculous fundamentalist book called “I Kissed Dating Goodbye”, which basically said that dating should be used for finding a suitable marriage partner, not for recreation or fun). Naturally, I had never done anything with a girl physically. But going into my freshman year, I had decided I was going to try my hand at dating (I thought I was of eligiblish marrying age at 19). But my interactions with girls were clumisy, clingy, and mostly awkward. I didn’t know how to be “just friends” with girls, which led to awkward/creepy “I’m semi-interested in you, but I’m too much of a pansy to take the first step.” This was a huge deal for me my freshman year. 

It was also my freshman year that my first serious doubts about Christianity began occurring. Doubts began seriously springing up around the loop holes in the old testament (i.e. how many Israelites in the exodus from Egypt, slavery being okay in the Old Testament, and many other odd and peculiar passage I had never heard of until now). I began studying these discrepancies and contradictions at length. Many weeks spending more time studying these issues than studying for my classes. Initially, I hide my doubts from everyone. This was an intensely personal search, and everything I lived for was at stake. What if everything I had believe up to this point in my life was a lie?  

My sophomore year I decided to take a break from trying to find a girlfriend. If it was going to happen, it was going to happen. God had someone out there for me, and I just needed to wait for God to bring her my way. Over time, I learned how to be friends with girls and not let things become awkward. I don’t remember when exactly I began opening myself to my closest friends regarding my doubts, but I think it was my sophomore year. I began meeting with professors and friends discussing topics ranging from authorship of biblical books to the justification for Jehovah commanding the genocide of an entire nation. 

Oh! What I would have given to just be bolder! To admit that a God that ordered the slaughter of women and children was a God that I was not interested in following! If only I had done that right off, my life would have been so much better! But no, I was so desperate to remain a Christian, I had to search for valid explanations. I was too invested. My family was hard-core Christians. My friends were hard-core Christians. I couldn’t just abandon my faith so flippantly. So I searched. And searched. And searched. 
I entered a very volatile period of my Christian faith. There were weeks where I fully believed my faith, and then next weekend, I would just fall apart and wander the streets of Chicago, feeling empty and lifeless and questioning my very existence. I eventually resolved some of the issues that I was struggling with, but I still had many that bothered me. I reached a point where all of these issues were piling up and my brain couldn’t take it anymore. I had to abandon Christianity or make a blind leap of faith. I made the leap. I said to myself, “I believe in Jesus. I have experienced his love. He has changed my life. If Jesus is believed the Bible, then I trust him, and so I trust the Bible.” 

Soon after this I entered a period of stability with my faith. I changed my major to Pastoral with the idea of becoming a pastor after graduating. I then was presented with an opportunity to become a part time high school youth pastor at a medium size church. I accepted the position. Shortly after, I started a relationship with a wonderful girl that I had already known for over a year. 

She was what I would consider my first real girlfriend, and we got along so well 98% of the time. Our relationship was progressing very quickly, and by Thanksgiving that same year, we were close enough that she invited me to go back with her for Thanksgiving during break to meet her family. I thoroughly enjoyed my time with her and her family, and her family loved me. Up until this point, we had never so much as kissed. The most physical thing we had done was have me put my arm around her shoulder while we sat and talked on the benches strewn throughout downtown Chicago. We regularly went for walks and talked for hours on hours. One of the things that she made clear pretty early in the relationship was that she wanted to save her first kiss for the man she was going to marry. That didn’t mean she wanted to wait to kiss until our wedding day, but she wanted wait to kiss a guy until she was sure that they were going to get married. 

That is why our first kiss was so meaningful. It was the last day that Thanksgiving week in Ohio that I took out her out on a date to one of the local restaurants. On our trip back, we stopped in a parking lot to just talk because we hadn’t had much for alone time that week. It was there that I said I loved her, and she said she loved me back, and we kissed, and it was the most amazing feeling I had ever felt. And I am laughing and crying as I write this because we were so concerned about us maintaining our sexual purity that we made a rule that day that we cannot kiss more than one time each day, except that we made an exception that first day, and kissed one more time, but that was the only time.

It was a couple months later during Christmas break when severe doubts returned. I was open and honest with my girlfriend that I was struggling to keep the faith. I remember balling my eyes out over the skype video call and being incredibly afraid of what she would say. She promised we would work through it together and we would meet with a professor together and discuss the doubts that I was having. 

And so when we got back to school, we did meet with the professor, but it didn’t help much. I was trying to teach the teens in the youth group how to live their lives for Christ. I really wanted them to believe and take their faith seriously and be good people. But there I was struggling with my own faith. I found myself drowning under the pressure, dreading every weekend where I would be responsible to give them a lesson. Things were caving in around me.

1zq3bo,48,2014-03-06,$30/€25 Giveaway to EU/US WoW Battle.net Store,invisi1407,wow,https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/1zq3bo/3025_giveaway_to_euus_wow_battlenet_store/,"*(Edit: THE WINNERS HAVE BEEN SELECTED, SEE BELOW!)*

Hello guys and girls!

I have played WoW since February 2013 and have come to love it and I sometimes see people who wish they could transfer to another server or faction change or whatever it might be; some would even want to have a bought mount because they look awesome ([Enchanted Fey Dragon](http://www.wowhead.com/item=97989/enchanted-fey-dragon), *I'm looking at you!*).

So - I would like to give away anything from the EU/US WoW Battle.net Store with a value of $30/€25 or less to 1 person. I have a EU account but I believe I should be able to buy a redeemable key in the US store as well. If someone knows I can't and let's me know, this will be restricted to EU accounts only.

For €25 you could get two pets, one mount, a server transfer, faction change or a race change.
Two pets are fine since they are €10 each.

***So what do I have to do?***

State what you'd like (don't be lazy - link to the store) and briefly explain why.

***Why are you doing this?***

Because fun times.

***When will we know who won?***

Tomorrow at noon. That is, Friday the 7th of March 2014 at approximately 12:00 GMT+1 (my timezone)
Any posts before that time is eligible for being picked.

*Moderators have approved me posting this.*

Edit: I noticed that [Alterac Brew Pup and Enchanted Fey Dragon](https://eu.battle.net/shop/en/product/world-of-warcraft-mount-fey-dragon-bundle) bundle is €26 and I just want to say to anyone wanting that, that it is fine. I had put €25 because it seemed to be the most expensive thing with regards to character services and mounts are only €20. Thanks to /u/TheGentleshark for pointing that out, however unintentional it was. :)

Edit 2: Wow, so many people replying with one good reason after the other - it will be hard to pick someone, but I have my eye on a few people already. Because of that (and because I just did a quick ""*26 eur in dkk*"" on Google) I will give away 2x €26/$30 to two different people (Edit: that is 1x prize per person)

I any of you feel a certain story sounds worthy, please don't hesitate to up-vote it! I will **not** use up-votes as a criteria for selecting winners, but depending on what gets up-voted I might be able to pull something out of my sleeve! :&gt;

**Edit 3: I would  really like to know who is downvoting this and why. It saddens me that people would downvote someone giving something away for free, but I guess this is just how the Internet works these days.**

----

**Edit 4:**

**The winners have been chosen!**

I opted to select the winners a little while before the time I wrote simply because there are already too many comments and I have already gone through every single one of them, making sure I would pick the *right* winners.

**What is a *right winner*?**

For example, /u/Ellylles won the [Enchanted Fey Dragon And Alterac Brew Pup](https://us.battle.net/shop/en/product/world-of-warcraft-mount-fey-dragon-bundle) because his/her reason was that s/he thinks the eyes of the mount looks cute and that I farmed reputation for my *Netherwing Drake* shortly after I began playing because my friend had it and I thought it looked *cute* - just as s/he thinks the Fey Dragon does. So, there.

Next, /u/MooNinja won a Faction Change, however I'm going to make that happen. Why? In all honesty, his story about kids and a new wife didn't touch me much; I'm kind of like cold hearted towards *them feels* about that; however! One thing I know for sure is that playing with friends or family is important to me because it can actually bring people together and they'll all have a blast; to that end, having this dude join his two step-sons who, to begin with, chose *the right side* (HE HE) would make me happy.

Moreover, I have randomly selected a few people over the lifetime of my thread that I thought deserved special treatement of some kind.

/u/mabgeek lost his job and cannot afford to play a game he loves; this stinks and being able to play WoW for at least one more month could probably help him NOT feel all lost and what not. He got 30 days of game time.

/u/BigBere wanted to give away 2 pets to people from his guild. Giving away to someone to give away is fantastic! He has not yet gotten the game codes because I am waiting for a reply, but he will.

/u/Ashiu has a girlfriend who works a lot and lives far from her job as an intern and she loves to collect pets but don't have the time to do so. I sent him [Moonkin Hatchling](https://eu.battle.net/shop/en/product/world-of-warcraft-pet-moonkin-hatchling) to give to his girlfriend. That hatchling is so fucking adorable! :D

**Why did I not win?**

Because ~260 other people wanted close to the same as you and because I do not have endless amounts of money. If I had, you would all have gotten what you wanted. No. questions. asked.

I am sad that I cannot go all Oprah Winfrey on y'all and give all of you an Enchanted Fey Dragon, whatsitsface bloodwing something mount and Faction Change all of you. There are many great stories here and there are many people who deserves server transfers and what not.

I believe Blizzard should sell character services in bundles of 10 for a *special prize for us*; I would buy a fuckton.

**What now?**

I am planning to do this again next month on the 1st of April 2014. Next time, however, I will restrict the gift(s) to certain items in order to be able to more easily select a winner. It has been, quite honestly, very exciting but also very time consuming to select one."
1zq94f,5,2014-03-06,"Me [27 M] with my girlfriend [34 F] 4 years, long-term: Should we break up or stick it out?",mrdude42,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1zq94f/me_27_m_with_my_girlfriend_34_f_4_years_longterm/,"I've been in a relationship for almost 4 years now. We both love each other but we've gotten to a point where that may not be enough anymore. We started out great. We had fun. We had a lot of sex. We were happy. But I fucked up early-on and that made her lose some of her trust in me and I've never been able to completely recover. For clarity, lets just call her Diana. I should also mention, we are 8 years apart in age. I’m in my late 20’s and she’s in her early 30’s.


When Diana and I first met I was just getting out of a 4-5 year relationship with another girl. Lets call her Alison. (i know. i'm a serial monogamist.) I was trying to be a nice guy to Alison (looking back that was a stupid idea) but it seemed to come at the expense of my new relationship I was starting with Diana. She was not liking that my ex was still around in my life. Eventually, Diana and I had a few arguments over Alison still calling me sometimes and so I decided to cut Alison completely out of my life. The problem was this was kind of too-little too-late. There was nothing going on between Alison and I after we broke up but Diana couldn’t understand why I would even still want to be friends with my ex. Even after I cut off ties with Alison, Diana still found a few of Alison’s belongings in my garage on a shelf and she was mad that I didn’t go through and toss everything out. It was hard for me to find everything because Alison and I had been together for so long I didn’t even remember everything I had. Finally, I went through all my stuff and made sure there was nothing. I even deleted all Facebook pictures that had Alison in them and unfriended her on Facebook. It was a complete purge of my ex. Looking back I think I should have done from the get go. So that problem was finally solved but it had left a permanent scar on our relationship.


Fast forward a couple years, we’re doing good. Then I find out I’m not going to be able to graduate college on time. Not even just and extra semester but its going to take probably 3 more years because I had changed schools 3 times and changed my major 4 times. My transcripts were a mess of transfers and classes that didn’t count for my current major. So I had to make the tough decision of dropping out of college. It really sucked. I mean, I’ve never been an A student but I thought I could at least get my degree. Diana was definitely a good student. She graduated a year early from high school, got her bachelors, and then got a masters degree a year early than normal. So when I made the decision to drop out of college she was not happy. I found out more recently that she was also really upset because I had made the decision without talking to her about it yet. So that was another fuck up on my part.


So I wasn’t in school anymore and I was just working construction with my family business. She moved in with me in a nice condo free of rent because I was managing the whole building so that was a good deal. We lived there for a couple years but she always had wanted to move back to NYC. I always thought about moving to NYC too so eventually she got an offer in NYC so we moved. Now we’ve been living in NYC for about 6 months and things aren’t too great. We haven’t had sex in over 2 months now. I’m working an low-pay internship and still looking for a full-time job. I’m not writing this because I want to complain or say its all her fault or anything. I just don’t know what to do anymore. I feel like I fucked up a lot by unknowingly being selfish for so long and created all this baggage that she can’t get past.


Basically, our relationship has degraded over time to where she is the bread-winner in the relationship. I pay 1/4 of the rent every month and take care of utility bills. But she pays the rest of the rent and buys groceries and pays when we go out. She makes a lot more money than me so thats just how it ended up. Also, I feel like our age difference is an issue that she can’t get past. She always brings up how I’m so young and so now our relationship has turned into her feeling like a mother figure while I feel like she treats me like a child. And I don’t blame her for that because I feel like in the beginning of our relationship I was like a child. I’ve grown so much being with her because she pointed out a lot of my flaws that I was oblivious too before. Like my lack of ability to communicate my feelings and my passive aggressiveness I got from my family be so passive aggressive. I much more aware of how I treat others and her especially but I wonder if it is too late now. I was so ignorant before of how I was hurting our relationship by making important decisions with out even talking to her about them and by starting a lot of things and not finishing them. Like dropping out of school, not finishing a few projects I said I would, and still not having a good full-time job. I’ve been really trying now for the past couple weeks after we had our last big fight. We almost broke up but we didn’t.
Part of me wonders if I haven’t left because I have no where to go in NYC. All my friends and family are 3,000 miles away. I don’t think that’s the case though. I’ve actually done the math to figure out if I could survive being homeless for a while until I find a job in the city to support myself. I know some of my new friends and coworkers would let me crash at their place for a while too. It’s just a matter of figuring out if this relationship is repairable of if I’m just kicking a dead horse. I love her very very much and I know she loves me. She stayed with me even when she wasn’t happy because she thought I would change but unfortunately I didn’t realize she was so unhappy until now and now she’s tired of it. She complains that I only noticed because we stopped having sex. And that’s true, I thought we were ok until we started having less and less sex.


To be honest, the last 2 weeks have gotten better since I decided I was going to change. Now that I’m aware of what was making her so unhappy. I’m being more motivated. I’ve gone to several job interviews. I’m being more thoughtful and trying to make her feel special with little things, and I’ve stopped bothering her about sex. If she wants to come to me then that’s cool but I’m not going to bug her about our lack of sex for the time being. I’m trying to be patient. I just wish I was aware of this much earlier. That I wasn’t such a dumb kid just a few years ago.
This ended up being way longer than I thought it was going to be so I’ll stop here. I just don’t know what to do. What do you think?



---   
**tl;dr**: I don't know if I should break-up or try to fix my relationship with my girlfriend. We have a lot of baggage and our relationship has basically regressed to where she feels like she nags me like shes my mom and I feel like she treats me like kid. I messed up early-on in our relationship which made her think I was immature and I didn't finish things I started and now she make a lot more money than me and so I feel like I'm not contributing enough to the relationship monetarily. Now we haven't had sex in over 2 months when we used to have sex 2-3 times a week. She thinks I only started to change because we stopped having sex which is true. I was unaware of her unhappiness until I started to be unhappy from the lack of sex. Now I realize that I wasn't being very aware of her feelings. The last couple of weeks have been nice now that I've started to be more aware and I've had several job interviews for a better job but is it too late?"
1zqdxa,3,2014-03-06,Taxes and Dependency - Full Time Student No Support,lynix,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1zqdxa/taxes_and_dependency_full_time_student_no_support/,"Hi Personal Finance,

I'm a full time student and I also work part time during the school year and worked a full time internship over last summer, clearing about $22k in income on W2's.

To pay for school costs, I pulled out and additional $13k in loans, and received about $5k in support from my mother, nothing form my father.

That's the back story, and that's how it's been for 2011, 2012, and again in 2013, however i made much less in 2011 and 2012, $6k and $10k respectively.

My father wants to claim me as a dependent, and I've already run my taxes (not filed yet) and with the school credits (american opportunity) I get all of my income taxes back ~$3100 this year.  If he claims me, I won't get anything, and instead he will, claiming that ""he gets more back from it"" but he's done this the last two years as well while I've gotten no support form him and covered school 100% in loans/ part time work while in school, it feels like I'm being taken advantage of since he's getting the credit from saying he paid my education expenses.  It's tough because its family and I don't want to start something.

Is there any way around this or am I just at his whim as to whether he decides to claim me or if I somehow guilt him into not doing it again this year? "
1zqkt2,2,2014-03-06,My [25f] live-in boyfriend [28m] has a job interview in New York. We live in Canada.,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1zqkt2/my_25f_livein_boyfriend_28m_has_a_job_interview/,"I am sorting through an overwhelming mix of emotions and need some insight from people who might have had similar experiences.

My boyfriend and I have been together for three years. We met in college. He graduated first and moved to Toronto. I stayed to finish my MA and joined him a year later. We were long distance for that year but only about 2 hours apart and saw each other at least every other weekend. 

Last year we moved into a gorgeous dream apartment. We've been making it a home while I get my career started. He has a full time, successful job in his field. Out of nowhere a few weeks ago he told me he applied for a job in Washington, D.C. Not much came of it, but he confided in me that he feels in order to excel in his career his opportunities in Canada are limited and he has to pursue jobs in the states or U.K. This is largely true, but I didn't know he felt that way or was unhappy in his current job (he is).

Shortly after this discussion, he went to a conference in the states and met a professional from a very high-end company in NYC. The guy was won over by my bf, reviewed his work and wants to fly him down for an interview next week. We talked about what our plan would be if he takes the job: he'd move to New York, I'd stay here to finish a summer internship while looking for work and trying to move down after the summer. 

There are a lot of problems though. For one, I don't really want to move to New York. It sounds kind of glamourous but I love Toronto. I have friends, family, job connections here. I've started to build a life here. Not for nothing but I love our apartment too. Plus the idea of living in the United States doesn't really appeal to me. The ideals don't really jive with my Liberal Canadian sensibilities and I'm kind of fond of my free health care. 

I also feel hurt that he seems willing to put our relationship on the line, be long-distance for who knows how long and leave everything we have here just for a job. My career is important to me but it doesn't trump our relationship. He says that it's not that he doesn't care, he just isn't worried. He thinks we are strong enough to handle it, that I can get a job and join him and he doesn't want to live down there for more than a few years anyway. 

I want to support him in his career choices and I know this would be a huge step for him, but I am hurt, scared and worried about what will happen. Everything seemed to be going so well here. I thought it would stay like this for awhile and we would eventually get married. Now it feels like I've had a bomb dropped on me.

Am I overreacting? Being unsupportive? Are we doomed or is long-distance not that hard even after you've lived together for 2 years? How do we find a compromise in this situation when we seem to want different things, but still want to be together?

**TL;DR: Boyfriend and I live together in Toronto for 2 years. Suddenly he is pursuing international jobs and will likely move to NYC this year, making us long-distance and me sad.**"
1zqlqg,6,2014-03-06,A few questions about getting a malware analysis related internship,Websly,Malware,https://www.reddit.com/r/Malware/comments/1zqlqg/a_few_questions_about_getting_a_malware_analysis/,"First off, I'm a 2nd year networking student in The Netherlands. The first half of next college year I'm supposed to do an internship.
I have contacts that can get me into a cloud provider company.
However, I would first want to look for a possible malware related internship.

The past year I've been doing analysis on malware (mostly using Ollydbg) and following many blogs. Before that I spent probably half a year looking at non-malware.
The mistake I've made was that I've only worked on random malware I got from malware packs I found around the internet instead of going through the most famous and interesting samples that are listed on kernelmode.info.

So finally my questions: 

1)What skills will I need to have to get an internship and actually be useful?

2)Are there even internships for these positions?

3)What malware would you say are most important and I definitely need to understand?

4)How important is knowledge of advanced math/cryptography?


I also would like to know about the average work day of a malware analyst:

5)How many samples do you look at per day?

6)Do you do deep analysis on them (Ollydbg,IDA Pro,etc) or do you mostly just run dynamic analysis tools?

7)What do you do once you have analyzed a sample? Do you look for signatures and send that to the developers or do you do some developing yourself?


I know there are quite some questions, so I won't blame you if don't have time :)"

I really feel confident that I fit behaviorally into the culture, and I am a proficient coder, but how can I improve and brush up my skills up until the start date?

I've always stuck myself in the room and have no real friends on campus to talk to or hang out with. I'm shy, socially awkward, and have low self-esteem. Everytime I try doing something to better myself I always end up giving up. 

I've had 3 semesters in a row where I completed less than 12 credit hours. I'm currently in probation and I'm still not making any progress. Since my 2nd year, I've been skipping classes and withdrawing from many classes. I don't feel any bit panic or nervousness of failing exams, missing homework/classes which makes me not care about even trying to do well and I procrastinate so hard. I continued that behavior even now after winging my midterms for most classes. Classes aren't difficult to the point where I don't understand it at all. I still end most of my classes with C's and B's and that's with missing classes, not turning in some HW's etc. etc. The problem is that I always drop classes and that ends up with me earning less than 12 credit hours per semester. 

But it now hits me how deep of a hole I dug myself in. I feel so guilty and horrible and just want to run away from it all. My parents are paying for my college and supporting me and I'm here just wasting it all. I'm a disgrace of a son, and I feel like just getting life over with. I don't have anything to show in my resume, and I feel like I know absolutely nothing about my major and I don't feel confident to go look for internship, research, or even to talk to my fellow classmates of the same major. 

It's not even the problem with my major, I've switched major twice and found chem e to be most interesting. I feel like the problem is I still have a child mindset where I don't want to work and just play games and watch shows all day. I've lost motivation and the focus on academics.

Suicide has come up to my mind but that makes me even more of a scumbag of a child to my parents who invested and supported me so much... 

I don't even know what I'm doing anymore. I feel like someone should come right at me and beat me up twice, even thrice, for all the wasted time and effort my parents have put on me and that I've put on myself..."
1zqucn,1,2014-03-06,Drop or receive D?,goflvhxj963,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/1zqucn/drop_or_receive_d/,"Hey guys I'm currently a senior majoring in mechanical engineering having serious problem. I've been in constant depress last year and ended up receiving bad grades and got a warning letter from school about my satisfactory academic progress. It says that I need to stay in at least 12 credits and term grade of 2.0 or better. The things is that I'm taking 4 classes right now which is 12 credit but I'm thinking about dropping one class due to danger of not being able to pass the class. I called the financial aid office about this and they told me that although it won't affect my financial aid for this semester as they already provided the aid to me, it might affect the academic progress warning. So should I just get a D in class or withdraw? It seems that in terms of gpa, w is pretty much same as getting F because I made an attempt to finish the course. But if I just take it and get the D, for the term grade, I won't be in danger.
The reason why I'm hesitating is that due to those years of depression, I receive 3 F's (which I retook and passed), 3 D's and 2 W's (I know, really bad). Adding another D to this seems like really bad, but if I withdraw, it'll affect the financial aid as I might not pass the satisfactory academic progress.
I'm currently waiting for a reply from an interview for summer internship and I'm scared they might ask for my transcript for verification.

CON there are two girls living in (different apartments as far as i know.)

The problem here is he eats and goes out for lunch and dinner everyday with them. There are constantly tagged pictures of them. There are constant times where he is out with them
AND THE WORST PART IS TWO OF THEM SPLIT ON THE CAR TOGETHER
This wouldn't bother me so much if they hadn't met eachother only TWO FUCKING MONTHS AGO. TWO MONTHS. And they bought a car together. HE CAN SAY NOTHING IS GOING ON UNTIL HE IS BLUE IN THE FUCKING FACE. But he does not understand how or why this would hurt me at all. I can't believe he would do this. 
He already knew how upset I am that he goes out with these girls every single FUCKIN day. And yet he goes out and buys a car with her??? Are you kidding me?
I dont even know how to react, I can't stop crying and he just doesn't understand and doesnt care. I dont even know what to do?

I have a plan to see him in april but I just don't know if I can do this, if I can deal with this situation. I can barely breath right now. I feel incredibly hurt and blindsided. I feel like he didnt even put himself in my shoes to see how I would feel about it?

I graduated this past April from college. I've been working at my current job since last February (started as an intern last Feb, moved into full time last May). I'm an independent contractor who works from home doing social media management. I studied mass communication in college, and I truly do love it, and I love social media. But I hate my job. There's so much I could say why, but I just hate it.

I've been trying to find work elsewhere for months. At the beginning of the year, I realized I wanted to be involved in higher education, because I had such a great experience at my alma mater. Also, due to my past, I believe in investing in others and helping them find their dreams and passions.

So, last month, I applied for a job in the admissions office at my alma mater. I could be involved in higher ed and help prospective students know why I love my alma mater and help them realize that they can pursue their goals/dream at my alma mater as well. I knew I wasn't qualified for it, but I put myself out there. I had a phone interview. I couldn't believe it. Last Friday, I had multiple interviews on campus, and had to give a presentation. For a week and a half, I poured my heart, soul, my everything into preparing for this job interview. All the interviews went well. Everyone seemed great, and I received fantastic feedback.

Yesterday, I get an email. ""Thanks for applying. We went with someone else. Good luck in your career pursuits.""

I've received that email so many times the past few months. I know I'm a young graduate, and I know I might lack experience, but I did so many internships and had so many jobs during college. I feel like I have some experience and I can make a difference wherever I might work.
To add to it, I'm getting married next year. My fiancee is going back to school this summer. We're living with her mom. I just want to provide her a place of our own. I want it to be me and her. I want to be the man she deserves. And I just feel like I can't. Every single time I apply to a job, it just tears me apart. And I'm tired of not being good enough. I just want a company to give me a chance to make something. To build relationships. To be passionate about and make a difference in someone's life.

I just want something better. I just want to be given a chance. "
1zqy05,1,2014-03-06,An inspiring Mechanical Engineer loaded with questions. Please help.,OnePieceTwoPiece,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/1zqy05/an_inspiring_mechanical_engineer_loaded_with/,"First off, I'm 20 and I didn't do that well in High School, mainly from the lack of motivation because I didn't know what to do and other life problems that never got resolved. So here I am finally motivated and firmly believe I want to be a Mechanical Engineer. I would like to know some things.

How beneficial would it be for me to go to a Community College and get my Gen-Eds and then go to a University? (Like would it hurt my chances to get internships because I wasn't working on my Major from Freshman year; or do I have this process all screwed up?)

A couple things about the question above. I live in Wisconsin and there is one UW College in particular that doesn't have many Majors or Minors, it's more for doing your Gen-Eds, but it makes it easier to transfer to the numerous UW School across Wisconsin. 

What would be a good PC or Laptop to invest in?

How hard would it be to get into colleges to pursue Mechanical Engineering when I slacked off in High School?

I believe I'll have more questions, but I'll start with these starter questions.

Thanks!

1zqyn9,12,2014-03-06,Best places to look for entry level IT jobs?,[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1zqyn9/best_places_to_look_for_entry_level_it_jobs/,"I've been looking to start a career in IT for a couple of months now and only had 1 interview, which went very well but they went with someone who had more experience.

I have no prior work experience which I feel is my biggest problem. I have a few years of voluntary work with a charity where I dabbled in some basic IT stuff towards the end, but that doesn't seem to be enough. I am A+ certified. I also have a bachelors degree in Photography for what it's worth.

I use the usual sites like Craigslist, Indeed, Monster, Dice etc. but they are full of stuff they is way above me and full of the same jobs that get posted every day that I've already applied to months ago. I feel my best bet currently is Craiglist because there is a higher chance of seeing entry level positions posted there but even those positions don't get back to me. I've even applied for internships (even though I would really like to be earning money at this point) but they seem to favour recent graduates or those currently enrolled.

I've tried some unconventional methods like typing in 'computer repair' to Google maps and checking out everything in my area but very few of those places have a career section and when I contact them directly I receive no response.

I'm just really frustrated and looking for some ideas, maybe some job sites that I should be paying more attention to or good ways of getting in the door. I am 24 and have never had a job and this stresses me out a lot and makes me really worried. I simply need that one opportunity."

[ The public is always told when we have the meteors that are passing really close by Earth...should there be one that is on a collision course, are we going to be told abou that one, or would it cause too much chaos to tell us?  What is the protocal for such an event?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zqlzm/were_a_team_of_nasa_meteor_experts_from_the/cfw0mha?context=5)|The answer is yes. Should an asteroid be detected on a collision course, the public would be informed. As a matter of fact, you can see all known close approaches of asteroids by going to [Link to neo.jpl.nasa.gov](http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/ca) The protocol for such events is that NASA would inform the appropriate government agencies such as FEMA and the Dept. of Defense, who would coordinate a response. If time is short before an impact, that would probably consist of evacuating the area. B.C.
[Even if it were an Earth-killer size?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zqlzm/were_a_team_of_nasa_meteor_experts_from_the/cfw1bgo?context=5)|There are no objects that big of which we are currently aware. I sincerely doubt we would have to face this scenario. B.C.
[What's the largest object that could possible come anywhere near us?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zqlzm/were_a_team_of_nasa_meteor_experts_from_the/cfw1lzg?context=5)|An object a few tens of kilometers across - won't destroy the planet, but would make it very uncomfortable for life for a few decades. Mass extinction and all that stuff. B.C.
[What did ""Gravity"" get wrong in regards to how objects orbit and move in space? Specifically in regards to re-entry?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zqlzm/were_a_team_of_nasa_meteor_experts_from_the/cfw18w9?context=5)|""Gravity"" had a the Hubble Space Telescope, the International Space Station, the Russian space station, which no longer exists, and a Chinese space station, fairly close to each other in space. This is very wrong. But I go to movies to be entertained, not to evaluate their scientific accuracy. Star Wars would be very boring without sound accompanying all the explosions. B.C.
[How useful are the minerals we can obtain from meteors or are they just as easily obtainable on earth?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zqlzm/were_a_team_of_nasa_meteor_experts_from_the/cfw0suz?context=5)|Meteorites contain basically the same elements as found on Earth, just in different abundances. So it is easier to get them here on Earth than wait for them to come to us. Exceptions may be iridium, which is more abundant in meteorites than on Earth, so if you're constructing an inter-dimensional portal like in the movie ""Thor,"" you may have a need for such. B.C.
[Silly question: have any of you ever accidentally misread test results and for a split second thought you were dealing with an apocalypse scenario? :P.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zqlzm/were_a_team_of_nasa_meteor_experts_from_the/cfw1fej?context=5)|No, but that would sure make for an interesting day! (DM)
[What are my chances of being killed by a meteor?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zqlzm/were_a_team_of_nasa_meteor_experts_from_the/cfw0u7c?context=5)|No one in recorded history has been killed by a meteorite, so I would say very small. A lady in Alabama was hit by a meteorite crashing through the roof of her bedroom in the 1950s. It bruised her side and she had to see her doctor, but no long term damage. B.C.
[What is the present condition of the comet Shoemaker Levy 9 impact zone on Jupiter? Will JUNO image this site?   Will New Horizons encounter meteor risk during its travel to Pluto and the kuiper belt?   How many impacts on the lunar surface had been imaged?   Will MRO, Odyssey, Mars Express, MAMEN or MOM be impacted by Comet Siding Spring c/2003A1? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zqlzm/were_a_team_of_nasa_meteor_experts_from_the/cfw1d7i?context=5)|Going to take a couple of your questions... 5) We have seen over 300 impacts from meteoroids on the lunar surface. 6) Because of how big it is! Another popular place for large meteors to occur is over the ocean because... well... it is about 2/3 of the surface of Earth. 8) It is possible, and The Meteoroid Environment Office has done work to try to predict this risk but it is hard to say definitely if and which spacecraft will be affected. However, the risk has been decreasing as time has gone by and we have been able to get more accurate understanding of the dust production of comet Siding Spring. It is currently a factor of 20 less than the original calculated risk.
[What's a way that I, a typical guy in Los Angeles, can be more involved with NASA and space exploration?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zqlzm/were_a_team_of_nasa_meteor_experts_from_the/cfw112f?context=5)|There are numerous citizen science opportunities out there. Go to [Link to science.nasa.gov](http://science.nasa.gov/citizen-scientists) and see if there is anything that strikes your fancy. B.C.
[What is the hardest part of your job?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zqlzm/were_a_team_of_nasa_meteor_experts_from_the/cfw1byh?context=5)|Trying to predict the intensity or strength of meteor showers as this is important for astronauts to know if they go outside the space station on EVA. Have to get this right. B.C.
[Also, you guys have awesome jobs.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zqlzm/were_a_team_of_nasa_meteor_experts_from_the/cfw0wgv?context=5)|Yes, we do have an awesome job. I always found the idea of rocks falling from the skies fascinating, so I decided to pursue that when I came to NASA. Who can resist the idea of playing Chicken Little. B.C.  Meteors are something that I can observe with my own eyes.  That makes them more real to me (and more understandable) than other fields in astronomy.  And despite seeing a lot of meteors, I still feel a sense of awe and wonder when I see another.  It's that sort of continuing excitement that makes this an awesome job!
[Have you found any precious or new elements at a meteor impact site?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zqlzm/were_a_team_of_nasa_meteor_experts_from_the/cfw10wl?context=5)|Nope. Pretty mundane stuff. No platinum, no gold, though from the prices meteorites command on eBay, you'd think they were made of this stuff. B.C.
[Lets say an Asteroid as big as the one in the movie ""Armageddon"" is on a collision course with Earth.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zqlzm/were_a_team_of_nasa_meteor_experts_from_the/cfw0ub7?context=5)|Call Bruce Willis. :-)
[How do you guys plan to stop it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zqlzm/were_a_team_of_nasa_meteor_experts_from_the/cfw0ub7?context=5)|Seriously, it all depends on the amount of time before the collision. If we have decades or longer, we can try using the gravity of a massive space ship to gently tug the asteroid off course or paint one side of it a reflective color so that the difference in heat radiation off the asteroid will change its trajectory. If we don't have a long time, we may have to resort to the movies favorite planetary defense scheme, i.e. nuclear weapons. B.C.
[Did you have any more details about the large fireball that was seen over the eastern U.S. on February 27th?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zqlzm/were_a_team_of_nasa_meteor_experts_from_the/cfw1isy?context=5)|I'm not sure what you know already so I'll just summarize.  The American Meteor Society received 290 witness reports about a fireball seen on Feb 27 around 19:10 EST (Feb 28 00:10 UTC) from Virginia, Maryland, West Virginia, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Washington DC, and North and South Carolina.  It was also featured on CNN.  The fireball was detected at EXTREME range (hundreds of kilometers) by two NASA all sky meteor cameras located in Brevard, North Carolina and Hiram, Ohio. Because of this range a trajectory is difficult to determine.  Our cameras first detected it on February 27 at 7:07:58 PM EST at an altitude of 80 km above the town of Montebello, Virginia, moving SW towards Roanoke with a speed of around 15 km/s (33,500 mph). Our cameras lost track of the meteor around an altitude of 68 km as it disappeared below the horizon, though it undoubtedly penetrated lower in the atmosphere. Magnitude was approximately -8.5, which is brighter than the crescent Moon. Taking into account the speed, we are dealing with an object having a diameter of about 1 foot (30 cm) and a mass in the vicinity of 50 lbs (23 kg). (DM)
[Which are better for getting to know the meteors? The telescopes (on earth / in space\) or the radar-like scanners?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zqlzm/were_a_team_of_nasa_meteor_experts_from_the/cfw15p3?context=5)|The Meteoroid Environment Office (MEO) uses telescopes, cameras, and radars all to detect meteors. There are benefits to each. Radars are great because the forward-scatter radar that the MEO uses sees a huge area of the sky resulting in over 10,000 meteor detections every 24 hours. So we get a lot of data from there. Radar also sees the very smallest meteors (sub-millimeter). Cameras are great for millimeter-sized meteors and centimeter-sized meteors. And telescopes are used to observe meteors hitting the moon which are from meteors several centimeters across. So to say which one is 'better' is hard as we need to observe meteors in all those size-regimes. I'm personally partial to radars as I worked with radar data for my MSc thesis. :-)
[Which is your ""Oh that's something extraordinary!"" moment?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zqlzm/were_a_team_of_nasa_meteor_experts_from_the/cfw15p3?context=5)|My ''wow!"" moment in my career was the Chelyabinsk meteor in Russia last February. So crazy! Loved getting to work on that event. -RB.
[You mean that you consider even the sub-millimeter particles as meteors? And what is the need of observing such tiny sized meteors hitting the moon - I mean they are so small, why do we consider them if they are hitting the moon?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zqlzm/were_a_team_of_nasa_meteor_experts_from_the/cfw2w88?context=5)|Yes, meteoroids can be quite small and still be detectable by radar when they ablate in the atmosphere. These are small particles but they are traveling very fast!  Think tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of mph.  In terms of energy, that really packs a punch.   A 1 mm sized meteoroid could have the punch of a 22 caliber bullet.  A cm sized meteoroid could have the destructive power of a cannon shell.
[Could we ever harness the power of a meteor, redirecting it to hit an enemy combatant, such as Russia, should things escalate?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zqlzm/were_a_team_of_nasa_meteor_experts_from_the/cfw0sa0?context=5)|In theory,  such a thing can be done, but I don't think this is a practicable weapon at least for the next few centuries. By that time, we will probably have phaser banks and photon torpedos. B.C.
[Is there anything classified about your work? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zqlzm/were_a_team_of_nasa_meteor_experts_from_the/cfw0vw1?context=5)|If we told you we'd have to kill you.  ;-)  (DM)
[If a meteor were to fall in the ocean or a body of water, how large does it need to be to create a coastal flooding/tsunami event?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zqlzm/were_a_team_of_nasa_meteor_experts_from_the/cfw0uk4?context=5)|The Earth's atmosphere breaks up most meteors, so it would take a meteor about 300 meters across. This size of meteor hits the Earth about every 100,000-300,000 years (that is an estimate!) so it is highly unlikely.  -RB.
[With the last sentence of the study concluding: ""...textural and compositional similarities to features in terrestrial samples, which have been interpreted as biogenic, imply the intriguing possibility that the martian features were formed by biotic activity""  Question: Are you intrigued? And just personally, if you were forced to give a probability to this possibility, how would you place the likelihood of a biogenic vs abiogenic origin to these features in Yamato, Nakhla, etc.?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zqlzm/were_a_team_of_nasa_meteor_experts_from_the/cfw1qhg?context=5)|The article also said possibility of formation by biotic activity. This is by no means conclusive, it just suggests this is one possible explanation. B.C. 
[Have you ever found something our of the ordinary on a meteor? (undiscovered elements, fossils, etc\). Ps. I think its awesome that you work with NASA, I absolutely love outerspace!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zqlzm/were_a_team_of_nasa_meteor_experts_from_the/cfw23k5?context=5)|Nope, we have not found any unusual elements in meteorites. I am very disappointed; my comic book studies indicated I should find Kryptonite in a few. :-) B.C.

[Okay this isn't really about meteors, but in the movie Gravity, Russia uses a missile to destroy one of their satellites, and the debris from this explosion starts a ""chain reaction"" blowing up other satellites, which then takes out the ISS, the space shuttle, and a Chinese space station.  THEN, the debris continues in the same orbit, going much faster than the ISS, goes all the way around the earth and ends up hitting the ISS again, 3 consecutive times.  So, first of all, how likely is it that any debris from any satellite could hit any other satellite? I understand the earth is very large. Is there any chance debris could ever cause a ""chain reaction""? How would this compare to, say, a comet trail?  Secondly, if there was debris in the same orbit as the ISS, but going thousands of km/h faster, is there any chance it would meet the same object when it came around again? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zqlzm/were_a_team_of_nasa_meteor_experts_from_the/cfw1zog?context=5)|Any explosive event in Earth orbit generates fragments. If this event occurs in a region where there is a concentration of satellite orbits like sun-synchronous altitudes, the fragments could collide with satellites in those orbits and create more fragments, sort of like in a chain reaction. However, it would only affect satellites in those orbits and would not be quick like in ""Gravity."" The collisions would occur over many years, not just in a few hours. As far as your second question, it depends on the nature of the debris; if it is strongly affected by atmospheric drag, it's trajectory will be changed enough that it will not pass near the ISS or some other object it previously encountered. B.C.
[I've heard that some people think microorganisms like tardigrades came to earth on meteorites. If so, how would one of those rocks get off a planet and into space to carry it somewhere?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zqlzm/were_a_team_of_nasa_meteor_experts_from_the/cfw1j80?context=5)|A possibility -- There would have to be an energetic enough collision between the planet and a minor body to eject some debris. After that the debris would be affected by gravity from the Sun &amp; other planets, radiation pressure, P-R drag, etc. which would change its orbit and place it on an intercept course with another planet. (DM)
[How long we got before being wiped out by a meteor? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zqlzm/were_a_team_of_nasa_meteor_experts_from_the/cfw0vhe?context=5)|There are currently no large asteroids (greater than a mile across) projected to strike Earth for the next few centuries.

Thanks for doing this, keep up the good work!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zqlzm/were_a_team_of_nasa_meteor_experts_from_the/cfw1ia1?context=5)|The Space Station has armor so it is protected against meteors.
 |Meteors do post a risk to spacecraft, but one of the products of the Meteoroid Environment Office (us!) are models that predict that risk - how many meteors of various sizes and speeds a spacecraft may encounter on its mission. That helps them decide how much shielding to put on their spacecraft to minimize that risk.

[In the recent Bill Nye &amp; Ken Ham debate on creationism, Mr. Ham stated that the age of the Earth was not determined based on any sample from Earth, but using data from nearby asteroids.

[Which showers do you enjoy observing the most?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zqlzm/were_a_team_of_nasa_meteor_experts_from_the/cfw21qc?context=5)|Perseids would be my favorite because they are in August so it is usually warm enough throughout the night to really enjoy being outside. Plus the rates are great (up to 100 if you are in a very dark place). The Geminids are also nice to observe but since they are in December it is a little less enjoyable to be outside at 3 am. :-) -RB.

[As a college student in aerospace engineering, I've been working towards working at NASA for a very long time. I did interview once but did not get the job. What could a student do to make him/her stand out?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zqlzm/were_a_team_of_nasa_meteor_experts_from_the/cfw1o32?context=5)|Get as much experience related to the area you want to study. Even if that is volunteering to work for a professor who does related research. Also NASA has a great internship program to get your foot in the door. nasajobs.nasa.gov.
[If humans eventually live on Mars, how would asteroids affect living on Mars? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zqlzm/were_a_team_of_nasa_meteor_experts_from_the/cfw2v9r?context=5)|Mars has a thinner atmosphere, so smaller asteroids can make it to the ground, which means the odds of a Martian colony being hit by one are greater than that of a similar size settlement on Earth.

[With more and more stuff getting launched every day into space is it getting harder or easier to track and model potential collisions with meteors?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zqlzm/were_a_team_of_nasa_meteor_experts_from_the/cfw173j?context=5)|If you're referring to asteroids, no, those encounters are rare. If you are referring to meteors, which are the small rocks, we can't pick them up until they hit the atmosphere and leave an ionization trail or the streak of light you call a ""shooting star."" So we can track asteroids and orbital debris, ""space junk,"" in space, but because meteors have a weak radar cross-section, they have to burn up in the atmosphere, before we can track them. B.C.
[What inspired you to go into a field of math &amp; science, and why specifically meteors?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zqlzm/were_a_team_of_nasa_meteor_experts_from_the/cfw13ju?context=5)|I grew up loving astronomy and decided to study what I was already passionate about. As for meteors specifically, I had a research opportunity after my 3rd year of undergrad to work with meteor radars, and I found I really enjoyed such an applied area of study. I like things that have very practical applications and studying meteors is a very interesting combination of science and engineering (we study meteors because of the danger they pose to spacecraft). I continued on with meteors after undergrad, doing MSc thesis in meteor physics. -RB (Rhiannon Blaauw)
 |I found physics challenging and thought math was a great puzzle so I knew that's what I wanted to do.  I also wanted my work to have applications, so engineering was a good fit too.  I kindof fell into meteors through various Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) opportunities while in school.  I really liked the fact that meteors were something I could see in our atmosphere -- much more tangible than other areas of astronomy. I'm also a trekkie/trekker at heart. (DM)

It's expected to peak on May 24, 2014 with a rate of 200 meteors per hour (possibly more).  But since it's a new shower, never seen before, all of this is very uncertain. (DM)
[How large does a meteor have to be to do any significant damage were it to hit the earth?  Is there a minimum size or is it more about speed?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zqlzm/were_a_team_of_nasa_meteor_experts_from_the/cfw1f6y?context=5)|It depends on what you mean by 'significant damage'. The Earth's atmosphere breaks up most meteors smaller than a football field. Take Chelyabinsk, for example, it exploded before impacting the Earth. It was about the size of a 3 story building but and only pieces made it to the ground. Still, the explosion did damage - many windows broken and many people injured in Chelyabinsk. Thankfully no reported deaths. Something larger than a football field would likely impact the Earth and create even more destruction.
 |RB.
[Hi :\) I am interested in a formation of Lybian Desert glass, which is scattered all over the desert, and considered to be formed after the huge meteorite explosion, but there is no trace of the impact (no visible crater\). Do you have theories about what happened? And another question: what would really happen if a small black hole hits Earth (one of the theories related to Tunguska event\)? Thank you :\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zqlzm/were_a_team_of_nasa_meteor_experts_from_the/cfwc60a?context=5)|There are a lot of theories out there on Libyan desert glass, some more plausible than others.  I don't have any to add, sorry.
 |The generally agreed upon theory about Tunguska is that a small asteroid entered the atmosphere over Siberia in June 1908. The combination of heat and pressure it felt as it ablated or 'burned up' in the atmosphere caused the asteroid to catastrophically disrupt -- basically annihilating itself.  The explosion knocked over millions of trees. (DM)
[How are fireball sighting collected, is there a database or web-service that has this info?  And, when they are sighted does anyone investigate to search for any debris that may have survived entry?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zqlzm/were_a_team_of_nasa_meteor_experts_from_the/cfw26lp?context=5)|The American Meteor Society collects fireball reports from all over the world.  Making a report is pretty easy.  [Link to amsmeteors.org](http://amsmeteors.org) go to 'Fireballs' then 'Report a Fireball'.  They also have a searchable database.  I check it weekly as one way to stay aware of what's going on over our skies.  NASA also has a website where we post fireballs seen with the NASA All Sky Fireball Network at fireballs.ndc.nasa.gov -- it's got images, movies, and info about fireballs seen by our network of 12 cameras.  Meteorite hunters and others can use this information to investigate any possible meteorites.  Since our group is mainly interested in meteors and meteoroids, we rarely hunt for meteorites ourselves.  Last meteorite hunt we did was exciting, but I ended up breaking out in hives. ;-)  (DM)
[Thanks for all the Info.  Do you guys work with the NEO JPL Team as far as any data sets or collaboration?  Just curious.  Also, Awesome work.  Space rocks!

Its my childhood dream.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zqlzm/were_a_team_of_nasa_meteor_experts_from_the/cfw6evd?context=5)|A lot of our work invovles analyzing data from a desk in a conventional office.  But we also observe at our local observatory and control observatories remotely.  Occasionally we will deploy teams to collect meteor data with special cameras/equipment, e.g. for the Genesis spacecraft re-entry and the May Camelopardalids.  A few times I've gotten to do some hands on work in the lab, inspecting returned spacecraft surfaces from Hubble and the Space Shuttle.  (Waaay cool btw!)
 |Regarding citizen science, check out the Meteor Counter app for recording meteors during meteor showers.  Also you can look into observing the moon for lunar impacts to support LADEE.

Some people are better at theoretical work, some people better at application, some people better at hands-on, some people better at detail-work, some at being able to grasp the big-picture. I know this is a very politically-correct answer, but I honestly feel it is true. I think our team (the MEO) has a really good combination of people right now. Makes for a great working environment.

However, a lot of good work - measuring asteroid light curves, looking for novae (exploding stars) and comets, and so forth - is done by amateurs who don't know a lot of math.

I'm not a US national and I need to take the internship so they can sign off on my visa papers but I'd like to try negotiate the salary with them. It seems to me that the average salary for a software engineering intern is about ~$50,000 (indeed.com) but I'm not sure if there's a distinction between a 'software engineer' and a 'data engineer'. I'll be using Java and MongoDB etc and there's a quite a lot of programming involved. I also have a year's work experience back in my home country so I'm not 'fresh out of college'.

1zr713,7,2014-03-06,"Trapped, Depressed and Alone. Dealing with N-mom is emotionally unbearable.. [Vent]",throwmomaway1,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1zr713/trapped_depressed_and_alone_dealing_with_nmom_is/,"Sorry in advance for the wall of text.

I’m F/24yo living at home still, commuter full-time student, working part-time and doing a lot of required internships and volunteer gigs for my classes. I get home late most nights and leave me super exhausted and drained. It’s all really demanding and takes its toll on me. I’m also in therapy for PTSD and depression which is endlessly affecting me and makes it difficult at times to do my work.  Folks pay for school, books, public transport, therapy and food (when I’m not able to afford my own some weeks). N-mom uses this as a weapon of guilt against me. She’s always complaining about money and how expensive it is to keep me afloat and how I should be thankful that she’s making all of these sacrifices. (it’s not a sacrifice, we have money - she just hoards her money and is VERY cheap).  My dad pays for most of my schooling but since he doesn’t speak up about his contributions, N-mom takes ALL the credit and uses it against me and guilts me into doing things I “should be doing”.

I really am grateful that they pay this for me, but I feel that my family uses this against me and to keep me tethered to the family and keep me from leaving. Feeling indebted to them and also because they guilt trip me into feeling that I HAVE to do these things because they’re being “generous” when they “don’t have to be” -I cook my own food, clean house as much as possible, pick up groceries for the house, manage N-mom money and pay bills with them.  This is never enough.
Some weeks I’m so busy I can’t do it, and I get endless shit for being “lazy”.

I come from a very religious, strict, traditional Hispanic family - which is a bad thing for me because I'm a female and the youngest and traditional Hispanics are pretty damn sexist. I have older brothers who are N-moms GC and get treated completely different than I do (which is something we always fight about because they don’t see it). Since I’m the youngest and the only girl, I don’t get taken seriously. AT ALL. If I ever share my plans or something I’m excited about, I just get spoken down to like I’m some type of adorable puppy attempting tricks that I will never be able to achieve.  Since I prefer not to get spoken down to about my life plans, I keep these things to myself since obviously no one cares.
My N-mom is a nightmare and so is my family because they go along with whatever she says. Everyone bends to her will, especially my dad and brothers. If we have a fight (which is often) and I try to defend myself to my brother, he will automatically think I’m being difficult, overreacting or just downright disrespectful. Of course he won’t side with me, he’s the GC.  I'm the only one who will try and stand my ground, call her bullshit if she starts something with me for no reason (I think she's bipolar). I’m always made seem as the villain in every fight, it’s always my fault and I’m apparently always doing something wrong. According to my family, there’s 1000+ things wrong with me and I should be ashamed of it and try fix them. N-mom is infallible. There’s quite a lot of guilt tripping going on in my family. N-mom will say things like “if only someone could go pick up milk from the store, I wish I could make something with it.”… instead of plainly asking me if I could get something for her. If I don’t catch on immediately to her needs, she starts attacking me saying that I’m “lazy”, “selfish” and I don’t do anything all day and the least I can do is do things for her because she slaves at work every day  etc etc etc. This type of guilting will go on until she gets what she wants. Sometimes after arguments she'll start crying and put on a whole show about how she's trying to best to have a relationship with me but all I do is shut her down and be ""rude"" to her. Complete and utter lie which everyone buys into.

N-mom is always guilting me for one thing or another and I haven’t quite learned how to tune it out. It makes me incredibly angry that I let her play with words frustrate me so much. I cry my head off sometimes because she makes me feel like I’m such a horrible and worthless person. I literally feel like I’m good for nothing and I have nothing going for me that would help me feel any better.

I have a midnight curfew, N-mom is always up my ass about what I’m doing and where I’m going. Most people my age are still out by midnight, and since it was such an issue to go out most nights and my parents are always crawling up my ass about where I am and when I’m going to be home. I had enough on my plate and couldn’t handle all of the drama and arguments associated with going out, so I stopped going out all together. The only time I’m ever allowed out super late is if I’m with my brother and his friends which I’d rather not do. Being home all the time has made my mother so much happier, but me much more miserable. I’ve never felt this alone in my life. It’s like N-mom wants to completely isolate me from everything and everyone that can possibly keep me away from her.  
Over the holidays we had a huge argument because she was trying to give me a bed time and I wasn’t having it. So all hell broke loose. The GC brother of course took her side. Afterwards, N-mom even told my boyfriend that he’s “better off” not being with me because he shouldn’t be with someone who is “nasty with their mother” and should be with someone “not like her”. 

I have my own room but I “don’t have the right” to lock the door when I’m in here because I don’t pay rent. So I’m stuck in a house with no respect, no privacy. I’m treated like a burden, really. N-mom thinks I only want to lock my door to avoid talking with her (which is partially true, but c’mon, I need alone time too.) She wants the door unlocked at all times so she can barge in (without knocking) question me about what I’m doing, try look at my computer monitor etc etc.

I have all of these plans and ideas about how finally I’m going to get away from these people and go NC. I fantasize about the day where I can give them all the finger on my way out the door and never see them again. As amazing as the escape plan sounds, it terrifies me. I don’t know how to budget, pay taxes, or the process to get an apartment. These things were always done without my involvement and I never learned how to do any of these things. Thanks to the internet, I just recently started to learn how to budget my finances. The only things I ever needed to learn in my N-mom’s eyes were to cook and clean so that I could be a good wife someday.  

On top of all the things she puts me through today, I resent her for how she secluded and abused me as a child. I was raised in a very religious household where I couldn’t even have friends who weren’t from the same religion. Since I went to public schools, I practically had no friends. Couldn’t go to school events, couldn’t go to sleepovers (I had my first slumber party at 18). All I did were church activities with church people 7 days a week. I resent her for easily losing her temper with me even though I had delayed speech. I would get frustrated and cry because I couldn’t communicate properly, yet she would hit me and yell at me with no remorse because I couldn’t communicate my needs.  I think back to my childhood and all I see is an angry, temperamental woman who wanted control over all things. I don’t love her, I don’t feel any connection to her except how she makes me feel guilty and feel like a piece of shit.

Even though she did all those things, everyone praises her as being this sweet and loving mother, especially my GC brothers. And I’m left seeming like this crazy and difficult bitch of a person who just doesn’t recognize how “wonderful” my mother is to me for giving me everything. I’m always the bad guy. I’m sick of it, I don’t know what to do. I don’t know how much more I can take.
I’m supposed to graduate in 2 months, and I’m already desperately looking for a way out. I want to move to another state and go NC. I don’t know how or if I even can. 
 I’m pretty much a burden to everyone in my family and am expected to be grateful that they even let me stay here. I can’t stand feeling like this worthless piece of shit who can’t do things for myself. 

I NEED to escape before I lose my mind. I’ve never felt so depressed, worthless, alone and miserable in my entire life. 
I just don’t know where to start.

Thnx for reading this.

TL;DR: N-mom calls shots in the family, everyone backs her up and make me out to be the villain. Dealing with constant guilt-tripping and emotional distress due her being controlling."
1zr9fe,1,2014-03-06,Job/Career advice (currently in mental health),[deleted],Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1zr9fe/jobcareer_advice_currently_in_mental_health/,"Hello Reddit! As the title indicated, I'm looking for some advice regarding my career. I'm trying to formulate a backup plan if the PhD route doesn't work out. Thoughts, opinions, and advice are all welcome. I'll start out with my current situation.

I graduated last May with a master's degree in Mental Health Counseling. I specialize in suicide prevention and crisis intervention but chose to have a wide variety of clinical experiences in school to make sure I'm fully qualified to handle anything a client may throw my way. In my state (FL) I am granted a sort of provisional license after graduation to be considered a Registered Mental Health Counseling Intern (RMHCI for short). With this, after two years and 2,000 hours of experience working under a qualified supervisor (and a few other minor requirements) I can then become licensed. This has the two notable distinctions of being able to work independently as well as perform a Baker Act. The Baker Act allows for involuntary confinement of a person for up to 72 hours in a mental hospital for observation and treatment if they are considered a threat to themselves/others due to mental illness. This is very important to be able to do if I'm working with potentially suicidal clients. I've performed plenty of lethality assessments before and been consulted with by licensed coworkers regarding a Baker Act but I cannot perform one myself.

After graduating and eventually obtaining a job, the realities of real life set in and I realized I'm not particularly happy making $30,000/year with a Master's degree. This is compounded by the fact that I can't obtain most jobs in the state as I am an RMHCI and not fully licensed; I get access to the jobs no one else wants or will take (for example, my last job essentially had me babysitting adults with developmental disorders and filing medicare claims). Looking at my options, I decided the best solution would be to pursue a PhD in Counseling Psychology. Due to the timing of this decision, the deadlines for programs, the travel requirements, and my work's inability to accommodate this I had to resign. I am fortunate in that I have a place to stay while going through the application process. I've used most of the money I saved from my job to apply to different colleges and make the interview trips. After putting in ten applications, I received four interviews. I have been put on a wait list at three of them and was rejected by the fourth. One of the universities made a point of telling me I was high on their wait list, so I may still get in. I will find out in late April or early May. I do not think I am high enough on the wait list for the other two schools to reasonably expect admission. If I get accepted, this post becomes pointless. I stand a very real chance of not getting accepted at this point though, and this is where my quandary lies.

What should I do if I don't get accepted into any PhD programs? I like the mental health field but most of the jobs I want demand a PhD to be considered for employment, and even then the master's level jobs with plenty of experience seem to top out at $50,000/yr, maybe $60,000. My current plan is to up and move to a college town with research in the field I can participate in; relative lack of research experience is the biggest weakness on my CV. I would need to do this in May and then be ready to submit applications by December for admission the following fall. On the plus side, the closest town to do this in has a professor I've been in touch with as I applied and interviewed with him there; he may be willing to let me work with his research projects which I'm guessing would help my chances if I apply there again the next year (assuming I do the research competently, of course). I'm very much open to switching careers and moving elsewhere, even to a foreign country, if it provides me with a secure job with a good paycheck. I'd like to reliably earn $60,000+ a year but to my knowledge I don't currently have the skillset to command that salary. I'm open to learning new things; I tend to excel with math and other logic-based tasks but haven't gone much past Calc 1 in school.

I have plenty of freedom at the moment as I'm relatively young at 25 and I don't have a wife or kids tying me down. I'm fine moving and I'm fine picking up a new trade or skillset. My limitations are that I've currently got $1,500 to work with for the move, a $35,000 debt that will need to eventually be paid off (no immediate repayment required though), and no immediately obvious means for funding additional schooling or other means of learning a trade. I'm also not the greatest at networking. Given all of this, what are you thoughts?"

It was undoubtedly the best course experience I've had.  I pose the question of how to keep the ""CS50 spirit"" of having fun within the field of computer science and software engineering. As I advance to the higher level courses at my school and internships alike, I encounter people (sometimes the majority of classmates or even the teacher) who really don't care about making the material compelling.  Does anyone have some good ideas on how I could help bring the CS50 spirit of having fun and doing really compelling things, or at least keep it alive in myself?"
1zrhf5,40,2014-03-06,"Debilitating anxiety, can't even apply for jobs anymore",[deleted],socialanxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/1zrhf5/debilitating_anxiety_cant_even_apply_for_jobs/,"Sorry for the lengthy post, I realize that begin overly verbose is another area I need to work on. I don't have anybody to talk to about this stuff, so it all comes pouring out when I finally do open the tap. I also think this is a combination of depression and anxiety, so I wasn't sure exactly where to post this.

I have always had a touch of social anxiety, not ever being comfortable in large groups and always being starkly aware of every action I take while around other people. My anxiety seemed to multiply in college. I think it's due to some misconception I had as a child that once you become an adult, things start to make sense and you sort of just mature all at once. I remember being almost panic attack-inducingly nervous for an oral report in 10th grade, and thinking ""I'll just learn how to talk in front of people when I become an adult. All adults do it, so I'll just be able to deal with it, plain and simple."" Here I am, 26 years old, and I still feel like the exact same person that I was when I graduated high school. Maybe even a bit less mature now, after years of relative isolation.

I've been graduated for a few years, and it has gotten to the point where I dread even applying for jobs now. I always mess up interviews, or don't know how to ""brag"" about myself on resumes. I have zero experience, and never had internships in college. I don't even want to send out resumes due to the lack of responses I've gotten, and every ""resume expert"" I've talked to has given me wildly different advice, all to no avail.

Now I've been jobless for years (minus a summer job at a camp run through my old university), living under my parent's financial umbrella, and my anxiety is becoming heavily twinged with depression. I seriously think if I found a job and started busying myself, I would improve vastly. However, I haven't even sent out a resume in weeks now because I don't particularly want any of these jobs (as in, I don't know what to say in cover letters/interviews under ""why do you want to work here?""), and the lack of responses I get from places where I do apply is becoming more and more depressing and scary. I can't do anything sales related since I've never been good at selling anything to anybody, and the jobs in my fields (physics undergrad, finance grad degree) all require internships to get even basic jobs. I basically don't qualify for anything that requires the degrees I have, and I lack any real world experience to get more retail/customer service/etc jobs.

Right now I want to find any job just to get some financial independence, improve my self-image, and also because my parents are going to make me move back home in a couple months if I can't find anything. The deadline, the lack of finding jobs in the past, and my natural anxiety are all mixing together into one hell of a crazy cocktail. I find myself spending hours online to escape from my lack of a real life and prevent myself from thinking about how my entire post-college adult life has all been one big useless blur of hiding from the world. Then at night, I spend hours tossing and turning as I can't stop thinking about all the issue that I put off throughout the day.

I'm embarrassed about my situation, which I know for sure is 100% my fault, because I have had everything in life handed to me and I am absolutely terrified that I can't do anything on my own. My attitude of ""why bother applying for jobs if I won't get them?"" is enough proof of my silver spoon attitude. I want to change and be a better person, but I keep falling back on these self-pitying ways."

So I'm restructuring my resume since I've found an internship that I think I'll like and I'm sort of stuck. I'm trying to work out how I should list the software and computer skills that I have. 

The position is a marketing/communications internship for a software company and they have a list of software that would be useful to know.

My problem is that as a tech oriented person I have a wide breadth of experience with a lot of different software but a lot of it doesn't have very much depth to it. For instance it'd be nice to be able to communicate that I can function well in Office programs or Adobe CS6 programs but I'm not necessarily a wizard with them. How do I best communicate that? 

I thought I'd do a Proficient vs Familiar titling for the different software but I end up with two issues. My familiar list is much larger than the proficient one and most of the ones they named as important would be on the familiar list rather than proficient. 

Thanks for any help. "
1zrmo0,11,2014-03-06,I had to drop out (CS major) and now I'm working on setting up a plan to enter the field ASAP through alternate means. Seeking any advice and guidance.,obviouslyCPTobvious,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1zrmo0/i_had_to_drop_out_cs_major_and_now_im_working_on/,"**My current position:** Long story short, I had to drop out due to financial problems. At the moment I'm just looking for something to pay the bills, I'll probably have to go back to my old factory job. The only CS classes I've finished that I have credit for are Intro and Intermediate C++. I don't have any projects completed to put on a portfolio. I'm familiar with python and C++.

**Short Term Goals:** Simply, I want to make money sitting in front of a computer learning and solving problems. I would prefer a software development job, but at this point anything is better than working in a factory. 

**Long Term Goals:** I want to be in a position where my job is secondary to my life. I would love to be able make a living while traveling or working part time. I want to enjoy my profession, but I want to focus on enjoying life more, if that makes any sense.

**My loose plan of action:** First, find any job to pay the bills right now. Second, build a portfolio of projects that I enjoy. Third, do something that will get me a job.

**Options:** I've consider programming bootcamps. I would have to save up money working in a job I hate until I have enough to pay for a bootcamp and hope that it leads to a job. I've thought about waiting until I have a portfolio I'm happy with and then starting a job hunt. Since I'm not a student anymore, I'm not sure if an internship is a viable option. **I'm willing to relocate almost anywhere.** as long as I make enough money to survive in the area.  I'm currently near Chicago.

**Questions:**

* Has anybody been down a similar path and what did you do?
* Which CS jobs have the lowest barrier to entry? Jr. software dev? DBA? QA?
* Are there any places where it easier for somebody at my level to enter the field?

**tl:dr:** Want to become employable ASAP. Currently have very minimal demonstrable experience. Willing to do the bitch work. Will move just about anywhere. What goals can I set for myself that will lead to a programming related job in a quick manor?"
1zrqvq,0,2014-03-06,"worst phone interview experience with a startup that doesn't even pay, so heated right now (warning: wall of text)",[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1zrqvq/worst_phone_interview_experience_with_a_startup/,"Basically I applied to a job on craigslist that is unpaid but for a startup and I would get a chance to do android development(remotely) and be 'mentored'. First off no one would apply for this job if they were not open to learning from a startup and wearing different hats, its the reason people might apply to start ups.

She talks and tells me about the company and basically before I even talk about myself she goes from telling me about the company to telling me why I am not a good fit  ....'you definitely are not passionate about our company because you did not research it. I said I did I checked facebook/twitter/website/app and did a brief search on what it does and how its publicized but was leaving it up to the interview to learn more about it and hear from an employee the ins and outs. 

She says every one who calls us and asks us a bunch of questions so I know they are passionate, and I was like ok well can I ask questions then?(keep in mind every time I tried to talk before this she cut me off and I let her) So finally I can talk...What would I be contributing to ? why do you need me? what does the team look like? how does the mentorship work? how many developers? etc etc.... oh you don't know? its confidential? we work remotely and its not required for the team to meet except 2 times a month????how is that mentoring going to work...well it works because you meet twice a month(her answer)

Basically she got fed up that I didn't know enough about the company even though I applied 1 night before and said I thought the phone interview was for you to tell me more about it, and she said yes well you should do more research if your passionate and open to new things. Fair enough. But telling me I am not passionate and not open to trying things because I did not ask any questions, when I TRIED to she cut me off explaining why I am not a fit, then said that because I tried to cut her off I was the worst experience she had and she NEVER had any problems before(prob because no one else applies) and I am rude and sarcastic?!?! I could of swore she was describing herself. In fact I said I am not giving attitude until you cut me off and she said I can say the same for you, you need to work on your social skills (basically, again just taking the insults left and right and the most bitchy tone I don't even want to describe). When I do ask questions she couldn't give a solid answer for anything, I still did not know what I was going to be doing because its confidential and I can't find out until I am hired. 

She was really mad that I left one question unanswered prior to the call in an email, and I said I left it blank because I did not understand it fully and wanted to ask you about it. At this point she was FURIOUS saying then WRITE IN THE EMAIL YOU DON'T KNOW.

I said I was going to ask you on the phone. She said if you don't understand that simple question then I am worried about you being qualified(still talking down to me with a tone and literally laughing that I asked that question, she said this after saying you need to ask me questions so I know your excited and willing to wait to be put on the tech team).

 After a nice intro she began to insult me every chance she got and I just listened and when I tried to speak she cut me off and said ' I never had to deal with someone like you you keep cutting me off and giving me attitude(I did not until she talked down on me about not asking questions which I did and she had no answers)... and also about me not being passionate enough which again I applied for an UNPAID role offering FULLTIME

keep in mind I barley talked she just assumed all this about me from a brief email which I explained my background and experience.

this is the question I left blank and she basically decided I wasn't fit for the job before 'If your current tech skills do not match the fundamental requirements for the tech team, are you willing to function in a tech liaison capacity with the marketing team, while you improve and strengthen your tech skills?   '

I wanted to ask what exactly this means(would I improve tech skills on my own time? or by a mentor, this is important to me). Because I left it blank, which I probably shouldn't have, she was implying I meant I am not open to trying new things, but I kept saying what is this phone interview if I can't ask questions about the job or the email and she said you should be better prepared before the interview..again fair but every phone interview I EVER had the caller talks for an hour explaining things, and asking If I have any questions no matter how dumb. I thought this was how its supposed to be. 

..Seriously applying to an unpaid internship is bad enough but then getting talked down on because I didn't answer a question in the email but every question I asked had no real answer..She said I don't ask questions over 100 times and every time I asked a question it was either a 'dumb question' or she had no answer. I am pissed at this because I asked so many questions and all the questions I had were valid but she scoffs at me saying ask prepare better and ask better questions(literally said ask better questions wtf) and we can talk again next week(ya right)

has anyone had a bad interview? I have never ever ever gave attitude or fought with someone verbally that I do not know, so I can't believe it came to this but this bitch brought the worst out of me and I am upset that she let me

1zsey6,20,2014-03-07,A vet redditor randomly asked me for post-separation advice; thought I'd share my drunken response,SoberIRL,Military,https://www.reddit.com/r/Military/comments/1zsey6/a_vet_redditor_randomly_asked_me_for/,"Well, I'm 3 whiskey cokes and half a bottle of wine in. Here's how I'm doing six months after separating:

I'm doing pretty well. I'm going to the University of Houston on the GI Bill, doing lots of freelance photo and video work, and getting pretty fat. My wife, who struggled to find work in Japan with her master's degree, has found a good job and is making more money by herself than we ever made combined.

Reintegrating into the civilian world is a mixed bag. I find I am much more able to stand out amongst my lower-performing colleagues, which is a big shift in the right direction. Too often was I enraged by NCO's who didn't know shit continuing to get paid more than me while I kicked ass at the job. Civilian idiocy and complaining abounds, but you get used to it and cut them some slack. I'm most annoyed by the ROTC guys at school. They think they're ready to run the military at 19 years old.

I don't know what your job was, or how you've prepared yourself for the outside. Hopefully you elected to take the GI Bill (for god's sake, take the post 9/11; anyone who tells you to consider the Montgomery is a moron), and hopefully you've at least done some thinking about what you'll do after the military.

*Time for a shot of whiskey. Tonight, I'm having Michael Collins, a delightful Irish blended malt. It's similar to Jameson's, but less sweet, and with a bit more earthiness and bite. I prefer blends over single-malts, though purists may scoff. I also greatly prefer Irish whiskey to Scotch whisky (the spelling is important), and I prefer American whiskey to Canadian. I don't know if this is indicative of the quality of my palette.*

Go to school, get involved with student and professional organizations. I was a videographer for the Air Force, and now I'm majoring in Digital Media. I became a photographer for the university newspaper, so I could shore up my photography portfolio to stand alongside my already-strong video reel. I'm working with the Student Video Network on campus to conduct some training courses. All of this leads to more contacts and more networking, which will eventually lead to jobs.

Try to look at school as a clean slate, a chance to completely reinvent your life. If you don't have a huge amount of savings, the post 9/11 GI Bill probably won't be enough for you to live on while you get your degree. Get a part-time job doing whatever, but then see if you can roll your school contacts into something relevant to what you want to do. There are tons of paid internships, fellowship programs, etc. available. I'm constantly amazed at how much money people have to spend in the civilian world - the income gap between an O-6 and an E-2 is nothing compared to what you'll find on the outside. Some of these people shit themselves at the opportunity to 'invest' in a veteran by employing them.

Leverage your veteran status. You may feel like a chump, especially if you didn't do OIF/OEF, get a CAB, or whatever. Civilians don't know the difference, and veterans mostly don't care. Fuck anyone who says you shouldn't take advantage of it; you took the oath, and there are soft and hard benefits to be gained. I didn't take unemployment when I got out, but I damn sure ask everyone from the barber to the guitar salesman if they offer veteran's discounts. I'm in Texas - these people love to send us to war, they can love giving us discounts on haircuts and Stratocasters.

*More whiskey. I'm drinking straight out of the bottle, because my wife has already gone to bed, and I'm now free to indulge in whatever heathen manner I choose. I'm chasing with a California blended red. I'm not a big wine drinker, but I only have one bottle of beer in the fridge, and it's an absolutely amazing Petrus Winter Ale that I'm saving for next weekend. This rare seasonal comes in a large red bottle, and I can't recommend it highly enough for enthusiasts of belgian saison/abbey style ales. Reminiscent of Gulden Draak, without the pricetag - get it if you ever see it.*

If you did the pre-separation stuff, hopefully you paid attention to the resume and interview portions, because they're not bad. /r/jobs and related subreddits have some fantastic advice as well. There are tons of job recruiters who work specifically for veterans and their spouses; my wife got some good temp work through these folks.

Abit of a long read but well worth it!

Hi Yourscene  Team:

We are you sending this notice because we’ve observed that your Insta Print box product and service violates Instagram’s Brand Guidelines and trademark rights. As you may know, last year we updated our Brand Guidelines to provide more detailed information about how developers can communicate their relationship with Instagram and how to correctly use our brand assets.
 
We appreciate your interest in developing the Insta Print box, and helping people print their Instagram photos onto keepsakes. While we encourage developers to build great products that use Instagram, we cannot allow them to look or sound like they might be official Instagram products or endorsed or sponsored by us.
 
As we hope you can appreciate, protection of its well-known trademarks is very important to Instagram. For example, using a name that looks or sounds like “Instagram” and/or logos that look like our logos may be confusing to people, or may make it harder for them to distinguish between different websites or products. Similarly, use of “INSTA” and “GRAM” for a service that works with Instagram is harmful to the Instagram brand. It is important that you develop your own distinctive branding for your service, and use Instagram’s trademarks only as specifically authorized under our policies.
 
Here are the things we’ve noticed:
Your product name is too similar to the INSTAGRAM trademark. You may not use “INSTA” or “GRAM” in the name of a service that works with Instagram.
Your product’s trade dress mimics the Instagram camera logo, and uses a stylized script very similar to that used by Instagram.
To help you understand how you may communicate your relationship to Instagram, and make correct use of the Instagram brand, we have launched updated brand guidelines with more detailed information. Please review them carefully: http://help.instagram.com/304689166306603/. Instagram's API Terms of Use (http://instagram.com/about/legal/terms/api/#Compliance) require compliance with the brand guidelines.
 
We can work with you to determine a reasonable timeframe during which you transition to a revised brand. Just respond to this email within 48 hours with your proposed changes or any questions you have regarding these guidelines.
 
Lastly, we have taken notice of your trademark application to register INSTA PRINT. We cannot allow the application to register, as that would be harmful to Instagram’s well-known trademarks. Please confirm that you will immediately and expressly abandon all applications for any mark you have filed containing the terms “INSTA” or “GRAM,” or containing any logos similar to Instagram’s logos. Note that our lawyers may need to initiate an action to oppose the application in order to preserve our rights, pending a satisfactory resolution of this matter. For now, they will be filing what is called a notice of intent to oppose the application, which will give us an extra 30 days to try and reach an amicable resolution.

We know it's hard to receive these kinds of messages, and we appreciate your effort to fix these issues and keep the experience great for everyone. For more information on what's allowed and not, visit the link above. If you have any specific questions about our policies, please respond to this message and we'll do our best to help.

Thanks,

The Instagram Team



Sup Instagram Team?
 
How's it going?
 
Please note: This email is expressed without prejudice.
 
To address your concerns:
 
We think the word “INSTA” is quite a generic word meaning “instantaneous” or ""instant"" and believe there shouldn't be a problem with it. Likewise, the word “GRAM” is a very generic word l had long used before “Instagram” came in to existence. It is also utilised here in Australia where we run on the Metric system to describe a measurement of weight. For example, 1,000 milligrams equals to 1 gram and 1,000 grams equals to 1 kilogram. 
 
According to reliable historical documents found on Wikipedia, Instagram was founded in 2010. Compare this to an entry found on Urban Dictionary dot com when you search for the word ""Insta"", it's definition was created in 2007.
 
The definition thus states: ""Insta - A prefix usually preceding a verb emphasizing and often exaggerating the haste of something, especially a performed task. "" - www.urbandictionary.com

We believe that this definately and definitively demonstrates that Instagram did not coin the word ""Insta"" and therefore  do not own the rights to this word as it is a common expression used by the masses.
 
 To hold ownership of everyday words used in the English language is absurd (even to non-lawyers such as our selves). If we were to open up a tool shop and call ourselves Tool Town, we could not claim ownership of the words ""Tool"" or ""Town"". Meaning if someone wanted to start a business and call themselves Tool World, we doubt our complaints would have any legal standing.
 
We think that the name “Insta-Print” will not harm Instagram in anyway because we are in the business of providing a service that prints “Instagram” photos that are posted in the public domain. If anything, we are freely promoting the use of your application.
 
Since conception, we have actually voiced our opinion of how good a service Instagram offers and many of our customers have since downloaded and utilize your application for their own use. Maybe we could possibly discuss a revenue compensation plan for marketing your product?
 
Regarding your complaint to us, we have consulted our team of 561 and a half lawyers (one of them is an intern. We had a meeting to discuss his validity in the team and concluded that he makes a mean cup of coffee) and do not believe you have a strong case but we are happy to work with you to try to resolve this matter as we don't wish to waste yours or more importantly our time.
 
Some questions: 
 
b) Will it help if we mention and made it clear that our services are not affiliated with Instagram as a company?
 
c) In terms of the logo, we can change the colour layout (possibly pastel colours) and rearrange the colours are laid out (do you have any suggestions for us). After all, this is a representation of a rainbow, can you trade mark the colours of the rainbow?
 
Fun facts about rainbows: We have a celebration here each year to help celebrate and create recognition for the Gay and Lesbian community where homosexual people parade in the streets of Sydney. It’s a pretty fun and outrageous party, you guys should definitely come down under and check it out. We’ll even shout you a beer or two. J
 
This one time (not at band camp), the LGBT community decided to re-paint a zebra crossing located at the end of Oxford St (famous for its dazzling queens and uplifting vibe). Then ‘the man’ decided that it wasn’t appropriate (boo!) and washed it away. But later on, they got it approved again. Good on them!
 
Also, have you guys seen that YouTube video of the guy that recorded the double rainbows in the sky? How funny was that? We think he was high on something, what do you think?

d) What are your thoughts on a commission structure where YourScene promotes the usage of Instagram to our customers and we get say, $50 on each customer we bring to you? Fair?
 
 5) We are happy to change the font on all our products:
 
·  ""Your product’s trade dress mimics the Instagram camera logo, and uses a stylized script very similar to that used by Instagram.""

       5.1. Can you please define the term “trade dress”? Is this in relation to the rainbow colours and layout or the actual design and shape of our product?
 
Our team of 561 and a half lawyers aren’t too sure about this one and asked the intern to ask us to ask you what it pertained to.

Their intern seems to think that no one has the right to tell us how to dress. He told us a story of when he was sixteen and a half, he was moved into a town in the outback of Australia. A very Christian town you see, and they were pretty strict in some of their rules, especially when it came to the youth of the township.
 
It all started when a group of drunk teens were driving home and unfortunately they got into a car accident. All of them passed away sadly. One of the teenagers was the son of a Pastor in the town.
 
He vowed to from then on change the laws in the town, restricting the townships teenagers from alcohol, enforcing a new curfew AND to add insult to injury, they were no longer permitted to dance.
 
Needless to say, our intern was a seditious one (what lawyer isn’t, right?). His desire to impress a girl he liked (who was also the daughter of the Pastor! WHAT?! CRAZY!) and his love for interpretive dance caused him to rebel.
 
In the end, the Pastor gave in, learning to let go of the past and focus on his life now and developing a stronger relationship with his family. He realised that he couldn't control the outcome of everything and that that was just life. He just had to come to terms with the fact that some things are just out of his control.
 
The kids in the high school celebrated on their Prom night and danced the night away to Kenny Loggins – Footloose.
 
We can only hope that YourScene and Instagram can come to a mutual understanding and one day, we may both also be able to cut loose and dance the night away... together. :)

With warm regards,

The (fairly decent looking) YourScene Team!"

1zss9a,7,2014-03-07,Taking summer school at another UC,McLovnn,UCSantaBarbara,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSantaBarbara/comments/1zss9a/taking_summer_school_at_another_uc/,"Sup guys! I have just discovered this subreddit and firstly I'd like to say I love reddit and I love ucsb so fuck yeah, that's awesome we have our own subreddit. Anyways, I went to talk to the counselor in the chem department today and she was unable to answer any of my questions. She just got the job this quarter and says she's adjusting and still trying to learn everything. Does anyone know if I can take major classes at UCI and have the credits transfer over to UCSB? I'm pre biochem (no biochem flair) and this summer I'm looking to take math 4B (differential equations), Chem 109C (organic chemistry), and Chem 6Bl (organic chemistry lab). I live right next to UCI and I got offered an internship to work in a lab there so I really want to be home for the summer instead of having to stay at UCSB for summer school. The chem counselor also said if I wanted to take courses at a CC and have the units transfer I'd have to take the entire series because the CCs in my area use a semester system as opposed to our quarter system. So it's kinda fucked if I have to retake ALL of ochem again just to get 109c credit but that's the system. So if anyone has experience with taking summer school at a different UC, help a fellow gaucho out. Thanks guys!"
1zssl4,1,2014-03-07,How do you Negotiate a Raise in Good Taste (with my personal life-altering story).,[deleted],workplace,https://www.reddit.com/r/workplace/comments/1zssl4/how_do_you_negotiate_a_raise_in_good_taste_with/,"**The Story**

Slightly over a year ago I started a job as a ""data-specialist intern"", which was essentially a euphemism for ""data-entry"". The job was intended to be strictly over the course of summer while I took a break from college so I could hold two jobs (the first being a fry-cook for a deli) to pay my way through my own education (Double-major of Computer Science and Mathematics).


The larger company I technically work for is worth many billions, our smaller branch, however, is not. This gives us a lot of flexibility (which I am deeply grateful for. I was tasked with a relatively monstrous project data-entry project that involved me verifying our in-house company data against thousands of changing online sources. This project had originally been passed-to and looked-over by our (much) larger and (much) coveted tech department. They deemed it impossible to automate.  Hundreds of thousands of entries to check against, only me on the team, and just three months to do get it done.


I worked a couple of days at trying to manually do the task, at the very least getting myself acquainted with the office and work-practices. When I felt comfortable enough, I proposed an alternate solution to my (original) boss, he told me if I could provide results quickly, he'd okay it. The alternate solution in question had me automating the task using Python. If possible, my boss would love the idea as it gave me time to pursue other projects. As a temp, I didn't feel right asking for a pay raise, and I figured it'd be a nicer experience than manual labor. (ew. :P).


I have been programming avidly for approximately a decade and a half, but completely non-professionally (only one of those years in college). I mention this because I need to say: The problem was non-trivial, and it required machine-learning and relatively well-founded heuristics. By the end of the month, I had wrought a data-mining god-program and it had already finished most of the work. My boss was ecstatic, and many of the projects that I was given afterwards followed the same design pattern as the first (job given, tried it manually, ended up automating it and sometimes even ended up helping other parts of the office in the process).


2 months and ~3 weeks into the job, I was near the end, getting ready to go back to school. Around this time I was slightly bummed that this would probably be the last chance in a good while I'd have at programming professionally. I mean I wouldn't even get as much as the chance to put ""programmer"" as a job-title on my resume. So you can probably imagine my excitement when in the middle of a standard-meeting that the following words were exchanged.


* Boss : ""Well, you know how we were talking about your end-date being in September?""
* Me: (slightly anxious): ""yeah.""
* Boss: ""Well, I want You, John (director of tech), and I to sit down and talk about future possibilities, and perhaps staying on permanently. If you would be interested, of course.""
* Me (with worlds weakest pokerface) : ""Why yes. I am interested, but I would love to discuss the details about it later""



I was so excited freaking excited that I almost cut the meeting short out of pure anxiousness. (I'm a tad awkward that way).


During the meetings that came up, I expressed that school was my #1 priority, and my now-manager (John), said he was happy to hear that, and he was willing to work around my school schedule. He offered me a job as a web-application developer, and I accepted. MUCH better pay (still below average for the title), a good team to work with, and something awesome to put on a resume. So I quit my job at the deli, and started to work immediately.


For the months that followed, I preformed well. I learned to respect my new boss deeply for someone who had both breadth and depth of knowledge, and I like to believe he thinks I'm a strong worker, so much so as to come to me specifically for problems that he thinks need to be done ""very intelligently and right the first time"". With that kind of mutual-respect I felt a weird mixture of happy and self-accomplished. (as well as having more coin in my normally college-vacated-pockets)


I was ecstatic except for one thing...


The way budgeting works at this company,is that there was no way for me to become an actual bonified permanent employee. So instead I settled for a 3-month contractual position. I very much dislike being contract-based. For plenty of reasons. Benefits are cut, I'm essentially pimped out by a completely unrelated second party, and I'm disposable at a whim no-questions-asked.



**The Problem**

Recently, I've been probing job-opportunities for the sake of knowing what is out there. There are definitely interested employers willing to hire me for a higher wage and better benefits, however none that are willing to work with me anywhere near the level that my current boss (whom again, I respect highly) is. However, I can't shake the feeling that a 3-month ""guarantee"" of employment is just not enough when some of my co-workers work on year-based contracts. It makes me anxious to know that at any point I could be canned for any number of reasons, not just limited to my performance.


I'm stuck at a point where I want to ask for a raise to mitigate/justify the risk, as well as payment for the services which I believe have gone well above and beyond the standard call-of-duty. I want to mention the fact that I've gotten job-offers for higher wages, but I don't want to try and be disrespectful or threatening, I just want to be able to justify that the raise I'm asking for is not, out-of-nowhere or unreasonable. I also want to be able to emphasize that I respect him without it sounding like I'm trying to butter him up (because it is genuine)


Does anyone have experience with any of this, or have any advice for my problem? Thank you so much.


TLDR; (read the second to last paragraph)."

1zszsi,20,2014-03-07,I found a job! Advice on moving to Europe from a non-European,elle_,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1zszsi/i_found_a_job_advice_on_moving_to_europe_from_a/,"Hi /r/jobs,

I've taken lots of advice from this sub and since I've just found a job (whoop!) I thought it was time to give some back.  I see a few posts asking about relocating to Europe so, as someone who's done it, here are my thoughts on the topic.


**My background:**

Mid 20s marketing professional from New Zealand.  I have a UK passport which means I did not require a visa/sponsorship to work in the EU (more on this later).  My background is in fast moving consumer goods.  I'd done a three-year graduate programme with a well-known multinational and one year at a Brand Manager level for the same company.


**My Advice:**

1. **Do your research.**  When I first came over I did some traveling and then settled in Berlin.  My boyfriend and I thought this would be a good idea because 1) he speaks German and 2) we both love the city.  I'd done research on Berlin before leaving home (expat community forums, /r/berlin) and the sentiment on working there was quite negative. I stubbornly refused to hear it and stuck it out there for four months with little traction outside of internship offers for €300 a month.

    When I realised that I wasn't getting anywhere I did some more research.  I made a list of English-friendly countries, a list of companies that I'd like to work for and created a spreadsheet of if/where they had offices in those English-friendly countries.  If only I'd done that earlier...Berlin had a grand total of 2/54 (although I think I still would have been stubborn and tried it).  This exercise lead to me relocating to Amsterdam.

2.  **Be prepared to compromise.** If you're looking to move to another country, chances are you're motivated by more than just career progression.  Don't get me wrong; career is important to me and I didn't want to take a job that would get me nowhere.  I just think that you have to be realistic in what you're looking for - getting a promotion (or even maintaining your current level) may not be possible if you have no local market experience or language skills.  In my case I'm taking a step down in title ('Manager' to 'Assistant Manager' level) but the learning opportunities are still huge.

3.  **Have your finances in order.** In the end it took me almost 7 months and 74 applications to secure this role I'm happy with.  Thanks to a lot of saving before I left home I've been able to support myself the entire time.  Yes, you canlook for other work to support yourself while you search (e.g. temp work, hospitality) but even those roles can be difficult to come by if you don't speak the language or have a network.  I'd recommend having at least three months worth of living costs in your bank account before leaving home.

4.  **Make it about more than just the job hunt.** As many of you in this sub know it's easy to fall into a slump when you're job hunting.  If you're moving away from home to do so make sure you're still doing things to experience your new hometown - take a language course, travel, learn something new.  This can be difficult to do on a tight budget but there are always ways (shout out to [MeetUp.com](http://www.meetup.com)).  Then if - *worst case scenario* - you don't find a job and have to go back home, you've still had an amazing experience and remember more than just the gloom of sending off endless applications.


As promised, **thoughts on work permits:**

Unless you have the right to work OR are an experienced professional in a field that's *truly* in demand where you're moving to (refer point #1), I wouldn't go.  The economic situation in most of Europe is still difficult and not having local experience/language skills already puts you on the back foot.  From what I've seen no companies have been willing to sponsor working visas.  Look into any reciprocal working holiday agreements your country may have as they'll provide you with a good way to start out ([this website](http://www.anyworkanywhere.com/visainfo.html) appears to have some good information despite using Comic Sans).


That was quite a ramble!  Apologies for the length, but if you're interested hopefully there's some helpful information in there for you.  Of course these are all just my own thoughts / experience.  If you have any questions I'm happy to answer :)


**TL;DR:** If you want to work in Europe do your research before leaving home, be prepared to compromise, get your funds in order and have fun while you're there.  If you don't have a work permit it's going to be extremely difficult.

1zt2bw,3,2014-03-07,Graduating B.S. Looking for Advice,knotoast,AskPhysics,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskPhysics/comments/1zt2bw/graduating_bs_looking_for_advice/,"I'm on my last year of university and was planning to take a year off (between ugrad and grad) to work at CERN again. Turns out the grant money fell through, but I haven't applied to any graduate schools yet, so I have been looking for jobs since ~February. I'm only planning to take a year off so finding decent job has been hard. I was wondering if you guys could point me in the right direction for where to look. 

I've found that I'm really interested in computer science and have been applying to a lot of jobs in that field, but my knowledge is much less than that of a CS major. (I am learning system design in a course now, but really only know basic algorithms/OO in C/C++).

Seeing as May is quickly approaching, I'm getting quite nervous about what I'm going to be doing for the summer/next year because I've only heard back from a few places, all of which have ended poorly. I've applied to at least 50 different jobs but am not sure if I'm looking in the right place.

My internship at CERN was mostly luck and my GPA is ~3.5 overall and ~3.7 in Physics (dem language classes). I've had internships at my university since sophomore year, but my current one is a dead end. Has anyone here been in a similar situation who could help me out? I'm pretty stressed about it and didn't think that finding a job would be this difficult.

TLDR; What do I do for my year off starting this May?

1zt4hj,20,2014-03-07,"My SO and I just ended our relationship based on timing, and my world is shattered.",[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1zt4hj/my_so_and_i_just_ended_our_relationship_based_on/,"My SO and I had been together for over 3 years, she's my best friend and we had many plans together. I was in Grad school and recently graduated with my Master's degree. It was easier for us then as we were a new couple and lived in the same town so we saw each other often. It was always her dream to get hers as well, and we both knew she would be going to school at one point. We each had our own personal issues that would get in the way of things that we dealt with, but would still get in the way of things. Basically she had difficulty expressing herself- but all of the feelings were there. And I had an insecurity myself, needing reassurance. Both were due to past traumas in life. We supported and loved each other, things improved immensely.

Flashforward- she has sinced moved 300 miles away to grad school (we are both 25) and we've been long distance. Things were great- visiting, skype, sending packages. As she started to get busier, she started to get more stressed and so did I. Our insecurities started to pop up again, slowly and more controlled but they were there. It was hard for me to understand at times, the ambiguity of her expression and she doesn't need as much support as I do. So things were great for her albeit the stress of school. For me, I felt the increasing distance (it wasn't so much, but I was aware of it). After 3 years, I finally finished school, and I felt like I was ready for the next step. She was not, understandably. And she needed the time to finish school, and focus on her education. She wasn't sure if she wanted a family, and couldn't decide if or when the time would be right. I knew I wanted a family and I didn't want to be older when I had one. But in no way am I ready for a family yet and won't be for a few years, which I feel like we shared that in common even if i was more certain than her.

I digress. We both did not want to break up. We both want to remain together and work our way through it. I pushed at times, for her to think about the future and she expressed she did not have the capacity at this moment, to think about that. I understood. My SO started to feel guilty that I knew I wanted more and she wasn't sure. She knew she wanted to get married to me but not yet, and she wasn't sure if she wanted a family which she knew I very much want. She thinks she will want one, but not for another 10 years or so and isn't comfortable with me waiting. The stress of the distance, and the amount of time we had together, and the timing of what each of us wants led to some stressful conversations... we decided to end the romantic part of our relationship and try to remain close before the relationship makes us hate each other and have regrets. 

I can't help but feel like that wasn't the right move. I don't wan't kids just yet and I didn't have a set plan, and we both want to travel before settling down. We share a similar life plan, we love each other, but she is afraid that I am sacrificing too much for her. I have my needs, I admit we didn't exactly line up perfectly but honestly, does anyone? (No really, do they? i don't know if that's how its ""supposed to be""). I understand she needs the time for school and maybe the relationship is too distracting and too much pressure for her. She also doesn't want to feel like i am ""waiting"" for her while I am fully capable of having a more involved LDR and she is too busy to do so with grad school and an internship. 

I am torn. I love this girl. I loved our relationship. We just... fit so well. We are best friends, we have so many similar interests, we are wonderfully supportive and caring about each other. We love each other. We are going to remain close and possibly revisit this when we can... but it hurts. I don't know if i want to lose her. I don't know what to do about this. "
1ztd6v,0,2014-03-07,Hello to All This: another unemployed 23 y/o moving to Brooklyn. How do I make it work?,BrooklynBound2,Brooklyn,https://www.reddit.com/r/Brooklyn/comments/1ztd6v/hello_to_all_this_another_unemployed_23_yo_moving/,"After graduating university and kicking around my minuscule Midwestern town for 6 months, I need a kick in the pants. My career aspirations are vague at best, and my undergraduate education comprised of a nebulous pursuit for knowledge about human behavior (psychology major). I conducted an independent study, but bad timing prevented us from getting enough subjects to submit for publishing.

I have always imagined that I would end up in graduate school, but I decided not to pursue it until I'm 85% certain what I would do with it. The soonest I would apply is this fall, but I've already scored well on the GRE.

So now I need to make a move. I can't remain stagnant. Most of my life I've been fed praise that has emphasized results over hard work, and in the small town that raised me, good results came easily. But now I'm sitting here, having never held a full-time job, terrified that any failures reflect on the nature of my being rather than the temporary state of my evolving skill-set. This needs to change. I need to get over my self pity, look the ""adult world"" in the face, and determine what the hell I need to do to get where I want to be.

My marketable stills are vague as well. I have some people experience (substitute teacher), social science research and data analysis, and moderate design skills (communications internship and web-design start-up in high school).

I have a connection in the city - my brother with engineering work in Manhattan. I visited him over spring break, and I loved the vibe of the city, though the experience was very tourist.

I also have volunteer work lined up in the game design industry, but I'm unsure whether there's a place for me in that.

Finally, I'm bringing to the table a few very fortunate factors. I have minimal student debt ($10,000), and I have $15,000 in money that I haven't had to work for. I want to spend as little of that as possible, but I'm willing to use it to invest in long-term, beneficial change.

From what I've seen on craigslist, I should be able to find a bed in Brooklyn for $750/mo or less. If it takes me 4 months to get into a full-time position, I would be out ~$4,500 with living expenses, but I hope to pick up a part-time job before that.

Am I setting myself up for misery, or is this a realistic challenge? Probably a bit of both?"
1zte1s,1,2014-03-07,"In a Dilemma, go for 2nd BS or undergrad certificate in CS",Christopoly,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1zte1s/in_a_dilemma_go_for_2nd_bs_or_undergrad/,"So right now I started my first semester at school again going for my 2nd bachelors as a comp sci major.  I'm currently taking discrete math, calc 3, data structures, and intro cs class(mandatory).  I'm actually doing really well in these classes so far but I've looked over my degree progress with my advisor and said it would take at least 2 years to finish this degree(can skip almost all gen-eds).  As a 25 year old, I'm tired of the school system and want to get out asap and start working full time.  


So I found out my school as another program called the undergraduate certifcate degree  http://catalog.gmu.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=15&amp;poid=5631&amp;returnto=1031 Pretty much its a years worth of credits to complete and it goes through all the important CS core classes.  As apposed to taking more classes if going through with the BS; such as stats, linear algebra, more upper level CS classes.  But this certificate is mainly used for people with bachelors unrelated to CS to go into grad school.  Im not looking into grad school bc its more expensive and will take an additional 2 years to complete.  


Im looking into the mobile development field, primarily android once I am done but I don't know if I should just finish my 2nd bachelors which will probably only take an additional 2-3 semester or get this certificate.  I also applied to many internships and waiting to hear back from 2 soon, so I can build up my resume.  But in the mean time I am learning android sdk on my own through a book I bought.  Right now I'm leaning towards the 2nd BS but want a second opinion."

1ztl7b,8,2014-03-07,Company credit card issue - looking for advice,LordRockingham,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1ztl7b/company_credit_card_issue_looking_for_advice/,"So, I think I have an issue with a company credit card, but not sure how severe it is or how to resolve it.  The story goes like this. (Sorry for all the text)

Three years ago, I was working for a company and was given a company credit card for purchases.  I cannot remember if I filled out any forms or signed anything, or what company issued the card or the card number.  In hindsight, I should have definitely looked into this more carefully and kept records, but it was my first job out of school and had to learn the hard way that some people can't be trusted at all.

The job involved making several purchases for clients and then billing for reimbursement periodically.  A good chunk of the expenses from my projects were charged on my card.  I never handled payments to the credit card company, but I'm sure the card was regularly maxed out &amp; carried a balance.

After a year of working there, I quit and got another, much better job.  I had many problems with the owner - he would constantly berate employees, lie, and demand employees do completely unrelated jobs (one intern was asked to clean toilets her first week after flying in from England for the summer - I kid you not.  He only allows foreign interns to threaten them with their work visa if they refuse these demands.  I think he got busted offering ""internships"" at no pay to US citizens before I got there).  People regularly worked 12 hour days on sub-par salaries, and someone ended up crying each day for getting screamed at for ""mistakes"" (i.e. not reading the boss's mind and doing what he would have done in the situation, which should be absolutely obvious, of course.)  You get the picture.  I gave in my letter of resignation &amp; turned in the company card.  After blocking my boss's phone number to stop all the threatening texts I got when I left, I thought I was finally done.

It turns out the company card I had is still active.  I got a copy of an invoice for an order I did not place (sent to my new work email - updated my contact info with a vendor I still use).  I called the vendor to clarify and found out someone (likely my old boss) placed an order with them under my name &amp; using the company card I had turned in.  However, once I explained the situation to the rep, she refused to cancel the order or give me the credit card number or issuer, since I no longer worked for the company that placed the order (I think she got scared about liability and just clammed up).

So, it seems like charges are still being made to the card I had, and probably have been for the last 2 years.  I don't know who issued the credit card, or what the # is.  There is zero chance my former boss will give me that info if I tried to call.  I also pulled my credit reports, and they don't indicate the card.

Is there any way for me to close this card?  Am I liable for it?  Could this affect my credit score if its not on my credit report?  Even if I tried to get a lawyer involved, I only had verbal confirmation on a phone call that my card was used.  The invoice I got only states ""paid in full"" with no more info.  I'm just really pissed off right now and don't know what to do next.

Thanks for listening."
1ztxty,80,2014-03-07,Hi Filmmakers! As a working composer I've noticed that film schools tend to ignore teaching you how to work with a composer. Here are some general tips to help guide you in your post-production process.,R3ckl3ss,Filmmakers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Filmmakers/comments/1ztxty/hi_filmmakers_as_a_working_composer_ive_noticed/,"Hi Filmmakers!

I've been working as a composer in LA for the past three years.  I'm not at the top of the game by any means but I have been working on a lot of projects with both well seasoned directors &amp; fresh out of school directors.  It seems to me that even the best schools in the country (USC, AFI, NYU) only teach you the very basics of music and how synch music works.  Here are a few guidelines and opinions you might find helpful.  If you'd like more info on any of this drop me a note.  I'm always happy to talk music with filmmakers.

**Step 1 - deciding on your music.**

There are a lot of options.  licensed music from bands, library (aka production) music, or a composer.  You're probably going to *want* to use licensed music.  I know this because of all the projects I get temped with Radiohead, The Black Eyed Peas, Aviici, and the like but in reality you can't afford this.  Seriously, unless Trent Reznor is your cousin you should really not even put the social network soundtrack against your picture even as a joke.  because you'll love it and then you'll be all ""let's just leave it in for now.""  terrible idea.  It will only end in tears.  If you're going to license music go find it on soundcloud and *contact the artist before you temp their music to picture.*  This way you don't end up working with a prima donna who wants thousands because they're awesome like that.  Have a contract at the ready, and get them to sign it as soon as they agree to let you have their music for no money.  

Library music is generally OK and you can sift through piles of crap to find something that works.  Then you pay a modest fee (anywhere from $20 - tens of thousands depending on your project and the library you're negotiating with) and you get the rights to use that music in your film.  

A composer will write music to picture and is the best thing for any film, but they come in all kinds and you have to wait to hear what they come up with.  You have to tell them what you do and do not like and then hope that their feelings aren't going to be too hurt.  Good composers don't give a shit.  New/young composers can get really attached to their work and be a little put out if you don't like it too.

You need to decide early on how you want to handle music and prepare accordingly.  If you're going to use bands get contracts ready.  If you're going to use library do your research and budget appropriately.  If you're going to use a composer find them as early in the process as you can.  There is NOTHING more frustrating than finding out that a director has ""no money left"" for the music but spent a couple grand on sandwiches for the crew on set.  If you hire them earlier you'll budget for their fee.  Please budget for their fee. 

This is so important I need to state it again.  BUDGET FOR MUSIC.  I have been approached with countless projects which budgeted correctly for food, transportation, and on set security but not for music.  Music can make a good project legendary or a fantastic film unwatchable.  When you don't budget for music properly you're far more likely to slip into the latter category.  If you need a rule-of-thumb figure then you can ballpark 10% - 15% of your total budget to music.  For something that can carry 50% of the emotional weight of your film that's some good value.  don't cheapen it.

**Step 2 - Temping your film.**

If you temp your film before sending it to your composer you should temp it with the most god awful crap you can find that still carries the emotional quality that you're looking for.  Trust me on this.  If you temp with the Social Network soundtrack or the Inception soundtrack and then hand it to your young composer YOU WILL HATE WHAT THEY GIVE YOU.  Why?  because you temped your picture with Oscar winning music that was recorded and mixed and mastered professionally and if your composer could write like that already then they sure as shit wouldn't be working on your ""indie short.""  You want to give them something that they're going to be better than.  Something that you're going to be glad to get rid of.  Tell your composer what about that crappy temp you think works (the rhythm, the strings, the build, the synth idea, the ""darkness"")

Before you send picture to your composer ask them what they need in the video.  SMPTE timecode?  two pop?  I prefer dialog &amp; SFX to be panned hard left and temp music to be panned hard right so that I can split them out.  Make sure that you put a card before the 2 pop that says ""[film title],[composer's name],[frame rate],[audio sample rate]""  (ex. ""Short Film, Jim Dandy composer cut, 24 FPS, 48k audio"")  Trust me, this is SUPER important information and if anything doesn't get delivered to you in proper format you can point to that card and say ""dude, you got this all in the video I sent you.""

Also, make sure that the assistant editor's intern's intern that you get to burn timecode into the composer's video gets their work checked by someone who knows what the fuck they're doing.  Wrong timecode is most-common-problem #2 on the composer list of every project's bullshit problems (#1 is click.  Composers/Engineers know what I'm talking about.)  

Lastly, when you send that timecode burned, 2-pop included, awesome info card added, temp/dialog correctly panned video please make sure you're not sending a fucking 4K video.  Make it small.  Turn off that little nit-picky voice inside of you that whines about sub-optimal quality.  I'm just going to have to take that much more time to download your giant ass file and then convert it to something small so my computer's resources aren't bogged down.  Just make it small for me.  crush that fucker down to ipod size.  I need to see what's going on, not screen it for the Academy.

**step 3 - Notes.**

So you just got version 1 of the music back and WOW did mr. composer man (or woman) miss the boat.  First, wait as long as you can to write your notes to them.  Live with it for at least 24 hours.  You might find that something works really well while other things might not.  Maybe it's just TOO LOUD (composers always mix the music too loud against dialog.  expect it.) 

But after living with it and mulling it over you're sure that there's a lot that's not working.  If you can, write everything down.  Make sure that you give two positive responses for every negative.  This can be hard if your composer missed the mark completely but try.  ""I really like the strings but I hate that synth sound.""  that can work.

Never, ever, ever say ""what the temp does really well is..."" because your composer will hear ""why can't you be the temp!?""  Instead, say something like ""your cue needs a little more..."" because then they feel like you're actually listening to the music and talking about what they did, not someone else's work.  Think how it would feel if someone said to you ""you know, what Spielberg does really well is...""  You'd be like, ""Why are you comparing me to him!?  That's insane!""

Talk in emotional terms.  Use emotion words.  Don't try and talk music.  Odds are you're going to use a term wrong and confuse your composer.  Unless you have some kind of degree in music avoid musical terms.  Speak to your composer like you would to your actors.  Emotions, elements of story, dramatic intent... stuff like that.  Your composer is telling a story though a different medium.  Give them the tools to tell that story.  Tell them what emotional content the music needs to have and give SPECIFIC TIMECODE if you want certain hits or moment accentuated.

**Step 4 - Revisions**

Try to limit yourself to two revisions, no more than three.  Unless you're paying them a shit load of money.  Then check the contract to make sure there aren't revision limits (mine says two revisions per cue or you pay more money but I'm not a total jackass about it,) and if not then go for it.  But in general most of you are going to be working with someone who's working for free or almost free so try and get what you need from them in two revisions.  If they're not giving you what you want by the 2nd revision you might have to examine your communication skills or expectations.  This is, of course, assuming that you're not asking for rock and getting jazz.  If they're sucking a giant nut then get a new composer.  If they're revising and revising and giving you what you ask for and you're still not happy try and find out where the communication is breaking down.

**step 5 - delivery**

Spell out to them what you want as a deliverable.  Do you want one long stereo audio file (for anything 15 minutes or less do this.  It's easier on you.)  Do you want stems? (unless you've got a really professional dub engineer don't ask for stems)  Tell them specifically file format, bit depth, sample rate.  (example: gimme .wav files, 24 bit 48k.)  If they are using ProTools then audio will spot directly to timecode in your avid session.  BUT just to be sure you should ask them to title each audio file with the SMPTE code that it starts on.  (example ""1m02_title_01111513.wav"")  This way your mixing engineer can spot the audio to the correct TC or check it if it spots automatically.  

BTW, if you don't know exactly what to ask for a deliverable ask your editor.  In fact, at this point your composer and editor should already have been put into contact with each other and have already developed a deep and lasting bond of friendship.  You want the Editor and Composer to start a dialog as early as possible in this process.  You want them to be best friends.  

**Step 6 - Credit**

Always ask *as early as possible* how your composer wants to be credited.  Make sure to ask if they have any ""additional music by..."" credits or musicians to credit.  Since the vast majority of you are small indie types you should tell your composer to create and submit their own cue sheets.  But if you're amazingly awesome you will get a cue sheet from them and submit it to ASCAP and BMI for them.  This is so that if your film gets any play on TV or in theaters or whatever then your composer will get some performance royalties.  If they're not registered with ASCAP or BMI ask them why they don't like money.  Then tell them to get their shit together and register.  

**Step 7 - Ask me questions**

Feel free to shoot me a message with specific questions on dealing with composers or music for film in general if you want more specifics.  

I'm sure I've skipped over a lot.  I didn't even cover publishing.  If other composers want to fill in or correct any of the above please do.  Being that this is Reddit and I've put up a bunch of opinions I'm sure that there will be plenty of posts contradicting a lot of what I've put up here or calling me a jerk or something.  Just keep in mind that this is all advice coming from my time working with people who are at the same level as many of you.  "

I am in intern at a local organization called Horizons for Refugee Families. Horizons is a non-profit organization that provides services for refugees (mainly from the Middle East, Africa, and Asia) ranging from naturalization assistance to English as a second language classes and health awareness classes. Presently, we are organizing a Cultural Event for April 5th from 11:00 AM until 5:00 PM. It will most likely take place at Lincoln Park, and it will be a day full of fun, food, a fashion show and a raffle!

That being said, this post has a few purposes:

1. To promote! This is going to be a fun event! Come out and enjoy your day with us! There will be a fashion show displaying clothes from different cultures, and the clothes will be auctioned if you like any of them! There will also be food and entertainment! Small fee at the entrance. ($15 or under, I will update once I'm sure!)

2. To recruit! We are having tents set up around the event. If you or anyone you know has a local business and would like to participate or advertise, we are selling tent space for $100, or, we are also trading tent space for goods to sell/raffle! This means that businesses could donate something to be raffled (the proceeds would go to the Horizons organization) and they would then get free tent space to do there thAng in throughout the event, and they would also get a space/shout-out in the pamphlet that will be handed out to all the guests! It would be a great way to advertise and promote your local business here in Tucson!

3. For some help/feedback! We are trying to make this event fun and successful! yayy! If anyone here has suggestions as to what kind of local businesses may be interested in this kind of cultural event, leave a comment or message me and I'll write them a letter of inquiry! Or if anyone here has any suggestions for a good place to get ethnic-type clothing or fabric for cheap, or has any that they are trying to get rid of, let me know! It may end up in the fashion show portion! We are designing/buying clothes for it, so, also, if anyone knows how to design/sew clothing and is bored over the next month, we would love to meet you and very much appreciate your help!

I will upload an official flyer with all of the specifics soon!

Remember, it is for a great cause (displaced refugee families who are in Tucson) and it will be super fun! Hope to see you there Tucson!

Can anybody offer any tips on how to list my military experience on a resume, presumably for an internship? Though I did (4) combat deployments to Iraq &amp; Afghanistan, some suggest leaving this off of the resume. Any thoughts on that?

I have considered a few so far:

- Meeting deadlines: Besides the deadlines presented in day-to-day military life, we used what was called a ""Time on Target"" plan during missions. Essentially, this was a deadline to fire rounds on specific targets, with all of the prep work preceding. 

- Used Math &amp; Proprietary software during nearly every phase of my job. It was pretty much real-life ""Pocket Tanks."" :)

- And the emphasis on punctuality, details, work ethic, blah blah blah...

1zuy0a,6,2014-03-07,I care too much what others think. I feel like I'm a failure and disappointment.,homewardangel,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1zuy0a/i_care_too_much_what_others_think_i_feel_like_im/,"I just received the latest of several rejections for a job/internship. I'm a second semester senior majoring in the humanities (I know) about to graduate undergrad and everything is sort of hitting me at once.
Off the top of my head, one of my big problems is caring too much what others think. 

I'm watching my friends get job offers to amazing places and here I am, scrambling for an internship. They ask me what I'm planning on doing after graduation and I can just hear the judgment bell go off in their heads when I tell them I have no clue. I actually want to write a novel. It's been in my head for ages and I really want it to happen. I'd be perfectly content working a menial job to feed myself while I work on it. I've been doing various odd jobs in regards to writing (advertisements, websites) and that's been okay.

But then comes the issue of my parents. I'm gay and they don't know. They've expressed their disapproval of homosexuality on multiple accounts. They ask me when I'm going to find a girlfriend and get married. When I'm going to find a job and support them. A large part of wants to be so successful that it won't matter to them whether I'm gay or not. However, the realistic part of me defines success on a much smaller scale. So now I'm going to disappoint them on two instances.
I'm seeing people on my Facebook newsfeed getting engaged or posting pictures with their long time significant others. That's killing me because the window of time I have to keep my sexuality from my family is diminishing. They're getting antsy, they're all so wrapped up around my love life. It's killing me because I'm keeping myself from being happy and experiencing things. I'm watching friends get job offers from the same places I got rejected from. (My friend and I applied to the same program. He got in. I bombed the interview.) That's killing me, too.

All these societal pressures are slowly destroying my motivation to keep working on my novel, which I feel like is the only thing I have right now. It feels like the world is moving way faster than me and I'm taking a slow step backwards. Regarding jobs, my problem is I don't treat it like a numbers game and take rejections personally. What do I expect, right? I do everything slowly and methodically and put all my effort into a single thing. This has worked well for me with schoolwork but with job apps, I just can't seem to prioritize and multitask. I feel so divided. I put so much effort into school when I feel like what I'm learning doesn't really matter. I put so much effort into my current unpaid internship, an obscure start-up that I tell myself ""will be good for the resume."" I have to apply for jobs - that alone is a full-time job. I want to work on my novel and give that my all, too. I'm afraid that if I shift my attention from one thing to another, the other things will all crash and burn.

I want to stop mulling over my failures but I can't. I want to stop giving a shit what other people think but I can't."
1zv1c8,0,2014-03-07,Should I take this entrance exam?,[deleted],ProtectAndServe,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProtectAndServe/comments/1zv1c8/should_i_take_this_entrance_exam/,"Hello all,

I am trying to type this out so it isn't a wall of text. Here's the deal: 

* I am going to graduate from college with a BA this December. 
* I had a one-on-one with the Chief of Police of a nearby agency, he told me that he would like to see me at the civil service exam later this month, that I can finish my degree later on if I am hired.
* If I can get hired on by an agency now and finish my degree later, that is perfectly fine. Getting on with a good agency is the whole point anyway.
* I have already applied for internships for this fall. I will hear back from them in July regarding my selection. If I hear back regarding the internship before I hear back about hiring onto this department, I will take the internship.
* If I do good on the civil service exam and end up in the background phase, the background may run past when I am offered an internship. HOWEVER, it is a small department and the Chief said that the process is usually only 2-4 months.
* Should I take the exam and tell the BI upfront that I will take the internship offer if the agency hasn't made a hiring decision on me by that time? The last thing I want is to turn down the internship thinking that I have this job in the bag, only to get a ""thanks but no thanks"" letter in the mail the next day. I will have put myself in a s****y situation.


I feel like if I do get selected, great! I have the job I want! If I don't get selected, then at least I now have experience with taking an exam and interviewing and what-not. Like I said, I just don't want to end up without a job OR an internship and have to push my graduation back a semester.

I believe I will again^1 be able to score 165 or more in quant.

I am talking about universities like UMass, MSU, Texas-Austin, UVa, NCSU, UIUC, TAMU, Penn State, GaTech, Illinois, Maryland, UMich Ann Arbor etc.

I was able to apply only to UMass, MSU and have not heard from them yet. I had applied to a lot of programmes in Europe (esp. the ones with scholarship but I've not received funding in any and I am on waiting list in most with dim chances). Won't be risking an education loan to Europe.

- Are there any disadvantages of getting into a spring entry programme? Less chances of assistance or so? (I am aware that very few places have spring intake)
- Are there good universities in USA that do not ask for GRE like those in Europe or focus mostly on GRE quant score for CS programmes? TOEFL is 111/120.
- Did not mail any professors, even those whom I mentioned in my application or on SOP. Planning to do that this year. Matters? I am applying to MS (not PhD or combined).


Anyone from Canada? I am also planning to apply to McGill, UBC etc.

1zv9he,8,2014-03-07,My [24/M] girlfriend [25/f] of 2 years broke up with me after moving to the other side of the world (x-post r/Relationship_Advice),SelflessInSeattle,LongDistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/1zv9he/my_24m_girlfriend_25f_of_2_years_broke_up_with_me/,"My girl loves to travel and recently bought a one way ticket to Thailand with an offer to work at a dive shop during her stay. I've been aware of her desire to embark on this journey for most of our relationship, and a part of me has always known this is something she wants to do on her own, but I still don't understand why she broke up with me after being out there only a few weeks.

This isn't the first time she's travelled across the world during our relationship, and I'm not sure what's so different about this particular trip. I stayed in touch with her during her month-long trip to Hawaii right after we met, and although we were living in different cities for 6 or 7 months while I was finishing my degree, our relationship flourished. She had an internship in Spain for a few months during that period, and for my graduation I flew out to meet her in Barcelona (her idea), and had one of the best experiences of my life. We pretty much moved in together after arriving back in the States, and have had a mostly wonderful time since then.

She admits that I'm a perfect match for her, and I feel that she's been great for me, but after our two years together she's bought her ticket and is living in Thailand and feels that this is something she wants to do on her own and decided that breaking up would be best for both of us. As I said, some part of me has always known that this is a trip for her, and from the beginning I've questioned if she wants me to join her. I was never able to get a clear answer (""I don't know!"" was a constant answer to my question) and I did push her to invite me to meet her out there after some period apart. Finally she said that she would be happy for me to make the trip, she would miss me a great deal and it wouldn't be the same without me, but on the condition that I give her 3 months to experience the journey on her own. After buying her ticket, however, all this seemed to change. Our relationship became rather estranged after she bought her ticket, and we've gotten into a few arguments because she suddenly seemed to act like she didn't want to be in a relationship.

We had the typical sad goodbye when she left and stayed in touch nearly every day for several weeks, until one day we were chatting on Skype and she told me that she wasn't going to be coming back for a long time and it wasn't fair to make me wait for her, and that we should break up because she wants to do this on her own. I don't know what's changed between this trip and the other two she's taken during our relationship, and I don't understand why she wouldn't want me to meet her for at least a little while. 

We both understand that we're still young and have our whole futures ahead of us, but I still can't imagine sharing my life with anyone else. Our families love each other, and I truly believe that this isn't the end of our relationship. However, I can't see any way for this situation to work out. She's been out there for almost 2 months now, and we still stay in touch, but I'm now moving on with my life, trying to get a real job outside of the service industry, and whenever she decides to come back I don't see how our life paths will be able to cross again. 

Any insight you can give into her mindset during this would be appreciated, as I thought we were perfectly happy and simply don't understand where this came from. I can't be mad at her, because she's been honest, albeit confused, but I'm frustrated that I won't be ""over her"" until it's been long enough that she will probably come back from her trip anyway and it's too late."
1zvaix,8,2014-03-07,I'm diagnosed but I'm not sure if my problem is ADHD,[deleted],ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1zvaix/im_diagnosed_but_im_not_sure_if_my_problem_is_adhd/,"I was diagnosed back in high school.  I just finished college and now I'm having a crisis and I think ADHD is feuling it.  


I went to school for copywriting(the mad men kind).  I loved it and had a blast doing projects in school and finding connections between two seemingly unrelated things to make a cool, clever ad.  

I graduated, and now I'm at an internship at an agency right now doing some work for small clients that the agency has and things like that.  My boss is really cool and its cool getting to do real work.  But unfortunately I feel like the things I'm working on aren't the fun things that I liked doing in school.  And I know that people have to pay dues etc to get to do what they want but honestly I have a hard time giving a fuck that that's what you're supposed to do.  I want to work on ads that I want to work on.  I don't want to make shitty poster using cliche lines because everyone is too afraid to take a risk with their brand.  I'm starting to resent the internship and copywriting as a whole because it seems like this is an omen of things to come with my career.  


I also love writing.  I'll read a good book once in a while and think, ""I want to write this.""  I want to write novels and short stories and screenplays.  I buy books about wring screenplays and I write short stories in my free time, often when I'm at my internship also, instead of doing work.  I want to master writing and become successful as a writer.

But wait, I also love to record music.  To make rap beats for my friends to rap on while we hang out.  I went to a show recently and running around on stage while everyone parties looks like the most fun anyone can ever have making money.  Now I want to do that.  I want to devote all my time to making beats and I throw writing and copywriting to the side as I order drum machines and chop samples late into the night.  

I see a good movie and want to become a screenwriter and spend time developing stories and plot outlines that will never come to fruition.

I saw a drawing that really spoke to me and I started drawing on paper and practicing that to get better.  

In order to clarify,  I do spend a lot of time with all of these hobbies, and I'm slowly getting better at all of them.  Due to this [quote](http://www.goodreads.com/quotes/309485-nobody-tells-this-to-people-who-are-beginners-i-wish) from Ira Glass, I force myself to believe that I'm getting better, and everytime I listen to an old song, or read an old story and cringe with embarrassment, it only serves to remind me that I'm improving.  

I'm terrified that I'm in love with too many things and I'll never be able to master any because I get distracted and move on to another thing.  I just cycle around: writing, copywriting, beats, drawing, writing, copywriting, beats, etc etc etc

What am I supposed to do to break this cycle? My meds put me in a mild manic state where I'm full of motivation but no direction.  

Edit: Wanted to thank both you guys for writing thought out responses.  It helps to know that there are others who are in the same spot that I am.

Hello there! I'm in need of an internship so I can graduate. No internship, no graduation! I need to find an internship -- which can be anywhere -- before I leave Maine; my college requires me to show up in person in order to register for classes this summer. Going back and forth gets a little expensive!

Up-and-coming company with a small budget? That's okay. I'm looking for a company to give me a chance to prove my skills, and to help me learn more. Part-time or full-time is okay. I'm also not looking for a whole lot of money here since the point is to prove myself, get my foot in the door, and to get good grades. I'm also fine with programming challenges!

Since I take my grades and courses seriously, and because I'm passionate about IT, I'll do my very best to make you happy. If that's not good enough, then I'll have to do better! My grade for all internships will be based on how you feel I've performed my duties. 

If you're worried about me taking off after the internship, don't be! The remainder of my courses can be finished online, and most of them are general electives. I've already completed the majority of my computer courses.

Now even if I do get the required grades, these universities are quite expensive especially considering I'm an international student. I haven't applied to US universities and missed their deadlines due to my own stupidity.

My question is weather I'll be able to find jobs after doing Aerospace from Manchester? Is it a good uni? Moreover, i'd like to know if it's a good idea to take a gap year and apply to US universities. Are they cheaper than the UK ones? do they have more scholarship opportunities? also, I have no idea how majors and minors work. :/

1zx74p,12,2014-03-08,The Mirror,[deleted],nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1zx74p/the_mirror/,"I bought a mirror about three months ago at an antique store. It's a pretty mirror, and I still have it. It was a fancy trim around it, as if it were a portrait of a family's patriarch. I found it odd that anyone would want to frame a mirror in such a way, but I also thought that it must of had some sentimental value or something. At the time however, I couldn't figure out how a mirror could even have sentimental value, perhaps, I thought, it had been owned by a very vain woman.

When I brought it home, I hung it up on my wall over my dresser. I figured, maybe I can finally realise how silly I looked all the time and change it *before* I went out into public. I didn't hold any sort of value on it, it was just a mirror.

Two nights after I set it up, I woke up in the middle of the night. A strange light was coming from the mirror, and as I stared into the mirror I saw the reflection of the moon. I saw then, a different image entirely. Instead of my room, I saw a (american) football field. I wasn't sure which team it was, as I didn't follow football. I saw the team that won, and then it stopped. I went back to bed.

The next morning I was certain it was a dream, though I remembered it so vividly. Two days later, I saw a news report where the team I saw in the mirror won. I was confused, and thought maybe I had just heard something about the game and saw the team. 

I hadn't seen anything in the mirror since that point, so I doubted it was some sort of ""magic mirror."" In fact, I didn't see anything until a month after my first viewing. 

Once again, I was awaken by a light coming from the mirror, and I stood and looked in. At first, it was just my room, the moon, and me. Then it was a woman in a red dress, approaching what appeared to be a homeless man. Like you would expect, the homeless man asked the woman for money, and she told him that she would feed him if he wanted instead. The homeless man grinned and nodded, so the woman hailed a taxi.

The mirror changed to an image of the woman's house, and the woman was cooking something. The homeless man walked into her kitchen, and behind his back I could see a knife. He walked to the woman, and held the knife to her throat. He told her she was a very pretty and sweet lady, and he was so lonely. I can't describe what happens next, but I can still see it in my mind, I couldn't take my eyes away from the mirror.

Right before the image faded, the mirror changed one last time, and I saw an image of the woman lying dead on her kitchen floor. Her neck was slit and her dress was torn. The man was raiding her kitchen. I couldn't handle anymore, and I threw up and passed out.

In the morning I woke up, next to a pool of my own vomit. I knew that it was real this time, but I didn't know what to do. Should I get rid of the mirror? Should I report what I saw to the cops? What would I say? All these thoughts came flooding into my head, and in the head I decided to keep the mirror and do nothing.

 I saw a report on the TV a week after about the dead woman. She was a kindergarten teacher, and had a daughter. The police said someone broke into her house and raped her, then killed her to keep her from saying anything. Her nine year old daughter found the body. Once again, I couldn't handle this. I had seen the woman die a week before she did, and I felt I should have done something, but I knew there was nothing I could have done. I did, however, call in an anonymous tip to the police about seeing her with a homeless man, but no killer has been found still.

I was wary of the mirror, I couldn't tell if it was evil. But I figured it probably wasn't, how can a mirror have a moral alignment? Once again, no visions until a month after I saw the woman die. This time, I saw another woman. She was wearing a blue dress, and appeared to be frightened of something. She walked down an alley, where a man with a knife came out, demanding money. She screamed as loud as she could, and a man came out and yelled something, causing the mugger to get scared and stab the woman. The man who yelled came running towards the woman, and the image faded.

This time, I was determined to try to stop this. I knew that the vision came from somewhere in my own city because I had seen the alley she walked down many times. So, all I had to do was find the woman which I thought would be really difficult. Surprisingly, it wasn't.

The next day, I had decided that I needed a drink, so I went to the bar. And, at that bar, lo and behold was a beautiful, yet familiar face of a woman in a blue dress. To make it easier, she noticed me see her, and she smiled and waved me over. I sat next to her, and we hit it off. I won't tell you her name, so let's call her Emma. 

She was a really likable person, and had recently landed an internship at a local hospital. In fact, the bar was suppose to be a celebration, but no one had shown up. I really liked her, and she really liked me. It was all going perfectly, until I accidentally said something about the vision in the mirror. At that point, she got really creeped out, and quickly ran out. At that moment, I remembered how scared she had looked in the mirror, and realised this was the moment I saw. I quickly rushed after her, and saw her turn into the alley, but she was so far ahead of me. I heard her scream, and I shouted, but when I got to the alley she had already been stabbed. I called for an ambulance, and when they got there she was still alive. They allowed me to ride in the ambulance with her.

In the hospital, when she woke up, I talked to her. She wanted to know how I knew what had happened, and I told her I didn't know. I told her I was so sorry, and it was in fact my fault that she had gotten stabbed. She told me to calm down. So I did. 

We spent the rest of the night talking, and she told me she believed me when I said I saw it in the mirror, as she had no other explanation on how I knew all the details. We've been going out ever since, and she had spent the night over at my house when the mirror showed me it's latest vision. 

I got up once again to see the mirror lit. I slowly scooted away from Emma, whose arm had been around me, and looked in. This time, when the image changed, it was still me. I was walking down the stairs in my building, when I tripped. I fell down hitting my head over and over again, my body was broken when I hit the ground. My face was covered in blood, and my limbs in angles they shouldn't be. I saw my landlord discover my body, but it was too late I was dead.

I haven't left my apartment, and Emma has been staying here with me. It's almost been another month since I saw myself die. Just three more days, and I haven't left the apartment building. Maybe the mirror was wrong. Oh god I hope so."
1zx7pm,2,2014-03-08,Drug Test for Internship?,Entropy_Greene,trees,https://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/1zx7pm/drug_test_for_internship/,Hey guys a good friend of mine is currently hoping to be at Wells Fargo for the summer financial analyst internship within commercial banking. He's been clean and is very competent but is curious to know if he will be drug tested upon his third interview. If anyone can offer some insight it would be greatly appreciated!
1zxalr,1,2014-03-08,"Me [21 M] with my girlfriend [21 F] of 4 years, the last few months have been rough. I keep fearing we have to break up despite us not wanting to.",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1zxalr/me_21_m_with_my_girlfriend_21_f_of_4_years_the/,"I met her in kindergarten, we became best friends in 8th grade, and dated since 12th grade.

Our relationship has sort of always been silly, and we always have argued and bickered like an old married couple. It never has bugged either of us, because we would always solve our issues right then and there and be done with them (looking back now I wonder if this was an early warning sign we never were meant for each other?).

The happy times are amazing and that is what is keeping us together. We went to Europe for a month, a couple two week long vacations, and I can't think of anyone else I rather do this with.

The last couple months have been pretty rough on us. Last December I was just finishing 4 hard courses in college before I can do an internship, which kept me busy and stressed. I admit, I could handle my stress better, but I was really grumpy in December. Right now she is in college too and its stressful for her. She also is living at home and has a lot of issues with her family right now that are wearing her down.

Right now she is going to college full time and I am working full time. We are both in the same city, but time gets tight and we are always tired and grumpy lately.

We both have anxiety problems, and both our anxiety levels go through the roof when we are stressed. This means we tend to get too caught up in our irrational thoughts and just generally anxious. We are usually there to support each other with this, but now that we sometimes both are in an anxious mood we can feed each other instead of help. This causes us to argue a lot lately about things each other does and just being rather unpleasant around each other.

That's not to say that's all we do. We tend to just tell each other, OK, this is enough, lets go to dinner and a movie and pretend life doesn't exist outside that and our problems. Or we will just watch a TV show or have sex or something.

Both of us want to work through this, but I am scared I'm stuck on something that will never work. Maybe you can tell me whether I'm being irrational or not?

I read all the other advice and get advice from other subreddits and everyone seems to think breaking up is the easiest thing to do. They say I'm young and moving on would be easiest. The answer always just seems to ""move on"". I just get scared that in this case that's the best thing we can do.

I get advice that ""people never change"" and that this might keep up forever and I'm just using this time as excuse for reality.

I get scared that because we have always bickered and argued with each other a lot that we have been so used to not working well for each other we don't know any better. Other couples just seem so non-confrontational and smooth with their relationship, but for us its just flat out on the table with anything.

I just don't know what to think. We want to make it work, I just really fear based on all the other advice and questions I have asked that we shouldn't make it work.

I get scared we are just making each others problems worse and we would be better off without each other. I get scared that I'm in denial that we are headed down a dark path that is doomed. I get scared that us arguing a lot is really wrong and a huge indicator that we aren't right for each other.

**Edit:** Reading back I tend to focus on all the negatives of our relationship and not the positives a lot more, I hope I don't bias your opinions. There are a lot of positive things we enjoy about each other too. I just fear all these little things we want to change about each other to make this work can't be done. I fear its just the way we are and can't change some of these little behaviors and things we do.

---   
**tl;dr**: Our happy times are amazing, but due to our anxiety and stress we tend to be pretty unpleasant and argue with each other lately. I'm scared breaking up is the only way despite us wanting to get through it. I just fear based on other advice on Reddit working through it is the wrong choice, and don't know how to tell if it is."

1zxkwq,1,2014-03-08,Help me decide if I want to stay an extra semester and find another job or stay with my current job (starting in Aug.)!!,[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1zxkwq/help_me_decide_if_i_want_to_stay_an_extra/,"I'm currently finishing up my Master's, graduating this May. I accepted a job offer for next August in Philadelphia. It's not my top choice but it was the only one I got. However, now that my start date approaches I've begun to feel really hesitant about going there. I feel like it's not right for me and have really been entertaining the thought of doing an extra semester in the fall, going through fall recruiting at my school, and trying for a smaller firm closer to my boyfriend (who works in NYC). 

However, I'm also really reluctant in going through recruiting again. My GPA is above a 3.0 but still low enough that many places just don't interview me at all. I think I'm just a sensitive person and being rejected by so many companies really took a toll on me. Many of the companies I applied to last year never responded to my resume, so why would they respond next year? However, I do believe that I've become more mature since the last time I went through recruiting. I feel like I'm better at the ""small things"" that get people to like you when they're interviewing you so I should hopefully have a little more success this year. Also I got my resume reviewed and my GPA is higher for my Master's than my undergrad. However, none of this is a guarantee that I'll find something.

I did do an internship in January at a company in NYC that seems to want me back. However, it pays 50% less than the company I accepted. My BF will make much more than either of these companies but I also don't want to rely on him.

If I do do this extra semester, I can take a few internships over this summer and next term. I got a few really amazing internship offers and I just want to do them all. I can work at the internship while taking 1 night class and working on my thesis. I've talked to my adviser and he says that we may be able to get a paper out of my thesis. And I'm really excited for these internships and would love to do them. They're not in the field I want to go into full time so that wouldn't help but they are paid so I'll be able to sustain myself. This is probably the biggest reason why I'd want to take another semester.

So here's the breakdown of pros and cons of staying another semester, ranked by how important they are to me:

Pro:

1. The company I accepted the offer from is really big and I prefer a smaller, more startupy environment.

2. I get to do multiple internships at places I'll have a lot of fun at and are also paid.

3. I can get a better job that might lead to more connections in the city in the future.

4. I can find somewhere in NYC to be near my BF.

5. I can maybe get a paper out of my thesis.


Cons:

1. I'm really scared of recruiting again and my undergrad GPA will probably prevent companies from 
interviewing me.

2. I fear my peers will be ahead of me. I'm going into a rather cutthroat business that is hierarchically stacked and being behind 1 year might have high opportunity costs in terms of potential openings for promotions.

3. I'm already on my 5th year of school (undergrad + masters). I already feel behind and my friends have already all started working. Many people finish both undergrad and masters in 4 years and I'll be doing 5 and a half.

4. If not for my BF being in NYC I would probably have sucked it up and gone to Philly. I know I wouldn't want to stay for many years but I wouldn't have mind going there for a few (~5 years).

5. The pay difference (not a huge deal).

Thanks for reading my rant and give me any advice you might have for me. Don't be afraid to give some tough love as well :P"
1zxzr6,0,2014-03-08,My[19F] sister[25F] is 4 years out of college and basically has no plan for the future. How can I effectively get my point across to her that she needs to get it together?,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1zxzr6/my19f_sister25f_is_4_years_out_of_college_and/,"I have 3 siblings between the ages  of 27 and 22, myself being the youngest. All of them are out of college and I am still in college. My sister, we will call her Grace, moved back to the area of her college after returning home for a while, post-graduation. (I was still in high school). All of us kids worked in the same store through high school. My brothers stopped working there after a couple years, and I did also when I went to college.

When I was still a senior and she returned home, she returned to work there. Fine. We worked together and it was fun! She wanted to take a year off before graduate school. Also fine.

So while I was a senior in high school (she graduated when I was a junior?) she moved back down to where her school was after about 9+ months of living at home. She started dating this guy who lived down there whom she met through her best friend, we will call him Jake[21], who was their family friend.

So she gets a 2 bedroom apartment, a job at a T.G.I Fridays as a waitress, starts dating Jake, and soon adopts a dog. Fine.

My other siblings are doing great. I am doing great. A year  goes by and we are asking her when she is going to go to grad-school. Essentially her responses are that she is capable of doing it herself and she doesn't need people lecturing her or telling her how to live her life. Not being a huge bitch or anything, just doesn't like people telling her what to do.

So one year turned into two, then three, and now in the next few months will be her fourth year down there. She is still dating Jake, is in the same apartment, same job and has TWO dogs. When she told me she was going to get the second dog, a rescue puppy, I flat out told her that I didn't think it was a good idea because she had this small apartment, a boyfriend, a dog, and herself already in it. She says she is probably going to get a bigger place. So I tell her, ok, get the bigger place and enjoy the space for a little while instead of filling it with another body! It struck me as a red flag that she couldn't afford this bigger place when she initially moved down there, but suddenly she can afford that AND another dog. Grace gets mad at me, saying that the reason she came to me before anyone else was because she thought I would be supportive. I told her I wouldn't be a good sister if I didn't tell her it wasn't a good idea and she should focus on graduate school. She got the dog anyway, and never got the bigger apartment.

So now she has 2 hyper ass dogs, a boyfriend, a small apartment, and a 4 year old bachelors degree...

What pisses me, and everyone else, off, is the fact that she hasn't even volunteered anywhere since she graduated! She is SURROUNDED by opportunities in her field where she lives, and she has done literally NOTHING since graduating. She had some great internships in college but those are from too long ago to really matter now.

Jake is a few years younger than her and just now getting into college. He is a great guy, smart, good family, but he is younger. He is going to go to school a bit further away from their general area in the fall. The things Grace tells me about their relationship sound like she has been pressuring him to spend all of his time with her, leaving not that much time for him to see his family, (in comparison) who is only minutes away. As result, they get into stupid fights (and for other stupid reasons, too). My dad and I are worried that she is going to push him away.

She is supposed to be taking her entrance exam for grad-school very soon to try and apply for this fall. Every time anyone asks her if she has studied, she snaps at them. My mom has sent her job postings that would be PERFECT for her, and she gets mad. She is dangerously approaching unemployable at this point.

I am going to say something to her, but I am just not sure what. I don't really even care if she gets mad at me and stops talking to me, I just want what I say to stick! Normally I wouldn't be the greatest person to say is, as certain troubles have left my academic performance rather poor in the last few years, but I have really turned that around and I am currently really motivated.

I just don't get it. She is so smart and so personable. It isn't like shes a loser off doing drugs, she is just, doing nothing! She works part time and hasn't been studying for her test.

What can I say to her, even if it risks her talking to me, that might stick in her head enough to get her on the right path??


TLDR: My sister has done nothing in the last four years since she graduated college to further her career. Shes waitressing, with a small apartment, a younger bf, two dogs, and no recent experience. She gets mad at anyone that tries to tell her they're concerned, what do I say to convince her now is the last chance she has to get back on the right path??"

1zy4qu,0,2014-03-09,The Best Two Bucks I Ever Spent,[deleted],LosAngeles,https://www.reddit.com/r/LosAngeles/comments/1zy4qu/the_best_two_bucks_i_ever_spent/,"So I figure this one was worth sharing with the world. Preemptive sorry for the wall of text. :)

So as an engineering intern from Georgia Tech working in Claremont California, I was pretty excited to get to see the Pacific Ocean for the first time and see if the waters truly were colder on the West Coast. For the 4 weeks since arriving and starting my job in metro-LA I had hiked and explored the foothills a bit but still hadn't made it out to the beach. Once I started making a few friends, I had kept trying to see if I could organize a trip to the beach to no avail. Finally, fed up with all the cancellations, I headed out to Huntington Beach all by my lonesome. I rode the hour drive from Claremont to the beach rocking out to the country station with two books, a tube of sunscreen, a towel, a Tupperware filled with grapes and cheese to snack on the beach, a water bottle, and a grocery store plastic bag to wrap it all up in. After an enjoyable drive through the sun, I arrived at Huntington Beach and even managed to find parking on Beach Boulevard. I got out of my car, and made change with the help of a passerby out of the two bucks I had in my wallet. Depositing said two bucks into the meter by the big red truck I had driven up from Atlanta, I made my way to the beach, plastic bag in hand.

As I got to the beach, the familiar scents and sights of the Atlantic flashed into head as I gazed out onto the cresting waves of the Pacific. The taste of salt water filled the air and I hurriedly cast off my things, laid down my towel and made a B-line for the waves. I rushed into the arms of the Pacific, laughing as I tried to tackle the waves and not too taken aback by the only slightly chilly water. After minutes in the surf. I returned to my towel and snacked, watching the other beach goers reveling in the sand and surf. I finished my snack under the constant eyes of a sea gull hoping to grab a bite of my scraps. I stood and looked out at the sun setting into the sea and took obligatory pictures of the coastline for the family and friends back home, enjoying the pleasant decision I had made to go to the beach. Luckily enough for the gull, I had even accidentally dropped a grape into the sand, and the gull did his duty grabbing it with his beak and flying away with it.

As the sun set I figured that I would gather up my things and head to the Pier figuring I could get a great shot of the sun-setting from the Pier. I packed my things back into my bag taking special measure to load my phone, keys and wallet into the Tupperware I had brought so that they wouldn't get wet or sandy as I strode along the surf. The water was nice as a I walked along the shore gazing back and forth from the Ocean to the land. I quickly realized however that I had over packed my bag and it was beginning to tear. I suppose it was rather foolish of me to bring two books to the beach that I hadn't so much as opened. I adjusted to carry the bag rather than hold it from the weakening straps and continued towards the Pier. 

As I was two life guard stations from the Pier, the sun began to set. Figuring that I hadn't much time left, I exited the surf, crossed the beach and made my way to the paved bike/ pedestrian path that enclosed the beach. I stopped before end of the beach to snap a photo of the sunset in case the sun set vanished below the waves before I got to the end of the Pier. Re-placing my phone in the Tupperware, I jogged toward the Pier meeting the crowd that shared my interest with the sunset and the Pier. As I got halfway down the Pier I figured it was about time I pulled out my phone so I could prepare to snap the setting sun. It was then that I was driven frantic; for as I looked through the remnants of my grocery store bag, I realized that I only clutched two books and the Tupperware containing my phone, car keys, and wallet was no longer under my arms.

It came to me quickly that I had just lost the entirety of my life. Having had my phone moments before I raced back to the beach against the crowd frantically looking at the floor for my Tupperware. I had no luck as I made in down the pier and back to the path. I must have looked like a fool as I stood in the middle of the bike/pedestrian path muttering ""shit, shit, shit"" under my breathe. That's when a rather cute college aged blond walked up to me and asked me if I was alright.

Her name was K****** (stared out for her privacy). She wore a Sailor Moon sweatshirt over the bikini straps around her neck. I was thankful for the help and explained as my heart raced of how the entirety of my life was lost in a Tupperware and that I was searching for it. She smiled and me told me that she would help and asked me where I had seen it last. With her prompting I recalled the last photo I had taken at the beach and I figured that we could cover more ground if we split up. I asked her if she could search for my Tupperware from where I was standing to the middle of the Pier. I would then cover the ground between the path and the beach where I had taken the photo. She agreed and we decided to meet at the sign for Sandy's, a beach side restaurant off the Pier. Newly focused, we parted ways.

I retraced my steps to the beach with no luck keeping my eyes to the ground. I then headed up the beach to the green head life guard station to see if anyone had turned in my Tupperware. Again I was met with no luck. I wasn't surprised. It had been moments since I lost my Tupperware and the sun was still setting in the sky. As I made my way back to the sign for Sandy's, I contemplated the gravity of my situation. I didn't have keys to my car, nor the phone to call AAA to get that car opened, nor the license to drive said car to the apartment which I also lacked the keys to get into. As I meet K******, I had moved into despair. She had met with similar results in her search. Feeling guilty at wasting this cute girl's time I urged her to head home, thankful for the kindness of a stranger. I repeated her search of the Pier and again came up empty. Hopelessly I returned to the beach when I found the first sign of hope an empty water bottle, the same brand as I had brought.

Racing up the bike/ pedestrian path, I realized that during my first search I had searched the wrong entrance to the path. I had actually entered the path one stop further toward the Pier. There I found my next clue the Sunscreen tube that I had brought. Jogging up the beach I found the object of my quest, the Tupperware container resting on the sand. As I approached my Tupperware I rejoiced at the blinking blue light of my phone resting inside with my keys and wallet. I had been saved. Thanking the Lord, I returned to the life guards and informed them of my discovery. I was going to be okay, but I was still a little sad that I would probably never seen the girl that had thought to help a stranger.

As I thought about the finality of it all and that I would never see this girl again, I pulled my phone out and I kid you not started writing out a post for K****** in the /r/huntingtonbeach subreddit. As I struggled to mesh out what I wanted to say on the touchscreen keypad of my smart phone to thank this girl I looked up and you will never guess who was facetiming on the path in front of me. I exclaimed ""No way!"" and K****** turned around surprised to see me again and smiled as she saw the Tupperware I carried securely in my hand. 

We talked and laughed. I introduced my self formally and asked about her. Turns out she was on her Spring Break with her parents staying in a nearby hotel. She was studying Music, as a singer in a college that was close to where I was staying in Claremont. I thanked her from the bottom of my heart for the simple act of helping a stranger in need. We chatted for a couple minutes and she looked at her phone and said she had to go. It could have been her parents, or maybe an unmentioned boyfriend texting her. I never asked. The foolish me didn't ask for her number. 

I headed back towards my car kicking myself for not asking for her number when I should have. It had been an awesome day. I had truly had an adventure with all the comes with that. As I approached my truck I was also blessed to find my car without a ticket even though my meter had expired 40 minutes ago. As I drove home I realized that was the best two dollars I ever spent.

TL;DR: Spent $2 for parking to see the Pacific for the first time. Lose everything I own. Kind cute beach girl helps me search but then has to leave. I find everything I lost. Am sad about not getting to thank the kind girl. Run into the girl as writing a reddit post about her. Don't get girl's number."

* I am intern at a local repair store.

* I man the front desk when the secretary isn’t in. She’s been sick for a couple days.

* The front room is pretty sizable. Can hold 5-6 customers comfortably. 

* I'm your average intern/college student. Hoody, presentable pants, backpack full of necessary things. A little bit on the hefty side. Kinda clueless and prone to confusion.

* I usually think a bit before I talk, results in a slow drawl.

Story time.

Usually I’m only scheduled to come in on Thursdays and Fridays. However, my boss doesn’t mind if I pop in and help whenever I want. When I’m not in school I usually have nothing better to do besides video games and help out down at the store.

Today I should’ve stayed home and played video games.

 I pop in the back door and everything is hunky dorey. Drop my backpack by the fridge and ask Mr.Bossman what needs to be done.

“Secretary is still sick. Do you wanna man the front desk?”

‘Course I do! Customers are much more fun than chopping my hands to bits on old sharp computers. (I’m not pointing any specific brand out, but it starts with a *C* and ends with a *ompaq*.)

I put on my company hat and set myself at the desk. Yeah, we wear hats inside. We’re cool like that. First hour goes by, only Mr.Bossman’s mom coming to visit him. Twiddle my thumbs a bit. Another hour goes by. Only a couple customers just checking in on their computers. I help one out, he pays and is on his way. 

I was rocking back and forth in the chair and spinning a defunct drive, just waiting for time to pass. My thought's right before the moment that taught me to be careful what you wish for,""This is boring as hell. I wish I had something to do.""

**YOUR WISH HAS BEEN GRANTED MORTAL**

This tiny man bursts into the shop. He must’ve been 5 feet tall max. He rushes up to the desk and slaps his computer down. A full tower, right on the desk. just slaps it there. 

Shorty: HeymistermycomputerisbrokenmybrotherlikestoplaywiththebioshessuchanasshedoesntlistenwhenItellhimthatwillbreakit...

Now that he set the computer down I got a good look at him. The man looked like he was just skin draped over a wire frame. From the way he was twitching and talking someone had probably plugged that wireframe into an outlet not too long ago.

Shorty: hedoesstufflikethatallthetimehedoesntlistencanyoufixit?

Me: Yeah, I think we can fix it. Shouldn’t be too tough. Do you know what he did in the BIOS?

Shorty: IdunnohejustdoesstuffitsnotworkingIthinkhediditbutitsbrokencanyoufixit?

Me: Yeah, we should be able to. Here, write down your contact information on this form. Does the computer have a password? 

Shorty: Yeahithasapasswordit’s *super speed gibberish*

 Me: I’m sorry, I didn’t quite catch that.

Shorty: *slower super speed gibberish*

Me: Again please?

Shorty: a... b... c... 1... 2... 3... (Password has been changed for ""papers I signed"" reasons)

Me: Thanks, once you’re done just set that paper on top of the computer there and we’ll take care of it for ya. 

Shorty: *slaps paper on tower*

You’d think that was the end, that he’d leave then right? That’s what I thought. Boy was I wrong. I was rotating in the chair and spinning the drive, noticed his reflection in the disk. 

Me: Uh, is there anything else you need help with sir?

Shorty: YescanyouputsomestuffinthecomputerformepleaseidlikethatitdmakeitsomuchbetterandI’dbesohappy.

Me: Come again?

Shorty: Canyouputsomestuffinitplease

Me: That depends. What kind of stuff do you want put in it? 

Shorty: Whazzat *points at the drive*

Me: That’s a hard drive. It holds all your information.

Me: Okay, how big of a drive do you want?

Shorty: ThebiggestyouhaveIhavealotovideostheyneedalotofroomitsuckshavingsuchlittleroomIwantbiggerpleasedothat

*Half an hour later of him claiming to have everything from 3 GTX Titan cards and half the earth in his computer at home.*

Me: Yeah, we can do that too. Sign here and we’ll get that all taken care of for you. 

Shorty: Okaythanksbye

He swoops across the room and out the door.

He came back two times later that day. 

The first time he came back is was right before another customer came in. I knew I couldn’t make eye contact with the other customer. We’d both laugh, that’d be bad. 

The second time he came back Mr.Bossman was at the desk and I was in the back. Surprise, his computer at home had been stolen. My boss got a good 30 minute talk in with him. More of a 30 minute listen really. 

Now whenever we’re both in the back and the front door rings (sensor that makes noise when it opens) I whisper “He’s baaaaack.” poltergeist style. Mr.Bossman groans every time. 

He’s supposed to come back tomorrow to pick up his computer. I suspect he’s going to try to pay in drugs.

So as an engineering intern from Georgia Tech working in Claremont California, I was pretty excited to get to see the Pacific Ocean for the first time and see if the waters truly were colder on the West Coast. For the 4 weeks since arriving and starting my job in metro-LA I had hiked and explored the foothills a bit but still hadn't made it out to the beach. Once I started making a few friends, I had kept trying to see if I could organize a trip to the beach to no avail. Finally, fed up with all the cancellations, I headed out to Huntington Beach all by my lonesome. I rode the hour drive from Claremont to the beach rocking out to the country station with two books, a tube of sunscreen, a towel, a Tupperware filled with grapes and cheese to snack on the beach, a water bottle, and a grocery store plastic bag to wrap it all up in. After an enjoyable drive through the sun, I arrived at Huntington Beach and even managed to find parking on Beach Boulevard. I got out of my car, and made change with the help of a passerby out of the two bucks I had in my wallet. Depositing said two bucks into the meter by the big red truck I had driven up from Atlanta, I made my way to the beach, plastic bag in hand.

As I got to the beach, the familiar scents and sights of the Atlantic flashed into head as I gazed out onto the cresting waves of the Pacific. The taste of salt water filled the air and I hurriedly cast off my things, laid down my towel and made a B-line for the waves. I rushed into the arms of the Pacific, laughing as I tried to tackle the waves and not too taken aback by the only slightly chilly water. After minutes in the surf. I returned to my towel and snacked, watching the other beach goers reveling in the sand and surf. I finished my snack under the constant eyes of a sea gull hoping to grab a bite of my scraps. I stood and looked out at the sun setting into the sea and took obligatory pictures of the coastline for the family and friends back home, enjoying the pleasant decision I had made to go to the beach. Luckily enough for the gull, I had even accidentally dropped a grape into the sand, and the gull did his duty grabbing it with his beak and flying away with it.

As the sun set I figured that I would gather up my things and head to the Pier figuring I could get a great shot of the sun-setting from the Pier. I packed my things back into my bag taking special measure to load my phone, keys and wallet into the Tupperware I had brought so that they wouldn't get wet or sandy as I strode along the surf. The water was nice as a I walked along the shore gazing back and forth from the Ocean to the land. I quickly realized however that I had over packed my bag and it was beginning to tear. I suppose it was rather foolish of me to bring two books to the beach that I hadn't so much as opened. I adjusted to carry the bag rather than hold it from the weakening straps and continued towards the Pier. 

As I was two life guard stations from the Pier, the sun began to set. Figuring that I hadn't much time left, I exited the surf, crossed the beach and made my way to the paved bike/ pedestrian path that enclosed the beach. I stopped before end of the beach to snap a photo of the sunset in case the sun set vanished below the waves before I got to the end of the Pier. Re-placing my phone in the Tupperware, I jogged toward the Pier meeting the crowd that shared my interest with the sunset and the Pier. As I got halfway down the Pier I figured it was about time I pulled out my phone so I could prepare to snap the setting sun. It was then that I was driven frantic; for as I looked through the remnants of my grocery store bag, I realized that I only clutched two books and the Tupperware containing my phone, car keys, and wallet was no longer under my arms.

It came to me quickly that I had just lost the entirety of my life. Having had my phone moments before I raced back to the beach against the crowd frantically looking at the floor for my Tupperware. I had no luck as I made in down the pier and back to the path. I must have looked like a fool as I stood in the middle of the bike/pedestrian path muttering ""shit, shit, shit"" under my breathe. That's when a rather cute college aged blond walked up to me and asked me if I was alright.

Her name was K****** (stared out for her privacy). She wore a Sailor Moon sweatshirt over the bikini straps around her neck. I was thankful for the help and explained as my heart raced of how the entirety of my life was lost in a Tupperware and that I was searching for it. She smiled and me told me that she would help and asked me where I had seen it last. With her prompting I recalled the last photo I had taken at the beach and I figured that we could cover more ground if we split up. I asked her if she could search for my Tupperware from where I was standing to the middle of the Pier. I would then cover the ground between the path and the beach where I had taken the photo. She agreed and we decided to meet at the sign for Sandy's, a beach side restaurant off the Pier. Newly focused, we parted ways.

I retraced my steps to the beach with no luck keeping my eyes to the ground. I then headed up the beach to the green head life guard station to see if anyone had turned in my Tupperware. Again I was met with no luck. I wasn't surprised. It had been moments since I lost my Tupperware and the sun was still setting in the sky. As I made my way back to the sign for Sandy's, I contemplated the gravity of my situation. I didn't have keys to my car, nor the phone to call AAA to get that car opened, nor the license to drive said car to the apartment which I also lacked the keys to get into. As I meet K******, I had moved into despair. She had met with similar results in her search. Feeling guilty at wasting this cute girl's time I urged her to head home, thankful for the kindness of a stranger. I repeated her search of the Pier and again came up empty. Hopelessly I returned to the beach when I found the first sign of hope an empty water bottle, the same brand as I had brought.

Racing up the bike/ pedestrian path, I realized that during my first search I had searched the wrong entrance to the path. I had actually entered the path one stop further toward the Pier. There I found my next clue the Sunscreen tube that I had brought. Jogging up the beach I found the object of my quest, the Tupperware container resting on the sand. As I approached my Tupperware I rejoiced at the blinking blue light of my phone resting inside with my keys and wallet. I had been saved. Thanking the Lord, I returned to the life guards and informed them of my discovery. I was going to be okay, but I was still a little sad that I would probably never seen the girl that had thought to help a stranger.

As I thought about the finality of it all and that I would never see this girl again, I pulled my phone out and I kid you not started writing out a post for K****** in the /r/huntingtonbeach subreddit. As I struggled to mesh out what I wanted to say on the touchscreen keypad of my smart phone to thank this girl I looked up and you will never guess who was facetiming on the path in front of me. I exclaimed ""No way!"" and K****** turned around surprised to see me again and smiled as she saw the Tupperware I carried securely in my hand. 

We talked and laughed. I introduced myself formally and asked about her. Turns out she was on her Spring Break with her parents staying in a nearby hotel. She was studying Music, as a singer in a college that was close to where I was staying in Claremont. I thanked her from the bottom of my heart for the simple act of helping a stranger in need. We chatted for a couple minutes and she looked at her phone and said she had to go. It could have been her parents, or maybe an unmentioned boyfriend texting her. I never asked. The foolish me didn't ask for her number. 

I headed back towards my car kicking myself for not asking for her number when I should have. It had been an awesome day. I had truly had an adventure with all that comes with that. As I approached my truck I was also blessed to find my car without a ticket even though my meter had expired 40 minutes ago. As I drove home I realized that was the best two dollars I ever spent.

TL;DR: Spent $2 for parking to see the Pacific for the first time. Lose everything I own. Kind cute beach girl helps me search but then has to leave. I find everything I lost. Am sad about not getting to thank the kind girl. Run into the girl as writing a reddit post about her. Don't get girl's number."

I am saddened to say that things did not go too well in the last 4 days.  After reading your replies, I decided to have an honest talk with her and see how to deal with this unhappy phase in our friendship.  We met up for dinner yesterday at my house (husband was working all night at the ER).  I explained how she had changed a lot over the last 2 years and gave her the examples mentioned below and how rude her behavior has been.  She told me that she did not feel the need to ""treat me like a princess"" because my life was just fine, and that she was just being honest about how she felt. 

She also said that because our lives were so similar, she expected us to continue doing as well as each other.  But, all that has changed.  She said that she regrets her academic choice (despite having a phd, she works as a post doc and makes very little money), she regrets her decision to leave her ex, her subsequent hasty marriage and basically a bunch of other minor things.  She also dropped a couple bombshells on me; 1 - she asked her ex to take her back and she would divorce her husband and cut off contact with her family to be with him and he refused.  He has moved on and in dating someone else now, and is apparently really bitter at her for wasting 5 years of his life. 2 - She has accepted a research job at UIUC and will be moving to Chicago in May (we live on the east coast).  She is moving alone and has asked for a separation from her husband.  She said that she does want to be in touch with anyone from her old life anymore, including me, my husband, her ex, family and other friends, and possibly even her husband because she is pretty sure that she will eventually divorce him.

It was was crushing to hear that she didn't want me in her life anymore, but I wished her the best and suggested that she talk to a professional in Chicago, at least to sort out her feelings and get some support in a new city.  I said that while she can't change her past, she can fix whatever is in her power.  She can still easily go to med school (she has the grades to do it).  She may not get her ex back, but she can divorce her husband (since she clearly hates him) and find someone else who will make her happy.   I also told her that I am willing to support her fully as long as she respects me and my life choices.  I told her that her snarky comments will no longer be tolerated.  She didn't say anything to that.

In any case, I am secretly hoping that time and distance will help her heal and that we will eventually restablish some sort of friendship again.  But, for now, I really can't do much else.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Hi everyone,

I have been struggling with my friend lately.  I don't know what to do and any advice is appreciated.

I am going to provide a detailed background because I feel like it is explains this transformation.  My friend and I have been very close friends from high school.  We went to the same college, same major, roommates throughout, even exact same internships!  I consider her to be my closest friend and confidante.  However, lately she has changed a lot and has become crazy materialistic! She judges everyone based on their possessions and it baffles me because she used to be the nicest, non-judgmental girl ever.

I feel like this has something to do with what happened with our love lives.  I am Indian and she is white.  Funnily, I dated a white guy and she dated an Indian guy throughout college.  All of us were biomed engineering majors in undergrad.  I, my bf and her bf went on to med school while she got a phd in Immunology.

Things went south (for her) when our bf's proposed around the same time 2 years ago.  My Indian parents were vehemently opposed to my white fiance, while her conservative, christian (super religious), southern parents were also opposed to her Indian bf.  However, I refused to back down and got married to my fiance.  But, my friend gave into her parents' pressure and left her bf and got engaged just 6 months later to a christian guy that her parents set her up with.  She has regretted it ever since.  She is miserable in her marriage, and regrets leaving her ex.

Ever since she got engaged to the new guy, she has become insanely obsessed with stuff.  I shrugged it off until she started insulting me and my choices because she ""it looks cheap/poor.""  For example, I decided not to have a wedding registry because well, I don't need stuff! I asked friends and family to forego gifts entirely, but if anyone felt the need to still get us something, donate to the local humane society instead.  My friend sent me nasty email that I ""ruined"" my wedding and that ""I look so cheap and all our friends are embarrassed by us."" wtf? 

M husband and I also recently bought a 3 bed/2 bath home and when she visited us, she said ""I feel so claustrophobic in this tiny house, I need to go out.""  I was stunned.  It was so rude and out of character for her.  My husband and I are very lucky to have great jobs, but we have seen so many rich doctors struggle because they are always keeping up with the Joneses.  Our plan is to lessen our stress and live a nice, not lavish life.  My friend has bitched about the size of my engagement ring, wedding festivities, even our ""low brow"" honeymoon because we went to Sri Lanka.  She said its gross that we went to a third world country and not to Europe or something.

Her husband recently confided in me that they are in serious debt because he of her new-found love of fancy homes, cars, clothes and vacations.  My friend is just getting worse and I have started avoiding her lately.  I tried talking to her about her behavior and she lashed out at me, and walked away.

I am at a loss here.  I really feel for her because I know how rough it was for both of us to get our families to accept our bf's.  I can't imagine how upset she must be.  I feel that she is acting this way to compensate for her shitty marriage.  I don't want to lose my oldest and until recently, my closest friend.  But, I am sick of hearing her judge the hell out of everyone, including me.  Should I tell her to see a therapist?  Should I just avoid her until she gets the point?  Ugh, I feel so helpless here.  I try to talk to her, but she has started shutting me out too.

**tl;dr**: Friend has turned materialistic and judgmental, I fear it may be because of her past decision to leave her fiance."

I'm interested in rehabilitation technologies and brain-computer interfaces, and related avenues of research in the biomedical field. Another field I'm interested in pursuing professionally is the development of internet-based, universally accessible education. *To summarize, it is important to me to help people get the most out of life by overcoming traditional constraints.*

**Summary**

I entered my master's degree following a couple years of working in the field. My degree is in Neural Systems and Computation at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zürich, Europe's top university for the sciences. I will graduate and move back to the States this summer, preferably to Chicago or Minneapolis.

My master's thesis brought together signal processing, machine learning, statistics, information theory, and neural imaging. Most of my data analysis experience is with time series.

Work experience includes machine shop fabrication, design and assembly of basic circuits, training non-human primates in socialization and complex experimental tasks, maintaining animal medical records to strict compliance standards, and basic wet lab microfabrication. Computer skills include basic Photoshop, Illustrator, and Dreamweaver; some Maple work; and significant MATLAB experience.

**Recent Background**

1zybud,26,2014-03-09,Financial tips for a (soon to be) college grad?,ClumsyMatt,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1zybud/financial_tips_for_a_soon_to_be_college_grad/,"Hey everyone,

So this is my first time posting here, but I think I need some advice. For most of my life I think I have lived in something of a ""bubble"" shielded from a lot of financial worry (and responsibility) that perhaps I should have been exposed to during my life. For that reason I am starting the long journey of educating myself on what I need to do, what I should expect, and what sort of necessary things I should do to be financially responsible. Some things about me.



* Though it's not guaranteed, Very likely my engineering internship will turn into a job to the tune of somewhere around **45k - 55k** around the time I graduate.

* I live in SoCal in the Orange County area and will be looking for an apartment. Some of the most important advice I am seeking is what sort of living residence I should seek (apartment, condo, or other) and what prices should I expect. It's important I remain here as my job is also here.

* What should I be doing with my money and how much should I be saving. What should I do with my saving; putting it simply into a savings account or what else.

* I am actually a very, very lucky individual and I believe I will be graduating with minimal college loans to repay. I am very blessed to have parents who set aside money for my college education early in my life.



I'm sorry I know these are broad questions. I am a little scared of the real world but hopefully someone can help me out. Thank you.

1zypcw,6,2014-03-09,Question about what you fine folks think is fair when hiring a new assistant/intern/trainee? (sorry for the length),throwawayemployer1,unitedkingdom,https://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/1zypcw/question_about_what_you_fine_folks_think_is_fair/,"Good afternoon to all the /r/uk redditors!

Apologies in advance for the use of a throwaway. and sorry for the length of the post. 

Essentially i'm just wondering about the general feelings toward the hiring of unpaid interns/trainee for a set period (say 3months) after which there will be a job if the applicant has shown to be successful in the role. 


In a little more detail i've started a trading company in the UK operating within the sector within which i have built my career. I wish/need to take on an assistant to primarily man the phone but also do alot of lead generation and other sales pipeline related tasks. Ideally i'll train them for 3 months and watch them work and if they have brought me just a single deal from their work then i'll consider that a success and take them on permanently. 


My question relates to the individuals remuneration during that probationary trial period. 

I know legally i don't have to pay them anything during the trial period and alot of my peers are advising me to take someone on for no pay for 3 months to see how they perform. However i have a personal issue with that and would at the very least like to pay a cost of living package or something of the such.

Also to mention, that they will during the trial period be entitled to commission on any deal they do bring me, and the smallest commission they could earn (from the smallest deal i can do) would be around 4k. This is the reason why some of my peers are advising me to take someone on a commission only basis and then if they don't bring me anything and are thus unsuccessful in the role then i won't have lost anything. This is seemingly both simultaneously reasonable and unreasonable.


My questions are thus:

Should i focus on my businesses expenditure and hire someone on a commission only basis during the trial and help them out with only work related expenses (travel to and from etc)?

My heart says that in an ideal world i'd like to take someone on that's been unemployed for a while and i know then that if i don't pay anything that'll be pretty much impossible with all the issues with JSA etc. And it's exactly those issues that i wouldn't want my staff to have (time between getting last jsa and first pay etc/bills during that period). In this instance i would like to offer to cover their cost of living in total (within reason, but covering rent/food/transpo/other bills, up to maybe 800-1000 per month)
 Is that fair or is that putting too much faith in someone who is for all intents untested in a field that very few in this country have any experience within? 

Finally, given as this is mainly to gauge peoples opinions on the subject, what would/did any of you do in a similar situation and how did it pan out? 



tldr: I'm hiring first staff member for a new business, unsure as to how/if to pay them during probationary period as just because i *can* not pay them doesn't mean i should expect someone to work for free right? 


edit: Ok i understand many of you are saying it would be illegal to hire an intern and then make them do actual work. Before any more tell me to contact a lawyer, i have and he's essentially told me that there are (unfortunately) many loop holes to achieve what i set out. I have however unequivocally stated that i would be unhappy doing so and would at the least like to pay someone sufficiently for them to live, eat and enjoy a little. The problem is that larger companies routinely take advantage of every single one of these loopholes and are thus playing on an uneven playing field compared to small businesses. 


edit2: Think i've come to some conclusions from your responses. 

Firstly i'll advertise the job with the salary that the role will come with (25-30k base) and stipulate that the probationary period will be @nmw. Commissions will be active from the start too and i'll offer equity as a bonus structure within the first year to enable them to work toward part ownership of the business too. I really really want to hire someone who within a relatively short time will feel as invested as me in the business and really feel like it's theirs as well. 

All the conditions under which they will be measured during their probationary period will be set out clearly in their contract as will the quantifiable standards i expect. 

My only major concern now is that should i hire someone that has been on jsa for some time, they may have financial issues within the first month between the date they got their last jsa payment and when they get paid by myself. As i'm paying NMW which will have other associated costs as well it'll make me less able to help out with any financial difficulties they may have during that period.

I fear this will jeopardize my relationship with my SO [22 M].",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1zz67n/i24_mf_suffer_from_anxiety_jaleousy_and_trust/,"*Edit: I mis-worded the title. I'm 24,F. Not M/F. Sorry.

I have always been a little jaleous/anxious about my relationship. We have been together for 6 years now, and have been living together for about 3 years. There were few issues in the relationship as it was, then. 


Recently, though, he went to Malta for an internship and he will return in May. This is were the problems started. 


We had plans to Skype frequently, to play Minecraft together a lot, to watch shows together. You get it: basically the whole romantic long-distance stuff. To put it short: none of this worked out, and we now Skype for a maximum of 2 hours every week. He doesn't want to spend time at a computer longer than necessary, and is always spending his evenings with the girls from the apartment upstairs. Even when we're on Skype, he's frequently doing other stuff on the PC. I have learned to cope with this and to cherish the time that I do have with him. I send him a little e-mail every evening with a line or two, describing a time where he made me laugh. The response, however, is zero. We do chat about random stuff during the day with Viber, but I do feel a little neglected. 


Recently, his Facebook was hacked while he was at work. He couldn't find where the security feature was where you can see what sessions are active on your Facebook, and so I started up his desktop, checked his sessions, and de-activated the one running that was fishy. He changed his password, which was saved by a plug-in active in Chrome, so his Facebook could still be accessed via his desktop. This is where real trouble began, for me. 


As I wanted to close Facebook, I spotted a message from AwesomeCutie, a girl from the apartment upstairs. As we don't have secrets in our relationship, I clicked it because I was curious. (Yes, this is wrong). To summarize: they were being kind of close. He was even flirty. I felt uncomfortable and told him so. He told me I was reading too much into it, that nothing was going on, and that he loved only me. 


It should've been finished then, but it wasn't. Due to other circumstances, I felt compelled to read more. Every evening I would log into his Facebook and read the messages to, and from, AwesomeCutie. Mostly they were harmless, but it did turn out that he was frequently on Skype with me, while messaging her about watching Sherlock/Doctor Who when we finished Skype, and about how he liked her company and such. I felt horrible. Even if I felt all right after leaving Skype, I'd quickly be stripped from all romantic feelings after I'd read the messages. He didn't like Skyping with me, and made it clear. He often cut conversations with me short ""because he had to go cook"", and then messaged her to come down and/or to watch movies. As my jaleousy reached an all-time high and I was nearly certain it was just him &amp; her, I asked him for a group-picture as he told me they would always watch series/movies ""with the whole group"". I did get one, and my nerves were reassured. 


Now, whenever I brought AwesomeCutie up, he'd mention that she was really close with his roommate. In fact, he said they were actually moving towards a relationship. But still, nagging doubts remained. 


During this week, I had to watch his mother's house as she was on holiday. As such, I didn't have access to his desktop. I felt way better about my relationship that way, broke down on Friday, and told him about my snooping. I asked him to turn off the plug-in, so I couldn't snoop anymore. He wasn't angry, just disappointed in me and my lack of trust. He said he'd changed some things so I couldn't snoop any more, and that there was nothing I wasn't allowed to see, but that still he felt like he wanted some privacy. I totally understand this and I feel really bad. Even though nothing really happened to worsen our situation as it is now, I feel like my relationship is at stake. And that's the heart of the issue: whenever something ""bad"" happens, I immediatly feel threatened. I'm constantly scared that he'll find someone better than me. In fact, I'm pretty sure AwesomeCutie is better than me. And it feels horrible. 


There is a lot more to this story, such as him forgetting me while out with ""the group"", and him completely forgetting Skype-dates, causing me to wait for hours, without a word from him. This caused me to feel horrible, even though I understand that time, for him, passes completely different. Waiting two hours is torture, but those same two hours are just a blink of an eye to him. 


Further relevant background: I have anxiety issues due to my family-history (verbal and physical violence, an extremely sheltered childhood, yadayada) and I was raped a few years ago with infrequent panic attacks as a result. 


Now, Reddit, what I'm trying to ask is this: I need strategies and advice. I don't want to feel so anxious all the time. I don't want to feel jaleous. I don't want to violate his privacy, only to make myself feel worse. I need healthier strategies to cope with his temporary absense. If any of you have any experience or advice on this topic, I'd welcome it greatly. 


---   
**tl;dr**: I snooped, found stuff I didn't like, but it's mostly my fault for reading too much into it. I'm overly worried, anxious and often feel depressed and overly sad. I'm being a controlling and overly invading girlfriend, even though I actively try not to. Help me find strategies to counter this behaviour - please. "

I can't apply this year, as the deadline has already passed for applications. So, that being said I have a free year as of now up until September 2015. Unlike most of my peers, I don't want to go for an apprenticeship as I feel that would be a waste of my time. 

I have good skills in Python, C and Java -- most of my classmates haven't written a line of code since the start of the course. I also have a good understanding of algorithms, big O notation and some other mathematical aspects of programming.

I have applied for a few companies, who have said that my skills are fantastic however they would not consider me because they aren't taking ""juniors"". This is down to the assumptions they have about the course I have taken, skills and portfolio aside.

My ideal job is for a big 4 technology company, but I do not expect them to consider me as I do not have a degree nor do I feel adequate for that kind of position right now. An apprenticeship wouldn't help me progress to this stage, so I'd say the best choice for me right now would be an undergraduate-equivalent internship.

Does anyone have any advice on this kind of situation?"

1zzc95,22,2014-03-09,[DECK] Jinteki Sundew Nonsense,Bwob,Netrunner,https://www.reddit.com/r/Netrunner/comments/1zzc95/deck_jinteki_sundew_nonsense/,"Just finished our local Store Championship. (32+ people, whew!)  My runner lost a lot, but my corp deck was able to carry me pretty hard, going undefeated the entire day, (6 games) until it finally lost in the semifinals to the store champion.

Anyway, I wanted to post it here because it's a somewhat unusual deck to have in a competitive event, and it's a theme I know a lot of people have been starting to play around with.  So here is my take on it:  Replicating Perfection nonsense.

Questions, comments and suggestions are all welcome! Hopefully this is interesting and/or useful to other people working on RP decks!


**Deck Overview**

The goal of this deck is to be taxing, and leverage RP's incredible corp ability to tax the runner as much as possible.  The runner is going to get a full breaker suite out eventually, so my goal is to plan for that eventuality: They'll be able to get in anywhere as long as they have the money, so my goal is to make that as expensive as possible.

Since they have to run on a central server before checking my remotes, I make sure that (almost!) all the ice is painful to bump into, as well as ETR.  That way they can't just make a run on a central and bounce off of some harmless wall before going after my agendas/assets.  They have to break a subroutine, or else they're losing clicks/taking net damage/whatever.  That costs them money.

This deck is really fighting an economic battle.  Not all of it is obviously econ, but at the end of the day, it all is.  I almost always get more money than the runner.  Even criminals.  People laugh at my econ assets.  When I've tried to describe this deck, they say things like ""what they didn't trash your sundew?  They left your pad campaign alone? You must be playing noobs!""  The thing is, though, the runner has to make a choice:  Let me become super rich, or become poor trying to stop me.  Trashing a sundew is a good goal, but if it costs them 8 credits to do (break a central subroutine, break the ice on the sundew, pay the trash cost) then that's going to sting.  And I'll respond by either installing another sundew, or using the fact that they're broke to score an agenda.

**Specific Cards/Plays**

* **Nisei Mk 2:** This card is incredible.  It's basically my version of an astroscript token: Once I get one Nisei scored, my chances of winning go up dramatically, since I can almost always turn it into another scored agenda, and can chain them together.  The runner's reaction window is already low: Because of the RP identity, when an agenda hits the table, they have at most 2 clicks to prepare before they have to start running on a remote.  Nisei tokens mean that they have only ONE click to prepare, AND they have to prepare harder, since they'll end up having to pay for all the remote's ice twice.  Brutal stuff.

* **False Leads:** The forfeit-ability on it works really well with RP.  It's a low-risk agenda I can occasionally get away with installing naked (since it looks like a pad campaign, etc) and if I DO score it, I can almost always use it to score a Nisei.  (Sacrificing it in the process, but that's still an upgrade of 1 point, and I get a nisei token out of the deal...)

* **Interns:** I originally put these guys in just for instantly reviving trashed sundews.  And, to be fair, I still use them for that a lot. (Very little is as annoying for the runner as spending 8 credits to trash a sundew, only to have it come back immediately.)  But I've found them to be far more versitile than I expected.  I've also found myself using them to rescue agendas that have been milled by Noise, and to reinstall ice that died to parasite.  They're a surprisingly good card.

* **Aggressive Secretaries:** My one trap.  Everyone expects Jinteki to play the damage traps.  People draw their hand up and run, figuring ""eh, if that's a junebug, I can soak the damage.""  People are sad when their rig gets trashed.  Also, unlike junebug, Aggressive Secretaries are pretty nasty even if they only have one advancement counter on them.  Sure, there are lots of ways to get programs back.  But you still usually have to pay for them.  This is basically an economic trap - it will cost them their most expensive programs, and usually open up a scoring window for me to try to push an agenda through.

* **Corporate Troubleshooter:** I love this guy.  So much.  He is a really phenomenal card.  He works well for a couple of reasons:  First - since he makes ice stronger for the rest of the TURN rather than the rest of the run, he is a good way to protect an agenda for a turn, if I'm ahead on money.  (He can often guarantee a score by himself.)  But second, he combos really well with Rototurret.  Yes, I know Archer is a scarrier combo.  I don't have archer.  He still works with rototurret.  (Especially with all the people I see playing Mimics these days.)  And if I can trash a program, I can usually buy myself at least enough time to score out an agenda.

* **Misc Ice:** Tsurugi is amazing.  Yes, it dies to parasite.  That's ok.  If they don't parasite it, it still costs a minimum of 4 to break for every sentry-killer in the game.  (Except Faerie, but that's not something they can do repeatedly.)  Himitsu-Bako is just there to be a cheap wall to force breaker checks.  It's the only ice I have that doesn't hurt to touch, so usually it ends up guarding a remote.  Swordsman is the only non-ETR ice in the deck, so usually it ends up on a central. Often I just throw it onto archives, so they can't bounce off of archives for free.  Unless they are using AI breakers anyway.  In which case it becomes a brutal program trasher instead.

This costs me approximately $75-100/wk in gas. It's in a small town, outside of where I live, so public transportation or ride-shares are not an option.

I worked with them as an intern for several months, and was thrilled when they offered me a permanent position, however it was drastically under what I was expecting, wage-wise ($13/hr). I took it because I love the job, and I hadn't really planned for other options at the time.

Now a year later I'm torn. For the most part, I really do enjoy my job because of the people I work with, however, while I can receive wage raises (I haven't yet) there is no room for vertical movement within the company at all. The thing about this is that this company is quickly growing with regards to popularity within not only the community, but the country, and it's always seen as a highly sought-after place of work. When people leave the company, others (within the company) look at them with these alien eyes, not understanding why someone would want to leave a company that hundreds are begging to work for. In all fairness it's a great company, with great people, and great perks.

That being said, the wear and tear on my car is crazy, I've put so much into it and it isn't going to be easier, putting almost 1000k on it a week. I have large amounts of debt I have a very hard time paying down, and absolutely no savings. My credit is awful because I can't pay my debt, and I'm starting to look at my life and realize that I'm 26, my boyfriend and I can't afford to get married, buy a house, and start a family like I'm so desperately starting to desire, because we simply don't live that lifestyle to support it. We can only afford to travel home to visit family once a year, and even that is a financial stress.

Moving closer to work isn't an option because my boyfriend works in town and makes more money than I do (and because of past situations, understandingly really isn't wanting to move to where I work).

It seems pretty cut and dry, but so many people talk about the experience and accolades I am getting from this job. The perks and such, which is why I feel so hesitant to leave. It is a big deal (apparently) getting a job at my company, so I feel a fool to leave. They say I'm 25 and have plenty of time to work boring better paying jobs, and I deserve to have the fun and perks of the cool job I'm at now. I'm also worried because I cover for and help with a lot of different jobs within my company (events, social media, etc.) and I just have a giant phobia of letting people down, or walking away from an amazing opportunity. How do you walk away from a dream job saying ""I can't afford to work here""?

I'm afraid if I start looking for jobs and have to take days off for interviews, I'll be caught on to, and I'll be left with now job. Not to mention  I'm scared my skills aren't desirable enough to be hired... Maybe I'm just over paranoid?

I enjoy my job, but I can't enjoy life outside my job because I can't afford to.

Should I just finance better, live leaner and enjoy the perks of what I have now? Or should I move on, and leave everyone's ""dream job"" for greener pastures/bankaccounts?"

Since BTC-China has opened the doors to Litecoin, they also have a large challenge for the community. BTC-China is doing matching donations up with 1000 LTC directed towards the developers fund. We need to support this effort in order to pay for the developers work this year. There are many things that they are working on right now, but without the help from the community they can not make it possible. Please open up your wallets and help out, if everyone here on r/litecoin donates just .05 LTC, we would reach that goal! As of this thread, we have raised 335 LTC (1/3 of the way there!).


Here is the official thread from Bobby Lee, CEO of BTC-China

This thread is also officially the next charity sponsored by the Litecoin community projects (previously worked on the Go Vap Orphanage and the Eden project).

If you are interested in helping out more, please visit the official Litecoin Community Projects forum! https://litecointalk.org/index.php?board=89.0



Thank you everyone! :)


EDIT: March 16th,  We have reached the 1/2 way point, good job everyone and thank you for your generosity!



EDIT: April 1st, 23 days after posting we have MATCHED our goal of 1,000 LTC! Very special thanks to toddamun, who donated 335 LTC today to complete this!

Message from Warren here (Lead LTC dev):

Wow!  Thanks to toddamun and the entire community for making this matching challenge a success in a relatively short amount of time.  This substantially boosts the ability to fund new developers to join us during 2014.

In other news ...

* Electrum development is now underway.  We now have a competent developer that you all know working on it.

* Please make small donations to the Website and Client Documentation Dev Fund.  Our intern quit her other job as of today in order to focus more time on this.  It would really help her a lot if this fund were to slowly grow to encourage her work.

1zzpp2,10,2014-03-09,Please help! My 7-year old adopted daughter (also my niece) has RAD and its making me a more horrible person. What can I do?,trueslicky,Adoption,https://www.reddit.com/r/Adoption/comments/1zzpp2/please_help_my_7year_old_adopted_daughter_also_my/,"How to avoid tl;dr and provide an insightful piece while so incredibly emotionally drained?

My wife's sister took her own life when my niece was just shy of 2 years old. She was an emotionally unavailable mother--which I guess should be obvious if she had intense depression to the point where she took her own life. She would sleep on the couch while my niece begged for attention, or go outside to smoke as my niece pounded on the sliding glass door. When she was screaming at night an unable to go to sleep, it was me or my wife--both of us grad students at the time--who would pick her up to console her. Months after my wife and I were married, my sister-and-law moved across country to live with us with both my niece and nephew, who had a different father. (My niece's father is an ex-con who was in jail at the time of the suicide &amp; adoption process.) My niece had her 1st birthday at our place with her mother and brother. For her second birthday, she spent it with just me and my wife.

The adoption finalized when she was two-and-a-half. Its now five years later and she has been diagnosed with both RAD and ODD. We've been seeing a therapist for her even before the adoption was finalized, but still living in our house and would frequently break out into full-blown tantrums that couldn't be stopped, resulting in things being thrown, destruction, etc. After a couple of years, the therapist suggested that someone else might have more of an impact. So we've been seeing an LCMSW for the past couple of years, and if anything the behavior has simply gotten worse and escalated. Her room has holes in the wall, showing marks of destruction. If they are fixed, they become broken shortly after. This morning she ripped a hole in her screen window for no other reason because she was meaning mean to her little sister, and I told her she needed to go to her room while she was unfriendly before going to see a movie, which was our plans for the day.

(Yes, she has a three-year old non-adopted sister who is showing negative signs of internalize the relationship with 'Sissy,' as she expects all interactions to eventually be antagonistic. If anyone at my younger daughter's preschool says a contradictory comment, she explodes into fighting, argumentative stance as she immediately assumes her friend is trying to be mean to her. This morning she kept saying to Sissy, ""You're my friend. Why are you pushing me? Why won't you hug me?"" She has recently begun picking at her fingers non-stop resulting in bleeding and other injuries.)

Now that she has gotten older, the tantrums and acting out by my 7-year old has gotten more and more abusive, both physically and verbally. Over the past week, I've had my face clawed, my wife pushed and hit, both of us kicked in the face. We've never hidden her adoption, telling her that she ""has two mommies, one was just sick and died."" Its impossible to drive around without exploding at her, because she constantly kicks the back of the drivers seat, or sticks her legs or head onto her sister resulting in screaming matches--a driving experience that is distracting and unsafe, to say the least. She tells us that she hates us because my wife isn't her real mommy, and we're just mean to her. (Because this weekend we bought her a doughnut, a cupcake, took her to two birthday parties, and also a movie. Clearly, we are just such mean parents!)

At the time of suicide and adoption, I expressed concerns because I wasn't sure if we were in a position to being able to provide what I clearly recognized she needed. As we were both finishing grad school, our time to provide undivided attention to her was incredibly limited, and I feel guilty about that now as I did then. But post-grad school, its not as if time has magically made itself available. I was laid off from my last full-time job with benefits in the spring of 2009. Its been five years of continual job search, complete with low-paying internships, temp jobs, Americorps service with its $1000/mo. ""stipend,"" or ""incredible volunteer opportunities that could result in employment"" yet never, ever do. The results of all these efforts is the continued experience of being told just how impressive a candidate I am, how much they really like me, how they wish there were two jobs available, but there isn't and they're going with somebody else. My wife is nearing the completion of her PhD, so her time is pretty much naught. If it wasn't for the various subsidies we receive, we'd be homeless or living in a Section 8 apartment with a two-hour commute each day. Currently I'm at a temp job where I have to get up in the middle of the night to arrive to work at 5:30 and work until 2. I've pretty much been pulling 19-20 hour days for a couple weeks now. My nerves are fried, I'm emotionally raw, I can't respond well to the coping strategies we have developed, and I just don't understand how all of my efforts to do the ""right"" thing and be good to my family and otehrs has resulted in such a shit hole of a miserable life.

(Get a college degree, they said. Get married, they said. Married &amp; educate couples earn a much higher salary than single people with lower levels of education, they said. Oh, if only that was true!)

All of these experiences over the past five or so years has made me simply a more horrible person. As described above, I'm bitter, pissed off, cynical, pessimistic. Recently, I imagine committing acts of violence, and it makes me feel like a monster--I have never, ever felt that way ever before and its scaring me. After years of trying to make things better and nothing changes, does it eventually come to a point where it doesn't make sense to keep trying any more? Both my wife and I have been seeing a therapist, I've been seeing mind for nearly four years and she's been seeing hers for much longer. My 7-year old's counselor has reached the end of her rope. She has treated kids with similar issues, and they've all responded favorably to her treatment. Ours is the first she's had that doesn't, lucky us. Under her suggestions, we've finally met with a psychiatrist last week for a full-on diagnosis and will begin exploration into the County's mental health options next week.

But if these options don't lead to anything, I don't know what to do. I'm at my wits end. I've done nothing but sob all morning and I haven't done that in years. Does it ever get any better?"

1zzv6y,1,2014-03-09,Me [21 M] with my [21 F] girlfriend of 4 years. It has been really hard on us lately and I've yelled at her a few times. Now I feel like an asshole. Does she deserve to forgive me?,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1zzv6y/me_21_m_with_my_21_f_girlfriend_of_4_years_it_has/,"Me and my girlfriends relationship is normally really good. We get on each others nerves occasionally, but we sort it out right away and without hard feelings.

Recently though due to life and stuff its been very stressful and hard for both of us.

I started a new full time internship that's stressful, a couple things are happening at home with me, she's going to school full time. She is having a lot of problems at home with her family, and we both have anxiety problems so the stress from all this gets on our nerves and makes us wound up and irrational.

Instead of keeping our distance when stressed we have been trying to support each other by being around each other, sometimes it goes well, and other times it doesn't.

This has been going on since the middle of January.

A couple times since then she has gotten on my nerves enough that I just started yelling about it. I realize its bad but it just happens so fast when I'm pushed to a certain point I can't control it. I'm just too stressed to not just release what I have been feeling all day about a problem or something that she is doing that is irritating me.

I don't call her names, degrade her, or otherwise insult her. I just vent all my frustration about the situation by yelling because I can't keep my calm anymore to try to talk civilly when I already have.

I just feel like a complete asshole right now because I told myself last week I would try hard to consciously not let this happen, and I have been trying.

But yesterday when I was out with a couple friends all night I kept getting text messages from her, and I ignored them because I was at dinner, I felt I was getting a couple phones calls consistently throughout the night. When dinner was over I checked my messages and she was freaking out about a problem and was upset I'm just ignoring her. I was upset because we had already discussed said problem and discusses how the night was going to go and that I would see her after the dinner and I would really like to just enjoy my time.

I was really upset after dinner and when I was outside I phone her back and yelled and started crying about how I was really upset and I just wanted to enjoy myself without feeling like I'm always doing something wrong.

How many slip ups while trying to work on it do I get before I just become an eternal douche bag and asshole.

I apologize to her every time and we have no intention of breaking up. She understands how hard it is for both of us, she wants me to stop yelling, but understands how its stressful for me especially when she is causing a lot of it for me with her anxiety problems.

I'm not usually like this, I'm usually very calm and relaxed and willing to talk things out. Its only when my stress and anxiety levels go up to the extreme.

I just feel like she doesn't deserve me and I'm just a complete asshole, I get scared that I just don't deserve anyone in life when I act like this and I should just break up with her because she doesn't deserve to be treated like this.

I told her I would rather just leave her be when I feel anxious so this never happens, but she insists its OK and knows if she's around she can calm me down and it'll make me better to talk to someone about it.

I'm so thankful she is understanding, but I still feel like an asshole, especially when I know she's the only one I would yell at because she's the only one I totally feel comfortable around. Its happened a few more times than I would allow myself to.

I get scared if other people knew I did this, and my friend has seen me once, that I'm going to be universally hated.

I don't want to abuse her, I try to stay away when I'm like that, but she insists I talk to her instead of avoid her.

I only yell at her because I care so much about her and I try so hard to make everything perfect for us. I yell when I feel like I've done everything physically I can do to make it perfect and its still not enough. This frustrates me, and thus I yell.

-----

tl;dr: Its been a really rough time for me and my girlfriend recently, we are both extremely stressed and anxious, a couple times when my stress level is high and she sets me off I start yelling. This isn't usually me, and I feel like a complete asshole. She forgives me, but I just feel like I don't deserve any more chances. I feel like I should break it off so she's not stuck with an asshole."
1zzznh,189,2014-03-09,"What is privilege, and more importantly, what is the opposite of ""privilege""? Help me understand this concept.",yumchaaaa,TrueAskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAskReddit/comments/1zzznh/what_is_privilege_and_more_importantly_what_is/,"I saw this comment on an [AskReddit thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1zyn3x/waiters_of_reddit_what_fucked_up_shit_have_you/) about weird conversations restaurant staff overhear, and it got me thinking. 

&gt;A complete lack of understanding from a privileged person:
I worked at a popular restaurant chain ... [A wife and husband] are sitting there eating and the wife says to the husband ""I don't understand what you mean by ""living paycheck to paycheck"". He explains to her what ""living paycheck to paycheck"" actually means in a very respective and unbiased fashion. She STILL doesn't get it. She questions WHY these people don't have any money leftover after they pay their bills and why they don't just ""change that"". Or why their bills are so high. Or why they don't just make more money....You could literally see the confusion on her face. It gave me a new perspective on things.

I saw more in common between myself and the wife in this situation than I'd care to admit. I come from a pretty sheltered background, I suppose, but I never realized that until I got to university. I grew up in a relatively wealthy area, one of the top-10 earning towns of the United States that is constantly on the ""most expensive suburbs"" list. All of my friends were at the same school, so my social life was pretty centered on that place. Sure, I knew other people weren't as well off as we were, but to me, this life was all I had ever known and my parents never implied we were anything out of the ordinary. I don't really know, I just didn't see us as big spenders. My father worked his way up and now makes around $300,000 USD (give or take 50k.. not sure of the specifics) a year. My current part time job pays $20/hour. International holidays are a yearly occurrence (e.g. I'm going to England in a bit to visit friends, we'll probably go to a tropical place later in the year.).. etc. I legitimately thought everyone did this until I was 15 or so. At first I would question if we could afford these things, but my parents always assured me that we had more than enough.

So it was definitely a shock to get to university and realize the majority of students were on massive loans (my parents paid cash for my education) and were severely restricted in terms of spending habits. For comparison, I was under the impression Whole Foods and Trader Joe's were normal places to get groceries, and that no one ever really went to the dollar store type places or bought off-brand items. I'm usually the one hosting gatherings because I don't care if people take my alcohol or weed.. I can always buy more, whereas it seems like other people are a lot more possessive about that.

Don't get me wrong, I've worked hard for my grades, volunteered, and led student organizations, had good internships, etc, throughout my entire student life, but I realize I was able to do these things because I had few major obstacles along the way, for example, no material limits on money, stable home environment, etc.

I guess what I'm looking for is a MASSIVE AMOUNT OF PERSPECTIVE from anyone who has not had this kind of upbringing! I *know* I have a shitload to learn, and I don't want to fall victim to this ""affluenza"" stereotype, so I'm looking to anyone here that can help with their own experience or point me in the right direction for further research. **If all I have known my whole life is what some could consider ""privilege"" (I'm not even really sure what that means, though), then what is the opposite of it??**

Thanks, everyone, for your input in advance. Sorry this post is so long. I tried to be comprehensive, but if you'd like any more info don't hesitate to ask. Cheers :)

So I dropped a post in this subreddit about a month ago about finding internships, and I received some awesome responses. 

As it turns out, I recently received an offer from a engineering consulting company out of dallas, tx! It is sort of what I am interested in, I would be kind of an assistant to an EE who's designing electrical systems for things like office buildings, housing complexes, etc. They even offer a stipend for housing/transportation, because they know I would have to relocate from California.

The problem is, in the offer they said they want a yes/no by March 17th, and I am still waiting to hear back from interviews (on-site with agilent) and applications that I think just haven't been evaluated yet.

I'm not against moving to Dallas for the summer, but obviously its not ideal. I'd prefer to work up in the Bay Area, since my family/friends are located there, and I could live at home for free. 

How should I go about making this decision? Because if I take the offer, I might miss a potential opportunity in the Bay. However if I don't take it, I could possibly not get another offer altogether.


Follow-up question about negotiating: Since I have this offer, and am waiting to hear back on a decision from Agilent for a co-op, should I email them [Agilent] and mention that I have another offer and need to hear back from them sometime next week? Or is this too much ""playing hardball"", as they say. Or, could I ask for more time on my decision from this dallas company? 

Thanks in advance for any advice you may have!"

I moved out of my parents house to pursue a career goal; uprooting to a new city and transferring my job. Things were pretty rough for a while. I got hurt on my first day of class, which delayed the start at my new workplace. 

When I finally started, the hours I was told I would get seemed not to be there. I was contemplating looking for different work. Thankfully, a new position opened up and I got more than enough hours after that. 

After taking two classes and continuing my internship, I came to a hard realization: I didn't enjoy the career goal I was working towards. Nearly every person I told told me to keep going, but in my heart of hearts I just couldn't do it anymore. The work bored me and it was making me feel down. 

 I got back together with my ex after she contacted me. Then we broke up. Then we got back together. It was good for a while, then things deteriorated to the point where I lost interest and she was fed up with me. It does officially feel over now.

So, I'm still working a lot and feeling things out. Lately, I've been getting out of the house more often and going to local places that I have been curious about. Did the bar thing a few times and brought a sketch pad along to ease me out of my comfort zone. It's nice to have the feeling that I'm actually *living* for once. Not merely subsisting. 

I'm still lonely. It helps that I'm living with my best friend. My social circle is very limited beyond that. Although I do have at least one friend I can get into contact with... and I have a number from a guy I chatted up at the bar too.

 There's a lot of things I want to do yet and I feel pretty motivated to chisel away at them. I'm also working on being easier on myself in general. That is difficult to do, but it's healthier. Rather than beat myself up for not working towards something, I have just set minor goals. Some days have been 'wasted' lounging around watching tv. I have to remind myself that that's ok to do once in a while. 

All-in-all, things are not bad right now. I'm very happy with myself that I truly tested my boundaries and figured some stuff out. It's a work in progress, sure, but that is totally fine. :)

I'm in my junior year and must take classes this summer (switching from another major), but next april 2015 I will be able to graduate. Is it worth it to take an extra semester and graduate in december 2015 just to maybe get an internship that summer? Or is that a waste of money?

I won't really need anymore courses but I guess I could take electives. I just want to know if an internship is this important? Also what if I decide to do the extra semester and I don't even find an internship (which seems to be common here). Thanks for your help.

It was a month long program, but I was drawn to him from the start. At the time, we were living on the opposite sides of the country so in my head, I put up a sort of wall about starting anything. Also, I hadn't been in a relationship before so I think I was still awkward and nervous about that kind of stuff. Still, the wholetime we were working there, we were always talking, flirting, and pretty much finding any excuse to be together. He was really helpful with the parts of the job I was having trouble with. He did try to tell me he had feelings once, but I pretty much froze up in that moment. Still, we ended up staying in touch over e-mail throughout the following year, pretty much writing each other a long message once a week. They were really in depth and caring messages, but neither of us ever flat out said ""should we do something about this? do you have feelings for me?"" Then, he started dating someone seriously and the messages stopped. After they broke up, I heard from him--he just wanted to catch up. It really tore me apart when he just randomly stopped talking to me, but if there were feelings there, I guess I understand why he did. But the conversations never took off like they used to and we pretty much stopped talking for about 2 years. Still, I'd think about him and check his facebook and sometimes have dreams about running into him. Here's where my problem comes into play. Last year, I got a job in Portland, ME and the last I heard he was living in Washington State. This September, he wrote to me to say he is going back to school at a university and hour away from here! I was dating my current boyfriend at the time, we've been together for a year now, and I'm really happy with him. We are very loving and committed to each other, and I feel like the excitement I felt when he contacted me was a betrayal. We had a short conversation, just catching up on what the other is up to. It was left at, if you're ever in the area, contact me. But that was the last time we ever spoke. I stopped thinking about it a lot, but lately the thought is still in the back of my mind. First of all, the coincidences here are strange, but mostly is it okay that I have these feelings? Should I try to talk to my boyfriend or the other guy about it? I have been writing it off as me just entertaining the ""what-if's"" and that I was a different person back then, and he was one of my first ""loves"". I don't want to jepordize the relationship I'm in now either because it's very strong, but...I don't know. Is this something I should address?

TL;DR A guy from the past that has been a big ""what-if"" for me has moved into the area, but I'm in a relationship and I feel guilty that I've been thinking about this person from the past."

200zav,2,2014-03-10,Interning after finishing an internship?,mllax,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/200zav/interning_after_finishing_an_internship/,"So I sort of asked this question before, but a lot of people got pedantic with a specific thing I said, so I'm going to ask this again.

I'm still interviewing with a B4, but have an offer from a national firm. Because of the deadline I have with the national firm, of March 14, and the fact that second round interview schedule hasn't been made with the B4 firm, I'm more than likely going to accept the national firm's offer for the Winter Term internship.

However, I enjoyed speaking with several partners, and associates at the B4 firm, just as much as I did with those at the national firm (I interviewed with all B4 but never got this impression with them). Because of this, I'm thinking about applying for maybe next summer, or fall internship with the same B4 again, to see if I really like it.

I was told by the people here that an internship can basically be seen as an offer, provided you don't screw up, however, if I have to put it in perspective of which will benefit me more, I think working with the B4 would be much better for my career.

And so, I was hoping to get advice, or opinions on my situation: Is it alright if I interview and intern at another firm, after I'm done with my internship?

If it matters, I have about 2 years left of undergrad."

I'm stuck at work on a beautiful Monday morning, but I need to get this out of my head. 

08:15 - On may way to work, a girl gets hit by a car, turning left in front of me in a big crossroad, just as I stop at the red light. Luckily, the crossroad was busy, and several people stopped to help her off the road immediately. She seemed ok (she was standing up at least), but the whole situation scared the crap out of me and everyone else. 

08:55 - A colleague asks for our attention and tells us that he's dying of a particularly bad type of cancer. He doesn't have much time left to live, maybe a month or so. Obviously, the mood in the office is a bit off right now. He's one of the best and nicest colleagues I've had and always supported me, when my former boss was after me.

09:20 - The son of an intern got hurt at school and ended up in the hospital. He left half an hour ago to take care of him.

Now I'm just sitting here, thinking ""WTF is going on?"", hoping nothing else will happen to anyone today. It seems.. I guess, more awful, when there's literally nothing you can do to help. 

It feels wrong to just get on with my day, as if nothing happened.

I studied economics and finance and graduated with a mediocre GPA from a top tier public school.  I worked for a year after graduation at a financial consulting firm.  I found the pace tough and had a horrible work ethic at the time, so within 7 months I was let go.  I spent the next few months working on a farm and regrouping, I think took a job as a camp counselor, meanwhile taking database courses.  

I am now an intern at a french automotive company with a location in the US.  I am a database analyst and have been in the position for about 3 months.  It's a weird system where I start out as a ""trainee"" without any benefits and low pay- I am getting paid $20/hr, which is about 10k less than what I was making in consulting.  I am doing well at the job and the people are generally nice.  The issue though, other than the pay, is the lack of organization.  I haven't gotten clear directions, and there are some communication issues.  Regardless, I have taken initiative and tried to solve any problems I run into.  I do enjoy the level of decision making I have- I'm also on a team that is redesigning the company's data system.  I have taken a lot on my plate and generally work 10 hour days.  Though the ""traineeship"" can last as long as 18 months, it is not unheard of that one can move from trainee to full time in a few months.  I have asked about this possibility but have gotten no clear response.  For the amount of work I am doing, I really do not like my situation.  

-I like the autonomy, room for creativity, atmosphere.  This is a growing organization (the US branch is still growing, just broke even last year)
- Do not like the compensation, lack of certainty, and lack of employer concern.  

I asked today about full time potential again, and they said there is no possibility before 6/30, but no indication of after.   

Should I stick with this company where I have created a positive reputation and have potential to take on and lead new projects.

OR 

Should I make the move in searching for a more permanent defined role.  

BTW, this role has never existed before.  
 

I have suffered from depression and ADHD so I have to be careful about the jobs I take, so I'm reluctant to move around too much, but on the other hand I can't help but feel like I want more.  "

I met this guy (let's call him B) at a mutual friend's birthday party. After a few FB messages back and forth we exchanged numbers and started texting pretty constantly for over a week. But then I got swamped with school work (he was working at an internship, living at home last semester) and our talking eventually subsided.

Enter this semester, and he has moved into an apartment across the hall with our mutual friend, less than 2 seconds from ours (myself, and three of our other girl friends). At the beginning of the semester, I was dating someone so we didn't really talk, but as soon as I broke that off, me and B started talking again. My two roomies, who have been friends with B for a long while, immediately get wind of this and start encouraging us on both sides. My one roommate, knowing my deep-seated adversion to commitment after a particularly messy breakup, gives up on trying to encourage a relationship and instead vies that we should be fuck buddies. 

Now, here comes the interesting part. We were texting one day while he was at a friend's 21st bday party. He says how much he wishes I was there, and we somehow get to the topic of ""types"", and he says he likes cute girls with cute butts (Puerto Rican genes have blessed me with a big booty), and for the whole night he was very forward about trying to hook up with me, asking me about penis sizes, etc. It could've been the alcohol talking, whatever.

Fast forward a few days, and I am extremely drunk and frisky (snow days, ya gotta love them). I text him pretty late at night booty-calling him and he accepts, which basically establishes our FWB status. It was a little bit awkward at first, but we have hooked up at least 8 times since then and the sexual chemistry is pretty amazing. 

After the first time, we proceed to text all day, every day as usual. The monkey-wrench in this perfect situation is I straight up tell him that I'm not looking for a relationship, only something ""fun"" and ""casual"", which he agrees to without objection. The next day we texted like normal, but then the day after that I don't hear a word from him, and for the next week it's like he dropped off the face of the planet. We continue to hook up, but he is no longer texting me everyday and oftentime I have to initiate conversation.

After all of this, I start coming to the realization that he's the only boy since my last boyfriend that I could talk to for hours and hours, the only one who could make me laugh on a whim, and, well, awesome sex. At this point, I've realized that I've fallen for him, but now he might feel differently now (if he had ever felt something for me before). I asked him how he feels about relationships, and he said he doesn't really object to the concept of a relationship, but if he wants to be in a relationship, it has to be really, really worth it.

Does anyone have more insight on this? My best friend, who was the only one I have told, basically told me to stop being such a pussy and tell B that you take it back, but if he didn't feel the same way it would be pretty humiliating, probably doubled by the fact that we have the same group of friends. 

I find that I am either completely oblivious or delusional when it comes to boys, so if someone could slap me in the face with some cold, hard truth that would be great. If more details are needed just ask.

**tl;dr**: I'm an idiot and prematurely friend-zone the perfect guy for me, and now I need help undoing it.

EDIT: Okay, another nugget of information because thinking back I also feel like this is important. Somewhere between the 3rd and the 4th time we hookup, me, B, and about 5 or 6 friends are about ready to head out to a party. Coincidentally, everyone except one roomie (let's call her rooomie J), is sort of paired up, as in either a relationship or the same sort of murky ground I'm on. Roomie J is belligerently drunk and asks B ""if you could hook up with any other girl at the party - BESIDES IMAPUSSYBCTHROWAWAY - would you?"" Obvs was not expecting this to be a good answer because we aren't anything official, but it was an enthusiastic ""hell yes!"" followed by some gibberish about ""plenty of fish in the sea"" and other macho bullshit. Obviously I was fuming on the inside (this was the first clue to myself that there were some feelings)...but I still went home with him that night because urges. I don't know whether to take that macho bullshit seriously or whether he's deep down upset about what I said and acted accordingly...  "

I am literally sprinting through this second B.A. It's seriously difficult and my GPA is suffering (GPA about 2.7-2.8).  I started it last January and I'm finishing it this December.

Now, before you all start telling me to do better, I know, I'm working on it. But at this point with the graduate level math courses I'm taking, it's unlikely my GPA will rise much above a 3.0.

I am okay with this. I figure once I get my first or second job I can leave my GPA off future resumes. I just want to know what my next best bet would be to find a software engineering job. I have not had the time for personal projects or internships. 

I have a good chunk of cash saved up that is presently invested in Vanguard funds. I'm planning on living off of that while I do one of the following:

- Attend a ""Hacker School""
- Apply for full-time internships
- Work on my own portfolio of projects and attend conventions and network as much as possible.

Even with a poor GPA, I think I am still in a good position to be looking for jobs, potentially a great position in regards to defense contractors.

What do you think? How bad off am I? What steps should I take after I graduate in December?

1) My job is in what looks like Greater Heights (north west section inside the 610 loop).  What is this area like? *On second glance I think it might actually be considered Lazybrook/Timbergrove

2) How is biking in Houston?  I've never lived in a city before, so I don't know much about biking in cities, but I usually bike 15 miles a day so I might try to bike to and from work.

3) How much should I expect to spend on apartments near that area?

4) If I drive down there, how is parking in Houston?

If you guys could help me out I'd really appreciate it."

I have taken all lower div CS classes, and took advance algorithm and internet achitecture, I also did a couple project on web dev, however my biggest weakness is no CS related internship, as I did research for two years. Can someone give me some advice for increasing my prospect of getting a CS job.

I apologize if there are similar post before.

I said sure, and he asked if I could get a couple of references, so I ask both of the PM's I'm currently working under --which I felt was not a big deal -- I'd imagine they get asked this all the time. 

Anyway, now I get the sneaky suspicion they are talking negatively about me behind my back and they aren't happy with me making the request. One was like ""sure I guess so..."" and another didn't even write back to me yet -- so I have no idea if he'll accept or not (if he said no I'd be incredibly surprised).

I was thinking that it's not that big of a deal if I choose to do an interview around once in a while, just so I know what my options are. I have bills to pay and student loans to pay off -- so I don't think anyone should take it personally if I did leave the company (even though I don't want to nor do I plan to, but like I said, I do have bills to pay). Plus I do interviews all the time, and 99% of the time it doesn't go anywhere, so I've decided it's best to take them when I can, it's pretty hard to even get an interview.

Anyway, anybody else been in this situation and can give me advice? From both developers and project managers. "

&gt;Recently inspired by my colleague Allen's interesting blog post about his hiring experience I've decided to follow suit and share my own experience on acquiring an internship the year before graduation!

&gt;I'm sure most anyone reading my blog knows of a company called thatgamecompany! I have recently been offered a summer internship! The company is an amazing one and I personally feel that I belong at such a place. I'll see how good of a fit we make in the coming months, though I remain extremely optimistic about the whole thing.

&gt;Smaller game companies seem to work like a mini-Valve in that the team structure is flat. When speaking with thatgamecompany's lead engineer John and researching the company I was drawn towards the way that John detailed about the internals of company working. One thing that stuck out to me most was that John had mentioned that often times a developer will get an idea, experiment and try it out and see how things go. If a good idea is placed into the game other employees will recognize this and ""hop on the band-wagon"" to work together to get to the next iteration. John had mentioned that he feels a good fit for a team structure like this are individuals with a lot of initiative. I myself strive for an environment that embraces initiative, experimentation and professional growth.

&gt;They even sent me one of their AWESOME T-Shirts! Special thanks to a particular someone's mom :)

&gt;So I've been struttin round with my snazzy shirt for weeks ever since I was made an offer. I think it would be fun to describe how I actually met John Edwards, one of the founders, in an effort to perhaps inspire others to do similar.

&gt;In my early studies at DigiPen I was hungry to find all resources that exist on the C++ topic of code reflection. thatgamecompany's lead engineer John Edwards had made some sample material available to students at my university a few years earlier, and at the end of his material he left his email in case anyone wanted to contact him.

&gt;Happy to have found the exact reference material I needed I implemented all that was presented, and then added a whole lot more atop. After feeling great about the results I emailed John thanking him for his contribution of knowledge and linked him to one of my portfolio videos. I do this with most people that give out GDC lectures or other types of online-material, as I know from experience that seeing others' work benefit from your own material grants a very rewarding feeling -like a sense altruism satiated.

&gt;John ended up liking my video and asked me to shoot him an email next year if I was interested in interning at thatgamecompany. At first (as a Sophomore) my mind wasn't on internships or hiring in any way, and I was really just lucky I sent him an email at all.

&gt;The interview process was actually super long spanning a couple months. Albeit Christmas did strike through the middle of the process, it was still long. The usual is programming tests, phone interviews followed by some form of in-person meetup and additional interviews; interviewing with thatgamecompany mostly followed this format. Knowing 3D math to point where it feels like a language in and of itself, and proficiency in C++ seem to be pretty much the only requirements to make oneself appealing as a potential hire (as for as tech skill goes for engineers). If anyone wants tips on how to practice for interviewing my advice would be to make sure you're proficient in your area of study. Beyond this I find that practicing writing code on a white-board helps for formal coding interviews, practicing with a mock-interviewer. For me personally the biggest practice was just repetition of mock coding interviews to keep me from being nervous. When I'm nervous my mind can go pretty blank.

&gt;Hopefully my luck will last out a little longer as I proceed towards graduation!

&gt;In this I would say the moral of the story is: people that write or put forth educational content always do so with an interest to teach others. If one is genuinely interested in the content and contacts the original authors with a thank you, they will inevitably be interested, especially if intelligent followup questions are asked. I would suppose that seeing others benefit and take interest in your efforts to help is just irresistible. It's a great way to thank wonderful people and educate yourself at the same time. I've done this with dozens of various authors of all sorts of content, and every single one of them has always responded very generously; I'm very thankful to them all for their willingness to help."

Even after constantly searching FutureLinks and talking to career services, I found a grand total of one position looking for my skillset (I assume because it tends to be found more among masters' students) and I'm really desperate for the summer.  I have an interview coming up on an unknown date and if it falls through I'm completely fucked.

My department has no co-op option and my advisor pretty much told me I'm on my own with regard to finding something to do over the summer.  Even the linguistics department offers internships.  Meanwhile I have nothing for the summer yet.  I went to all the career fairs and practically all the companies were random local startups or big companies with one or two alumni who wanted bare-bones Java programmers or finance people.  I assume this is because with Carnegie Mellon right across the street, few big tech companies would want to bother looking at Pitt.  I'm good friends with a bunch of people there and they get tons of internships offers around the country.  Meanwhile I'm a junior with a relatively high GPA in two difficult fields, but I feel I'm overlooked because Pitt just isn't as prestigious.

Is my experience common among other technical majors at Pitt?  Note that the reason I'm reluctant to give away my major combination is because I think I'm the only one who has it, so it would give away my identity really quickly."

203ymw,8,2014-03-10,"1 police department, 2 days, 2 ride-alongs, 2 completely different experiences.",suddenLY_CAPITALS,ProtectAndServe,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProtectAndServe/comments/203ymw/1_police_department_2_days_2_ridealongs_2/,"I am interning with my local probation department and have aspirations of working for the local police department.  With this in mind, my probation officers overseeing my internship set me up with two ride-alongs this past weekend with the local department.  I just wanted to share the experiences.

Ride 1: I got to the station around 5pm and rode until about 12am.  I could have stayed later but had my physical fitness test for the academy early the next morning (I passed, woo!).  The officer I rode with was recently brought back after being laid off and has been an officer for around 6 years.  We had good conversation throughout the night, he tried his best to keep my interested and entertained and I had a blast.  There wasn't much going on, one arrest for retail fraud and a few traffic tickets.  We went out to dinner with another officer and both included me in the conversations, were interested in what I was doing, and were extremely friendly and grateful to the staff (said thank you a lot, left a nice tip, did not expect a discount, etc.).  There was a young boy around and they introduced themselves and made the kid's day by being friendly and doing so.  Their cars have GPS trackers on them so they can see where all of the other units are at, and he explained it is great for knowing where backup is, but is really frustrating when you see guys just sitting around doing nothing.  I thought that was really interesting. They were great guys and I wish I could have stayed a bit later, but both wished me luck as I left and told me to inform them of how my test went the next day.  I was really happy when I left, hoping my experience the next day would be something even remotely close to this one.


Ride 2: Same shift as the first ride, but this ride could not have been more opposite.  Not in the amount of calls or how busy we were, but the attitude of the officer I was riding with.  This officer was brought back after being laid off as well and has been an officer for about 10 years.  He stayed silent most of the night, making it really uncomfortable.  I tried bringing things up and asking some questions, but he would give one word answers or sometimes just not answer.  He brought up that he had a newborn and lived in the area, so congratulated him and I said ""Hey, my mom runs a daycare if you are ever in need."" because there are other officers at the department who have my mom watch their kids, and he answered ""I don't want someone else raising my kid.""  I felt like I insulted him somehow, I was just trying to be nice. He was one of the officers that was not proactive at all, he would sit in empty parking lots and make up traffic stops to make it look like he did something on his log.  He simply did not want to do anything and said he was only there if other officers needed help with something, but he wasn't going to get into anything himself.  We went to meet another officer in the same area for coffee and that officer got called to something, so we sat in the parking lot for 20 minutes waiting, then he was like ""let's drive down the street so dispatch doesn't think we are just sitting here."" Finally the other officer was off the call and we went for coffee at a local Dunkin' Donuts. These officers flat out expected free coffee and donuts, placing a dollar in the tip jar and putting their wallets away before even ordering and not even offering to pay.  No verbal ""thank-you"" and they sat as far away from people as they could.  I had a credit card and tried to insist to the cashier that I pay, but he didn't let me.  All I had was a small coffee but still felt bad because I thought he would take my card considering I wasn't in a uniform, I really wanted to pay and felt uncomfortable.  One guy came and thanked them and they just kind of stared at the guy, said ""You're welcome."" then were pissed that he said something to them.  Is it really that hard to appreciate someone who appreciates what you do?  Later he stopped at a Subway and got some food, I was not really hungry, but immediately afterwards sent an IM to the other officer in the area saying it was ""confirmed that it is a 50% discount there for officers."" I was just taken back about their attitude, it seemed they didn't want to do anything other than talk shit about other officers and ride around looking for free (or heavily discounted) food.  


I know most of the officers working with this department are go-getters like the first officer I rode with, and most are very friendly and outgoing...but that second officer and his patrol partner just really ticked me off with their whole attitude towards their job.  I know he may have not wanted a ride-along, I get that...but I feel that is no excuse for not doing the job correctly, taking advantage of local businesses, and having a poor attitude towards the civilians you are working for. I still want to work for this department, and I know exactly who I want to be like while working there (or at any department that I should be so lucky to be hired at in the future).  I am glad I could see these two types of officers so closely, it is an experience that will stick with me forever as a constant reminder of what kind of officer I will strive to become."

I came from a small city in the Midwest, where education wasn't exactly the most advanced and I had no academic competition. I got into some top ~20ish universities but I feel like that was because the adcomms took a look at my test scores and EC work and said ""He'll do."" Truth is, my parents were the driving force behind all of my test prep and EC work, which ranged from volunteering at the hospital, donating to food shelter, and working at various summer research internships. 

Once I got to college, however, I completely fucked up. I didn't party excessively, do drugs, or even socialize that much. I felt kind of isolated, tired of forcing myself to put on a happy face and make &amp; maintain friends. Instead, I spent most of my time surfing the web, watching tv shows and movies, and generally procrastinating. In my 5 semesters at college, I've gotten 3 Cs, lots of Bs, and not enough As. The main point of my worry is that I claim to be on the pre-med track, but actually don't really know what to do with myself, and can't find a suitable replacement for a physician so I can back out of the pre-med track. 

I also feel like I've been a disappointment for my parents, bringing in so many terrible grades and pretty much killing any hopes of getting into a DO school, let alone MD school. Every time I go back for break, they give me a sincere lecture on how they hope I will push myself, study harder, and get my grades up, and every time I nod in agreement. I really want to improve my grades, but as soon as I arrive on campus, I lose my motivation to study for my classes.

My Cs have been in organic chemistry and psychopharmacology, and I'm pretty sure another one will come from biochemistry this semester. The irony in my ideations is that my suicide plan is to buy equal ratios of concentrated formic acid and concentrated sulfuric acid, mix them in a confined space, and listen to music while I drift to sleep from carbon monoxide poisoning. 

I really don't know how to handle my life, I feel like I'm a disappointment to my parents, and I feel like I could never repay their patience."

Recently I have come to terms with the fact my girlfriend and I have serious issues in our relationship. So serious, in fact, that we had to discuss whether or not they could be solved or if the right decision would be to peacefully part.

Our relationship had been in a steady state of decay for at least a year before our discussion just three days ago. Our issues are something I think a lot of couples encounter. Mostly the absence of romance and absence of intimacy that accompanies the descent into the routine. We had discussed it more times than I can even remember, and each time I would say ""I'm so sorry, I understand our issues, and things will be different from now on."" And to some extent that was true. I thought I was making a reasonable effort to create the aire of romance: the occasional date night, the spontaneous day excursion. The truth is I didn't do enough. Whether I realized it or not, I was only going through the motions. My neglect for our emotional issue rapidly led to our decay of intimacy. Now this I noticed. However, my naive approach to fixing our intimacy was to attempt to be intimate, which only drove more space between the two of us.

We do have a couple of more atypical issues. Mainly, I don't have many friends. Those that I do, live hours away and I see only once a month or so, when I drive back from school. Some of you might be ahead of me here. Let me assure you , I have always assured my girlfriend that having and hanging out with her own friends is healthy and will help us retain our autonomy (not become the couple-blob). I even encourage it. However, I don't make friends easily. I'm introverted, and unfortunately very content with spending time alone. I wouldn't say I prefer it; I think it would be nice to have more friends, but my content-fulness hinders any new connections.

This leads us to the most damaging issues. My girlfriend has told me that she cannot escape feelings of guilt when she is with her friends. Because I am always in our apartment when she returns, she feels like she is abandoning or disappointing me every time she makes plans. She believes I am not autonomous enough. My inability to contribute anything from outside of the relationship to the relationship leaves her feeling guilty and alone.

Additionally, she is uncomfortable with my lack of ambition and the degree to which I have tied my future to hers. Truthfully, I cannot imagine a future without her, but she is fears that I have made her my future. I should expound here. My girlfriend graduates this April with a degree in Fine Arts, and if all things go well she will be attending graduate school in upstate New York in the fall. I'm studying Computer Engineering, and won't graduate until this December, however I have an internship in Miami this summer. This gives us *only two months* to resolve the past year of accumulated issues.

We've discussed the possibility of me finding an entry level job in New York and us continuing the relationship, but this makes her uncomfortable as well. She doubts that my efforts in school are going to translate to the freedom to choose where I can work, a concern that I can understand. Additionally, she doesn't want me to make any career sacrifices for her, as it could lead to resentment in the future. I believe that relationships will always require sacrifice from one party at one time or another. Having the more traditional career path, I think I could have the flexibility to follow her if I want to, which I do.

The past week has involved a lot of crying, and holding, and regret. Regret for the past year of bullshit that could have been different. Two days ago we agreed we would give it our all. That for the next two months we be as happy as we could, that I would become an individual again, that we would rekindle our romance, and that above all we would just be happy. We will make our decision together, when the time arrives.

There is one issue that particularly irks me though. An issue I have confronted her about numerous times in the past couple of months. At first I dismissed my concerns, chalking them up to pettiness or paranoia. We are very busy, both being seniors in our programs, so the evenings are the only times we have together during the week, and yet every night into the early morning, as early as 2AM, she is texting this fellow (we'll call him L). I support her having friends, and I'm certainly not insecure enough to be jealous of her guy friends, but after night, after night, it gets to you. I've met L and we actually have a lot of common interest, he's a real decent guy, but holy fucking fuck they text ever night. There are times when my girlfriend blatantly goes through the motions of conversation with me while never looking up from her phone.

L and my girlfriend have a total of 12 hours of class together a week, so I know the have a chance to maintain a comfortable, non-romantic relationship without texting each other into the early hours. I realize that the issues previously discussed created an emotional distance between the two of us, a distance that may have driven her toward L.

When I asked her if I should be worried about the two of them, she scoffed ""No, you have nothing to worry about, we've just become good friends."" I may be paraphrasing, but I don't think that is too far off. I explained to her the reasons for my suspicion, and how her actions make me feel. She seemed to understand, but nothing has changed. I still can't get her away from the phone, and I've noticed she has begun taking her phone with her everywhere, never leaving it unattended.

In a way, knowing that she is having her emotional needs met elsewhere is worse than any physical infidelity. I honestly love this women. I want things to be just like the day we first made out in my bedroom, but I can't get there without her.

So tell me, reddit. Should I be worried? Should I confront her again? Has she already cheked out? Should we just call it off?

It would kill me, but it's no worse than her being with me out of some misplaced sense of guilt, or fear of hurting me. Especially if I'm still being hurt and she has moved on anyway; that isn't a relationship.

---   
**tl;dr**: Girlfriend and I are at a crossroads. We agreed to see things through with the two months we have until we will have to break up or go long distance, but she is/has been texting a guy, L, every night until the early morning for months. I suspect emotional attachment. Wat do?"
204ibt,3,2014-03-11,CPP Geology Transfer,[deleted],CalPolyPomona,https://www.reddit.com/r/CalPolyPomona/comments/204ibt/cpp_geology_transfer/,"Hey folks, I had a few questions that I've had a hard time getting an answer in regards to elsewhere and figured this was probably the best spot. I was accepted to CPP for transfer into the geology department for fall 2014 and am trying to get a handle on the program strength and any departmental strengths or weaknesses. I'm currently waiting to hear back from my UC choices over the next few weeks, but I am seriously considering Pomona. 

Little background, I started out as an Engineering major (at the JC level) until I had the opportunity to do an engineering internship and realized that I had absolutely no interest in what engineers actually do. I am now going into Geophysics with the intention of pursuing graduate work in Planetary Science and that jazz. I'm all the way thru my DiffyQ and Linear Algebra courses, as well as the physics, chem and some Astronomy and obviously geology. My biggest concern when viewing some of the courses on the general catalog was in regards to the Analytical Calc III course that is offered at CPP. It seems that the highest math required for geology and geophysics at CPP is basically integral Calculus, which leads me to believe that the program there is not heavily math based (If you're not using Vector Calc and Diffyg that makes hydrology and things like orbital dynamics pretty difficult). This is troubling to me as I wish to move on to do research type work. Please correct me if I am wrong and I am definitely looking for some feedback!

Another question I have is in regards to my personal situation. I am a nontraditional student (late 20's living with my long term girlfriend who will be moving with me). Is anyone familiar with CCP's policy for ""married student"" housing, or shared housing for students with families? What is the cost like for living off campus within about 10 miles if it were a necessity? I am just looking for a ballpark here, as I have already begun looking at apartments myself. 

I'm writing this pretty late so it's a bit scattered, which I apologize for. If you guys have any friends in the Geology Department I would really appreciate it if you could direct this to them! 

Thanks in advance for the time and responses,

204ovo,1,2014-03-11,An open letter from life as a post-grad.,tweak06,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/204ovo/an_open_letter_from_life_as_a_postgrad/,"Growing up, I had a special skill that not a lot of other kids had. 
I could draw.
Really well for my age, in fact. 
My dad was an art director and my mom was a painter, my sister was also talented. I didn't understand exactly what my dad did for a living (he worked at an ad agency) but I knew whatever he was doing that's what I wanted to do, too. I always looked up to him. I have two very loving, supporting parents, but I always gravitated toward what my dad was doing. So I grew up, honing my skills and eventually getting an internship job at the firm my dad worked at during my senior year of high school. 

Then I went to college for graphic design. This is what I always wanted, it was even the same college that my dad went to when he was my age. I was following my dream. All I ever wanted to be was an honest-to-god graphic designer. So I worked hard. My professors liked that I could draw. It's a rare talent in this field; with the invention of computers and Adobe Illustrator, the ability to hand-draw your ideas and concepts is becoming a lost art. 

I can draw on any medium, so learning to draw on the computer wasn't difficult for me. I had an advantage of already knowing and understanding the programs from my internship job. The design program where I went to school is very competitive. Every 2 years they weed out people until the class has been whittled down to about 20 students. My freshman year my class was 160 kids. My junior year there were 19 of us left. I did very well up until late into my junior year, where we had to take a class on production, that's where my trouble started.

The class was very difficult and not necessarily focused on design, but more along the aspects of printing/design. We learned about outdated technology like graviere printing (the same method of printing used to make dollar bills). It was good knowledge to have, but not necessarily plausable--if I wanted to be a printer, of course. 

So I failed that class, and my grade point dropped below a certain level needed to stay in the program and I was kicked out. 

But I stayed in. I chased my dream. I switched my major to advertising/marketing. I thought with 3+ years experience in the design program and an Associates' Degree as well as a Bachelors of Marketing/Advertising, I should be a rare find in the market. 

Then I graduated and moved to the city with my girlfriend. This was 3 years ago. 

The city I live in has many colleges, and everyone from the surrounding areas moves here. It's a very competitive marketplace. After a year of being unemployed, I landed a job as a ""production artist"" at one of the largest t-shirt manufacturers in the country. 

It's not a fun job. In fact, it sucks. They have a very specific way of doing things--all of which are very unpractical and go against everything I learned in school. The president of the company is a micro-manager and has bottled-necked all workflow through him. Meaning he has appointed himself into complete control of literally everything that happens in the company, from approving artwork to birthday cards. I'm not kidding. 

This would be fine if he were a designer, but he's not. He's a salesman. We constantly produce artwork that looks terrible and sell it for 1000% markup. The pay is low and the hours are long. People quit multiple times throughout the year. The president drives a porsche and a BMW, most of us drive shitty run-down cars. That's just how it is. 

So I worked on my portfolio. I keep chasing my dream. I can't stay where I work. I'm called an idiot and a moron and my ideas are laughed at. I've been working here for 2 years and I can't stand it, to the point where I've started sleepwalking and talking in my sleep about how much I hate my job. My girlfriend and I are in an awkward situation because she's working her way up at her job, but doesn't make enough to support to the two of us if I quit. I'm paid just enough that I can't make it if I go back to a minimum wage job. It's literally beginning to drive me insane.

I've applied at every design and advertising agency. If the positions aren't already filled, I'm competing with several dozen other candidates, most of whom have years' worth of experience that I can't possibly compete with. 

Then there's a few agencies where my ex-girlfriends have gotten jobs. In fact, just yesterday I got desperate enough that I texted one of them because I found out the agency they worked at was hiring. It was humiliating. Not only am I willing to have an awkward work-relationship with someone who I used to sleep with and someone whom dumped me, but they would also hold a higher ranking position than I, despite being a year behind me from graduation. 

""Sorry, the position is already filled,"" she told me. ""But we're going to have an open house in a month or so, you'll definitely be on the list."" 

Great, yeah. So I can show up in a nice polo and slacks and be shown this great office with these amazing projects that I will never have. So I can bite my tongue and force a smile and hope to network with somebody. 

I'm so angry. All the time. I can't stand it. I can't stand my shitty, terrible job. I can't believe that I've ever done anything to deserve this. When does it end? I'm sick of stressing about money, I'm sick of going to a job that I'm not proud of everyday, I'm sick of lying to people about the projects we do at my work to impress them, I'm sick of everything, down to it's core. I'm a good person, for chrissakes. I recycle, I donate to charity and I love my girlfriend and my family with all my heart. I work hard for the things I want in life. When is it going to be my turn? 

All I've ever wanted to be is a designer, goddamnit. I just want a light at the end of the tunnel here. 

Thanks for listening, I appreciate it.

204p36,6,2014-03-11,This week...,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/204p36/this_week/,"It's been full of highs and lows. My grandmother passed and I spent more days at my grandparent's house than home. I'm in a grad school program and I've been struggling and I have a meeting today to talk about it, but I'm worried they're going to pull me from my internship and I don't want that to happen. It makes me feel sick to my stomach every time I think about it and I don't know what to do. I'm tired and exhausted.

On the plus side, my uncle took me aside and asked me if I was gay. I am. He was really supportive and told me my parents would probably put up a fuss at first but then they'd come around and that if I ever needed a place to stay I was more than welcome. I can't even express how much that meant to me. I told my gf and she thought it was kind of funny in a good way. Of course my first thought was, what gave me away?

I don't know. I just feel so tired. I'm worried about today, really worried. And I feel helpless because I know anything I could have done to fix the situation should have happened a month ago so I've been kicking myself for not doing things better. I had a lot of days off because of the snow this year, but more often than not, i found myself staying in bed sleeping nearly the whole day.

I've been getting really bad headaches too, like cripplingly bad headaches where I can't stand up without feeling really dizzy and nauseous and light and smells and sound just hurt. And it always seems to occur right around that time of month which makes me feel just ten times worse.

What really scares me is that my grandmother passing makes me sad, but not extremely different from how I normally feel. That is to say, I'm not happy normally and everything that's been going on has only served to point out that it's not making me feel bad like I should, it's pushing me further down than where i already am. And I don't know what to do about it. I don't know what to do about anything anymore and I feel helpless to change anything. I keep wondering what the point is of me being here if all I'm going to do is keep failing and keep disappointing people."
204txt,1,2014-03-11,Will taking a job in test hinder my career in software development?,Smashreddit,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/204txt/will_taking_a_job_in_test_hinder_my_career_in/,"For some background, I double majored in Computer Engineering Tech and Computer Science. I worked 2 years at a company as a software engineering intern while I was in school. Unfortunately right as I was graduating they had a budget freeze and weren't able to bring me on full time.

So I went out into the job market. Had a lot of interviews and actually had about 5 offers over a few months. The best offer overall was in another department for the same company. Unfortunately this was a test position. The main product in this department is a lighting control system that also has associated software. When interviewing they played up the automated testing that would be associated with the position.

I took this position. Now I find out the software product is shipping in a couple of months. The next product we will be working on in the foreseeable future is more of a firmware project. I'm also hearing rumblings about doing all the automated testing in labview!

The job is laid back and pays better than any of the other software engineering positions I saw and the company has the best benefits I've ever seen. I am exposed to many different technologies, including SOME programming. If my goal is to move into development, is working in test going to hinder that? I'm afraid I might have taken the best short term option and destroyed my long term options. Any advice would be appreciated."

I intern at the PD's office and love doing it, but law school drains me more than anything I ever thought possible. I've always suffered from anxiety issues and the stress of law school has caused serious strain and possible divorce between my wife and I and I honestly feel as if I cannot do it anymore. I am on a full scholarship so I have very limited debt from this experience. I am also harboring really negative thoughts towards my school because I feel as if it is almost a scam because I know so many people &gt;200K in debt that did nothing last summer, can't find anything this summer, and yet are still told by the school about all these job options. I don't necessarily think I'm better then them, but I've busted my ass making connections in the field I want, criminal law, and have a few semi-formal job offers lined up although they are very low pay. 

It has never been so hard to get out of bed each morning and just make it through each day. My mind is racing constantly and I haven't had a full ""relaxed"" moment since school started. I've been seeing a counselor and psychiatrist and it is helping but I am still absolutely miserable and cannot keep up or focused on school this semester. I am not suicidal, but its hard not to think how nice it would be to just never wake up to have to deal with all of my stress. I knew law school was bad, but it is just absolutely soul draining for me and I cannot believe how low I have sunk. I should have gotten help sooner but I'm afraid it may be too late now for my marriage and law school career. 

I don't want to make an irrational decision, but I honestly cannot keep this up. I'm tired 24/7 and want to just sleep, but I can't sleep. I feel like I can't control my anxiety and worries anymore and it is scaring me that I have gotten to the point where I can't even control my mind. I'm just struggling to stay afloat and not sure where to go or what to do. 

I guess this is more of a rant, but Reddit has helped me in the past and I'm sure I'm not alone with these feelings. "

2053ef,3,2014-03-11,"Recent grad, BSBA Accounting, low GPA and had to move back home due to financial strain... I'm just so lost right now.",[deleted],careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/2053ef/recent_grad_bsba_accounting_low_gpa_and_had_to/,"My GPA was about 2.5 upon graduation due to things that I would find too personal to disclose to an interviewer (ranging to what I've been told were symptoms of PTSD from a parent's death in conjunction with trying to perform CPR on another person later who ultimately died to marital separation). Just, the last 3 years of my life have been T-total hell in that regard.

My associates is in Computer Science, I had a nearly 4.0 GPA, was in all the community college's academic honor societies, etc., before these life situations--that is the best reflection of my typical performance, IMO, too bad it was at the beginning of my college career. I finished college with ~$8700 in subsidized government loans because I had scholarships from academic performance in my beginning at college (I say this only to say I haven't had a crappy record for my entire college career). 

I also have 153 semester hours from the major switch, but I'm not sure if I meet the accounting hour requirements for the CPA exam. I'm confused by which classes count for upper division, lower division, w/e. I graduated in Alabama, had to move home to Tennessee, and have also considered looking in and around Atlanta, GA, so I wouldn't be opposed to taking the CPA exam in any of those 3 states.

I don't have any internship experience. I didn't have any bites for internships, and I've worked unrelated jobs just trying to finish school (largely cashiering in grocery stores, but some other things). I've worked for VITA the past 3 tax seasons, and worked for a small accounting office while doing VITA this tax season as well. I just wanted to get any experience I could possibly get.

I just don't even know where to go from here. I'm kind of lost. That may sound strange but... I have no idea where to start with this. I have no one I can ask for help or guidance. I'm the only one in my family to even graduate college, and I feel like this experience has been an uphill battle and reinventing the wheel the whole way. I mean, there were times I was going to class 3 days a week, hand washing dishes from Friday-Sunday, and volunteering for VITA the rest of my spare time.

I had an alumni say to me that I was ""working a job sophomores would be working"" in the most condescending tone you can imagine, when all I could think was: ""I'd love to start a career somewhere, but no one has called me back and I can't refuse a job that's giving me food and a means to get to school just because it's not up to your standards and you were *so* much better off than me when you were at my level."" 

I just... I don't know where to begin. I feel afraid of not starting my career, financial strain makes it necessary to do whatever I can possibly do when an opportunity arrives, but I don't know where to even go. I've had to move to a completely different state than my university, and I don't have many connections at all."

As a person of color, hispanic, I can't help but wonder what Idaho is like considering nearly 80% of it is white. I am from the University of Florida so I've experienced many a pleasant white folk and have no general qualms.

205adx,1,2014-03-11,Need help choosing between two internship offers,AwkwardActually,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/205adx/need_help_choosing_between_two_internship_offers/,"I am an undergraduate student (junior) majoring in finance and Chinese. I am very interested in international finance with a focus on the East Asian market. I've secured two offers for summer internships and am at a complete loss for what to choose. For either company there is a good chance of getting a full-time offer after graduation, so this internship will greatly impact my future career path.

**Offer 1** is from a large US bank in their commercial banking department. 

* Pros: Great pay, located in the same city as where I go to college, big name would look great on my resume. Since it is a large bank, I would learn a lot about finance and the industry that could be easily transferable to other jobs in finance.
* Cons: I'm not extremely interested in commercial banking but it could be a good stepping stone to a more lucrative career. This bank's operations are domestically focused so I would not get the international exposure that I want. This bank was hurt badly by the great recession and is still in the recovery process.

**Offer 2** is from an East Asian automaker in their capital services area. The internship would be in their headquarters abroad.

* Pros: International experience, I would get to travel to a country I have always wanted to visit, they have a large presence in China. This company, while not as large as the bank, is still a fortune 500 company and has experienced significant growth in the past decade. 
* Cons: They are only paying me a third of what the bank is offering. I do not speak the native language (though I would be willing to learn) nor do I have a particular interest in the automotive industry (though I would be willing to learn). The headquarter country still has a lot of issues with gender inequality and the automotive industry is already so male-dominated, I worry if I continue working with this company I may hit a glass ceiling, so to speak. Also, auto finance is a more specific line of work with skills that would not be as easily transferable. 

Personally, I would LOVE to take the internship abroad for purely personal reasons, but I know I need to focus on the long-term career impact of my decision. Another issue is that money is definitely a factor for me. With the bank offering my 3x more pay, it is really hard for a cash-strapped college student to turn down that offer. Is it acceptable to try to negotiate salary with the foreign firm? 

So which offer should I take? Any advice is greatly appreciated.

They scream at him, beat him, and have broken his bones. He used to be able to go to uni to get away, but he took an internship they didn't want him to. He told them he was suspended. He hasn't been back to university since then, his parents won't pay. His parents are also rich, so he doesn't qualify for need-based aid. I've been trying to get him to fill out the fafsa as an independant but that only gives out unsubsidised loans, and they dont allow enough of those to cover the costs.

He works three jobs and his health is failing badly. He isn't saving anything because his parents find ways to make him pay for everything, despite being genuine 1%ers and needing for nothing. He says he constantly has chest pains, his hands constantly shake. I try to get him to go to a doc. He has 3 days off a month. I try to get him to save up for an apartment, but he always vascillates between saying he hasnt saved up anything and then saying he's saving, so I don't even know what his status is.

I desperately want to help, but I'm poor. I have a single mom cause my dad died, she makes barely above the poverty line. I have a serious chronic disease I will carry until the day I die, and I was hospitalized for a month last summer. I have thousands in med bills, thousands more in federal student loans. I'm bad off financially, and I want to help him, but idk how. I havn't touched a credit card in my life and I might have to declare bankruptcy because of med bills. 

He has this car his dad bought him, 20 grand. His dad is making him pay it back. It seems to be the main thing holding him back, he is afraid his dad will repossess the car if he leaves. I don't have a car, so I wouldn't be able to drive him around. Not having a car would severely limit his job prospects.

He says relatives won't help, and also that they don't know about the abuse. He refuses to tell them. Won't help him cosign a private student loan either, something his dad did.

He can't get private student loans. One bank was going to give him them, but his dad was their biggest customer and his dad threatened to find another bank if they gave my boyfriend loans. The deal fell through. 

 My original plan was to just get him out of the house with a shit job up here for a few years until he hit 24, at which point he can get fafsa. But now the car is holding him back and he can't even do that.

I just don't know what to do. I desperately want to get him out of his situation. He's suicidal, and I'm honestly not much farther. I try as hard as I can to make plans to get him out, but he shuts everything down. His situation wears on me constantly, and i miss him all the time. 

  --- **tl;dr**: My boyfriends asshole rich dad abuses him physically, mentally, and emotionally, takes most of his money from his 3 jobs, and won't let him go to college.  What do I do?"
205j95,57,2014-03-11,How RP has helped me and made me change my life. How has it changed your life?,rj88631,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/205j95/how_rp_has_helped_me_and_made_me_change_my_life/,"**About Me**

Five months ago, my life was in shambles. I was barely getting by in my supersenior year. My LTR was constantly making noises by the exit and I was too wacked out to realize to getting bearing on my life. Then I discovered ROK and ate through the content voraciously. I discovered the manosphere and eventually came here to The Red Pill. I realized what I had been missing. I no longer had my frame. I let  several setbacks get to me and they had disrupted my drive and confidence. I struggled and feel into a directionless depression.

But TRP showed me the world for what it is. I looked at my life and saw when I had acted most RP, I had been successful and happy. I did what I wanted, succeeded at what I tried, and accomplish my goals. If I wanted to intern or work somewhere, I made it happen. If I wanted the company of a woman, I made it happen. Women wanted me. 

Women want strength, physical and mental in a man. That is what I had. That is what I let go. What I lost sight of. The Red Pill helped me to realize that. It gave me the tools I needed to be wanted and desired by my LTR again. 

When we fight, I maintain frame. I try not get upset over the little things and keep my cool. I don't get drawn into the petty crap, or arguing about how we argue. I keep my eye on resolution. I don't let myself give into mindless bickering. I argue, not fight, argue above the disagreement. I let her know that if the fight is going nowhere, I will walk away. 
Sometimes I simply choose not to get involved at all. Text messages at 2am with a snarky attitude asking ""where the fuck have you been all day?"" do not even get a response. When she calls me the next day and asks if I saw the text, I simply say ""yes I did and there was no point in responding to it when you were obviously pissed and just looking for a fight.

 And I am starting to crush the shit tests thrown at me. 

""So I was talking to this girl in class about this big assignment we have due next week..""

""What girl? You've never said anything about her before. What's her name?""

""Her name? Honestly, I don't know. We just usually fuck before class and then talk a little, we never exchanged names and numbers.""

""oh okay. lol :)""

I am getting my work organized. Talking to my professors. Building relationships with them and fellow students. Taking care of my shit ahead of time. Taking the lead in group assignments and actually being productive. A job recruiter came in at the end of my class today to tell us he'd be waiting outside for anyone interested. What do you think I did? I went straight to him after class and started talking. Normally I'd say another time, meaning never. But I took charge and said today I do something to improve my life.

The Red Pill has given me a positive image to build toward. I am getting back that strength and pride in myself. 

**For You**

And I want to know what you are doing to live a Red Pill lifestyle. I have noticed that the past few weeks have been mostly bitching about feminism and the such and posting Blue Pill examples. Yeah, this sub is partly about that. 

But what it is mostly about is changing your lifestyle. Rebuilding yourself as a man, and giving you the tools to do that. I enjoy being in control of my life. My LTR likes it a lot, too. I get eager for shit tests. I get eager to succeed. 

I want to see your stories not just in response to mine but also in your own posts. I want to know how you are changing your lives. Any damn fool can criticize and tear down others and too much of this sub has been dedicated to that lately. It takes a man, a real man to build and create something. Even if you are failing and don't know what you are doing wrong, tell us. We are here to help. Acknowledging failure is necessary.

205ra9,1,2014-03-11,I [23/m] have second date with a girl [25/m] and I have no idea what I'm doing,burner2212,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/205ra9/i_23m_have_second_date_with_a_girl_25m_and_i_have/,"Please excuse the rambling wall of text that follows, I would really appreciate any advice or suggestions you have:

A few days ago I met a girl at a mutual friends birthday celebration/drink up (although both of us are doing internships at different departments in the same company), while we didn't really get to talk much that evening, she added me on Facebook and we ended meeting up at a club on the next evening. Both the friends I was with and her friends left while we stayed out eventually getting some food before we went home. At the end of the night I asked her if she'd like to go out sometime, which somewhat to my surprise she said she would.

We organised to go out two nights later to a restaurant for dinner and a few drinks. I should mention at this point that this was the first time I had ever been on a date (largely due to self-esteem issues and a lack of courage that I've had to work my way through), and I've just started a year long internship in a completely different country, and so naturally I was very nervous. Despite some initial embarrassment on my part because the place I had suggested was full and we had to find somewhere else. I thought the dinner went pretty well, as we had a fair few laughs and the conversation seemed natural and easy. At the end of the night we parted ways in what seemed to me a somewhat abrupt manner with just a hug. She had asked me to text her when I got home as I'm new to the city and so when I got home I messaged her and told her that I'd had a great time and asked whether she would like to do it again to which she said yes.

So at this point things seem to be going quite well, however I have an unfortunate habit of over-analyzing things, and this coupled with my inexperience and complete lack of awareness when it comes to the ""signals"" I always hear about has led me to be quite anxious about how exactly to proceed. So far we haven't made a particular plan for a future date but tomorrow evening we are both attending a work function (not so much a function as an excuse for all the interns to party). 

So I guess the thing that worries me is that I have no idea what I'm doing. I don't want to come on too strong, but I don't want to seem uninterested. This is particularly pertinent when it comes to physical displays of affection or interest I guess, a very close female friend of mine thinks that I need to kiss her on the next date to avoid the ""friend zone"" as she terms it, but I literally have no idea when that's appropriated/expected/required on a second date, and how to or if I should tell her of my lack of experience. Furthermore, I don't know if I should be texting her in-between dates, or giving her space so I'm feeling rather anxious over the whole thing at the moment.

Tl;dr: I’m an incredibly naive guy trying to get to know a girl and have no idea how to go about this.

To give you some background, I'm graduating college this May and moving to town for a job. I was here this past summer during my internship and stayed at One Lytle. I'm trying to live close to downtown but also am limited on my budget so I was thinking about NKY since rent seems to drop considerably and you are still basically in downtown. 

I found the riverchase apartments and was wondering if anyone has any experiences with them. I feel like they seem like too good of a deal. Also are there any areas of NKY that I should avoid because of crime? Any other suggestions for places? I'm currently using padmapper as my main source for finding places.

Thank you guys!

EDIT: I saw some reviews for Riverchase (there was only 2 or 3) but they seemed fairly negative. Any of you know about Arthur Historic Apartments?"

She thoughtful, caring, drop dead gorgeous, and is had over heads for me, but after almost 3 and a half years we now have no sex life, and the lack of intimacy is killing me.

When we first started dating we jumped into bed pretty quickly, within two weeks. Yes, we were young 18 at the time, but we were truly love struck. 

For awhile we couldn't get enough, and we had sex any moment we could fit it in. Over the year that changed to about once a week, and we had stints of time where we were busy but for the most part or sees life was a constant. Going into year two, I got extremely busy, engineering major, and we ended up having sex about every two weeks. Going into year three or sex life suffered more we ended up having sex a little under once a month, thus was fine because I was busy and didn't really have much time to notice. Note that even though we were only having sex a little under once a month I was still trying to make hinting advances on a weekly basis. 

This brings us to the end of year two. I went on internship for 6 months and we had to do the long distance thing, but I was able to see her periodically (approx every 2-3 weeks). After I got back out sex life was nearly dead. We had sex maybe once a month, emphasis on maybe. See became increasingly nervous to have sex and wouldn't initiate. We have a couple bad moments in bed where she couldn't last more than 10 minutes, and going into year four we spotted having sex.

It has now been three and a half months now since the last time we have had sex. She says she is attracted to me, but she never makes advances and always shoots me down. She often states that she is nervous, either about getting pregnant(despite the fact that we use two forms of birth control) or that it won't be good. I've tried everything from just talking to her about it to trying to be romantic. I just don't know what to do. I don't need sex every day. I just need that close intimacy with her once in awhile. 

This whole thing has launched me into depression which I'm trying to hide, but it is getting more difficult every day. I'm under high stress at school and work, and to have this on top of it is the icing on the cake.

If anyone has any suggestions or advice, I would really appreciate any thoughts before this ruins our relationship.

TL;DR Dating an absolutely wonderful girl, but slow decline in sex over three years is disrupting the relationship. I feel like I've tried everything. Help."

in 2002 I was convicted with 5 felonys (grand theft, grand theft of a motor vehicle, aggravated assault, burglury of a conveyance, and another grand theft).  I ended up violating my probation once, they put me back on house arrest (2 years) and 2 years of probation. I completed it 5 years ago and now I go to college for Electrical Engineering at UCF.  I'm getting to the point where I need to get internships and a job.  I looked at my record on my county webpage last week and most my charges say ""disposed by prosecutor"" except for 1 grand theft and 1 violation of probation. 

So today I ran a background check on myself (a legal paid one) and the background check showed 14 felonys and 3 misdemeanors, some of which I never even received.

I tried to find contact info for the webpage I ran the background check, which is criminalscreen.com but all they have is an email.

1. My first question is, what can I do to fix the error, because everytime I apply for a job, my interviewer is gonna pull up a page with 3x the charges I really have (not that having 5 is really that good)

2. Can I sue the webpage if it isnt correct?

3. Really what should I do here, my county site is showing that I have 1, and I know I can get 1 case sealed in my lifetime and this would put me in the clear.  for the record, all my felonys are on different case numbers.

Thanks for the help!

thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1oiwc2/new_grads_2013_what_was_your_offer_hard_numbers/)
from a few months ago went so well, I figured it would be worthwhile to do the
same for internships now that Spring recruiting is coming to a close for large
and medium sized companies.

-------

As some of you are no doubt aware, Glassdoor data for ~~~new graduate
positions~~~ interns is highly unreliable, and many universities don't publish
~~signing bonus and equity~~ housing stipend and signing bonus numbers alongside
salary in departmental surveys, or don't make the information available until
late in the year, long past offer deadlines.

Having seen the popularity of [this
comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1ogl75/should_i_negotiate_a_higher_starting_salary_with/ccrvc75)
in the [Should I Negotiate with
Google](http://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1ogl75/should_i_negotiate_a_higher_starting_salary_with/)
thread I thought it might be worthwhile for us to have an informal survey here
in CSCQ to get a better idea of what we should *really* expect when interviewing
and negotiating.

In the interest of making it at least semi-structured, I propose something like
the following format:

For each commenter:

* Target School: Yes/No [See Notes Below]
* Degree in Progress: %w{Bachelor Master Doctorate}
* Major/Concentration: 
* Number of Internships: For the privacy conscious
* OPT: Interned At:
* Significant Personal Projects: Yes/No

and then for each offer on hand:

* Company: $name
* Location: 
* Position Title: e.g. SDE, PM, SWEII
* Salary: 
* Signing Bonus:
    * Caveats or Obligations: 
* Housing Stipend or Provisions:
* Misc. Perks, e.g. transit pass or rental car, gym membership:

To save you reformatting the above, here's the raw markdown:

    * Target School: Yes/No
    * Degree in Progress: %w{Bachelor Master Doctorate}
    * Major/Concentration: 
    * Number of Internships: For the privacy conscious
    * OPT: Interned At:
    * Significant Personal Projects: Yes/No

    * Company: $name
    * Location: 
    * Application Process: 
    * Position Title: e.g. SDE, PM, SWEII
    * Salary: 
    * Signing Bonus:
        * Caveats or Obligations: 
    * Housing Stipend or Provisions:
    * Misc. Perks, e.g. transit pass or rental car, gym membership:

If you're uncomfortable with sharing the details under your regular name, no one
would doubt you for using a one-off account (I did!). 

--- 

# EDIT/UPDATES

* **Target School**: I'd consider a Target for CS somewhere the top tier
  companies and VC firms recruit, e.g. UWaterloo, MIT, CMU, UW, Caltech,
  Oxbridge, Edinburgh. Essentially, be near the top for at least one computing
  discipline.

Additionally, some people have suggested adding:

* **Application Method**: How you applied to the company. Was it via on-campus
  recruiting, a career fair, internal referral, their careers page, etc...

* **Application Process**: Something as simple as a date range, e.g. `Applied:
  9/25, Offered: 10/12` or a detailed explanation of the interview process.
  Whatever you feel works best!

The biggest issue is that I'm far from an expert developer at this point, but I'm very eager to learn. I'd like to jump into a role where I can immerse myself in development work until I'm up to speed. Given my background and experience, I don't think it'd take too long for me to settle in.

My situation - I may or may not get an internship, i'm supposed to hear back this week. If i do get it, I feel like they are going to ask me to take a drug test.

I rarely ever do cocaine, far from a regular user. However, last week was a little out of the usual for me. Last wednesday was my friends 21st. We were drinking pretty early in the day and thought some yayo would do the trick to keep us going. Me and my pal went halves on a 40 bag. I forget how many lines we did total, maybe 2 or 3 each. By no means huge fatdaddy lines. Skinny guys.

Fast forward to friday - my friend comes up to visit me at my school. its a special occasion. lets do some more cocaine. This time me and my 2 pals split a 50 bag. a little less than a half gram. I forget how many lines we did.. I'm gonna say 6 max, not big fat lines, skinny ones agian.

Fast forward to saturday night - friday night was fun. lets do more yayo. can't find any. One of my friends at a party says ""hey i'll break you out a line"". I do one line, again, a small line.

Altogether, from wednesday-saturday, i MIGHTVE done a .5.... I wouldnt say much more than that.. maybe .7 at the ultimate max. And keep in mind... the quality of this yayo is pretty garbage. by no means columbian bang-bang. Just a little numb in the nostril and a faster heart rate, I used to mainly to sober me up and keep me going.

With all this being said.. If I get the internship and I'm asked to do the test perhaps next week, what do you think my chances are of passing?

I won't have to do it this week because I'm away at school and 3 hours away from my internship. They understand i'm in school and I doubt they would force me to come home right away for it. Next week i'm on spring break, if I'm too nervous I might fail, I might tell them I have had a vacation planned and booked for lets say... California. And I would have to wait till I get back.

What do you guys think? Again, I am not a regular user.. I sort of just binged this past week. I am very active, work out 5-6 times a week. Starting this past Sunday I am cleansing myself from alcohol and not drinking for at least 7 days. I understand cocaine is water soluble and can be pissed out. I'm worried about left over benzos that could show up on the test.

I'm looking for a summer internship, preferably in the hardware design industry or low-level software, though I would of course welcome software opportunities. I have some interesting out of school experience in hardware design and some work experience for software.

I've saved up money from various internships and jobs, and my stipend is comfortable enough.  After necessary expenses (rent, loan payment, gas, groceries) I have $450/mo to put towards... other things.  Car payment, more loan payments, savings and a little left over for fun stuff?  After depositing my paycheck yesterday I am now sitting on around $12k, about $10k of which is in a savings account.

One of the great things about still being a student is that most of my student loans from undergrad are still in deferment.  I'm planning on budgeting *some* payments, but not like the amounts I'd have to if they weren't deferred.  The loans total in the neighborhood of $47k... which still seems like a HUGE sum to me, but I'm confident that when I get a ""real job"" I'll be fine paying it back.  (studying computer science, hurrah)

I also owe my parents $5000 remaining for my car, which they are generously allowing me to pay back in monthly installments as I am able.

So my question is: what should I be doing with my savings?  Beyond retaining an emergency fund, of course - although I am confident about getting a job, I'd like to have a cushion in case of extenuating circumstances.  I had a scare last semester and it was a huge relief to know that I would be financially secure if worst came to worst.  Should I put it all towards paying back my loans, immediately?  Is investing something I should think about?  I know next to nothing about that, but after reading a bit on here I suspect having money sit in a savings account is not really the way to go.  or... ???

Thanks in advance!"

I'm doing a little experiment for my internship. Basically I want to check which online (social) medium is most effective for advertising a website we want to launch. The idea is to compare advertisements on Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter &amp; Blogs. So I want to create imitation pages with an advertisement of the website on it. Afterwards a little questionnary, which measures their interest in the website etc.

I have a few questions where I can use some input from other people.
1. How should I fill in the rest of the imitation page. I feel like creating random posts is a bit weird. For example, a participant would see a imitation facebook page with an advertisement for our website and random posts..

2. Participants know that they are in a survey/experiment. I feel like that they would actively screen the imitation page because they know they are participating, but in real life they would to it in a passive way. This would mean the results of the survey would be stronger.. how can I prevent this?

If anything is unclear, please ask :) If you have some input or suggestions, that would be great :)

Thanks!"

I got along great with the whole team, and this is where I began to learn programming.  I have become quite proficient in Python, and have been picking up a little Java and more OOP practices as I've been going along since my internship ended.  
  
I would really like to turn software development/engineering into my permanent career, however I am having a lot of trouble finding a places that are willing to give me a chance; i.e. an interview.  I know I'm at a disadvantage since I don't have a CS major, or much to show (as of now, but I'm working on that).  Some people have suggested that I look into Web Dev, but I'm just not all to thrilled with that idea.  When I think back to what I enjoyed the most about my internship, it was the problem solving and the science/engineering involved developing the product that they sold.  
  
I would really like to find a position working for a company that produces a product, and not so much a service.  I know that this probably severely limits my options, but I think this is where I would thrive the most.  I am starting to get to a turning point where I am ready to start flaunting what I've learned and how to apply it to real world situations.  So my questions is: Where do I go from here?  I'm not necessary looking to do embedded programing (but not opposed either), but I would really like to find some place where I assist in creating something that ends up in the real world.  Some examples of stuff that would interest me would be; software for guidance systems, machine vision, automotive computing, GPS systems/navigation, personal electronics, etc.  
  
I hope this has been clear enough.  My experience and knowledge of professional software lingo and roles is still somewhat limited.  Thanks in advance for you responses and advice.  It is greatly appreciated."

I was perfectly happy with her. She was a slim built woman with 32D breasts, brown hair and brown eyes, man was she beautiful. She is from one of those families that just has really good genes. Her dad was British with slight greek heritage and her mother was american with italian family. She had two sisters, Jennifer and Adriana, each a year apart, both as beautiful as her, if given the chance I definitely would have slept with all of them, the mother included, unfortunately that isn’t my story.

One day I walked across the city to visit Victorias house. We always tried to make the best of our ‘time’ when her parents were out at work. I knocked on the door and her youngest sister, Adriana opened the door. “Hi” I said “Is Victoria in?” (I don’t know why I asked this, I knew she was). Adriana was wearing a white shirt and some shorts. The shirt was buttoned up just over half way and the slightest amount of cleavage was on show, her legs were long, tanned and smooth and I had to stop myself from checking her out really obviously. Adriana looked at me and smiled “Hi OP, yeah she is in her room go on up.” She turned around and walked off, her ass looked so good in the shorts, and I felt myself getting turned on (lucky I was going upstairs to get satisfied). 

I walked upstairs and heard that someone was in the shower. I shouted for Victoria and she shouted back from her room, to just come on in. Knowing that my girl was in her bedroom and that Adriana was downstairs, i surmised that this must be the middle sister, Jennifer, in the shower. I peeked through the keyhole, to get a quick glance, but unfortunately I did not have a direct line of sight to the shower, all I could see were Jennifer’s clothes on the floor. (For some reason this was still a huge turn on). I gave up trying to have a peek and left to go fuck Vicky.

She didn’t waste any time getting started. As soon as I walked through her door she pinned me against the wall and started kissing me passionately. Undoing my shirt as fast as she could, she kissed down my body as she fell to her knees and fumbled at my belt. She couldn’t undo it (for some reason) but once it was off she quickly got to work. She took my hard cock in her hand, placed her lips on the tip, looked up at me in the eyes, and slowly took me about half way into her mouth. Now don’t get me wrong, I really fucking love blowjobs, just, she wasn’t very good at them. Needless to say I was appreciative, and enjoyed it a lot, just I’ve had better, and she really isn’t very good at them, and thinks she is a lot better than she is. 

After she was done with that anyway she stood up and walked over to the bed, we kissed a bit more, I fingered her, she gave me a hand job, then she just whispered into my ear “Fuck me”. I climbed on top of her and she guided my cock into her pussy, the first push is always the best one and she let out a loud moan as I slid in. After a few gentle thrusts I started to pick up the pace, pounding in and out of her, my hands exploring her whole body. I knelt up, still inside her, and placed my hands on her waist, ready to pull her around a bit, really get going. Just as we were really getting into it her phone started to ring.

She had been called in to work ASAP to help ‘sort out an account for a client’. Now this didn’t annoy me, that much, because she is an intern and she has to make a real effort to get in with her superiors. But I really wanted to cum. She apologised and said I could let myself out, or wait for her to get back this evening, it was up to me. She got up and was gone 3 minutes after the phone call. I sat up in bed and threw a shirt on.

I heard a noise by the door and looked up. Standing there was Jennifer, her jet black hair still half wet from the shower, wearing a dressing gown. She was smiling.

I was pretty confused at this point and kind of just muttered a meek “Hello”. She simple replied with “Hey” and another smile. Out of the three sisters Jennifer was definitely the best looking. She had recently turned 18 and had long black hair and wide blue eyes. Im not great with breast sizes, but I guess she was kind of a 32C. She was slightly taller than Victoria and quite a bit thinner. Im not gonna lie, I had thought about her a lot, whilst having sex with my girl. 

She walked over in front of me (I was sitting at the edge of the bed at this point) and turned her back to me. She undid her dressing gown and let it fall to the floor. Holy Shit. I was speechless (literally I didn’t want to think about the consequences of anything or wake up if I was dreaming or scare her away or anything). She was wearing a red see-through bra and thong. Without saying a word she sat down and started to grind against me, my cock sliding up and down her glorious ass. I went to hold on to her waist but she pushed my hands away. She was leaning back into me, her hair against my neck, man it was probably one of the best things ever. Or so I thought. After a while, she got off me and dropped to her knees. She placed my cock by her lips and pushed me back on the bed with one hand as she took me as deep as she could. She coughed slightly, which turned me on even more, and then started to slide up and down my cock.

I half sat up just so I could watch her suck on my cock so well (she was a lot better than her sister). She didn’t use her hands at all, just kept sucking me and taking me as deep as she could, coughing and then continuing, she hardly ever took a break. Without changing her rhythm or speed or anything, she used her hand to smoothly take her bra off. Her tits were absolutely stunning, I would say that Victoria’s are pretty damn good, but these, were on another level. So perky and perfectly round. 

She continued to suck me off, and about 10 minutes I felt like I couldn’t hold it in any longer. I tapped her on the shoulder and warned her that I was going to cum. She then did the sexiest thing that anyone has ever done, ever. She opened her eyes, shrugged and did a muffled giggle as she continued to suck on my cock. That sent me over the edge, and I started to cum straight into her mouth, as she swirls her tongue, around the head, cock still in her mouth. Only when she was sure that I had finished cumming did she stop working on me. She let my cock out of her mouth and a little bit of cum fell onto her chest and down the side of her breast. She looked me in the eyes once more and swallowed. Then stood up, smiled and walked out the door to her room. Not a single word from start to finish.

There is more, to do with Jennifer, well to do with the whole family to be perfectly honest. But those stories are for another time. I just thought I would share with you, one of the best afternoons of my life. Hope you enjoyed reading it as much as I enjoyed doing it and writing it. Sorry if this is too long/badly written etc."

206y14,15,2014-03-11,Help! I don't know where else to turn...,WalkaFlakaFlame,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/206y14/help_i_dont_know_where_else_to_turn/,"Hello PF,

I screwed up, I screwed up really bad and I have no idea what to do. I defaulted on my private student loans totaling $93,000. Two of the three loans were with PNC for $61,000 and the third was with Chase for $32,000. Both are defaulted and they want their money now, quite frankly myself nor my parents have that money lying around. PNC offered 10% down and payments of 1% thereafter. Looking at my finances, there is no way I could afford this monthly. 

To make matters worse, my mom and step-dad are co-signed on these loans. To say the least they are freaking out, and I don't blame them. Quite frankly I am freaking out as well, as I have ZERO idea how to handle this or what to tell them. I know I fucked up and I will be the first to admit it. 

About my finances and myself- I am 24, I have my Bachelors degree in Culinary Management from a small private culinary school (First Mistake). I am currently doing a management internship with a large hotel chain that will wrap up at the end of July. My yearly take home with this program is $33,000. My hourly wage is $11.53/hour with 10 hours of overtime guaranteed a week at 17.xx/hour. With that said, my take home bi-weekly has been between $850-$1000. Once the program is completed in July, I move to another hotel where I will hopefully find a position that will pay me $40,000-50,000 annually. On top of these three student loans I have 3 other loans. Two of which are with Sallie Mae and current and the other with nelnet, which is current as well. I also have a car note that is $165.00/Month and a cell phone bill that is $90/month. My rent is $500/ month with all utilities included. I can live pretty cheaply for the most part in terms of living expenses, I do enjoy going out once a month or so and I try to eat majority of my meals at work.

PF, I am open to any and all suggestions, besides leaving country and leaving my family with this $100,000 burden. I am in tears typing this because I have no idea how to handle it or where to even begin. At this point I dont care how long I have to live under a rock to get back on my feet and repair my financial situation, I just want it repaired and to get my life back on track financially. 

Thanks for your help.

Due to the drugs. Now, I am misiribly single. I left my tech school to go full time to my highschool, because I love computer science and they offer classes on it at my highschool. Today I was kicked out of that class, for remotely shutting my teachers computer down. I got a potential job and an internship with my school district ripped out from under me, and now I literally have nothing. Nothing but 5 Xanax bars. I just want it to end, but this would be so unfair to my family. The only thing stopping me from eating these right now is my family and how it would break them. I don't know what to do, today I was walking around holding back tears. I can't live like this for awhile. Something has to give."
206z6a,1,2014-03-11,[rant] but I just found you guys and I couldn't be happier.,[deleted],xxfitness,https://www.reddit.com/r/xxfitness/comments/206z6a/rant_but_i_just_found_you_guys_and_i_couldnt_be/,"I just ate a whole tub of ben and jerry's phish food icecream and sadly, thats not unusual. But it's also not okay. 

I'm a former gymnast, briefly I was a cheerleader (it sucked for me), and I took dance in high school. I used to go on walks all the time too. 

I'm not overweight. But I have no muscle and I lost my flexibility. 

Last year I did yoga in college spring semester and then everything went to hell this summer. I was too busy working either at my job, weddings as a photographer, or doing renovations at home like putting in hardwood floors ourselves. I was burnt out and had no break. Fall semester I crashed and I was sick literally all throughout the semester. I had 3 separate colds. I didn't even know that was possible, I guess I was super stressed. 

I finally had a chance to breath and have a break. I did yoga a bit on my own using youtube videos but I can't do anything regularly because my schedule is never regular and I don't know how to work out on my own. Joining a gym is not an option for me, it's too expensive and I can't afford it right now. My parents would not want to get me a membership either. 

My dad is an overweight PE teacher (300 lb at least) always criticizing me on everything I do and thinking sun and baking soda is the cure all for everything. My mother will always find something to pick on. She is much worse. She is never happy, if i'm skinny and fit she says I look like death, when I gain 10 pounds more than that I am automatically a fatass.  I literally have a photo from one day that she complimented me last year and I looked like crap. It was during renovations and I think she likes to sabotage me completely. She is also incredibly disgusting she always complains about herself and doesn't lift a finger to change anything.

I'm afraid of becoming like them. 

I can't stand myself. I've gained weight recently and I'm miserable. I'm doing everything I feel like I can right now and this is my first step to making an official change. I just installed myfitnesspal and I'll be doing better soon. I'm already doing something but it's slow.

I've been breaking down a lot, especially in front of my bf. I take anything anyone has to say as a criticism because that is what I am used to in my household and with my former friends. I just want to cry all the time. It's hard to get motivation to do anything other than watch netflix when I have time to myself. 

My internship is slow, I'm still a full time student, and now I'll have more time on my hands because i'll basically only be working saturdays. I'm taking this opportunity to change myself. I really do have the motivation, I need to learn discipline. 

I'm working out completely on my own. I've started a new skin care regimen too and am changing everything I don't like about myself. I really think I can strengthen up and learn to discipline myself in a community like this from all the posts I've been reading. I can't wait to get started officially here and doing much more than I am already.

So far all I do is yoga once or twice a week and I started eating more veggies. This of course, isn't nearly enough haha. 

My plan is to track what I eat and start slowly. Do yoga 6 days a week, and running on my treadmill 3 days a week. I really have never been an endurance runner and I'd like to change that.

I just needed to post this somewhere. I hate any other online community I've been a part of. Tumblr is full of horny snobs when i started posting my fitness progress, new makeup looks while I was learning, and inspiration last year (I was always on my phone online) I got really weird messages and I began hating people all over again. I just like seeing my progress. Thats all this is. Something I can look back on. 

I was confident in myself when I was a gymnast, and I want that person back before she was broken by the people around her. 

This is day 1 of tracking progress. "
207dpj,141,2014-03-12,Why cycling has been the greatest thing to ever happen to me: a love story.,cygnusx1_,bicycling,https://www.reddit.com/r/bicycling/comments/207dpj/why_cycling_has_been_the_greatest_thing_to_ever/,"I started university four years ago. Fresh out of high school, I came to school with a bitchin' attitude, ready to kick some ass and get into medical school. But rather than focusing on my education, I let myself get lost in the freedom - I was finally away from my parents, at school, ready to have the time of my life. They say university is the best time of your life, right? Fucking wrong.

Instead, I started slacking. I started hanging out with the wrong crew; I started smoking, drinking, and stopped giving a shit. I'd do OK my first semester, rock C's and B's, but never an A, which always fueled my depression.
Long story short - this continued for two and a half years until I had a chance to do a co-op internship and take a year off of school to do some work in my field. In that time, I had moved in with a friend. That friend's brother and I would hang out, and he would rant about how awesome bikes were and how we was looking around everywhere to buy himself some fan-dangled ""cyclocross"" bike. I had no idea what the fuck he was talking about, but then he brought it home one day, and in my fucking unfit state of mind, I took it for a test ride. It whooped my ass, *but I loved it.* 

The next day I scour craigslist until I found a shitty old Apollo road bike that was way too small for me for $200 (Vancouver has a weird market). I bought it and that night I rode 30km around town. It was insane. I loved every moment, even though it nearly destroyed me.

A few days later, I sell my car and buy myself a mid-2000's Trek. It was a huge step up, and I started commuting to work. Each and every day, I would get up at 5 in the morning, and leave by 5:45 for my 25km commute to the neighbouring suburb. It was hard at first, but I got better. I got faster, my legs seemed to be a little firmer, and it was honestly my favourite part of each day. I began smoking less, too. It's weird; I could never convince myself I didn't like smoking until then.

A few weeks later, I sell the Trek and buy myself a brand new Masi. I loved that fucking thing. I rode it everywhere all the time, and it was my trusty steed. It was flashy too - people would look and compliment it and I felt great on it. I also got lycra at that point and felt like Lance fucking Armstrong, but far better looking.

Fast forward: a few months later, the love of my life breaks up with me. I'm devastated. I contemplate stupid shit, and I end up barely eating for 2 weeks and slowly withering away. But one day, my roomie convinced me to go for a ride. And so I did. And for that brief moment in time, I felt OK. The next day, I started eating again, cut my hair, and shaved. I was putting myself together. A week later, I quit smoking. I started taking control of my life, all because of that little bike ride.

My life is now fucking awesome. I ride my bike each and every day, everywhere I go, no matter what the weather is or how I feel in the morning. I get on and I fucking do it - and that mentality has moved on to everything in my life. I'm back in school, and for the first time in my university career, I'm killing all my advanced chemistry and physics classes and getting perfect marks on my midterms. Hell, I'm even going to apply to CalTech and MIT now because of my vastly improved work effort and references. My PI is a cyclist and that's how I got to do a thesis with him - he noticed my cycling shoes!

I attribute this all to biking. Biking made me get my shit together, and for that, I will always ride a bike. Nothing makes me happier than a ride.

Thanks for listening. I'll see you on the road, reddit."

I'm doing a little experiment for my internship. Basically I want to check which online (social) medium is most effective for advertising a website we want to launch. The idea is to compare advertisements on Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter &amp; Blogs. So I want to create imitation pages with an advertisement of the website on it. Afterwards a little questionnary, which measures their interest in the website etc.

I have a few questions where I can use some input from other people.
1. How should I fill in the rest of the imitation page. I feel like creating random posts is a bit weird. For example, a participant would see a imitation facebook page with an advertisement for our website and random posts..
2. Participants know that they are in a survey/experiment. I feel like that they would actively screen the imitation page because they know they are participating, but in real life they would to it in a passive way. This would mean the results of the survey would be stronger.. how can I prevent this?

Also, this internship is part of my education, and my school requires me to do a survey so I had to go in this direction with the experiment.
If anything is unclear, please ask :) If you have some input or suggestions, that would be great :)

Thanks!"

207y1u,0,2014-03-12,URL Web Filtering System Help,scsean,androiddev,https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/207y1u/url_web_filtering_system_help/,"Hi everyone,

I'm just looking for some friendly advice on something I'm trying to get my head around at my internship. I've been tasked with researching and coming up with a new URL Web Filtering system, my boss said he'd preferablly like to pay for one rather than use the current custom basic one we currently use for the App.


Some background on the App, it's an App that allows parents to install it onto their childs phone and then monitor their call &amp; texts, photo's, Apps, Location and Internet Browsing. The Apps working perfectly fine and the current system of how the Internet is filtered on the phone works mostly fine, but it can be better. 

Currently the way the App monitors the browsing history is by checking the server which has a database with a list of pre-defined categories, keywords that when a child searches for them on google it will then redirect the webpage to a html page saying this action has been blocked. 

The issue though is the current filtering system doesn't block google images or many other search engines. Also we don't have a database of already pre-defined blacklisted websites so a lot of the time the children could have already been accessing unsafe content and only afterwords will the parents know and then block the site.


I've been looking at a product called [URLfilterDB!](http://www.urlfilterdb.com/en/products/howitworks.html), just wondering if anyone could give me some advice on how or if we could implement this into our Android App.

Much Thanks!"
2089ui,350,2014-03-12,Beneath the ice,jdpatric,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/2089ui/beneath_the_ice/,"Lake Vostok is covered by some 4,000 meters of ice. It’s been cut off from the world by the thick ice sheet for approximately fifteen million years. The water is kept liquid by the massive pressure exerted by the ice above, and possibly by geothermal heat from beneath the Earth’s crust. The Antarctic summer is the only time the continent can be regularly inhabited due to the incredible cold. In 2011 Russia began drilling to reach Lake Vostok. It’s thought that the water can offer a unique view on life that has evolved separated from the rest of the world for fifteen million years.

In 2012 I was a PhD student and was lucky enough to be able to work with a Russian scientist on examining the ice cores created by the lake drilling. Once the drill was just above the surface of the lake it would be extracted slowly, drawing the water up the borehole. This water was no longer under the massive pressure that kept the rest of the water liquid and it would freeze in the borehole, creating a plug. This plug itself could be drilled out and studied. I was one of the interns who made the trip to Antarctica in the summer of 2012. We finished our work in early February and left the next day. 

Once we had the cores back to the lab we were able to safely analyze them. We’ve been keeping them frozen to analyze the dissolved particles and gasses as they are in the lake. There are some theories that the many subglacial lakes under Antarctica are connected via passageways. This would mean that we’re studying not just one, but all of the lakes under the ice. This past year we finally got the go ahead to let one of the cores thaw. We’d finally be able to analyze water that hasn’t seen the light of day in thousands of years, quite possibly far longer than that.

I cut a small section of the deepest core, the one right next to the water’s surface, into an enclosed environment and began to gradually increase the temperature above 0° C. We wanted to capture the gasses as they were let off, so we had a small balloon-like device working to capture and monitor the gas release. The device is very sensitive and can basically tell if you’ve eaten seafood in the last six months, for example. It immediately picked up on an incredibly high oxygen level in the water. We knew that there would be a lot of dissolved oxygen in the water, due to the enormous pressure above it, but the water seemed to have enough oxygen in the water to support all manner of living things. The PhD I was working with, also one of the smartest people I knew personally, and probably one of the smartest people alive at the time, said, and I quote, “if a dinosaur were alive today he could probably breathe that water to survive.” Now, I know he was joking, the age of the water was probably ~13,000 years give or take due to the residence time of Lake Vostok, but he was at the very least a little bit serious about the water having a high enough oxygen content to sustain life.


We tested several other gasses from the water and found that it contained nitrogen, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, and several other trace gasses that were in such small amounts they could have been introduced by a dying lizard or fish as it swam by millennia ago. We just kept coming back to the high oxygen count. When the dinosaurs were alive the temperature on earth was much greater, and the oxygen in the atmosphere was also much higher. After the entire sample had melted we took stock of our information and finally found the first trace of life in the new water.

It appeared as though several species of algae had evolved to withstand the incredible temperature and the massive pressure of the water. It thrived in the oxygen rich water, feeding off of small inorganic particles that were carried by the massive glacier above. No light made its way that deep, so the algae were small and mostly stuck to the bottom of the glacier. It was amazing; I had the information I needed for my thesis, the PhD I was working with was surely going to win yet another award, and we were both going to be famous. But then catastrophe struck.

The man I was working with, at this point I can call him a friend, suffered a massive stroke during the following night. He stayed on life support for several days, only briefly coming to consciousness a few times. He said goodbye to his loved ones, those still living, and told me to continue my research with his blessing. He lingered for about a week before finally passing due to another stroke. I was devastated. I knew the man professionally, but in the past several years we’d spent enough time together that I regarded him as a second father in my life.

Finally after two weeks off I decided to go back into the lab. Only…everything wasn’t the same. I don’t mean that it wasn’t the same doing my research without my mentor. I understood that, my brain could comprehend it. I didn’t like it, but I know that no one lives forever. The lab had changed. Something seemed different as soon as I walked in the door. The sample looked like it was in a different spot; I was sure I’d left it in its balloon/container, but yet it was sitting now directly on our lab table. It was still in an airtight location, but I wasn’t about to just leave it there on the table, so I again moved it inside the balloon. The remainder of the core was still frozen in storage…or so I thought. We had each core separated to prevent cross contamination. It was very unlikely, but we basically went with the “why risk it?” mentality, and it paid off; the deepest core had thawed completely. There was a short in the circuitry of the refrigeration unit for that specific core. It had nearly caught fire. We had one core that was close to it, and decided to defrost a section of that core next.

While doing so we filmed it via a high speed camera for future use. We wanted to see in many frames the structure of the ancient water as it broke down and became liquid again. It was an interesting experiment until the camera appeared to be malfunctioning. The levels of dissolved organic compounds in the water were unusually high. High enough that it was as though a large creature had died in the water before it was frozen. Particles we usually found in large fresh water bodies such as the American Great Lakes were found in abundance in this sample. The camera was actually capturing sediments trapped in the frozen water at the surface of the lake; something had to have disturbed them. My supervisor, another PhD, requested permission to return to Antarctica for the summer of 2013-2014. We nearly didn’t make it due to the US government shutdown, but our project was one of the few that were spared the axe.

I arrived in January and began setting up shop at our scientific outpost. We had been partnering with the Vostok Station, but due to the shutdown and several poor coordination policies our spot in Vostok had been booked so to speak. Our solution was to use a more dated facility that had since been abandoned. Basically everything inside was frozen solid when our team arrived, but we were able to thaw what we needed and replace the rest, and within our first week we had a fully functioning station.

The borehole we were using was situated directly below the station. It made for easy access during the coldest months of the year, and was designed to be able to operate year round. The hole had been drilled prior to my arrival and was simply waiting to be cored when I landed. The core process is incredibly intricate; the drill pulls the cores up from beneath the ice and a sharp blade cuts them to a specified length, and so that they fit inside our building. Once we’ve reached the bottom core the drill uses itself to plug the hole and the water inside freezes again creating more samples from the lake.

I was to have two assistants and my supervisor, but due to my expertise on the matter, and the fact that I’d worked so much on the initial project, I was to be handling most of the work on the project. This was great for me; I enjoyed it, and I really felt like I was going to have an incredible thesis and a fantastic starting point for my post grad career. 

Things were going smoothly until the drill became lodged in the borehole. The assistants were both undergrads at the university I went to. One of them wasn’t properly operating the drill and managed to get it lodged at a very slight angle in the hole. Over 4,000 meters a slight angle can be catastrophic, but the bit didn’t shear; it was just stuck. This required a specialist to dislodge. I had a few small core samples and a solid scientific lab onsite so I continued my analysis.

The technician arrived and informed us that the end of the bit was likely going to fall into the lake when he removed the rod; indicating we’d need a new drill. We’d still be able to core out the “plug” that would form, but we’d need to get a new bit for future boreholes. My supervisor decided that he would be taking both of my assistants with him once we had enough cores for me to work with. I’ve been alone before in our research base in Antarctica, so I wasn’t really bothered by this prospect. We cored out the plug and I had several thousand meters of newly frozen lake water to work with. They left the following day, leaving me alone, presumably for a period of three weeks.

The first few days after they left I didn’t have any problems. I hadn’t melted any of the samples yet. As soon as I went to melt the very first one, a sample of about five kilograms, I began to run into problems. While it was melting I had our camera on it for posterity, I looked away and the fragment had moved completely out of the frame. Just like that, maybe two or three seconds. I quickly ran into the lab to check the gear and the sample. The ambient temperature in the room was only slightly above freezing, but there was already a small puddle of water around the core on the tray. I replaced it and went back to my observation room where I’d be able to watch in relative warmth that the lab didn’t offer.

Back in the observation room I noticed that the door leading to the sleeping quarters and kitchen was slightly ajar. That was a big no-no; we didn’t like to leave compartment doors open in case of a bad storm, like the one we were having; if the outer compartment was breached the inner compartments needed to remain warm enough to support…life…well, us. Sure, we had emergency survival suits, and backup plans with backups, but I was sure I’d closed that door.

Nothing else seemed to happen that day, and I went to bed without incident. When I woke I could hear the storm hammering loudly on the outside of the building. It was intense. The weather report for the station was 90 kilometer per hour winds, and a driving blizzard. The temperature was below -60° C. It was close to condition 1 weather; the worst it can get. Luckily for me I was happily going to work on another sample today, this time extracting the dissolved oxygen and studying how it increased or decreased with depth in the borehole. That was what I was going to do…until I got into the lab. My sample was gone. The initial sample I’d melted the previous day had vanished. It hadn’t evaporated, the air in the lab was filtered and climate controlled; if any evaporated it wouldn’t have been the entire sample.

I was perplexed, and I began to think that there was someone else in the facility. It wasn’t a large base, there weren’t many places for someone to hide, but I began to see things. Right as I went into the kitchen that night for dinner I briefly saw what looked like a person running from the room as I entered. I just saw a shadow…it might have been my imagination, but it really looked like a person. 

The power went out that night; the facility blew a fuse. I was awoken by bitter cold and an alarm that should have woken me earlier. I quickly dressed and went to swap the fuse with a good one. Once I got to the electrical panel I was standing at the end of a long dark hallway about forty meters long. I briefly shined my light all the way down to the end and managed to see a person duck behind the next hall. I put the new fuse in, flipped the power and tore off in a run, determined to catch my target. I rounded the bend and…nothing, no person, no surprise, just nothing. Puzzled, I made my way back to my room and tried to fall back to sleep. The storm was still hammering on the side of the building, and it was doing so with an eerie frequency; it seemed to have a rhythm to it…I began to think that maybe something was stuck to the side of the building and floundering against the wall in the extreme wind. I laid there for hours until I finally fell asleep for a few minutes before I had to wake to begin the day.

My day finally began to get better when I was analyzing a small piece of sediment that appeared to have come from the lake bottom. It was incredibly old, and actually had a small amount of algae that had accumulated on what I assumed to be the upward facing side of the particle. I was looking into the microscope when something heavy fell off of the table behind me. Startled, I quickly went to turn around and bumped my microscope, moving my sample without realizing it. When I looked back into the microscope I saw blood. Not mine, not human for that matter, it was brown, which made me think it was dead blood, but there were living blood cells that I’d never seen before on my slide! I had made a breakthrough! It was incredible. I’d discovered a type of life that had evolved on its own separated from the rest of Earth for millions of years! My jubilation, however, was short lived; how were the cells alive? They were floating in water cold enough to freeze yet remaining liquid due to the incredible pressure placed on top of it. Most living creatures don’t possess the proper coping mechanisms to live through this…let alone to produce a blood cell that can live outside the body in these conditions.

I began to quickly test the remainder of my sample, and sure enough there were more blood cells floating freely in the water. This was amazing! I was suddenly far less concerned with the odd things that had been happening around the facility. Nearly two weeks had gone by since my colleagues had left to get a new drill bit, and here I was making an earthshattering discovery that was going to lead to the next “Galapagos Islands,” except this time it was under 4,000 meters of ice in one of the most inhospitable environments on Earth. I went to bed that night under full condition 1 weather. It was bad. Warning claxons went on and off throughout the night indicating gusts of well over 100 kilometers per hour. The temperature had dipped to a record low for the month of March; -80° C. The facility could withstand this onslaught, or at least it was designed to handle much worse. 

I woke around 1:00 am local time to a loud smashing sound on the side of the building. The walls were double thick and insulated by a vacuum space between the outer and inner walls, yet something was banging on it loud enough to wake me. I knew I couldn’t go outside in condition 1 so I tried in vain to go back to sleep until I again noticed an odd pattern to the banging. I’ll describe it best I can.

After it repeated a few times I thought that it might be Morse code, and had the horrifying thought that there might be someone trapped outside our station. Maybe my colleagues had returned and I was basically ignoring their pleas for help. I ran to the monitoring station where we had a CCTV camera attached to the outside that we could use to monitor the main entry door. I quickly flicked it on and found, to my dismay that it was fully iced over. I could see only a small corner of the door and ice. I was about to give up when I briefly saw a shadow on the door. Someone WAS there! I ran to get fully dressed. I was going to have to break the rules and open the door and airlock to condition 1 weather. No one is allowed outside in this weather, but if someone was already out there…something bad had happened, maybe there’d been an accident on the return trip and they’d been unable to alert me?

I ran back to the door as best as my thick clothes would allow and flicked on the light to the airlock and the outside. I opened the first door and found the airlock filled with frozen moisture that had accumulated on the walls and floor. The door was nearly frozen shut. I clipped a safety rope to my waist and then to the railing on the wall and forced the door open. If I hadn’t clipped in…I probably wouldn’t be here today; the door was ripped from my hands in a massive wind gust and I fell straight into the abyss.

After struggling to stand for a few seconds I saw that no one was there. The entryway was slightly out of the elements, but for the most part it was in the thick of the storm. I tried screaming to see if anyone was nearby and I couldn’t even hear myself. I glanced towards where my sleeping quarters were, now fully illuminated by the outside lights, and saw two sizeable dents in the wall. I couldn’t see any further than that…it was only a few meters anyways, and I decided that I had lost it. I reached for the door to shut it and head back inside when I thought I saw something in the snow.

Eyes can play tricks on you when you are staring into snow so thick that visibility is limited to a distance of a few meters in winds so severe you can barely stand upright while holding onto a safety rope. But…I could see a figure standing in the snow. That shouldn’t be possible; no one should be able to stand upright in this without support, and yet I could see all the way through the madness and clearly tell the outline of a person as I had turned to go back inside. I quickly stopped and tried to yell at them…but as I did so I moved suddenly and had to readjust my glance. They were gone. Had I imagined it again?

I had to get inside. I grabbed the heavy door and tried to drag it shut, but my feet weren’t catching on the slippery terrain. I ended up having to tie the safety rope around one of the railings on the doors and use the wall railings for leverage to pull it shut from inside the airlock. As soon as I was surrounded by an odd sense of silence. The storm was still raging outside, but suddenly my overloaded ears were ringing in the relative silence of the airlock. I made my way back to my quarters and noticed that the banging had picked up again. Something had to have come loose from the facility. It had to be stuck to the walls. That was the only rational explanation.

I forced myself to sleep. It wasn’t easy. Finally it happened. When I woke I was greeted by a call saying that my colleagues had again been delayed due to the horrible weather. They were going to have to emergently evacuate me soon if things didn’t improve. The bit was ready to be delivered, but they couldn’t access the station. The goal was to get station drill-capable again before full winter kicked in. Meanwhile, I continued my research and made one of the most amazing discoveries of the millennium.

There was tissue in one of our frozen samples. TISSUE! Our drill had hit a living creature in the water under the ice. Whether the creature survived or not I had no idea, but our drill had managed to hit it and cut a small sample of tissue. I immediately went to record my findings and report to our home base, but as I did I noticed our communications were down. I tried to connect to the internet and was greeted with the spinning wheel of lag; nothing. I was now cut off from the outside world. 

As soon as this happened I heard an alarm that I hadn’t heard before. The severe weather alarms were shrill and short; this one was louder and longer. I ran to my instrument panel to figure out what it was…water was coming up the borehole into the station. That shouldn’t have been possible; the ice should have frozen all the way up to the top long ago, and created a plug. Like an artesian well the water under pressure would have a certain head to it and come so high up the tube before finally equalizing and remaining stationary. We’d calculated that distance as being less than 3,900 meters from the surface of the lake. We should have had 100 meters of safety, but when I ran into the borehole room I was greeted by several centimeters of water sloshing about. I had waterproof boots, and quickly donned them. 

The borehole was open. The ice plug…gone. I looked down it with a light, and as far as I could see the ice was gone. We needed to seal the hole in a hurry. The hole was only about fifteen centimeters in diameter, but water seemed to be coming up from the depths…apparently our calculations were wrong. I began to run the drill controls. The bit itself was gone, but with nothing to impede it I could insert the remainder into the borehole and use it as a plug…the only problem was the ambient temperature in the room. I suddenly noticed that it was warm…unusually so. I had to flood the room with the outside air, and then the water would freeze in moments. There were vents in the ceiling that could be manually opened allowing the harsh air in, for just such an occasion, only we didn’t expect to have to do so in condition 1 weather. I quickly climbed up and cranked the lever opening both the inner and outer walls. The air whipped in through the slits and the temperature dropped to freezing in moments. With the drill in place the water began to solidify nicely, I was then able to remove it and let the hole freeze over as before…only I had no idea what’d caused the thaw.

I made my way back to my sample to find that it was gone. That was the last straw. My equipment was disturbed, slides moved, and my groundbreaking discovery was missing. I made to go cut a new sample and as I did I opened the door to our freezer room, which was actually normally slightly warmer than the outside temperature at present, and found…that everything had defrosted. Our 4,000 meter ice core was sloshing about on the floor of the facility slowly freezing again. My samples were ruined. I was about to storm out of the room when I noticed something lying on a shelf near the back of the room. If the ice had defrosted nothing should be there. I went to investigate…and it looked like a mummified corpse. It was black, blue and withered. Shriveled into a contorted position and it looked like it had too many limbs. Suddenly it started crawling towards me, using more than two arms, and maybe an extra leg. I fell backwards and caught myself on a shelf before I landed in the water. I was trudging through several centimeters of water to begin with, and now I was running. It moved on the shelf about waist high and climbed around the outer edge to get to the next level up. I reached the door moments before it did and slammed it, locking the sample room as I did. I opened the ceiling vents to try to freeze the room…and whatever was inside it…and then realized that this probably wouldn’t bother it much if it’d been living where I thought it had.

I ran to the crew quarters and locked myself in. I had access to the kitchen, living quarters, and sleeping quarters, without having to go near the lab. I was going to be emergently evacuated soon…I could just wait it out. Except…I couldn’t be reached via coms at present. I tried to access our communications and found that the internet was back, but that our radio communications were down. I had several messages asking if I was OK; apparently they were receiving emergency distress beacons from within our lab. The water alarm had also caught their attention. I told them what had happened and they didn’t believe me. Told me I was crazy. Maybe I was. I was alone in the Antarctic, and I’d been there for nearly a month. They likened it to an astronaut on the ISS suffering from anxiety. I managed to calm myself down a little. The CCTV’s showed nothing moving anywhere else on the station. I grabbed a flare gun and a pry bar; I had no other weapons, and slowly made my way through back to the lab. Everything seemed…normal. I received a report that they were sending an emergency transport to pick me up the following morning. The weather was going to break for the last time before full winter and they were going to deliver the parts for the drill, get me and go. I still had to pack up some equipment and whatever samples I could save.

I avoided the sample room at all costs. The lab still had a few samples under lock and key and I quickly placed those in our freezer coolers for transport and grabbed a few pieces of equipment that we’d need back at home base. I needed to visit the sample room eventually…I needed to inspect for damages and deactivate the internal thermostat. It was still on to keep the temperature regulated and I’d need to do that from inside. The room had been freezing for several hours and when I cracked the door open the water was several centimeters high frozen on the door. I carefully trekked across to the far side of the room and turned the thermostat to nil; letting the outside air control the temperature for the winter. I carefully watched the waist high shelves where our ice cores had once lain and made my way back to the door as quickly as I could. When I was nearly there I caught movement and looked up.

There it was, on the very top shelf, frozen nearly solid. Reaching for me and the door as best it could, but the ice was finally freezing it to where it couldn’t move. I swung wildly at it with the pry bar and it managed to grab it out of my hand. I slipped and caught myself on the handle. The thing tried to slink down the shelves as it had earlier, but its previous grace was gone and it was cracking ice off of its arms as it moved. I slammed the door and locked it once again. I didn’t have a camera on the inside, but I could hear its stiff movements…the ice breaking from its limbs as it moved. It was like ice fishing; the water had finally frozen the fish.

As I slowly backed away from the room I heard a light humming sound and realized that something had closed the vents from the inside. I was done. I returned to my quarters and locked the doors yet again. That night before the storm abated it struck again, hard. I could hear the same weather alarms, and finally the banging on the walls again. It seemed different that night though…almost defeated.

The banging eventually subsided and I never actually fell asleep. The weather slowed down shortly before morning, and once it was truly morning, it wasn’t actually light outside, but 8:00 am our time, I was finally close to leaving. My colleague radioed in, yes my radio had finally came back; apparently the storm was blocking the communications to some degree, he was less than thirty minutes away. After a short wait with all of my gear ready to walk out the door I was alerted to our main airlock being opened. I thought I’d have received another call, but maybe he made it early. I went to check and there was no one there. No snowmobile, no vehicle, no people. Puzzled, I stood around for a moment until I saw footprints leading away from the facility, and into the snow. There seemed to be too many of them…and they were bare footprints...the gait seemed to be off. A fresh snow was falling, and I was about to take a picture of them when I again realized…no one would believe me.

I went back inside and received a burst transmission from the Russian Vostok Station. It was static-filled and mostly incoherent. They must’ve known that I didn’t speak Russian because the voice was speaking heavily accented English. It was hard to decipher, but I finally could make out a few words. “We…tried…warm.” It didn’t make sense at first so I replayed it several times, eventually I realized they weren’t saying “warm,” but instead…”warn.” Startled I deleted the message and backed away from my computer until I heard the airlock door open again. I grabbed a different pry bar and went to investigate. This time it was my ride. I loaded the sled and got out of there as quickly as I could.

The Russians in the Vostok Station had been carrying out a similar experiment to ours using a different cored location a few miles away. Their schedule was a few weeks ahead of ours, however, and I can only assume they came to the same conclusion as I did.

208b7y,123,2014-03-12,{C}remation,nicmccool,nicmccool,https://www.reddit.com/r/nicmccool/comments/208b7y/cremation/,"I come from a small town where the only jobs for freshly graduated college kids stupid enough to return home are fast food and Walmart, so I practically peed myself when Anita called me out of the blue and offered me an internship. It’s not the most ideal job, and it’s something I have to lie about when I talk to other people or I get a lot of really stupid questions -- “Does it smell in there, Cassie?”, “Do you ever, *you know*, check out peoples’ wangs?”, “Are you scared?”-- but it’s a weekly paycheck and I have the chance to stay on after a year. 

First off, I’ve got two brothers so I’ve pretty much seen it all. Steven used to bring home deer and rabbits, and skin them right outside my bedroom window. Chad, he was normal, but he’d always show up with some freak injury that he’d be more than happy to shove in my face while I was trying to eat my Cap’n Crunch. I can safely say I was a already fairly morbid midwestern girl far before I started working at Reynolds Funeral Home. 

And secondly, you can’t just turn down an offer to work in a funeral home. Forget all the dead bodies stuff, being a mort tech is a *cushy* job. I mean, that’s why they always keep it in the family! I think I work about twenty total hours a week, get paid for forty, and spend all my free time in the upstairs lounge on one of the pastel rose couches reading my kindle and avoiding Centaur, Anita’s mastiff with a affinity for humping my hip. Plus, did I say I may get to stay on in a year? I mean, that’s like a *life* gig; the golden ticket and all those other corny cliches. So, when weird things happen in a mortuary you tend to ignore them, because the perks are good. 

That’s normal, right?

Okay, so a few days ago I got called in to prep two bodies; a mother and son poisoning, which as sad as it seems is a pretty big cash cow for funeral homes. We’ll take nice safe heart attacks and poisonings any day of the week over gun shots and car wrecks. There’s no physical reconstruction, maybe a little around the mouth if there happened to be a large amount of bile or resuscitation efforts, but it’s way better than trying to jigsaw puzzle somebody’s face back together. And as in any business two is always better than one. 

We’re a small funeral home, you could almost call us mom and pop, except Anita’s husband died a few weeks ago, so I guess we’re a mom and random girl business. We don’t have a whole lot of money for sub freezes and heavy duty storage like you see on tv with the stacked drawers and stuff. We’ve got one positive temp storage in the basement with an old Mopec table, and three gurneys for overflow. The door to storage is one of those big steel insulated ones that seals when it’s shut, so when you latch it down you can’t hear a thing on the other side. Which is why the noise really freaked me out. 

I was washing down the boy, he smelled like strawberries and stomach acid, and I was lost in thought about some teen romance I was reading when I heard a shuffling sound. I said the storage was sealed shut, right? Like, no sound? Because, that’s what I was used to and when I heard it, let’s just say I jumped *over* the table like I was an Olympic freakin’ high jumper. 

“What the fuck?!” I screamed. Not the most eloquent I admit, but it got the point across. “Anita, are you messing with me?”

She wasn’t, I mean, she never had in the past and she wasn’t the type to randomly prank an employee surrounded by dead bodies. She’s like a grown up Wednesday Addam’s, but with less personality. I scanned the room slowly, looking at the empty corners first, then counted all the tools on the instrument cart. One saw? Check. Two bone cutters? Check. Two flush retractors? Check. One really big pair of scissors? Nope. 

“Seriously?!” I screamed. It came out much louder than I was expecting in the small room and I raised my hands to block my ears. In my right hand the scissors came extremely close to stabbing me in the temple. “Oh,” I said to no one. I must have grabbed them off the cart when I hurdled the boy. 

*The boy*. 

I raised the scissors up in what I thought was an intimidating pose. “Don’t be moving. Don’t be moving. Don’t be moving…,” I chanted in my head; a prayer to a god or gods or whatever was enjoying this shit-show. “Please, please don’t be moving.” My eyes cut from the instrument table to the grossing station along one wall, to the sealed concrete floor that concaved into a drain under the table, and then up the table to two tiny feet that shone a waxy pink in the harsh overhead lights. The toes moved. “They didn’t move, Cassie. You just blinked.” I stared at them for thirty seconds, wanting them not to move, but somehow hoping they would. They didn’t and I traced up the rest of the body with my eyes. “Definitely dead,” I thought. 

And then something launched itself against the outside of the door. 

I screamed. Of course I screamed. I screamed so loud I looked over to see if the woman on the gurney would sit up and tell me to keep it down because she was trying to sleep. The scissors clanged to the floor. They weren’t just dropped, they were propelled against the steel door with all the force I, the person directly referenced in the insult “you throw like a girl” because I *am* that girl, could muster. I squatted down and covered my head, because I heard somewhere that’s what you do when everything goes freakin’ bonkers, and kept screaming. 

On my third pause for air I realized that everything was dead quiet again. “Dead quiet? Nice one, Cassie,” I thought and pulled myself up off the floor. My hands brushed the fingertips of the boy on the table and I was half tempted to either hold his hand for comfort or crouch back down and start screaming again until the Army, or Navy, or freakin’ Marines blasted through that door to rescue me. “Daddy was a Marine,” I thought. 

Fuck. 

What would my dad think of his only daughter, crouched on the floor of an over-sized refrigerator, scared of some random noises outside? The trembling in my arms slowed, my lip stopped quivering. “It’s probably just Anita moving in a new table,” I thought. “Or maybe they’re replacing the propane for the cremator.” The latter was probably true. We hadn’t gotten new propane in months, so we were due for a refill. “Just poke your head out, Cassie,” I said to myself and the two cold bodies behind me. “Just poke your head out and see.”

My fingers grasped the metal latch and pulled up. Stuck.

“Fuck this, I’m done,” I said as panic started to wash over me. And then, in some rational part of my brain my dad said, “Push down, Cassandra.” I was calm again. “Duh,” I thought and pushed the latch down. The door opened outward with a soft release of air. 

The basement of the funeral home goes the full length of the building, but the building itself is not that big, so when standing at the partially open door of cold storage and looking out one can see the big gaping metal mouth of the industrial furnace the house was built around forty years ago. Brickwork lines the outside of the furnace marred black from residual blow-back after years of “cooks”. A rack of rollers stand on metal stilts and angle into the furnace’s mouth like a long, silver ridged tongue. Today the rollers were empty, but the mouth was open. Fire licked up on the inside of the furnace casting the entire side of the building in a blue-red strobe. A black shadow inside the mouth twitched and thrashed in the flames.

Twitched and thrashed.

I thought I was blinking again, I thought my eyes were lying, so I stared. My head poking out from behind the clean steel door looking across floors grooved by years of gurneys into the wide mouth of a furnace where a black object morphed to ashes and twitched. I stared until the light from the flames hurt my eyes and left rose blooms of red on the backs of my lids when they were closed. I blinked out what I thought I saw, re-saw the image, and tried to blink it out again. “Definitely twitching,” I thought. “Maybe it’s just a cross-breeze coming down through the chimney -”

And then it screamed.

A howling painful yell ripped from the throat of whatever burned in that fire. A scream of seizure and ecstasy. A scream both primal and knowledgeable enough to know that this sound was the last imprint it would leave on the world. A scream that gurgled out with the boiling blood of its throat until nothing was left but the soft whimpering pleas of the remaining dust. 

I slammed the metal door behind me and latched it shut. I slid to the floor and tucked my head between my knees and covered my head. I stayed in that position for what seemed like hours but could have been minutes when the Marines finally came knocking at the door.

“Cassie?” the Marine who sounded an awful lot like Anita Reynolds said from outside the door. “Cassie are you almost done with the wash down?”

“Almost,” I found myself replying. “Almost. Give me another few minutes.” 

“Okay,” the voice said, and then it was gone. 

I found myself standing, picking the scissors up off the floor, and putting them back on the instrument table. I thumbed down the switch on the shower head. “That wasn’t really a scream,” I said to the dead in the room. “I mean, it was definitely *not* a scream, right?” I took their silence as affirmation. I went back to washing the boy and his mother and never mentioned what I saw or heard.

208i90,1,2014-03-12,Tell me what Ya'll think about my transfer essay,[deleted],Proofreading,https://www.reddit.com/r/Proofreading/comments/208i90/tell_me_what_yall_think_about_my_transfer_essay/,"Growing up I was never that special. I was never the most smart or artistic in class,  or even good at sports. Even worst,  I was almost always the shortest or second to being shortest in class. All those traits meant a combination that led to low self confidence for years to come.





By the time i graduated middle school it had only gotten worse. In my mind , it was as if highschool was a movie except I wasn’t acting in it but merely watching it flash by. Numerous opportunities were put in front of me such as clubs, sports, and other activities but I still stayed in my shell. But one day in my junior year something changed and I realized that I can’t just let life or high school for that matter pass by. In addition to becoming a member of the Future Business Leaders of America I took one of the biggest risks of my life and joined the Rugby team. Playing rugby was a scary thought, being the smallest person on the team and the fact that I was a rookie while all my teammates knew all the rules was very hard to overcome. Being in that position made me work twice as harder than everyone else and i still would barely get any playing time. So many times I thought to just quit. I said to myself “Why waste time going to practice and going to the games, when I dont even get to play”. Eventually the odds were in my favor and everyone who could play my position was either injured or tired and I finally got the chance to go in. Now this isn’t like most sports movies, so I didn’t score the winning goal or make an amazing play, I probably only ran a few yards. Yet I still got a chance to prove my worth. From that point on I finally felt empowered, I felt like with enough hard work I could do anything I put my mind to.








Attending college at the University of Bridgeport taught me a lot about myself and the world around me. I knew i had a lot to adjust to if I wanted to succeed. The workload and constant distractions that university life brings made me manage my time wisely.College forced me to step out of my comfort zone once again.  At one point I was even playing basketball on a team of international transfer students from china. Although I appreciate everything UB has did for me I feel it is best for me to transfer to Uconn Stamford.  As French nobel prize winner Andre Gide said, “Man cannot discover new oceans until he has the courage to lose sight of shore”. Uconn is known across the country as one of the best public learning institutions. The school is rich with culture and academically is up to par with ivy league schools.Attaining a business degree at Uconn will allow me to create my path to success. At Uconn the students are motivated and the professors will challenge me academically.The Stamford campus also is located in a ever growing city filled with opportunities for internship. In this ever growing world real world connections is what makes all the difference between starting a career or working a dead end job. Transferring will be will no doubt impact my life forever by reaching my full potential academically, mentally, and emotionally. As I learned from rugby I can’t just sit by and let life pass me by, I have to take the steps and make it happen and succeed. Attending Uconn will be one of those steps.

It isn’t around.  
I’m sad.  
  
A new radio sits on my desk, a reward for becoming head of security.   
Not a reward I wanted.   
  
I get a call. Its an IT intern, he’s helping our head of sales with her computer and apparently it’s causing trouble.  

&gt;Intern: Hey, this lady is asking for you. She says she needs the boss.   
&gt;Me: Okay put her on the phone.   
&gt;Sales: Hey Airz, heard about the new promotion. Congratulations.   
  
She said this entire line with such distain I could hear venom dripping off every word.  
  
&gt;Sales: I need you to get up here and fix this machine. The tech you sent up can’t handle it.  
&gt;Me: I’m sure he can. Put him back on.  
&gt;Intern: Yep Im back.   
&gt;Me: Whats wrong with the machine?  
&gt;Intern: Nothing major, just a hard disk error. It probably needs replacing.  
&gt;Me: Okay pack it up and bring it down.  
  
As I wonder how far I can stretch a budget for HDD that currently sits at zero I hear through the phone an argument erupt.   
  
&gt;Sales: You can’t take it, give me the phone I want to talk to your boss. We NEED this machine.  
&gt;Intern: It needs replacing Im afraid…. You know what? Okay, here.  
  
I hear the phone crackle as it passes between the two.  
  
&gt;Sales: You need to get up here now, and sort this issue out. He keeps trying to take the desktop away.  
&gt;Me: Yes unfortunately I think it’ll need replacing. It’ll be back soon though don’t worry.  
&gt;Sales: No.  
&gt;Me: No?  
&gt;Sales: No.   
&gt;Me: Okay. No. It’ll stay as it is.  
&gt;Sales: No. You get up here and fix it.  
  
I look out over the department. I see other techs doing work.   
I feel bad for the intern who’s at sales dealing with this lady.  
I give in.   
  
&gt;Me: Fine. Ill be up in a sec.  
  
I get up to the floor. I can see intern looking glad to see me, I send him back downstairs with a smile and an order for coffee.  
  
I sit at the computer. The HDD is corrupted.   
  
&gt;Me: This computer will have to come with me I’m afraid.   
&gt;Sales: No, it stays.   
&gt;Me: I can’t fix it here.  
&gt;Sales: You’ll stay here till its fixed.  
&gt;Me: No?  
&gt;Sales: Im going to call the VP.  
&gt;Me: Okay.  
  
We waited around till the VP arrived, he gave me a big smile. I knew he worshiped the feet of Sales however. Its where the money comes from.   
  
&gt;VP: It does seem like you’ll have to fix it here. I must insist.  
  
I sigh, and look around for any coffee. There wasn’t any.   
Im getting out my screwdrivers and staring intently at the back of the VP’s head. It didn’t explode. I was sad.  
  
It was at this point that my radio crackles to life.  

&gt;Radio: All security please report to main desk immediately.  
  
I smile flashes across my features.  

&gt;Me: Oh dear. Im afraid I have to go… security head and all.  
  
Turns out security had been given a box of chocolates.   
I took one.   
It was nice.   
Perks of the job I guess.

208mwy,94,2014-03-12,Today I learned about speed.,[deleted],talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/208mwy/today_i_learned_about_speed/,"Let me give some preface points to help you understand the situation. 

* I am intern at a local repair store.

* I man the front desk when the secretary isn’t in. She’s been sick for a couple days.

* I'm your average intern/college student. Hoody, presentable pants, backpack full of necessary things. A little bit on the hefty side. Kinda clueless and prone to confusion.

* I usually think a bit before I talk, results in a slow drawl.

Story time.

Usually I’m only scheduled to come in on Thursdays and Fridays. However, my boss doesn’t mind if I pop in and help whenever I want. When I’m not in school I usually have nothing better to do besides video games and help out down at the store.

Today I should’ve stayed home and played video games.

 I pop in the back door and everything is hunky dorey. Drop my backpack by the fridge and ask Mr.Bossman what needs to be done.

“Secretary is still sick. Do you wanna man the front desk?”

‘Course I do! Customers are much more fun than chopping my hands to bits on old sharp computers. (I’m not pointing any specific brand out, but it starts with a *C* and ends with a *ompaq*.)

I put on my company hat and set myself at the desk. Yeah, we wear hats inside. We’re cool like that. First hour goes by, only Mr.Bossman’s mom coming to visit him. Twiddle my thumbs a bit. Another hour goes by. Only a couple customers just checking in on their computers. I help one out, he pays and is on his way. 

My thought’s right before moment that ended all plans for the rest of the day included something along these lines,”This is so boring. How far can this chair tip back. Hmm... not too far. That’s kinda lame. Wish I had something to do.”

**YOUR WISH HAS BEEN GRANTED MORTAL**

This tiny man bursts into the shop. He must’ve been 5 feet tall max. He rushes up to the desk and slaps his computer down. A full tower, right on the desk. just slaps it there. 

Shorty: *Hey mister my computer is broken my brother likes to play with the bios hes such an ass he doesnt listen when I tell him that will break it...*

Now that he set the computer down I got a good look at him. The man looked like he was just skin draped over a wire frame. From the way he was twitching and talking someone had probably plugged that wireframe into an outlet not too long ago.

Shorty: *...he does stuff like that all the time he doesn't listen can you fix it?*

Me: Yeah, I think we can fix it. Shouldn’t be too tough. Do you know what he did in the BIOS?”

Shorty: *I dunno he just does stuff its not working I think he did it but its broken can you fix it?*

Me: Yeah, we should be able to. Here, write down your contact information on this form. Does the computer have a password? 

Shorty: *Yeah it has a password it’s* ***super speed gibberish***

 Me: I’m sorry, I didn’t quite catch that.

Shorty: ***slower super speed gibberish***

Me: Again please?

Shorty: *a... b... c... 1... 2... 3...* (Password has been changed for ""papers I signed"" reasons)

Me: Thanks, once you’re done just set that paper on top of the computer there and we’ll take care of it for ya. 

Shorty: ***slaps paper on tower***

You’d think that was the end, that he’d leave then right? That’s what I thought. Boy was I wrong. Rocking in the chair and spinning the drive, noticed his reflection in the disk. 

Me: Uh, is there anything else you need help with sir?

Shorty: *Yes can you put some stuff in the computer for me please id like that itd make it so much better and I’d be so happy*

Me: Come again?

Shorty: *Can you put some stuff in it please*

Me: That depends. What kind of stuff do you want put in it? 

Shorty: Whazzat ***points at the drive***

Me: That’s a hard drive. It holds all your information.

Shorty: *I want some of those please put them in the computer*

Me: Okay, how big of a drive do you want?

Shorty: *The biggest you have I have a lot of videos they need a lot of room it sucks having such little room I want bigger please do that*

Me: The biggest one we have is two terabytes. Your model has a 200gb drive in it. Two terabytes is about 10 of what you have there. 

Shorty: *Oh yeah I have nine of those in my computer at home I dont need them nevermind*

***Half an hour later of him claiming to have everything from 3 GTX Titan cards and half the earth in his computer at home.***

Me: Before you leave, let’s go over your list.

Shorty: *Okay that sounds good your such a nice guy*

Me: You want an RCA adapter, a wireless card, and new keyboard?

Shorty: *Yes thats what I want can you get a cool mouse too and a password for bios*

Me: Yeah, we can do that too. Sign here and we’ll get that all taken care of for you. 

Shorty: *Okay thanks bye*

He swoops across the room and out the door. Good riddance.

He came back two times later that day. 

The first time he came back is was right before another customer came in. I knew I couldn’t make eye contact with the other customer. We’d both laugh, that’d be bad. 

The second time he came back Mr.Bossman was at the desk and I was in the back. Surprise, his computer at home had been stolen. My boss got a good 30 minute talk in with him. More of a 30 minute listen really. 

Now whenever we’re both in the back and the front door rings (sensor that makes noise when it opens) I whisper “He’s baaaaack.” poltergeist style. Mr.Bossman groans every time. 

He was supposed to pick his computer up last friday. It's still here.

And 55k a year is pretty nice. But god damn it do I hate the 40 hour work week. 

The people are great and the company has decent benefits, but I don't know what it is. I'm not a morning person, and it fucking kills me every god damn day to drag my sorry ass out of bed so I can be there at 8 AM. Every fucking day I just want to pull the covers over and give up, and never go back. Not every human being is a morning person, and I shouldn't have to live like this, with this shitty feeling to start every day.

It also doesn't help that I don't enjoy the type of work I do here. But everyone was nice, and really pushed for me to stay during my internship, and I was promised more things that I would actually enjoy (which even then I should've known better). And now I'm stuck here for now. I settled for this at graduation instead of interviewing more, and now the longer I work at this particular company, I become more proficient at this job and less marketable to the rest of the world.

I come home, and I'm mentally exhausted. I have to take a nap. I get home and just collapse on my bed and want to forget that it happened. I already have less than average social energy too (not that I can't be very sociable and charming when I need or want to be), but in this post work exhaustion, I pray no friends call to come over or hang out, because I just don't feel like it socializing or entertaining some one else (unless it's to grad dinner, then split). 

I wake up from my nap feeling well, do a few house chores (because my roommates don't pick up after themselves, and some how manage to make a mess of the living room and kitchen every day), get something to eat, all of a sudden it's 10 or 11pm. I've got to jump into bed soon and try to get rest so I can get up and grind out the same damn routine again! At this point my mind is so awake and active, full of ideas, considering all of the things I actually want to do and accomplish. I try to assure myself *I'll figure this shit out, and accomplish what I want one day* just to fabricate the solace to fall asleep again.

Weekends go by in a flash. I do one thing or another, visit friends or family, and then it's over. And I already feel shitty starting out because I know how it ends: With my worthless ass in bed Sunday night, trying to mentally prep myself, and praying for the strength, to do this shit again for another week.

There has to be a way out. I don't want to be chained to this desk for 8-9 hours a day for the rest of my life. I don't want my biggest aspiration to be cashing out a 401K when I'm my dad's age. And I DO NOT want to jerk myself out of bed at 7 for the rest of my god damn life.

I want to wake up in the morning at whatever time my body feels rested and ready to rise. I want to casually make breakfast and lunch at my own leisure whenever I'm ready. And if I have work to do, I want to do it with some consideration to my own time preferences during the day. I want to cat nap in the afternoon when I feel like it, or go outside or go for a ride somewhere if it strikes me. And I want to go to bed at whatever time I like, with the comforting knowledge that I won't have to muster every ounce of motivation within me to pull myself up and out the door at an ungodly hour."
208pdi,26,2014-03-12,"Win Wednesday! Engineering Student Edition , I hope this inspires you like everyone here inspires me!",Dat_Lebanese_Tho,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/208pdi/win_wednesday_engineering_student_edition_i_hope/,"First off I would like to thank every single person who posts on this subreddit, for you all are equally responsible for my success so far. I really would like to tell you my story and I hope it'll inspire you like many of you inspired me.

So to start off, I was raised poor, homeless at one point. Ever since I was a kid, I was amazed by anything that is technology. I remember the moment I wanted to be an Engineer was when my mother dropped the T.V remote on the floor, splitting it in half and showing the electronics inside, and instead of her throwing it away, she went out and bought a broken PC, an old Cellphone and another Remote for me to look at.

Senior year of high school , After a couple of visits to my Dr., I was diagnosed with ADHD and was advised to start stimulant treatment. However, having ""brown parents"" (not an insult, but more of a fact of life for me ) , nothing is wrong with me and I am just looking for an excuse. I did receive a Scholarship to the University that I've always wanted to go to , but my symptoms were becoming more noticeable as days go by.

Freshman Year was the toughest, Engineering was not made for people like me, I was never able to keep a schedule, my friends were becoming annoyed by the fact that I could not listen to them or carry a conversation without interrupting. I started doing bad in my classes, not that they were not interesting or hard, it was the fact that i couldn't just sit down and do homework. I started to become really impulsive and do things without thinking twice. My parents still were apposed to me getting treatment. My wake up moment is when one of my closest friends said "" you just might not be cut out for this sort of thing"". That was the moment I knew that if I don't control it, I will not become the man that I once wanted to become. 

After long fights with my parents, I finally started treatment, and everything changed. I started to become more organized, started taking interest in the field that I loved. It wasn't just the medicine, I started lifting and running everyday, my diet is healthier than ever. In a sense, I stopped running from my pain (ADHD) and embraced it, I controlled it without it controlling me. 

Now I am in the top of my class, and I was just elected Captain of the Solar Racing Team at the University.  Best of all, I accepted an internship at GE this summer in which I was interviewed alongside students who have 4.0 GPA's and all the contacts in the world on their side, they didn't even stand a chance, because once you set your mind on something, ADHD or not, you will succeed. 

Moral of the story, don't let your ADHD control you, if you need help ask for it,there is no shame in it. We are people with the power to change the world, but we can't do it by surrendering to ""normal"" we are way more than just that, there is NO ONE who can tell you that you can't do something or has the right to stop you from becoming the person who you want to be.

Sorry for the long story, I just really wanted to share my success with all of you!"

208z86,77,2014-03-12,Why can't the older generations have just a tiny bit of empathy for us?,sotired2424,lostgeneration,https://www.reddit.com/r/lostgeneration/comments/208z86/why_cant_the_older_generations_have_just_a_tiny/,"So yesterday I was feeling worthless and hopeless as I have every day for the last year (I graduated college from one of the top schools in the United States, with honors, last year and have been searching for a real job since), and at my part-time minimum wage fast-food job, I had an older couple make small talk with me as I was getting their food. They told me I looked a little old to be working there and asked for my age. I said I was 24 years old. They told me I should go to college, I could be making good money with a degree. I replied that I graduated from college, with honors, from the best school in the state a year ago and can't find a full-time job. They asked me what my degree was in. I responded that it was in television and film production/post-production technology. The guy laughed and told his wife (right in front of me), ""well that's why!"" ""Young people get these stupid joke degrees now, no wonder they can't get a job."" I finished the transaction and asked my manager if I could take a quick break and he said yes. So I locked myself in the bathroom, huddled in the corner, and wept for the entire 15 minute break.

Why can't the older generations have even the tiniest bit of compassion for young people trying to find work? They bitch and moan about young people if they don't have a job, and then if young people look for a job and can't find one, the older generations imply that it's our own fault we don't have one and bitch and moan that we're lazy and entitled. Entitled to what? Full-time work for a living wage after graduating college? What a bunch of free-loaders and moochers we are!

WE WANT TO WORK. THIS ISN'T LAZY. WE WANT TO CONTRIBUTE TO SOCIETY. Why should we be mocked and ridiculed for not being able to work when we WANT TO? It's one thing to make fun of people that don't want to work, but why put down those who want to work but are struggling? Go to any news article on the internet about youth unemployment, and there's always hundreds upon hundreds of comments like ""I have no sympathy. They probably majored in something stupid like basket weaving. These young people are so entitled now."" So what if our majors weren't the most profitable ones possible? I don't deserve a roof over my head? I should just starve to death? Just because I don't have a PHD in computer science? Even the President of the United States, who I voted for twice, comes out and mocks those who studied art history. HAR HAR, ART HISTORY! WHAT A BUNCH OF MORONS, AMIRITE?! THE PEOPLE WHO DIDN'T STUDY COMPUTER SCIENCE OR ENGINEERING SHOULD JUST STARVE, THEY'RE WORTHLESS!

I just want the chance to work for a living. That's all. Even if my major isn't the most profitable, I still worked my ass off and got great grades at a nationally respected school, I still acquired extensive career training and marketable technology skills, and I even interned in my field for a semester; I should be able to live with the tiniest sense of dignity. I don't want a gigantic salary, all I want is enough for a tiny studio apartment and food to eat. And yeah, I'm sure the only reason for record levels of youth unemployment is that our degrees are all in worthless subjects. A horrific financial crisis has nothing to do with it. Except when an older person gets laid off. Then it's the recession's fault. Baby Boomers can't find a job=it's entirely the recession's fault and an urgent crisis that needs to be addressed immediately. Young people can't find a job=it's completely their own fault, fuck 'em. They should've bootstrapped harder. Got it?

Why can't the older generations just say something like ""I'm sorry you can't find work, I know it's a tough job market right now, especially for younger people. I hope things get better for you."" Is that so fucking hard? Yet I've never been told that. I've certainly been mocked and ridiculed time and time again though. Why can't they have the least bit of compassion or empathy for us? They can't possibly understand the shame and worthlessness that sets in after you're even rejected from unpaid internships, to be told you're not even good enough to work for free.

I just want to be treated like a human being for once. Why is it acceptable to laugh in the face of someone who's struggling and suffering? I can't imagine a young person ridiculing and laughing at an older person in the same situation, and yet it's all the older generations do at us."

I'm an American studying Integrated Social and Cognitive Psychology at a school for international students in Germany.  My dream is to one day be an Organizational Psychologist (a.k.a business or I.O. Psychologist).  My school does funded internships, in fact, they're mandatory to graduate, so naturally my sights turned to Japan, a country I've been painfully curious about since I was a kid.  Japan's business culture is legendary, and being an east Asian country makes it's society and culture VASTLY different than that of the U.S. or even Germany...  I know it would be an amazing experience.  So, I have some technical questions, as well as some societal and cultural ones:

*Warning:* I realize I'm asking you to generalize an entire country of people, but just humor me here.

First of all, does Japanese culture have any extreme standpoint on Internships?  By that I mean, is it commonplace for foreigners to want to intern there?  Are most experienced and open about this this type of thing?

How is Psychology viewed in Japanese society?  To be honest, I get the vibe that it's either frowned upon, or not paid attention to much.  Please correct me if I'm wrong, I'm very curious!
What city would you reccommend I conduct it in?  I know I wouldn't get the ""full"" Japanese experience by going to Tokyo, as capital cities tend to be very international, but the city in Germany I am living in isn't extremely big, so not many of the actual residents speak English.  I'm leaning towards Tokyo because I want to make it easy on myself, but if you're aware of another city, perhaps one with a better business culture, I'm all ears!

Are Americans viewed as alright?  I know it may sound silly, but since coming to Germany and interracting with other people from around the world at my UNI, I realize my government does some very messed up things.  Thankfully I'm finding out that with most countries, they differentiate the people and the government.  I like to learn about other cultures as well as share my own, would it be easy to do that there?

Finally, if everything else seems good, what are some places you think I should look into to intern at?  

Thanks for your time guys, I know this was lengthy, but it's really important to me!  Sorry about the generalizations I may have made, but I'm obviously very ignorant to Japanese culture, which is why I want to dive right in!  Can't wait to hear some responses, cheers!"

I've applied to probably somewhere in the neighborhood of 50 positions and have had five interviews.  One of those interviews was as a water resources technician, which I did get an offer that I accepted. The position is a good foot in the door in the field, but it only pays $15/hr.  It's more than I'm making being unemployed, but I have a considerable amount of student debt and that amount is a far cry from what an engineering role would pay.

I recently had a phone interview with an engineering company for an entry-level water resources engineer position and did not get the second interview.  My background is arguably the strongest in this area, and I can't even land an entry-level position.  Meanwhile, I'm seeing my friends land positions left and right.  I've always finished in the top 5-10% of any program I've attended, but I just don't know what to do anymore.

209kce,1,2014-03-12,Ahhh I need to bug you guys again.,sydney__carton,Barcelona,https://www.reddit.com/r/Barcelona/comments/209kce/ahhh_i_need_to_bug_you_guys_again/,"Ok, so wall of text coming in.  I don't blame anyone for not reading it!

I'm from the U.S and doing an MBA here, until July.  I have no European citizenship and am here on a student visa.  The only problem is, I really want to stay, legally.  Which, I know everyone says is impossible, but people do find a way, they must.  Since I've been living here I've gotten conflicting feedback about the various ideas of staying, and trying to figure them all out, wading through all the online forums, is becoming exhausting.  So, that being said, a few people have suggested scenarios, and I thought I would ask you guys and gals, if you have ever heard of them happening before. I appreciate in advance anyone who takes the time to reply.  

1.  Internships-  I can get a student internship, and a few people have told me that after school is over, my employment can keep extending the internship.  Has anyone heard of this. 

2.  Changing a student visa into a work visa.  I used to think this was flat out wrong, and you have to go back to the U.S, but I stumbled upon something online and apparently the law has changed..?  Has anyone heard of that.  

3.  Extending student visa.  Has anyone ever done this?  If also gotten conflicting reports about how going about this.  


I guess thats really all I have at the moment.  Does anyone know of other options.  I know an MBA isn't as highly sought after as something like IT or Engineering.  But if anyone has a small kernel of insight or advice I would really appreciate it.  

For the most part it seems as if everyone here is either from the EU or married someone (jealous!), so I know this is a stretch.  

Thanks!

She's upset that I ""forced"" her to reveal my graduation surprise.",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/209oc2/me_27_m_with_my_24_f_15_years_shes_upset_that_i/,"I'll try to make this as short-winded as possible and thank you in advance for anyone taking the time to read this and help:

I'm 26, almost 27, and will be graduating finally with my first Bachelor's in May. My goal after graduating was to do fucking NOTHING for two weeks. Work a couple shifts, catch up with friends, spend time with the girlfriend, but other than that just really soak up the accomplishments and relieve myself of a lot of pressure. I've made this pretty clear to her and friends around me just as a ""gift"" to myself.

Girlfriend is 23, extremely generous, caring, and sweet. She is truly a Good Girl Gena but a bit immature emotionally. We are both attached in a healthy way. I am a bit handcuffed in contributing to the relationship because I am working to finish school, finish my big projects as a design student, and get the most out of my internship to prepare for the professional world of design or wherever my path leads. I have no income at the moment, have student debt and a car payment.

She has taken it like a champ and been the leader in terms of creating fun things to do in our relationship and we've done a lot in a year and a half that we've been together

All of the sudden last night she demanded I get a passport, and not just soon, but by the end of this week. I informed her that this demand was unlike her and that I don't do things at the drop of a hat even at her request. I'm not a dumbass and I obviously catch on to the fact that she is planning a trip for us somewhere. Awesome, right?

I ask her for the dates and she refuses, telling me it would ruin the surprise. The surprise is out the door for me at this point after telling me I needed a passport. She ""hypothetically"" brought up the Cabo situation a week ago (""well what if I took you to Cabo for a week after you graduate? Haha, jk..."").

She becomes increasingly upset and trivial about the matter saying, well just get the passport and don't ask questions. Don't plan anything after you graduate until like the 10th of June. Don't make me ruin the surprise, just go do it and it will be worth it.

All I ask her for is the dates. ""What if I have to finish a job, what if I have an interview, what if something professional comes up, etc."" I have to know the dates, I didn't find it very responsible to blindly commit to this without getting a time frame.

She blows her lid, blames me for ruining everything, tells me she bought a week in Cabo for the week after I graduate, and tells me she's going to cancel it tomorrow (today). ""I've already told all my friends and family and you've destroyed my surprise. You're a dick.""

I'm kind of sitting here now thinking, what happened to my plans? This is very flattering and generous but why did you think that was the right thing to do? I feel she did this more to impress her friends and family and disregarded what would have been best for me immediately after I graduate. I mean, who the fuck wouldn't want to take a trip to Cabo? I'm a partier and a traveler and we have done both together, but in small amounts as I could. 

We've done Vegas, SD, Santa Barbara, D.C., N.Y. and a handful of other cool stuff even while not being able to not all that much because of living an hour apart and doing different things. The trips and material stuff will come if we stay together but this is a red flag for me. Her quick emotional reactions often trigger when she doesn't get what she wants or she interprets something upsetting. I read it as a bit of immaturity and can only wait to see if it improves.

Aside from that, I don't find her financially responsible and have encouraged her take steps in that direction. She wants marriage and the whole nine yards in due time, but the disregard for financial stability, lack of planning for long term things instead of short term satisfaction, and just flat out not caring what I wanted to do for myself immediately after I graduate is a big red flag for me.

I'm under a lot of pressure to finish school strong and keep myself afloat money-wise and I don't feel she is respecting or noticing that. A sort of blissful ignorance.

Anyways, if you insightful peoples could help me relay these thoughts to her without making her MORE upset or confused it would mean the world to me.

**TL;DR**: Gf wanted to surprise me with a trip to Cabo after graduating college. I asked too many questions about dates and she lost it, blames me for revealing it. I don't feel bad, and a little relieved she may cancel it because of financial and ""rest"" reasons.

I had already implemented into our certificate environment with no issues.  I was busy working on a high priority project to fix an ongoing production issue, so I figured the steps were easy enough I'd let an intern do it. I showed him exactly what needed to be changed and where to go. The change was simply adding a jvm start-up argument and copying some files over. We were not going to restart the jvm until the next day, but I figured I tried to get as much done as possible. Later that night an issue happened which caused us to restart the JVM. Turns out the files were not copied over but the argument was in which prevented the JVM from starting back up. I was called and I backed out the change and got the JVM started up. Turns out there was still an issue. 12 hours later we found out he did not add the start-up argument, but replaced what was already there, which was breaking a core piece of functionality in the application. The issue was highly broadcast and several execs are aware of what happened. I 100% take responsibility for the issue. I did not properly train/instruct/document and verify with my intern on the change that was needed to be made and I was not aware of what the argument needed to be in case we had to back out the change. This kind of mistake could be enough to lose my job, but even if I don't... how do I come back from this? Should I try to apologize for the mistake? Should I try to ensure the execs that the mistake will not be made again?"

I am a junior studying Computer Science at a major B1G school. I have a pretty decent GPA (3.35) but not many side projects besides a website I made for one of the engineering groups I am part of.

I am looking for a summer internship and have been applying to a bunch of places over the last couple of months. Last week, after an on-campus interview, I was flown to Milwaukee to Kohls headquarters for final interviews for their IT internship programs. I had three back to back interviews with department VPs and I thought I did really well. One of them even said he was impressed and that I was a good fit. I was pretty buzzed and I thought I had the job. I was pretty impressed with their program and was looking forward to contributing. Then I hear back yesterday and they say I did not get the job. Needless, I was pretty deflated and this has made me doubt myself. 

I have phone interviews with Amazon and QuickenLoans next week but I keep asking myself, if I can't get in with Kohls, how am I going to get in with these big companies. I guess I am feeling too sorry for myself right now.

My question is, how do you guys deal with rejection? Any tips on how to get over rejections and feel more confident about yourself?

209tlq,2,2014-03-12,There is a line. (long),dcthrowaway12,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/209tlq/there_is_a_line_long/,"So a bit of a background (sorry, this post is going to be long).

My parents were married for 20 years before they divorced. In fact, my father told my mother he was leaving her at their 20th anniversary dinner because she wasn’t good enough to be a doctor’s wife. They had three daughters—of whom I am the youngest. 

My father is, to be blunt, an asshole. He joined the Catholic church when I was in 5th grade (relevant later on), and less than a year later was cheating on my mother. He had three affairs while I was in middle school, and left my mom for the last woman. Since my parents have separated and divorced (going on 8 years), he’s moved several times, never finding the right place to work or tolerating who he works for (he’s a doctor). He currently lives 6-7 hours away from me (also relevant later on).

I’m going to go on a bit of a rant on why I think he’s an asshole, but it’s not super relevant to the story, so if you want to skip it, go ahead.

He’s made it pretty clear that he doesn’t really want us kids. The only reason he still talks to my sisters is because they make him feel important. He refuses to buy us anything, or pay our tuition and other bills. Now, you might say I sound like a spoiled brat, so let me explain some of our disagreements about money:

•	Tuition. Oh god, the big one. My oldest sister, S, went to a private university and he was so proud; my middle sister, M, was encouraged to go to a VERY EXPENSIVE art school by HIM. I was told on the day I moved in to my dorm that I needed to “pack my shit up” and go home to enroll in community college. I wanted to be a doctor, had TONS of potential (went to a gifted boarding school for practically nothing), and he knew that he was ending my dreams. My grandparents and mom said that I should ignore him and that we’d find a way to pay for it. I got about 89% of my bill (tuition, room, board, books, fees) paid for by academic scholarships. The rest is divvied between loans, grants, and federal aid. I’ve never gotten a C in a class, had only 5 Bs and only 6 A-s in my entire four years. I’ve never had a semester where I’ve taken less than 20 credits. I’ll graduate magna cum laude in May, with three separate honors—all based on service, grades, and leadership—and a spot at one of the strongest medical schools in the country. 

My father has told me that I cannot go to my school no fewer than a dozen times. He’s told me at the start of every semester, at inopportune times (before my biochem test), and in completely inappropriate ways (“get ur fucking ass home and stop being such a selfish bitch. Ur sister went to community college nd she was fine”). Yes, she did go to community college, but because she couldn’t get in to a private school, didn’t want to live away from home, and is going into one of the LEAST competitive majors. He’s also had his gf call me up and cry that she wouldn’t be able to take her kids on vacation with them if he had to pay my bill. Oh boo hoo, Cheryl. You know how many vacations I’ve been on in eight years? None. Neither has mom. 
	He’s also been kind enough to tell the judge, on several occasions, that he refuses to pay my tuition. The judge has threatened him with jail, as my tuition (or at least a chunk of what isn’t covered by scholarships) was part of the divorce decree WHICH HE SIGNED FULL WELL KNOWING THAT I WAS GOING TO THIS SCHOOL.

•	He cut off my cell phone—my only form of communication with my mother—this past summer because I was in an area that wasn’t 3G and it ran up his bill. I was using it for my research internship because the university was being a dick about letting me use their internet.

•	He’s threatened to take away the junker car—the only way I’m able to get to my off campus job, besides walking 10 miles in the pitch black. OKAY THEN. When I made my sister, M, trade cars with me (She was using my mom’s car—the car I was going to take to med school—to drive 40 miles a day to visit her bf) he bought her a brand spankin new one for her birthday. This was also the same year he didn’t even send me a birthday card or pay my tuition bill.

•	He’s failed to pay child support countless times. If my grandparents weren’t alive and able to help, we’d probably be homeless or constantly harassed by creditors. He owes my mother upwards of $40K in support alone, let alone back pay, refunds for her covering his obligations, etc. The judge has told him that he will very likely sit in jail the next time they meet if he hasn’t made a good faith effort to start paying her back.

•	He purchased the cheapest health insurance he could find, knowing that it would force my mother to pay ridiculous out of pocket fees and the like if we saw a doctor out of his area. Remember, he lives 6-7 hours away from me and he’s a doctor—he can easily afford better insurance and knows that there is better insurance out there. As a result, I have NO access to affordable healthcare when at college. 

•	He foreclosed on the house because my mother wouldn’t let him and his gf have it. We spent the night before my 16th birthday sleeping in the car. 

•	He’s used my college savings to pay off other bills, including my sister’s college tuition.

•	He has refused to let me upgrade my phone when it was due, but bought my sister an iPhone 5S because she wanted one. 

•	I injured my knee last summer, and couldn’t be seen by anyone in my area because it wasn’t an emergency and they didn’t recognize my insurance. I asked him for a consult—no big, happens way more than you think in the medical field—and he refused until my mom called her lawyer who called the judge who bent his hand to make him do it.

I’m sure there are others, but these are the big ones. For those of you mid-sentence in your “what a spoiled bitch” tirade, remember—he’s a doctor. He makes $220K a year. He’s generous with his money to everyone else, but can’t or won’t support his children. Not even his children. Really just me.

The big changes are obviously the length. I reduced my resume to one page, and cut my cover letter quite a bit.

Things I am looking for help with are:

**Resume**

- My branding statement: I still don't fully understand how to make one without sounding either too much like an objective or like something that just repeats what is already on my resume.

- Is my order okay? In my last thread, someone mentioned moving skills to the top, but I'm not sure what is more important to highlight as someone who has graduated and hasn't had that much professional experience. 

- I attempted to put only accomplishments for my internship experience that seemed relevant to my education and what the company could use from my skill set.

- I left relevant courses on there, but I am wondering if I should switch that to something more along the lines of 'relevant topics covered'

- Also, in terms of format, I appreciate the feedback. For this particular application, it will be submitted as plain text on the website, so while I will take your suggestions into account for future apps, it won't necessarily be too much of a concern just yet.


**Cover Letter**

- I really didn't know how to write this. If it was for a specific job, I might have had an easier time, but since it's general and I'm basically asking them to consider me when something related to my education/skills opens up, I'm at a loss for words. So any and all feedback here would be greatly appreciated. 

- I took materials engineering in school and had taken electives focused on nanotechnology, which is what the company does analysis work on. However, a large part of the company is also computer/mobile hardware and nanotechnology. I was already previously interested in this stuff, and do my own studying/reading on the topic, but I don't have a degree for it. Is there a better way to demonstrate my interest in pursuing the field and showing that I can contribute to the company with my current skills but also willing to learn at the same time?


Anyways, feel free to take my application to the acid vat if necessary. Thank you, thank you, thank you for all the help, feedback and tips! Looking forward to see what you have to say"

the good:

* they are flexible with the hours and accommodate class times and stuff
* boss seems reasonable and coworkers seems cool
* no set date for my internship so i can intern until i decide to quit or i get fired

the bad:

* low pay (~$20/h)
* boring work 
* not a well known ""name brand"" company like google, microsoft, facebook, etc.


i dun care that much about the low pay at the moment, but i'm afraid that if i stay w/them and eventually get hired full time then the pay will still be low. the work is boring right now, but i've only had one assignment so far so i can't judge that muhc. the ""name brand"" thing only matters because in a year, ill have to start searching for full time positions and that this isn't going to look as good  on my resume as one of the more well known companies.

so should i start trying to look into other internships or should I just play it safe and stick with my current employer? "
20a0hh,5,2014-03-12,The Merits of Planetary Science in a Geology career,[deleted],geology,https://www.reddit.com/r/geology/comments/20a0hh/the_merits_of_planetary_science_in_a_geology/,"Good afternoon Folks, 
Today I was hoping to pose a question to all the degree holding Geologists/Geophysicists/Planetary Scientists that work in both Industry and Research here on Reddit. But before I do, I believe a short introduction is necessary:

I am currently a student at a Junior College. I began my educational career as an engineering student, working my way through the lower division courses we offered (statics, dynamics, materials, circuits). Last summer, I decided to take an internship at a local engineering firm and I was absolutely astonished at how boring the job was. Over the course of about 4 months I entirely lost my momentum in regards to my career path, engineering just wasn't for me. It wasn't the difficulty of the job, or anything of the like, it was the endless spreadsheets and reference books and excel formatting, I just was bored the entire time! All of my life I have been absolutely fascinated by space and the planets and stars (which is what drew me to Aerospace initially), so after my burn out I took some time to reassess my goals and motivations. 

I'd always been very interested in Geology, having been taken to rock and mineral shows all around the country with my father and the introductory Geology courses I took as electives at my Junior college were always my favorite courses of the semester (Physical, Historical, Environmental and Mineralogy). So after 4 years in Junior College I finally decided to apply to transfer this semester (I started a bit behind in math (precalculus) and couldn't get into a math class the first year to do impaction. I am finishing up Linear Algebra this semester and have completed all requisite Calculus and Differential Equations courses). For the most part, when applying to universities I chose to transfer as a Geophysics major (Cal Poly Pomona, UCLA, UCSD, UCSB,); however, when I applied to Berkeley and UCSC I was drawn to their Planetary Science majors. 

Now, this is where I may be getting slightly premature in posing the question...

As of this post i've been accepted to Cal Poly Pomona as a Geophysics major; however, decisions for the UC schools do not begin until Monday. So lets say that theoretically I get into all of the schools I have applied to. As of this moment, I am most drawn to the UCB and UCSC program (Planetary Science). So this is where my question begins: When I look at the major requirements for graduation for both of those programs, they both require or recommend similar courses to the pure Geology programs at most other major Universities (Structural Geology, Geomorphology, Sedimentology, Tectonics) however they do lack some of the more ""heavy"" geology courses, like Optical Mineralogy and Petrology. 

I intend on pursuing Planetary Science, it is vastly interesting to me. But I don't want to pretend like I am not also motivated by monetary compensation, which is where the root of question comes to the forefront. When applying to most jobs, especially in resources or O&amp;G, or just general exploration, they list the job degrees preferred as Geology, Geophysics or a related field. Does Planetary Science make the cut for a ""related field?"" I honestly hope that by the time I finish my doctorate that Planetary Scientists will be more in demand than they are now, as i've been told that most Tenure positions for Planetary Scientists are being flooded by hundreds of very qualified people. What do the job prospects look like for Planetary Scientists outside the yolk of pure research? My biggest concern is that by looking through the course requirements for both undergrad and Gradschool that you get lumped into the ""Very knowledgeable about everything, but master of very little."" I would actually love to hear the accounts of anyone who has graduated in Planetary Science on this note. 

My second consideration is that if I do not make it into UCSC or UCB and I attend a different school and finish in Geophysics, would this make me a more rounded prospect for both research and industry? If I graduated in Geophysics, would going after a doctorate in that field be applicable to planetary research later?

I apologize if this has been beaten to death elsewhere. It is very difficult to find good information on Planetary Science degrees in this day and age, and even more difficult to find answers to these specific questions. I look forward to any responses at all, negative or positive and will answer any follow up questions that you have for me!

Thank you in advance and I look forward to being more active in this little community in the future, 

John"

We met in school, and went on a date within two weeks. The first month or so we saw each other often, and the last three not so much because of school and work. But here we are months later and we both (I assume) are still into each other. Now I was hoping to kind of have that talk once school is out in May since we would both have a lot of time. However, I have an internship in NY, and she as an internship in FL.

Realistically, we would only be able to see each other once. Either I visit her or she visits me. It is only two months, so by no means is it a long time. The thing is, I dont know if I should save this talk for after we come back or before. I kind of dont want to hold her back for the summer, what if she wants to have some fun while shes away kind of thing. Plus she will be busy, and I dont want her to feel that she has to call me every night or skype every friday night at 7pm. etc

As for how I feel, it doesnt matter if I told her now, or in May, or whenever she gets back. I know my feelings aren't going to change. Now like I said, I would rather wait until the end of the semester to do it. Right now we are close to 5 months, by the end of the semester itll be 7, and by the end of the summer break itll be 9 months.

 What do you guys think? How should I go about this

20arps,25,2014-03-13,An end to my yearlong sesh,wasbaked,leaves,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/20arps/an_end_to_my_yearlong_sesh/,"I, like many before me, first tried marijuana at the start of my university education.  After a few lackluster seshes with some of my new friends (none of whom were regular stoners), I finally got insanely high and instantly fell in love with everything weed.  As a naive, previously straight-edge 18 year old, I had no idea what regular marijuana use could lead to... my brief google searches convinced me that marijuana was completely harmless and non-addictive.  Now that I think about it, I actually just disregarded any search results that suggested marijuana could be harmful and instead believed what I wanted to.

In the beginning, I would only light up with other friends, usually on weekends.  It wasn't long before I started blazing by myself, getting completely ripped on a nightly basis.  I don't need to tell you guys how awesome my experiences were during these first highs. This was only about a month after I first smoked.

Within a few months, my friends knew me longer as a stoner than a non-stoner and I was treated as such. I didn't care, I just kept on toking away, first only on nights, then all day.  My grades quickly declined as I regularly skipped class and assignments.  The day before midterms and finals, I'd get my FIRST look at the class material and try cram it all in... all the while vaping or hitting the bong.  I've managed to scrap by with B's and C's, though I did fail one class.

I quickly became disinterested in socializing and exercise (I had always been in good shape) and would stay in my room all day, blazed.  I began skipping out on several respectable internships I scored early in the school year. 

I tried dating a few girls and could never connect.  I never smoked before a date, but the sober me was probably worse than the high me.  Without weed, my mind was dull and indecisive.  

I constantly told myself that I would only smoke for one more day, that tomorrow I'd move past this phase.  This led to me smoking even more and being more unproductive, as I truly believed each day would be my last smoking… so I wanted to blaze it up as much as possible.  Each time I picked up, I'd hate myself for having so little self control.  I felt pathetic.  It was pathetic.  

My tolerance was extremely high.  I've literally done 15 dabs in a sitting just to attain a moderate buzz… while my friends who had been smoking since high school passed the fuck out after just one.  

Now of course, I'm just describing the negative aspects of my relationship with weed.  Through marijuana, I've met many people, learned to be more open-minded, and have had many priceless memories with my friends.  I could have, however, stopped smoking long ago and still have reaped the benefits.  

I'm tired of lying to my amazing parents, who think I'm up here working my ass off for these shitty grades.  It'd kill them if they ever found how their only child ended up.  I only see myself telling them the truth if I graduate and make it into my desired graduate program.

After lurking on this sub for a while, I've come to realize that I've only been smoking a fraction of the time than most people here.  I've also realized that my problems stemming from marijuana use came much quicker than most, and that scares me.  

I've been sober for almost two weeks now.  I can barely sleep and barely eat.  When I first stopped, I'd feel extremely nauseous after eating anything.  I've been exercising a bit and that definitely helps with the insomnia.  My mood has been up and down, mainly sad and hopeless.  I can feel my wit slowly coming back, and I'm starting to interact with my friends again.

I don't want to ever go back to that lifestyle.  For me, I believe that means completely abstaining from weed.  My smoking friends don't seem to understand this and I'm trying to figure out how to tell them so.  I know they'll be understanding.  

It feels nice to dump this all on you guys.  I see it as a step towards moving on.

20b1eu,2,2014-03-13,Just need to vent. IDK what to do.,[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/20b1eu/just_need_to_vent_idk_what_to_do/,"Please ignore my bad grammar/ spelling, i'm writing this in one go and just posting whatever comes out.

The past two years i've been on and off with pretty severe depression (diagnosed, but I haven't been to a lot of sessions so i dont truly know how severe), or at least it feels pretty severe when its happening. I used to think i was just lazy but now i realize its my mind doing this to me. 

Last year i took a medical leave from college (i'm a grad student) and i'm back now to finish my degree but i find myself in the same patterns.

Last year I wouldn't go to class if i forgot to do an assignment or only half-assed it because i didn't want to be judged by how bad my work was (we present a TON). I'd lie to my professors about being sick or my computer having issues, I'd smoke weed to keep my mind off of the hole i was digging myself academically and that only exacerbated the effort problem. I slept 12-16 hours almost daily, and then try to make big pushes in terms of finishing projects, etc. ultimately i came clean with all the lies etc and sought help. I took a medical leave and I spent my summer at home trying to put it all back together and figure out what the hell i was doing wrong. 

I got an internship and moved to D.C. for the fall and moved in with my longtime girlfriend. It was great. I felt great, there wasn't any pressure and I was doing well. I got offered a full time position for when i graduate and I went back to school this january. now i'm back in my old habits and i've missed 2 deadlines and I'm constantly anxious, stressed, and generally sad. I'll wake up in the morning, do NOTHING all day, tell myself i need to do work, do about 2 hours of work, and then go to sleep just to repeat the cycle again. IDK what exactly triggers all this and I just needed to vent about it but theres noone i feel i can talk to. I'm making another appointment with a therapist this week but idk if im too late to fix all this and idk if i'll get a third chance. i just feel like i've let down all the people that care about me and i've fucked up my degree and my ""future"" job""...

I just feel so isolated when it comes to dealing with this and the handful of therapy sessions havnt helped me at all. They just always feel so banal and like filling out a form about my ""feelings"" but nothing about how to really right the ship. "

I'm a first year student at CS program at top 10 university and want to have something to do with software this summer. I looked through many websites for internships and a lot of them preferred 3rd year students or required a lot of skills(I had around half of them) and did not mention any mentorship opportunities so I can learn best practices. I want to work in such a company because if there is not mentorship at all, it's the same as working on your own.

I have skills in Java, Android, some web dev experience and currently study dynamic programming and data structures on my own. 

I want to ask if anyone know opportunities for the particular requirements above? I want to learn from exprienced developer and develop project to completion. Also, I want to have my own company in the future thus working in industry would provide me with opportunity to learn how business is run. 

If someone knows any opportunities, please reply. :)"

20bp5y,1,2014-03-13,"My cancer came back. Riding on the high of what was quite possible the best year of my life, my cancer came back.",[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/20bp5y/my_cancer_came_back_riding_on_the_high_of_what/,"God, I don't even know where to begin. I'm so depressed. And it's weird because the first time I had cancer back when I was 17 actually brought me out of a major depression. See, I had been so sickly and unwell for months before the actual cancer diagnosis. They misdiagnosed me with and treated me for Crohns disease for six months. During that time I didn't get any better health-wise and just became more depressed. I wanted to die. I had even wished cancer upon myself sometimes, just praying for an easy way out.

Then one day I was getting a CT scan and suddenly it all made sense. The doctors saw masses all around my body and it became crystal clear what the problem was; I had stage 3 Hodgkin's lymphoma. Honestly, after having been sick for so long it was a relief to hear those words. Something in the words ""you have cancer"" kind of changes you. Like, when push came to shove, even though I was really sick I knew that I didn't want that to be the end of my life. That I wanted to go on to do many great things and touch many lives. I thought it was my destiny. I battled for the good part of 2009 and 2010 until I was deemed to be in remission. When I was in remission my life had meaning again. The world was my oyster. I could do anything, be anyone. I was just about to begin college, had a decent-paying job, and a boyfriend who doted on me and loved me unconditionally. On top of that I decided that I wanted to major in some form of international relations and languages. It was the perfect fit for me. I love people, I have incredible people skills and I love foreign languages. I knew this would be my calling.

So in 2013 I decided to embark on the craziest adventure of my life. In order to get some experience in the field of foreign languages and international business and relations. I went abroad to Europe to study for six months. To say that it was the most fulfilling, life-changing experience seems like a gross understatement. I met some amazing friends, people that I plan on staying in contact with and visiting every so often for the rest of my life. I also met my current boyfriend who is the most amazing guy on the planet. After he and I went back to our home countries we decided to stay together. He managed to get an internship very close to where I we got an apartment together and everything seemed perfect.

Then in November, while I was still planning for my boyfriend to come here and for myself to visit him for the holidays, my entire life was turned upside down. One weekend I was visiting a friend at school. I woke up one day with an unbearable stabbing pain in my side. I thought it was food poisoning, maybe even appendicitis, hell it could have just been the worst hangover of my life. Thats why it completely blindsided me in the hospital after they did a CT scan amongst other tests, and told me they believed my cancer was back. Keep in mind, that before this day that I had the pain I did not have any symptoms that would indicate that I had cancer. I went from literally symptom-free to being infused with chemo within a 2 week span. It was unreal.

Almost four years in remission and it came back. I couldn't believe it; still can't. But hey, it is what it is. Life kinda just throws this shit at you and the best thing you can do it to just roll with it. 

That was my attitude at the beginning of this whole process. After I got my first round of chemo the day before Thanksgiving I thought to myself, this is going to be a piece of cake. I've done this before and I can do this again.

Then the cancer wasn't responding as well to the treatments as it should have been. Under the advice of my primary oncologist I went to one of the greatest hospitals for blood cancers in the country. After some long talks the doctors decided the best idea would be for me to undergo a ""stem cell transplant."" Which essentially is when they collect certain cells from my blood, freeze them, give me super intense, fatal amounts of chemo and then ""rescue"" me with my own cells. On top of that they want me to do a complete bone marrow transplant, which is essentially the same thing expect I'll be getting donor marrow. 

At first I wasn't so worried about it. I mean, I knew I would have to take off school for the next semester, maybe even fall as well, and quit my job, and stop going to the gym. But as soon as these things came around to happening, I realized that I didn't want to put my life on hold. Why should I stop my life while everyone I know is going to graduate at the end of this year? Why did this have to happen again? Why now? Especially with my boyfriend about to move to my country for his internship. Why should he have to deal with this burden? And my parents as well. Even with insurance, we are being put through the financial wringer. It doesn't seem fair. I know money is an issue but they never mention it to me... probably because they don't want me to feel guilty. But how can I help but feel guilty? It eats away at me knowing what a burden I am on everyone. 

Two weeks ago I began the process of the stem cell transplant. In fact, I'm sitting in my hospital bed being infused with etoposide and carmustine as I type this out. The doctors think I should be out of here hopefully by mid April.

But I hate this. I hate it here so much. People come in and out of my room all of the time: doctors, residents, nurses, pca's, fertility specialists (who tell me I have almost no eggs left because of the treatment and will probably never have a baby), dietitians, housekeeping, x-ray techs, music therapists, social workers, oncologists, you name it! There is no privacy. There is no ""me-time."" There is nothing.

I feel myself slipping further and further back into that dark area of depression that I thought I had left behind after the first time I was sick. But here it is, rearing its ugly head again. It's a little black beast telling me that I don't want anyone to visit me, that I never have and never will deserve nice things, that I'm probably going to die in this hospital. I hate this. I hate feeling like this. Sometimes I slip out of it and I'm my fun, cheerful, funny self. And that's awesome, because as I said before, I get along really well with people and the staff here loves me. But those thoughts are few and far between. Mostly I feel sad, angry, hopeless. Even when my friends and family and boyfriend come to visit I feel sad. The commute to get here from where I live is a little over 2 hours. And there is literally nothing to do here. In my free time I have been trying to teach myself a bit of German and how to play the keyboard, but those are really more ""me activities."" When they come up here I have to put down everything I'm doing and accommodate them and try to keep them occupied. I feel bad having them come all the way up here just to watch tv and sit around. I find myself pushing everyone away. Some days I can't even put on a smile or animate my voice to pretend like I'm feeling okay. 

I hate it, and this is only the beginning. For the bone marrow transplant I will be in the hospital for 2+ months. The worst thing is knowing that I'm not even halfway done with this whole process. Or maybe the worst thing is knowing that I might die here at 22, alone, because I told everyone not to visit. I don't know, maybe I'm being dramatic. I just really hate this. I hate having no power to do anything. I hate being confined to this bed. I hate being a burden on everyone. I hate that this had to happen to me again. I hate everything. Sometimes I really just want to die, even knowing that I will leave behind no children, and no legacy, and that I have touched no one."

I have a university degree and internship experience, currently I work for Starbucks, and in the past year I hiked the Camino de Santiago. Are any of these things relevant? 

2. Cold calling vs applying online.
Would calling up vineyards and asking if they are hiring be affective or should I just apply to online postings (I was looking at winejobs.com and winebusiness.com)

3. Is there anything I should know in advanced?
Wine terminology, techniques, etc. I have some basic knowledge from a wine course I took at university, but that's about it.

4. If I live in Virginia, what are my chances of getting hired on the west coast? "

Hey, and welcome to the Guide to Literary Agents, brought to you by /r/shutupandwrite.

A quick note about the sub: we’re pretty productivity-based. If you like talking about the euphoria you get from writing, you should probably avoid us. Users run monthly workshops (things like [self-publishing](http://www.reddit.com/r/shutupandwrite/comments/1z8mbi/workshop_an_introduction_to_selfpublishing_part_1/), [ShUpWriMo](http://www.reddit.com/r/shutupandwrite/comments/1w5rnb/shupwrimo_shut_up_write_more_25k_open/)). It’s a pretty tight community, so to see things like this first, you should head over there. Alternatively join our fairly active [IRC chat](https://kiwiirc.com/client/irc.snoonet.org/shutupandwrite). Okay, now to bigger and better things.

*** 

If you’re familiar with query letters, it might be best to jump on past this section. This here is for people that are wondering about the mechanics of approaching agents. The best strategies. That kind of thing.

Put simple: a **query letter** is what you’re going to send to a literary agent in an attempt to get them to ask for a manuscript. Some agents ask for the first three chapters, others don’t. Some agents personally read each submission, others don’t; they have interns for that kind of thing. The outcome is the same: yours needs to stand out. I don’t want to get into the how-to’s of a good query letter, because I don’t have them. I recommend checking out the posts of /u/BiffHardCheese, who has made [several](http://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/1k2ad1/queries_the_art_of_selling_your_art/) great posts, and runs a [weekly query critique thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/202g69/weekly_query_critiques_round_four/). Check those threads out for that kind of advice.

***

One of the most important things to remember about agents is that they are all different. They have different tastes. They like different books. You need to learn that. Agents go on at some length about how – despite 99.99% of them have extensive submission guidelines about *what they accept* – they receive things that simply aren’t suited to them. 

**Agencies usually have different agents**. They all like different things – so tailor the message. This seems obvious, but all it takes is for one person to write “Dear Agent” at the top of the email, and immediately, they’re going in a little less hopeful. So, use their name. Look at their guidelines.

[Here is an example](http://nelsonagency.com/submission-guidelines/). 

You have to **look at what they want**. Once you see that, approach them. Submission times vary wildly. The Nelson Agency (above) has incredibly short response times, and that’s indicative of a few things, but we won’t go into that. Most are around six weeks. If you don’t receive a response at that time, it’s okay to send another email to check up on them. Sometimes stories slip through the cracks, and yours might just happen to be the gold they’re looking for.

*** 

**How do I find an agent who represents my kind of writing?**

There’s a few ways of approaching this. You can either:

* Find out the agents of authors whose work resembles yours in some respects. Genre is the major ones – not themes. You can usually find these by searching online really easily, or on the author’s website.
* My preferred route is **agentquery.com**. On the left hand side, you can select your genre, and then you have a huge list. Each page has information about the agent: be sure to check that they’re accepting submissions. If not, that’s too bad, but there’s others. *Loads* of others. 

There are a lot of agents in the US. Most UK-based agencies don’t accept submissions from US writers, but it does work the other way around. Is that fair? No, but it’s the way it is. If you are a UK-based author, then there is a huge list **[here](http://agentsassoc.co.uk/members-directory) ** of agencies. Another great resource!

*** 

**A lot of people like podcasts**. Here are some links to podcasts, or episodes of them:

* [LitReactor Episode 8 – Inside the Mind of a Literary Agent](http://litreactor.com/podcast/unprintable-the-litreactor-podcast-episode-8-inside-the-mind-of-a-literary-agent-guest-bree)
* [Shipping &amp; Handling](http://shippingandhandlingpodcast.com/), a podcast by two literary agents;
* [The Business of Writing, Getting a Literary Agent and Getting Published](http://www.fictionschool.com/business-writing-getting-literary-agents-getting-published-adriann-ranta-wolf-literary-services-fs011/), with guest Adriann Ranta of Wolf Literary;
* [Agent talks about agents andpublishing](http://www.ifyourejustjoiningus.com/2009/09/14/fantasy-and-scifi-literary-agent-ginger-clark-talks-agents-publishing-and-the-future/), for people with fantasy and sci-fi in their hearts and on their computers.

***

When you’re approaching agents, remember that they are people. Be professional, but be relaxed about it. You’re going to them as someone wanting to work *with* them – not *for* them, not *above* them. Here’s an example of [a query that worked]( http://misterkristoff.wordpress.com/the-query/) (I’d be pretty interested to hear what /u/BiffHardCheese thinks of this one). 

*** 

Agents usually have a blog or twitter. Some of them run workshops (I’ll offer some links below). *Follow them on twitter, read their blog – see what they like.* If, in your query, you can mention something from their blog, or something that they mentioned on twitter, you have something over the other robotic responses. Agents receive thousands of them. Something has to make you stand out immediately.

* [Pub Rants]( http://nelsonagency.com/pub-rants/), by Kristin Nelson. This is a pretty nifty one. It doesn’t matter if you are a part of the genres she enjoys – she goes over query letters in workshop form, and I think they’re pretty great. Read her posts.
* [About My Query](http://ktliterary.com/category/ask-daphne/about-my-query/), which are more or less just query critiques. Another great query-critique website is – 
* [QueryShark](http://queryshark.blogspot.co.uk/) – brutal, brutal, brutal, but *so useful*. 

These are just a few. There are so many out there. Go onto their websites, have a look around.

**Start a spreadsheet.** Whether you do it with gDocs or Microsoft Excel, it doesn’t matter. Make lists of agents, the amount of time it takes for them to respond, when you expect one by. Send them out maybe six or seven at a time – take note, some agents want exclusivity. I think that’s unfair of them, but you have to be the judge of that. Is it worth it? Try and always make sure that your preferred agents are *first*, otherwise you might get a response from someone you like a little less, and then you’ve got a problem. Make sure that doesn’t happen.

Happy querying!"

When you’re approaching agents, remember that they are people. Be professional, but be relaxed about it. You’re going to them as someone wanting to work *with* them – not *for* them, not *above* them. Here’s an example of [a query that worked]( http://misterkristoff.wordpress.com/the-query/) (I’d be pretty interested to hear what /u/BiffHardCheese thinks of this one). 

*** 

Agents usually have a blog or twitter. Some of them run workshops (I’ll offer some links below). *Follow them on twitter, read their blog – see what they like.* If, in your query, you can mention something from their blog, or something that they mentioned on twitter, you have something over the other robotic responses. Agents receive thousands of them. Something has to make you stand out immediately.

* [Pub Rants]( http://nelsonagency.com/pub-rants/), by Kristin Nelson. This is a pretty nifty one. It doesn’t matter if you are a part of the genres she enjoys – she goes over query letters in workshop form, and I think they’re pretty great. Read her posts.
* [About My Query](http://ktliterary.com/category/ask-daphne/about-my-query/), which are more or less just query critiques. Another great query-critique website is – 
* [QueryShark](http://queryshark.blogspot.co.uk/) – brutal, brutal, brutal, but *so useful*. 

These are just a few. There are so many out there. Go onto their websites, have a look around.

**Start a spreadsheet.** Whether you do it with gDocs or Microsoft Excel, it doesn’t matter. Make lists of agents, the amount of time it takes for them to respond, when you expect one by. Send them out maybe six or seven at a time – take note, some agents want exclusivity. I think that’s unfair of them, but you have to be the judge of that. Is it worth it? Try and always make sure that your preferred agents are *first*, otherwise you might get a response from someone you like a little less, and then you’ve got a problem. Make sure that doesn’t happen.

Happy querying!"
20bxtf,1,2014-03-13,Engineering vs. Economics Dual Degree (Canada),[deleted],FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/20bxtf/engineering_vs_economics_dual_degree_canada/,"I am a high school senior who is almost certainly going to be attending the University of Western Ontario to pursue a Honors Business Administration degree from the Richard Ivey School of Business next fall. The business program is a second entry program which can only be entered after two full years of university study and it is designed to allow students to earn dual degrees within 5 years if they choose to do so. I have high hopes to have a career in finance (most likely in Canada) and after talking with several people, I feel that this school is the best fit for myself, and provides some of the strongest finance opportunities of all of the Canadian universities.

I have applied to and been accepted to both the engineering and social science (economics) faculties as well as been given pre-acceptance to the business program as long as I maintain an 80% average throughout my first two years in university. I applied to engineering and economics because I have strong interests both areas but I am having troubles deciding which would be the most beneficial career wise.

As an Albertan, having an engineering degree would give me almost guaranteed job opportunities through friends and family in oil and gas but honestly I don't see myself working as an engineer for my whole life. I also realize that an engineering degree would add a lot of depth both to my skills, knowledge and credibility, but I am worried that the immense time needed to do well in engineering may hamper opportunities to get involved in finance related activities, such as a investment clubs, and also probably hurt my GPA.

I think that the economics program would be a fair bit more relaxed in contrast to engineering, and give me a lot more free time to dedicate myself to extra-curriculars and keeping my grades as competitive as possible. Also I think that the extra two years focused on economics may help me come out stronger in the field of study, but may be a fair bit redundant in addition to the business degree.

Does anyone have any recommendations choosing between the two programs to supplement my business degree, particularly in regards to university life, competitiveness for internships, overall job prospects and opportunities. Any guidance is greatly appreciated!"
20byhe,51,2014-03-13,[x-post from /r/shutupandwrite] A Guide to Literary Agents,ryanbtw,writing,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/20byhe/xpost_from_rshutupandwrite_a_guide_to_literary/,"Hey, and welcome to the Guide to Agents, brought to you by /r/shutupandwrite. You can see the original post [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/shutupandwrite/comments/20bxet/a_guide_to_literary_agents/).

A quick note about the sub: we’re pretty productivity-based. If you like talking about the euphoria you get from writing, you should probably avoid us. Users run monthly workshops (things like [self-publishing](http://www.reddit.com/r/shutupandwrite/comments/1z8mbi/workshop_an_introduction_to_selfpublishing_part_1/), [ShUpWriMo](http://www.reddit.com/r/shutupandwrite/comments/1w5rnb/shupwrimo_shut_up_write_more_25k_open/)). It’s a pretty tight community, so to see things like this first, you should head over there. Alternatively join our fairly active [IRC chat](https://kiwiirc.com/client/irc.snoonet.org/shutupandwrite). Okay, now to bigger and better things.

*** 

If you’re familiar with query letters, it might be best to jump on past this section. This here is for people that are wondering about the mechanics of approaching agents. The best strategies. That kind of thing.

Put simple: a **query letter** is what you’re going to send to a literary agent in an attempt to get them to ask for a manuscript. Some agents ask for the first three chapters, others don’t. Some agents personally read each submission, others don’t; they have interns for that kind of thing. The outcome is the same: yours needs to stand out. I don’t want to get into the how-to’s of a good query letter, because I don’t have them. Check out the posts of /u/BiffHardCheese, who has made [several](http://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/1k2ad1/queries_the_art_of_selling_your_art/) great posts, and runs a [weekly query critique thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/202g69/weekly_query_critiques_round_four/). Check those threads out for that kind of advice.

***

One of the most important things to remember about agents is that they're all different. They have different tastes. They like different books. You need to learn that. It's surprising to me that agents go on at some length about how – despite 99.99% of them have extensive submission guidelines about *what they accept* – they receive things that simply aren’t suited to them. Don't submit to a young adult agent with your mystery novel. Find those that specialise.

**Agencies usually have different agents**. They all like different things – so tailor the message. This seems obvious, but all it takes is for one person to write “Dear Agent” at the top of the email, and immediately, they’re going in a little less hopeful. So, use their name. Look at their guidelines.

[Here is an example](http://nelsonagency.com/submission-guidelines/). 

You have to **look at what they want**. Once you see that, approach them. Submission times vary wildly. The Nelson Agency (above) has incredibly short response times, and that’s indicative of a few things, but we won’t go into that. Most are around six weeks. If you don’t receive a response at that time, it’s okay to send another email to check up on them. Sometimes stories slip through the cracks, and yours might just happen to be the gold they’re looking for.

*** 

**How do I find an agent who represents my kind of writing?**

There’s a few ways of approaching this. You can either:

* Find out the agents of authors whose work resembles yours in some respects. Genre is the major ones – not themes. You can usually find these by searching online really easily, or on the author’s website.
* My preferred route is **agentquery.com**. On the left hand side, you can select your genre, and then you have a huge list. Each page has information about the agent: be sure to check that they’re accepting submissions. If not, that’s too bad, but there’s others. *Loads* of others. 

There are a lot of agents in the US. Most UK-based agencies don’t accept submissions from US writers, but it does work the other way around. Is that fair? No, but it’s the way it is. If you are a UK-based author, then there is a huge list **[here](http://agentsassoc.co.uk/members-directory)** of agencies. Another great resource!

*** 

**A lot of people like podcasts**. Here are some links to podcasts, or episodes of them:

20ccwc,4,2014-03-13,Just hit 25 pounds down!,[deleted],loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/20ccwc/just_hit_25_pounds_down/,"Hi everyone.  I'm seriously so proud of myself, and I just thought I would share, as my support circle is fairly small in real life.  

All my life, I've been overweight.  In fifth grade, I was over 100 pounds, when most of my friends were much smaller. By eighth grade, I was wearing a 2X shirt.  My whole family has always been fat, and I've always been fairly in shape, so I never felt bad about myself.  I told myself that as long as I never weighed 300, I would be happy with myself.  

Well, as I'm sure you're expecting, it happened. Back in May, I started an internship, and they required a physical.  During my physical, I found out that I weighed 303 lbs.  It pretty much ruined my day, especially when the doctor basically called me fat (and he was absolutely right).  

Over the next eight months, my weight ballooned up to 325.  I never weighed myself, and I never knew how much I weighed.  A bunch of the guys at work wanted to do a weight loss competition, so I entered, and that's where I found out how much I weighed.  On that day, I vowed to try to lose weight as quickly as I could (healthily).  

I'm getting married on September 20th, and I'm really hoping I can be under 250 by then.  As of today, two months and a week in, I have lost 25 pounds.  I got up this morning and got on the scale, and I weighed exactly 300.0 pounds!  I'm ecstatic!

I tried Keto for about a week during January, but keto flu hit me so hard that I had to miss two days of work, and I decided to give up on it.  Instead, I bought a fitbit and started counting calories on MyFitnessPal, trying my hardest to stay under 1200 calories, and to never go over 2,000 on my cheat days, which are once every two weeks or so.  

There have actually been days where I would work out so much that my net calories for the day would be in the negative!  And the thing is, since I've basically cut out all processed foods, I'm always full because I'm eating so much of healthy foods.  My latest addiction has been cheesy brocolli and rice steam bags, which only have 225 calories for the entire bag.  I usually eat an egg or two for breakfast, a steam bag for lunch, and then some sort of meat with vegetables for dinner (steak, pork chop, chicken breast, etc).  

I've also almost completely cut out drinking soda.  I no longer drink any non-diet soda, and I only have diet soda about once a week to enjoy with a meal.  Last night we had a friend over for dinner and she brought a bottle of root beer, and I was able to resist drinking it.


I know these all seem like extremely easy feats for people who are much healthier than I am, but it's been a fair amount of work for me.  


Anyway, thanks for reading, if you still are.  I'm super proud of myself at this point.  My fiancee has also lost about ten pounds, but she's not as serious about it as I am, so it's not coming off of her as it is me.  I think she's afraid of losing too much weight and not fitting into her wedding dress, which I completely understand.  I haven't even looked at tux rentals yet.."
20cd7d,3,2014-03-13,So I may be in some deep shit here,[deleted],howtonotgiveafuck,https://www.reddit.com/r/howtonotgiveafuck/comments/20cd7d/so_i_may_be_in_some_deep_shit_here/,"Not to mislead anyone with the title, let me preface this by saying that really I should be thankful for the things that I have. I have a loving family, a proper education, a job to go to and my health and youth.

I realize that compared to people who have 3rd world problems, my issues don't quite compare but I believe in Maslow's hierarchy or needs, in which unless you have achieved self actualization, your mind is preoccupied by the things on the tier that you're stuck on.

I'd like to break the rest of this up into things that have happened vs the abstract concepts of what makes me happy or unhappy.

First off, without breaking out in some frantic story telling, I'll summarize some of the big events that have impacted my life in the past few years.

Starting off in HS, I was never too social of a person. I had friends but none were too close and none would have considered me a great friend. I was and am still a highly sentimental person. I like to believe that people are good and that the relationships that you see on friends and seinfeld can exist in real life. Around my high school career, I realized that people come and go. I never had a friend last more that a few years before we part ways. I also learned how selfish people are. I learned to deal with these things and accept them for what they are.

Fast forward to college, the first year I was there was miserable. I developed crazy anxiety and felt judged every step along the way. Things started picking up a bit when I got into my second and third year. I started a work out regiment shortly after drowning myself in alcohol for a quarter of a year. The feeling that nothing was happening for me and that girls would pass me by really kicked my ass into shape. I gained about 25 lbs of muscle in that time but it didn't really change my outlook on life.

I started working internships by the middle of college career. The internships taught me not to expect too much from working full time and that everyday life might really not hold many surprises. 

At this point it seems as if all the fantasies that I held about life was diminishing. By the second to last year of my college career, I pulled my life together and found happiness in the things that I could. This basically involved keeping a schedule, not expecting too much from events or people and genuinely trying to live in the moment and appreciate anything that I could. 

I got a gf around that time as well. By then I was already 22 so it really felt like forever. I had been choosy... I always inadvertently turned my nose up at girls that I felt had a spoiled attitude or was just not a good person. I was looking for someone to keep around for a while in other words. Long story short, that fell apart catastrophically and that really put me in a dark mood. That was one of the last things that I believed in.. or rather wanted to believe in. 

At this point, it seems like everything that can make life enjoyable has been slowly escaping me. I don't believe in the goodness of people anymore. I know based on my experience that any friends that I have can disappoint me. I know that romance is a minefield. I know from the past year or so that I've been disappointing myself by not having enough motivation to do what I want. 

I know that money does not make me happy and I'm getting sick of the same environment over and over again.

I recently interviewed for a consulting job that I thought might re-energize me but I didn't do too hot on the case study and ended up taking a job in a city that I was already fairly familiar with. 

I don't have many hobbies because I have the opposite of an addictive personality (with the exception of being around that past gf). I'm finding it hard to enjoy life.

I have proven that I can stick to a model and seemingly do well in life (Climb the corporate ladder, go on vacation, invest in stocks, continue my education, get in better shape) but it honestly seems hollow to me. I don't know what to believe in and I don't know what will make me happy anymore.

Honestly I love bonding with people but there is rarely any permanence to any of that. I find it hard to even listen to people talk anymore. I can't think of what to say or how to engage anyone in a meaningful way at this point. 

I guess what I'm asking is, if anyone else has gone through something quite like this and if so, how did you ever begin enjoying life again? I have all the tools I need for a healthy, happy life, yet all I can think about is how disappointed I am with how the world is and how hollow and fake everything is. Is there a self ass kicking regime that will help with this?

And as an extra tidbit to paint my mood right now, there are two songs that I can really relate to right now. 

Your love - the outfield. - This one shows that I'm really just stuck in a shitty place wanting some love.
Rockstar - Nickelback - This is what I want to be like. Consulting might have been similar but not for the time being."

It's 2000 and I'm at the advertising agency [here](http://redd.it/1rgd61). The ad agency believed that it was cutting edge when it came to cool technology. If it looked cool, we bought one to display when clients came to visit. We had picked up a handful of the iMac G3s, since they positioned us as hip and cool. They were positioned at the ends of cube farms so a passerby would think that everybody had one.  

One of the junior account execs wanted to enhance the coolness of a direct mailing to prospective clients. Instead of a letter explaining the firm, it was going to be a CD with the agency logo and nothing else. She wants to send it to several hundred companies. 

She wanted a cool video to load, with loud music 'borrowed' from the Matrix. It was supposed to automagically load on both Macs and Windows PCs. Someone from the Art department did the video and my job was to make sure it worked when put in a CD drive. 

When the Art department was done, we were at about 22MB. No problem. While Macs could play ISO9660, they wouldn't autoplay from them. Account Exec didn't want even a sentence of explanation. She wanted seamless.

So fine. Hybrid CDs wouldn't reliably autorun on Macs for some reason when I burned them using Toast. 
So I make a 2 session disk, using a HFS (Mac) and ISO9660 (Windows), each with autorun enabled for the appropriate OS. The Mac partition's autorun points to the ISO partition, where the video lives. 

I test it a few times, show the ad exec and she OKs it. I set up every burner I can get my hands on and I spend a few hours making sure each drive is burning successfully. I'm waiting for the print shop to give me the custom sleeves while I stack the CDs. 

Then I get the sleeves. They're for non-standard,  mini cds. I don't happen to have any mini cds. 

I call the exec and tell her.   

Me:""Uhh, there's a problem with the sleeves""  

Exec:""What's the problem? They have to go out tomorrow""  

Me:""The sleeves aren't for regular sized CDs""  

Exec:""Oh, that's not a problem""  

Me:""I don't understand""  

Exec:""We didn't want regular sized CDs""  

Me:""But that's what I burned. Remember when I showed you that cd and you OK'd it? I've burned a spindle's worth""  

Exec:""So what you're telling me is that you can't make the deadline""  

Me:""You didn't tell me you wanted mini cds. I didn't order any""  

Exec:""Why not?""  

Me:""As I said before, I didn't know you wanted them""  

Exec:""I did. I sent you an email today""  

Me (getting angry, afraid that I'll be the epicenter of the blamestorm):""No, no you didn't""  

Exec:""Well, what are you going to do about it?""  

Me:""I'll give you two options. You can get new sleeves, which will take several hours. Or you can insist on mini CDs. It'll take a day or two for delivery.  A duplication shop will take another day or two. Your call, but I recommend the first""  

Exec:""Because you're lazy?""  

Me:""Because mini cds are stupid. They don't work in slot loading drives""  

Exec:""I don't think that's a problem""  


I call around and find a print shop that can do the job and has the cds in stock. I run the CD over with the appropriate artwork and tell them that it's urgent.   


By the next morning, they have a stack of octagonal CDs with the right silkscreen and a stiff invoice. I get an intern to help me with putting them in the sleeves. I then deliver the box to the exec, hoping I won't have her complaining to the spineless account manager. I know I didn't do anything wrong, but at our outsourced IT shop, techs were always wrong, even when I could document it.  


So I go back to work. I get a call from the head of the agency. He's got a problem with his laptop. I run up, since his displeasure could easily result in no job for me.   


He's got the latest Powerbook G3. With an octagonal CD stuck in the slot-loading drive.    

  
I pull the optical drive out of the bay and walk back down to my office. I disassemble the drive enclosure enough to remove the offending mini-cd. I put it back together and walk back to the agency head's office with one of the CDs I burnt the day before.   


As I walk back down, I see the ad exec. She wants to talk about the problem she's having with her iMac. Turns out, she tried feeding a minidisk into a slotloading drive.   


I ask her if she's deliberately breaking things. Her response still makes me wonder fourteen years later:""I thought the smaller disks looked high tech""

  a.	I want to see what kinds of actives are involved in a technology companies.


    i.	How different departments work together.


  b. __Analytical skills.__

    i.	I know businesses do many analysis and I have learned some from school, but I don’t know how a business environment actually would use them and what else is out there for me to learn.


  c.	Network	


    i.	I want to meet people, see what others are doing, maybe I will learn something I never thought about before.

    i.	I want to contribute, share my ideas with others, perhaps I got something useful to share.


  f.	I want to get an entry to a career in business while still involved with technology not necessary robotics.


5.	What I did to find a internship.


  a.	I have contacted my mentor from I school, and found the company he is currently in and formerly in are still looking for interns. And they are both great companies, I am still working on my resume and cover letters for both companies. If I can get in it would be a great start for my career.


    i.	I can’t just relay on those two opportunities as they are both very competition chances are high that I won’t be the one, so I want to know where else I should apply.


  b.	I don’t have much knowledge with what are the companies that offers a business internship program while they are a technology company.


    i.	So I have searched companies that I can think of as technology advanced, but they are all too famous and too competitive.


      1.	It would be really nice if I can get in, but very likely I won’t be the one.


        ii.	I went to internships.com which I did find companies that interests me but I haven’t apply. Because I wanted to work on my cover letter some more.


        iii.	I had bad experience with indeed and monsters.com so I didn't spent time on those website, perhaps I should. I will. 

  
.


Thanks for taking the time reading,



__Please give me some advice on where I should look for internship program.__


__if possible name a few companies that in particular I should look into.__


__I would like to know more about smaller companies that aren't getting too many applications, and please don’t exclude big name companies for this reason.__

20d9eg,1,2014-03-13,"Want to get a bike , but don't know where to start.",[deleted],bicycling,https://www.reddit.com/r/bicycling/comments/20d9eg/want_to_get_a_bike_but_dont_know_where_to_start/,"I haven't had much experience with cycling. I've been commuting to school on and off for a couple years, but I've always used cheap 10-20$ bikes from thrift stores. As soon as they've stopped being useful I've dumped them.

I would like a bike in between 750$ and 1000$ preferably on the lower end, but I'll spend more for better quality. I'm fine with new or used, but ultimately I want a bike that'll last a good while.

My current commute is 16 miles round trip. I'll mostly be using it on the road, but I would like to have fun with it on trails and off road in my spare time. I would also like to take my 2 year old out on it too. So ideas on a trailer or a seat would be helpful also. The road I'm riding on is mostly flat, there are a couple hills, but they're so small they're negligible. The trails I've been looking at aren't too bad either. Mostly dirt and flat.

I'll be moving soon to do an internship, but the weather conditions are pretty much the same, probably less commute. I also know nothing about transporting a bike.

The weather can get pretty snowy and cold, I'm currently in Idaho. I know there are brakes that are much better for this kind of weather, but that's the extent of what I know. Also, it gets extremely windy here. Lots of drag.

Since I'll be riding it to school I'll be using my shoulder bag or backpack a lot. I don't know if wearing it or attaching it to something would be better.

I was thinking of going to a local bike shop. How do I pick one to buy from? I've read one that treats you well and doesn't push things on you, which makes sense. Or would it be better to buy one online? I was assuming bike shop so I can have them do tune ups and adjustments while I learn how to do maintenance myself over time.

Any advice would be appreciated. Thank you.

Update:
Thanks for all the help.

I've been searching for a while and found a good lbs, they'll do a year of tune ups for me when I get the bike and they were very friendly. I think I've decided on the Giant Defy 5 for a road bike. It'll be within budget for me, they've got it for 700. What do you guys think?"
20dmgh,288,2014-03-14,"I just filed a harassment complaint for office bullying- and immediately got asked to leave my position. Advice, words of wisdom!?",fuckingfired,TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/20dmgh/i_just_filed_a_harassment_complaint_for_office/,"I should be clear- I am the paid intern and have been there for a year- the bully is senior to me and has been there for about 8 months. He has basically be psychologically torturing me with extremely passive aggressive  remarks, confronting me when no one is around to tell me I am worthless, with-holding information to keep me from being able to do my job etc. 

Today was the last straw when he came into my office unannounced and told me that I was purposefully not doing my work to undermine him (which is untrue). Of course, I cant prove any of this because its verbal and he times is so that I am alone when it occurs. I did save our few email interactions where his underhanded nature came to light a little bit.

 Anyways- my boss said that since I couldn't produce anything that strayed from work related topic, that nothing ""inappropriate"" had occurred- meaning I suppose that as long as you are talking about work- no matter how manipulative, scheming, underhanded you are, it's all good (apparently). I was then promptly invited to leave my internship since ""no bullying or hostile work environment"" had occurred but it was clear that I was ""feeling anxious and very distressed"" so it was better that I remove myself from the situation.

So now I am out of a job (a low paying job, but a job nonetheless) and have possibly lost my reference- all because I wanted this serious and ongoing harassment to stop. This man clearly dislikes me, is threatened by me because I am more educated than him and have been at the institution longer- and finally managed to push me over the edge into making the fatal flaw of issuing a complaint. 

Fuck My Life. Does anyone have any good advice or even consoling words? Has anyone been here before? 

TL;DR: I complained about harassment and was invited to leave my job. Fuck. 


Edit: Thank you all for the good advice, especially to those of you who seem to really understand the psychological trauma that the the aftermath of bullying can cause! I've decided to let it go- My husband and I were moving soon and so I wouldn't have been in that position for very much longer, regardless. I am going to therapy starting next week to work out and process the anxiety and anger that I have about what happened and I look forward to being able to move on and leave this behind me. Unfortunately, I suspect that the man who did this to me will continue to climb the corporate ladder- he is the worst sort of sycophant- but if I ever catch wind of others beginning to complain and come forward with their experiences, you can bet that I will be back with the documentation of my initial complaint against him.

20dnww,0,2014-03-14,[344] Fork Me Running,dogg724,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/20dnww/344_fork_me_running/,"Sometimes I think people can only count to one. As if every moment exists in a vacuum. It's one thing to know nothing about history in general and stumble through to the future. It's entirely another to ignore the fingers on your own hands.

 

One thing I'm perpetually confused about is when someone tells me “I don't believe that” when I say something true. More so, when I qualify it and say “which has been my experience thus far” or “what I've consistently heard across any number of instances.” My thought is that they don't believe me because they think I'm trying to sell them something they think can be obtained for free. Surely, there are as many ways to happiness or contentment as there are people, but it doesn't make what seems to make sense, most of the time, any less true. Not what you remember most, not what “feels the most,” just what adds up to the most.

 

Like, the easiest example I could talk about would be my crazy ass mother. There's a distinctive way that I go about “handling” her that my brother doesn't. After years of not talking, actively degrading her, and finally provoking a restraining order, I no longer have the stress and drama of dealing with my mother. It's 100/1 easy negative to positive things I could say or reflect upon thinking about her. Please save cliches about “but it's your mother!” for someone who's planning to blame their children for existing.

 

My brother is different. He kept going back for Christmas. He kept calling her and letting her into his life. He tried to stay with her when he had an internship in Indy. Throughout it all, he's lost money, been actively degraded and judged, come back time and time again to what seems like the brink of disassociating. He's, in my view, arguably causing more harm than good because he can't count.

 

Now what if we counted all the bad feelings, of everyone everywhere, who've done something we're about to do? There might even be statistics on the matter! Exciting. The idea isn't that you should live your life according what seems likely, but perhaps better appreciate why the numbers look the way they do. I have nothing to gain in trying to persuade you against anything you hold so dear, but the chance to converse more eloquently. My argument centers on honesty, very little stress, and an arguably more positive thought pattern. Where's the kick to regard these as terribly wrong guidelines come from? Cliches should make you stop and think, not bust out the polish for a comfort zone bubble.

 

What if we counted and listed and categorized everyone we knew? Pro tip, I'd argue that we already do, facebook just doesn't have enough data for a pretty algorithm. But what if it was more concrete, like a scoring system on a big white board that everyone you interacted with could check in with daily to see how they rank in your life. How much of your dialogue would you have to change to accurately reflect what someone means to your life? How many pleasantries and excuses and abuses could you no longer pursue? What if the best people, with the best advice, netted you cash? What if your life depended on them?

 

It's the devilish details. It's not “3 years” it's 1 month of nothing but crying, 2 months of arguing. 3 weeks of “pleasant” talks,  400 hours of excuses and very reasonable doubts if you ran them end to end. Or maybe it's a handful of wonderful nights, many months of “well-enough,” and 3 years of *pseudo safety* because no one feels like risking their relationship with you over criticizing. Because at that point, you're “just being mean” right? Or jealous maybe. You certainly wouldn't understand, I can tell you that much.

 

1 time has a close friend violated trust against hundreds of act of utility over years. Potentially violent Nick P. came very close to throwing that away until I let the numbers speak. 99% of conversations I have with Kay aren't louder than a TV show perhaps running in the background, and the other 1% she's probably at the other end of a Frisbee field. I could count on one hand how many times we “argue.” The number of times I make people laugh instead of cry helps dictate how often jokes get made. The number of shitty, or absences, of thoughts verses smiles helps filter facebook friends and me to forget to send out a text or invite.

 

People are good for you for different things at different times, in deeply personal ways, and for ever evolving reasons. Just let them be that person. Don't reduce to a label or something *laboriously physical*. If it's supposed to go there, why does it feel like you're forcing it?

 

I make pains to not point too sharp a finger so when I slip I don't cut myself and bleed out. But being passive aggressive here is different than the kind of screwball dream worlds we help maintain around people we claim to care about. That doesn't mean come in like a wrecking ball, but you shouldn't offer to cradle the balls of the dick forced into your mouth."

I am 21 years old and am a senior at University. I am completing my degree in the summer (hopefully if I can find an internship) and then finishing my minor in the fall. 

I have been regretting my major and have been having a hard time coming to terms with graduating. 

I switched my major three times. I came in to University as a freshman with Anthropology. I did not know much about it then and just put that on my app. I changed it to Communications shortly after as it is a common major. 

Then I didn't think too hard on what I wanted to do or study. For one, I think I was situationally depressed. I met my amazing boyfriend the following semester and my spirits rose. 

I always took classes that were super interesting to me and I loved being a student and being dedicated to my classes, but why wasn't I dedicated to figuring out myself?? 

I just want to kick myself. 

To note, I get overwhelmingly sad when I am PMSing (like how I am right now). I would like to conquer it. 

After sophomore year, I told myself Communications was silly and I should focus on something more hands on. I chose BECA (broadcasting and electronic communication arts) as I always liked media. I noticed myself not liking much of my classes...but I did nothing to change my major or seriously figure out what to do.. 

WHY WHAT WAS WRONG WITH ME. 

I felt like since the major is broad, it would be safe with plentiful jobs. It felt safe and open. 
I never checked into reality and fully realized that no, I dont wan't to do production (video and audio). No, I don't want to be in front of the screen. I liked the business, theory, education side but the department did not offer much and I got out of the classes what I could. 

I frequently could not make up my mind if I liked BECA or not. I guess I never thought about the real world and jobs. What the fuck am I going to do with a theory focus with a random mixture of different media classes thrown in (writing, a marketing class, a law class, a performance class, history, etc.) 

Like what the actual fuck is my problem. I feel like a fucking idiot. 

I am tired of crying and feeling sorry for myself, because it is fucking pathetic.

My boyfriend is supportive and tries to help me figure things out but he even tells me he doesn't know what I want to do and it makes me so so sad. 

Like I said before, this grief and rage over my life occurs mostly a week before my period..not sure if connected or not..

Anyways,

end of Junior year I struck up a Parks, Recreation, Tourism minor. I love it. I love the outdoors, the park system, just everything about it. 

I work at a museum (working the exhibits, scanning tickets) and love that job but it's not a career.

I was so close to switching to Anthropology over winter break. I took enough classes where I could finish the major in a year. BUT, that would mean I would lose my RPT minor. Not wanting to give up my education in RPT, I chose to stick out BECA and make the most of it. 

I regret it. I think. I am so indecisive.

I was looking for media jobs but they were mostly production. I have head in the clouds too long. I liked my studies but...what jobs? 
I found two possible internships that deal with media and education. One is part of NPR in the education department and the other is at a company that does public policy for Internet activity for youth and is the biggest reviewer of media. They also have an education department.

However,

I feel like If I don't get one of those, I am stuck. I don't want to edit or be a journalist or writer. I want to help people or animals or the environment and make it my career. I know I sound like a whiny bitch. 

I am trying to be active in the RPT department for jobs and internships but that will have to wait after I finish my degree. 

I am a mess. 

My friends all know mostly what they want. One of my friends just got a fellowship with our city's government to be placed into planning or public works, which is something I would love. 

I just don't know why I didn't take a leap of faith and studied something less broad such as Urban Studies, or RPT, Social Services or Anthropology. They may still be broad in a sense, but they will help open more doors into jobs that focus on human services, planning, education, outdoors, park ranger, etc. 

What do I do? 

All I know is that I have my interests but I don't know what to do.

to name some thing I care about and see a future with:

-education
-National Park Service
-US forest service
-National Geographic 
-park planning and usage
-conservation
-event coordination
-research
-Nature Conservancy 
-local government 
-human communication
-cultural studies
-radio
-social services 
-saving elephants from extinction 
-ancient studies
-online environmental news 
-advocacy 
-planning
-design 
-marketing 

^ but what does this mean? 

Why do humans have to choose one job or one major?
Why is there so much pressure to only do one thing until you retire?

Alright, well yeah. 

I feel like a basket case. 

One day I have come to terms with having this degree, another I am fretful and feel sick about my future. 

Just watched the show Girls (on the 3rd season) and them not having their lives together. Ouch, I don't want to be that clueless when I'm 25. 

Halp.

If you seriously read all of this, thank you, seriously. Yeesh, I do not know how I just wrote like 5,000 words. 

I would keep talking to my boyfriend about this...but I feel like he doesn't know how he can help me further :/ I don't want to be a loser in his eyes. 
I already saw my adviser but that didn't help much. 

It is hard to sum up what I feel in words.

These old stupid professors never teach something that is going to be useful somehow.

I should be building myself, acquire knowledge and hard skills like a mad psychopath. Instead I am rotting inside my studies.

I am in my third semester and if somebody would ask me what practical, real world skill I learned in those 1.5 years I have no answer.

I see people in their final semester and I can feel their regret. Some of them are stuck at university as a student assistant because they can't find other jobs.

Professors are telling first semester students what a great subject they have chosen and what a bright future they will have. Those fu..heads professors depend on the students because if people would realise how bullsh*t their education they would not have a job.

The only thing university is useful for is meeting new people. That's it. But there are unlimited other possibilities to meet people.

By the way don't get me wrong CS itself is not useless. But studying CS at university is useless.

You are better of learning it by yourself. You will be a lot faster. And in this field you have to be fast! You know these days kids at age of 13 are learning real coding. And no, not some cheap HTML. When these kids are 20 they will have a lot more knowledge about CS than you with a CS degree.

Because your professors never really cared what they taught to you. They were happy as long the pay check was coming. And if that's not enough already professors actually often don't teach by themselves. They hire lecturers who even give less of a f*ck.

I am a skinny weak guy now.

I am going to quit this shit. I will become the warrior I always wanted to be.

I have no special skill. NOTHING. I hate it. I cringe about every second. I am paralyzed by it. F*CK IT! I will acquire any skill I can possibly acquire.

My parents are poor, I have nothing I can rely on. I can visualize my future in a dead end job if I continue my current path. But no. Not this time.

I need advice. Am I exaggerating? What should I do? Please people I need honest advice.


Edit: **I should have mentioned that I am in CS since about age 12. It's not only that I don't like going to university it's that I can't imagine doing CS for my life. I don't like it anymore. I did like it, and this is how I got into this field.**


I am thinking about going into health care and finally become a doctor.


Edit 2: Philosophy was just some random example.


Edit 3: Awesome answers thank you guys! But a lot of you did not notice that I don't only think it is somehow useless I also don't like doing IT my whole life. What I am thinking about doing is taking 1 or 2 semester off, take up some internships so I can find out where to dedicate my life to."
20ey40,0,2014-03-14,Company wants reply to job offer before internship at another company begins,[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/20ey40/company_wants_reply_to_job_offer_before/,"Hi 
I could really use some advice for the situation I'm currently in.

   
First a little bit about my background:

I dropped out of college to start my own company. Unfortunately I developed a depression while doing it. Upon realizing I had to change something about my current situation i went into therapy and consider myself healthy now.

Now to the Job part:

I live in Germany where apprenticeships are a pretty common way to get a job education and experience. I decided it would be the best way to start my way into the world of being an employee. 
The apprenticeships typically start 1th of August(keep that in mind for later on).
I got a pretty good reply to my applications from several companies, which put me in the situation I'm currently in.

I had a job interview with Company A two weeks ago. Three days later they called me to say that they really liked me but would really like to do a week long internship to check if I could handle the work enviroment/load given my history with depression. If I could handle it they will over me the job. Back then I scheduled the internship to start on the 24th of April. 

This Monday I had a job interview with Company B. Yesterday Company B called to offer me the apprenticeship, but they would like to have an answer by Monday, the 17th, which means before my internship with Company A. They want the reply so fast because they are afraid of not finding a good candidate before the start of the apprenticeship.

I really don't want to decline the offer from Company B given that I don't have definitive answer from Company A.


BTW Company B knows I have an internship with Comany A.

How would you handle this situation? Accept the offer, do the internship and try to get out of the contract with Company B if Company A offers the position? That seems like a dick move.

Declining the offer doesn't seem to be the right move either as I have no other offer.

tldr: Company B made an offer, wants reply before I can start an internship at Company A, which has a high chance of resulting in an offer as well. How to deal with this situation?

[Why do you often complete your due dilligence AFTER the cheque was given on the show?  Do you have the business owners sign a contract stating that you may rescind your offer within a specific amount of time?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20enj5/im_marcus_lemonis_host_of_cnbcs_the_profit_and/cg2hs6t?context=5)|I always rely on peoples words first.  It tells me a lot about them.  They always know that they cant cash the check until I check things out.  I want to continue to trust people and not let some ruin it for others.  
[How do you think the US can shape its economy to encourage entrepreneurs to try potentially risky ideas?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20enj5/im_marcus_lemonis_host_of_cnbcs_the_profit_and/cg2hba3?context=5)|NO one loves risky ideas but well calculated, well thought out risk is fine.  The SBA will do it but the tougher the risk the more security interest they want in the form of assets. If it feels very risky it probably is. 
[I am a Private Equity guy and i love your show.  unlike nearly every other attempt i've seen you manage to have a lot of ""real business content"" but done in an entertaining way, so kudos for that.  As a PE guy i've also noticed you pull some of the ole PE techniques on these less sophisticated owners (signal high interest, get exclusivity, get down the road and then be shocked, shocked-I-say! about some ""hidden weakness"" and use that to re-trade the deal\).  Also as a PE guy, i've been trying to discern your investment thesis, your deal type.  I think i am getting closer to understanding it. are you just really a CPG guy?  i noticed that both with pro-fit and meat co, you just picked out just the product brands. and then do you slam these into some sort of existing manufacturing and distribution organization that you own?  **Question: PE guy to PE guy, what is your deal type?** ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20enj5/im_marcus_lemonis_host_of_cnbcs_the_profit_and/cg2iyb0?context=5)|No deal is the same and I pride myself of staying away from spreadsheets and analysis paralysis. I usually look for things I can connect to other things, a bit of vertical integration.  I also know what contacts I have and use them to help bolster the investment.  You ultimately have to like what your investing in. 
[Do you plan to stop making money at some point in your life?  Will you ever retire?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20enj5/im_marcus_lemonis_host_of_cnbcs_the_profit_and/cg2jn2n?context=5)|I have grand plans for what I make.  Cant take it with you. Need to leave a legacy behind that builds the future.

[My husband and I always watch your show. We love your personality, and your show is interesting to watch. We always wonder, is it hard sometimes not to invest in a company if you sympathize with the owner's plight and want to help them, but know that the company isn't going to be successful?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20enj5/im_marcus_lemonis_host_of_cnbcs_the_profit_and/cg2hz75?context=5)|Its very hard because I become emotionally attached to all of them.  See for me its never just about business, it always has to be filled with personal affection.  Stein Meats was a good example but I will be updating everyone in the coming weeks on our progress.
[Also, the episode with Planet Popcorn: what is your opinion of where that money went?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20enj5/im_marcus_lemonis_host_of_cnbcs_the_profit_and/cg2hz75?context=5)|Planet popcorn money? Yikes.
[Did you notice last Tuesday's episode about the gym called ""Pro-Fit"" also spells ""Profit"". Was that like subliminal messaging or just a coincidence?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20enj5/im_marcus_lemonis_host_of_cnbcs_the_profit_and/cg2i1d7?context=5)|It was the craziest thing and I actually didnt think about it till I got there.  I said ""well, were not changing this name""
[Hello Marcus. Your show and what you do has been very inspirational for me. Slightly off topic, I am in college right now and I want to do what you do. Like consutancy ans saving businesses. What career path did you take? Or should I take in order to achieve that. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20enj5/im_marcus_lemonis_host_of_cnbcs_the_profit_and/cg2jqno?context=5)|Finish school, work for someone else for years and get beat up, save money, take a chance, fail, get up, fail, get up even stronger and get a win. 
[I've noticed with Stein Meats and Pro-Fit, you carved out side deals (Brooklyn Burgers and Tina's health bites\). Is this a typical tactic you use to mitigate risk or was this just a coincidence in the last two episodes?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20enj5/im_marcus_lemonis_host_of_cnbcs_the_profit_and/cg2i3wo?context=5)|I always go in thinking big but in the case of both of them, I became emotionally attached and felt compelled to do something.  It still has to be good business and they will benefit as well.  Stein gets a 7 percent royalty. 
[How do you determine the value of a business? What approach do you use?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20enj5/im_marcus_lemonis_host_of_cnbcs_the_profit_and/cg2hjqi?context=5)|Never a perfect formula. You must understand the multiples of like businesses.  I look at tangible net worth of business, current revenue, where I see margin improvement and expense reduction.  Most people go off of cash flow but if the business is struggling its much harder.  Often times I use my gut and measure my risk.  The greater the risk, the more return I need.
[What was your first job?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20enj5/im_marcus_lemonis_host_of_cnbcs_the_profit_and/cg2iivs?context=5)|I owned a lawn company at 11.

Its important to have fun.
[Marcus, it's easier for you to invest in small, private firms that you think have a lot of potential but are currently undervalued. How should the rest of us think about doing the same: maybe public companies that are undervalued and are a good investment? Yes. I am asking for stock tips :D.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20enj5/im_marcus_lemonis_host_of_cnbcs_the_profit_and/cg2hyr3?context=5)|I have never been a big fan of stocks only because I want to bet on myself or people I trust.

[Hi Marcus--Huge fan of the show--I've been on reddit for a while but this is the first time I've ever posted.  I have owned a small, successful healthcare recruiting business for the last six years .  All of my work is done via telephone or email and I find myself becoming burned out and bored.  One of the things that really stuck with me about your show is that you always require businesses (owners\) to be passionate about what they do. I no longer have the fulfillment I once had and really do not enjoy this job anymore.  I am thinking about applying for jobs that would once again challenge me. One stigma I've noticed with small business owners re-entering the job market is that they are unable to take direction because they are used to running the show.  I believe myself to be very open minded and willing to learn-- Is there any advice you can give a small business owner re-entering the job market that would make me more marketable as an employee?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20enj5/im_marcus_lemonis_host_of_cnbcs_the_profit_and/cg2i52y?context=5)|The single biggest thing they add is that the employer benefits by having someone on the team that understands what it means to own a biz.

[I know you invest in distressed businesses, which is great, but do you ever recommend a successful small business take on investors?  for expansion, for example?

20f8ko,1,2014-03-14,Successfully taking time off when with depression,[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/20f8ko/successfully_taking_time_off_when_with_depression/,"I (21/F) have had depression and anxiety for 8+ years.

I am SIX weeks away from graduating college with 2 majors. It has taken so much out of me, mentally and physically. I am barely surviving but am determined to make it through these next few weeks and receive the degree I worked so hard for.

I haven't applied to a single job but have a great resume, multiple internships with great references but a mediocre gpa.

I know eventually I will have a job in my field but I can't imagine having to start work soon after graduation. I really want to take some time off and really wait until I find my perfect job (which I have experienced before). 

I plan on using this time to get some certifications done while relaxing too. Like my cpr certification, wilderness survival, diving, driver in bad weather...bunch of other stuff that Im interested in and would help my resume too. And working out and getting my body in the best/healthiest shape.

My anxiety is worst when regarding going to classes and I have successfully help 9-5 internships I enjoy and don't cause me anxiety to go to. I feel like school is whats killing me, fueling my continual depression. I am on medication and noticed a huge improvement (not suicidal, no full scale panic attacks) but still just can't handle doing most things, I feel so consumed and overwhelmed, always behind. I don't enjoy my classes like I'v enjoyed my internships either.


**TLDR:** If I take 3 months off and do little things in life, will my depression consume me or can I actually productively take time off.

What has anyone done to ""restart"" themselves in beginning a new chapter of life?"

I am a computer engineering student looking into quant work. I plan on entering an MFE program after finishing my undergrad. However, since I am in a CO-OP program I have the chance to complete internships before I graduate. In fact, I have an 8 months internship coming up next winter.

I am looking for advice on types of firms and positions that I should contact and look into. What can I do during my undergrad to increase my marketability. Should I take extra finance courses, work on a personal software project relating to quant work?

On Monday I filled out a form for a background checking agency (Verifications Inc or something). 

Anyways, I have nothing to hide, my only concern was that I had listed my work at a family members company that had a bit of trouble with the law (before I went to help out, which was why I went to help during their hard time). I only went to help out, so I considered it more as an internship than anything else and it was what I had told the people at my interview too. 

Now I am somewhat worried that the fact that the company had a run in with the law (violation something while doing government-related business, don't really want to go too much into detail), and how it might affect me. I don't really think it will, as the background check should only be verifying that I did what I said I did, but it is also a large company and we are working with trading supplies for airlines, so I don't know if they will make a bigger fuss if that information were to come out.

Any thoughts?"

20gs00,4,2014-03-15,We are a married couple thinking of buying a house. We have 68k in student loan debts and another 30k (in student loans) on the way? Any advice?,BillyBumblersUnite,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/20gs00/we_are_a_married_couple_thinking_of_buying_a/,"TL:DR (at the top since this is really long)
We're 30 years old.  My wife has 68k in student loans; I'm adding another 30k to that total.  Her current job pays 50k/year and her new job (starting in August) will pay $74k/year.  I'm two years away from graduating.  We have $20k in savings.  Should we buy a house using $10k for a down payment and then pay back $10k of her student loan?  Or should we apply the full $20k to her student loan?     
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

My wife and I are both 30 and we have been renting for over a decade.  We are thinking of finally buying a house, but we are afraid that we might be getting in over our heads.  

My wife put herself through college, a master's program, and then a PhD program.  In 10 years of school, she accumulated $68k in student loans.  This year (which is the first year since graduating) she is making $50k, but recently accepted a new job that starts in August where she will be making $74k/year.  Right now, her student loan payments are about $400 a month (income-based repayment plan on her current $50k/year), but those will undoubtedly go up significantly next year based on her new income.     

As for me, I am back in school pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science.  I've already taken out 10k in student loans and will need approximately another 20k before graduating (in two more years).  If I manage to find internships during the summers, I will be able to reduce the amount that I need to borrow.  

When we got married, we did not have the money for a wedding so we simply eloped (and spent a grand total of about $300 for the weekend).  My parents, very generously, gave us a $20k wedding gift.  We honestly had no idea that apparently they were planning on paying for our wedding (they had never even hinted at it).  So when we eloped they gave us the money that they had initially planned on spending.  That $20k is essentially all of our savings.  

After renting for so long, we were thinking that we might want to buy a house and start building equity.  Is this is a bad idea with so much looming student loan debt?  We were thinking of putting 10k into a down payment and 10k paid to the balance of her 68k student loan.  In our area, we can find a nice house for about $170-200k, but we can also rent a decent 2br apartment for only $700 a month.  Additionally, if we bought a house, we were planning on it being an investment property.  Once I start working (and we are able to chip away at the student loan debt much faster), then we were thinking of renting out the house and buying another one.    Anyone have any thoughts on any of this?  Thank you!"
20gtkq,1,2014-03-15,LPT: How-To Effectively Break Bad Habits?,[deleted],LifeProTips,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/20gtkq/lpt_howto_effectively_break_bad_habits/,"We have heard that habits die hard. Changing habits can be difficult at times[1] and we all deal with this issue at some or the other part in our life. But changing yourself is not as complicated as it might seem to be. You need to be persistent and strong enough to break all the bad habits[2] and set yourself free to enjoy the life.From chewing your pen to biting your nails, smoking a weed to addiction of beer, Follow these simple tweaks to make your silliness a no-more-habit of your life.

**ONE AT A TIME**

Don’t try to change more than one bad habit at a time, and instead of concentrating on what you haven’t done, look at what you have done. Try to replace every negative behavior with a positive one[3] but only one by one.

**THE OCCASIONAL SLIP IS OK**

If you’re committed to changing a bad habit, don’t worry if you slip every now and again but make sure you don’t lax and allow too much slippage, or allow yourself to let slips be a reason to give up.

**COME UP WITH A SLOGAN**

Singing a positive slogan can help you harness the power of a bad habit because repetition of a phrase hardwires it into your brain[4]. Create a slogan such as ‘stay on track’ or ‘one step at a time’ and repeat it ten times a day to burn the thought into your brain.

**ASK ADVICE**

Talk to your partner or a close friend about how to reward your good behavior if you would be successful in quitting a bad habit – keep the reward reasonable and achievable;  so that you can stick onto it.

**THE RIGHT SUPPORT**

Before you discuss making a life change with someone, make sure you are choosing someone who will be supportive enough to make you feel good about yourself when you need it the most. Don’t ask a smoker for support on giving up, for instance!

**GIVE YOURSELF A CHANCE**

If it was easy to kick bad habits nobody would have any, so accept yourself the way you are and try to do better in future[5]. Chart your progress so that you can see how things develop over time and look back to motivate yourself. The habit will help you in the long run.

**MOVE YOUR NOTES**

Posting motivational notes[6] around the house to remind yourself to be positive is a great idea, but keep in mind that after a few days your brain will “background it” unless you move it to a new place.

**KEEP THE CHANGE**

To help you form a positive new habit, put ten coins in your left pocket and each time you remember to do your chosen thing, move one to the right pocket. When you have moved all ten several days in a row, the habit is formed.

**DO IT FOR THIRTY**

Focus on one change only for 30 days and during that time concentrate solely on that one thing and don’t try to change anything else about your life. After 30 days, move on to the next change, or take a break from change for a while. Trying to focus on several things is difficult and makes it more likely you’ll give up on all of them.

**PULL THE TRIGGER**

Come up with a trigger; which is a short ritual you link with a change to condition new patterns of your own behavior. Examples include snapping your fingers every time you want a cigarette if you’re trying to quit, or jumping out of bed as soon as the alarm starts if you’re used to sleeping in.

**KICK ‘BUT’**

Use the word “but” to help you change negative thought cycles. If you find your inner voice telling you that you’re bad at something[7], use “but” to make it positive like, “I’m crap at this … but if I keep practicing I’ll get better“.

**PRINT YOUR PROMISES**

If you’ve made a commitment to yourself to change, don’t keep it in your head where it could become warped or forgotten.

Writing down promises makes them harder to break as they tend to get settled in your subconscious.

**KEEP SCHTUM**

Studies have shown that people who talk about things to exhaustion before they do them are less likely to follow through. By all means discuss your chosen course of action, but don’t let words take over from actions.

**BET ON IT**

Motivate yourself to change a habit[8] by having a wager with a friend.

Making a public commitment and promising to give up something is agreat motivator for the tough times.

**BE CONSISTENT**

Make sure your habit is as consistent as possible and doesn’t require thought or  keeping it consistent will only allow the habit to get drilled into your subconscious instead of you having to remind yourself.

**REPLACE LOST NEEDS**

If you’re trying to give up a habit that gives you something.;like comfort eating or watching television to relax, bear in mind that the feeling you’re giving up will need to be replaced with an alternative behavior.

**STAGGER YOUR REWARDS**

If you’re trying to reinforce behavior; plait to reward yourself as often as possible in  the first week, then every week for a month and then every month for three months.

**OH YES! YOU CAN**

Be vigilant in your hunt for negative thoughts, like “I can’t do it”, and keep squashing them and replacing them with positives like “I can do it ,I am doing it“. If you think positive, you will succeed.

**KEEP IT SIMPLE**

Don’t let the change in your behavior become a complicated biggie! Keep it to a few rules to help form habits and avoid confusions. Exercising every day for half an hour is easier to remember than a complicated weekly regime, for example.

**MAKE LINKS**

Try to link your rewards to your behaviour change. If you’re replacing smoking with exercise, for example, use the money you would have spent on cigarettes to buy yourself new exercise gear, a gym membership, or a sports massage.

*You aren’t bad, Habits are bad. Make sure you follow these simple steps to get rid off them before they eat you. *

Side Notes: Players do not have access to /back or any teleportation commands aside from               /spawn, /home, and Towny spawns. Surviving the night can be overwhelming with the status effects of mobs (MonsterEffects) and very frustrating if you are not prepared. Please be aware of this before joining.

* **Rules**: 

1) Do not ask to be made OP or staff. Do not ask for items.

2) Griefing is not allowed in any form. Things that count as griefing: Stealing in any form, breaking without permission, setting up traps, placing without permission, generally anything that causes problems for other players. (Breaking naturally generated items like nether fortresses, mineshafts, strongholds, and Villager villages is not griefing, unless the area has been claimed by someone.)

3) Mods, cheats, and anything that gives you an unfair advantage over the rest of the server are not allowed. Certain mods may be allowed, such as InvTweaks and Rei's Minimap. Inquire if you have any questions on what is allowed and what isn't.

4) Do not ask for server files. The answer is always ""no.""

5) No spamming! Spamming counts as: advertising non-approved material (especially other servers), repeating phrases/words over and over, begging for items/sell items/join towns/add members to town/etc., excessive CAPS lock.

6) No 1x1 tower or holes. These are fine as scaffolding, but take them down as soon as they are not needed.

7) No player traps! None! Period! If you're concerned that a project could be considered a player trap, contact staff.

8) Derogatory language, swearing, and vulgarity are not allowed. Please keep in mind that there are young children that play Minecraft and keep your language and behaviour appropriate.

9) No vulgar or derogatory builds. This means that, as fun as penises are, you cannot build them. No swastikas, no penises, etc.

10) Attempts to get around mutes, jails, tempbans and permabans can result in a longer or harsher sentence.

11) Listen to all the staff! Even the Interns! When you are asked to do something, listen to them. If you feel a staff-person is abusing their position, you need to contact another staff member, preferably a Founder.

12) Cyberbullying and cyberharassment is not allowed in any way, shape, or form. This includes persecuting other players for their age, religion, political views, sexual orientation, gender. We take cyberharassment seriously here and will not condone it at all. If you feel you are being targeted for such reasons, please contact staff and it will be dealt with.

13) Automatic and semi-automatic mobs farms, farms that break/bend gameplay mechanics, and farms that are unnecessarily large will not be allowed, due to potential issues involving the server's resources and therefore impacts the gameplay of other players.

20hjmk,1,2014-03-15,"I [25 M] like a girl [24 F] that I work with. I need advice, but I'm not sure who I can talk to about it.",anon285747,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/20hjmk/i_25_m_like_a_girl_24_f_that_i_work_with_i_need/,"Overview: I work in a client serving industry as part of a team. The girl in question is part of one of my teams, and has been for a little over a year. Over the course of the past year, I've grown more and more fond of her. We have the same stupid sense of humor; we've both almost gone into convulsions over some of the stuff the other said. Sense of humor is very important to me, which I think is what led me to be so attracted to her in the first place.

My problem extends beyond her being someone I work with. My industry involves more or less scheduled promotions. In other words, when she joined my team, we were the same rank, then a few months later I was promoted above her, which is where we now stand. She'll be promoted up to my level in a few months. I'm very fortunate that I haven't had to supervise or review her work up to this point - there would obviously be a conflict of interest there. That being said, I will likely be working with her in the April/May timeframe, likely in a supervisory capacity.

Let me step back a month. Up until that point, our relationship had been strictly platonic. We were at a happy hour, and both of us (well, everyone we were with also) had far too much to drink. I asked her if I could crash on her couch, as I had done once before. I commute a long way to work, so it would've been a long cab ride home otherwise. She said yes, so we headed back to her apartment. I was fully expecting to just lay down on her couch and go to sleep, but she told me to go lay on her bed, and that I could just stay above the covers. Things were a bit fuzzy here, but I ended up telling her exactly how I feel about her...the booze made me go into more detail than I probably would have liked (think somewhat gushy, middle school thoughts that should never see the light of day). Anyway, we ended up making out. Of course I was happy about that, but I couldn't help feeling guilty because I know what we did was inappropriate. In the morning we both had to go to work, so we woke up pretty early. It wasn't awkward or anything - we cracked the same types of jokes we usually do and laughed together.

I guess the bottom line is this: I am absolutely crazy about this girl. I have only liked one other girl even remotely close to how much I like her, and that was when I was 17 or so. I think about her every single day, for a good portion of the day. I feel like I hide my feelings for her pretty well when I'm at work, but one person on the team (as well as an intern who was there for a few weeks) both approached me saying they can tell I like her. 

Relationships on teams in my industry aren't really tolerated. If I asked her out and the head honchos figured out, one of us would be asked to leave the team, which I don't want for either of us. I haven't brought up what happened at her apartment or ""us"" in general since it happened - I'm afraid to. Sometimes I feel like, regardless of if she would want to be in a relationship with me or not, I should walk away from the team. If I leave and she doesn't want a relationship, great. If we had the talk and she doesn't want a relationship, I feel like I would absolutely need to leave. I honestly wouldn't be able to deal with hearing the girl talk at work if she were to get a boyfriend, let alone seeing her every day knowing that nothing is going to happen. Leaving isn't as simple as it sounds though - the team is dependent on me, and would be very upset, possibly angry if I told them I had to leave.

I am completely lost. I feel like I'm torturing myself thinking about my situation and what I should do about it. Like I said, I'm just not sure who I can talk about this with, so I'm trying you guys. Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks.

20hmrg,26,2014-03-15,"My supervisor gave me horrible reviews and I might lose my internship, what can I do?",[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/20hmrg/my_supervisor_gave_me_horrible_reviews_and_i/,"For context, I'm a 21 year old female student in computer science, he's a 50+ male working in corporate IT support. I've been working with this man for about three months now. We are in a separate office away from all of the other employees on the floor. 

Everything was going fine until two weeks ago. We began arguing a lot over work related issues (it started when another intern needed my help with something, I went to help him before doing as my supervisor asked -stacking boxes in the supply room). I did not realize that this week was also the week of midterm evaluations. He flamed me to the point where I may lose my internship if I don't show improvements. I've never had issues with any of my other supervisors, and I've always had good reviews. 

Yesterday I was called in to see HR, and I lost control and started crying out of frustration. It was horrible and I'm extremely embarrassed. This man is very difficult to work for (short tempered, loud, condescending, type A personality) and I dread going in to work each day. I set up a meeting to talk with him about ways I can improve, he listed things such as showing more motivation (this is fair), completing all of my tasks quicker and more thoroughly, and learning all of the names of the people on our floor (about 50 people, this is not necessary to complete my work). He sees my natural shyness and quiet nature as a huge character flaw that I need to change. 

We are working in a very high stress environment due to a project that will take several months to complete. He works through lunch everyday and expects that I do the same, though he hasn't outwardly said it. I barely have time to check my email and he often gives me multiple tasks to complete at a time, then becomes angry and dismissive if I ask questions. What can I do to salvage this situation, I cannot lose this internship, but this person is extremely petty and likely to hold a grudge against me. I am not the first intern to have trouble with him. 

He is the type of person who loves to gossip and judge other people. He often calls the users stupid once they're immediately out of earshot, and I'm sure he does the same to me. If he gets in trouble for my emotional breakdown in HR he will make sure I'm removed from the company. I feel lost here and I'm to the point where I've started applying to different companies, just to get away from this man. "
20hner,11,2014-03-15,Best way to reach seniors looking for programming jobs?,jmoseck,Drexel,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drexel/comments/20hner/best_way_to_reach_seniors_looking_for_programming/,"What is the best way for a company to reach seniors who are Computer Science majors or those interesting in programming? I am a 2010 Drexel alum (BS/MS in Computer Science) who works for Bloomberg LP, a financial software company with complex programming challenges, cutting edge technology, demanding clientele, and great pay/benefits. We are always looking for new talent, especially at our Princeton office location not too far from Philadelphia. 

Previously we ""officially"" recruited at Drexel via information sessions and career fairs, but we weren't getting enough candidates due to Bloomberg only having a 3 month summer internship program that doesn't line up with co-ops, and we found that most seniors already had a job lined up through their co-ops (which is a great thing to hear as a Drexel alum, but not so much as a Bloomberg employee who would love to see more of his alum applying).

So I'm wondering what is the best way to reach you guys on a grass roots level? Are there any CS job boards? Is this sub-reddit a good place? I'm open to any and all ideas.

If you are interested in applying to Bloomberg, feel free to private message me and we can talk. Also, if you just want to apply on your own, check it out here:  http://jobs.bloomberg.com/job/New-York-2014-Software-Developer%2C-Entry-Level-Job-NY/36470100/ Finally, if you have any questions about the company I would be happy to answer it here.

I applied to( in order of preference): CS, CompE, Mech, Chem. The only program that actually took me was MSE. I blame nobody other than myself, as my gpa wasn't up to par(3.65 at the time, 3.4 now). 

I'm a current 4th year(will take next year to grad), as I developed major anxiety during college and took a year off to self-help, and then came back, got school counseling and now I'm here. I failed to get any internships, failed to join any clubs, and don't even have a job. I blame nobody other than myself.

Now that you have my background allow me to tell you what I truly wanted:
I've always been interested in energy, and I've loved the idea of working with drilling for resources, that, or working in the mining industry as that also interested me.
But, as soon as I entered college, and took a java programming course, I wanted to go into CS(probably a bad choice, but at the time seemed like the right thing to do)
I started ""day dreaming"" of things I wanted to do with my degree(s):
-I wanted to get a CS degree, and work with snapchat(software eng), or other mobile applications. Or work with trading software.
-Back-up plan was getting my ME degree and hopefully placing myself in good position to land a job in drilling on off-shore rigs or something related to drilling like at a place like BP or Chevron.


But now, after being rejected from all those departments, and getting a MSE degree, I've realized that I may have no chance for any of these jobs, and since I've gotten no internships, I've pretty much ruined any chances. 

I'm just here to ask, if there is reason to keep hope alive for these jobs? If so, is there anything I can do now to hopefully make me get into a decent position to apply for a senior internship or even a co-op during my senior year? What would I absolutely need to know how to do regarding things like soft. engineering at a place like snapchat? or drillling intern at Chevron?





Cliffs:
-Rejected from most departments, but wanted engineering, got MSE

-No internship(entering last year), no extracurrics

-Want to work in soft or drilling(two diff worlds, but my only interests).

-Places like Snapchat, Chevron, or a trading company(software purposes)

-If there is hope, what can I do over the summer/now to build my resume?

-What do I absolutely need to know in order to be successful in applying to intern/co-op spots for places like snapchat, etc

I have years of experience, but no degree or work history in the business. ( [Here is my post from when I got my job](http://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1qlfgm/i_just_got_my_first_web_development_job_what_do_i/) ) 

Everything is working out great with my new job. I work on a small team and learn every day. My main responsibilities are support for our custom CMS, building wordpress sites and maintenance on these sites. While my job is currently focused on front end work and support, I have experience with LAMP and I would like to pursue a career in software engineering. There is the opportunity for me to shift my role to back-end developer for our CMS. This requires skills in C#/MVC/Linq, I have been studying and building my experience using my personal time with the help of a mentor at my company. I've made good progress and I believe I will be starting this transition over the next few months.

I live in Houston and am salaried at $32k/Year. I believe I am on the low end of the compensation scale for an entry-level employee with my responsibilities in my area.  On the other hand, I broke into the industry only 4 months ago - you could almost consider it a paid internship.

A few questions:

- I believe I am currently underpaid with my current level of responsibilities. Do you think this assumption is accurate?
- What steps do I need to take to maximize my earnings as a newcomer to the industry?
- Is the shift to developing in C# a smart idea in terms of earning power and overall career potential?
- At what point is it smart to consider switching companies for better compensation? Is this effected by a possible new position as a C# developer (and all the potential that comes with it)?

And of course I always appreciate any general advice you may have for someone new to the web development and CS industry.

Thank you in advance!"

So much that she had to postpone starting university.

She's dealing with depression from being trapped at home and my parents have a terrible marriage and she hears both parents ""vent"" about the other. It's just a very bad situation and she's stuck right in the middle of it all.

She sometimes seems to be hopeless about everything. The time for her evaluation before being given approval to come back to college is approaching but she's not ready to come back and I'm scared that postponing college another year will be detrimental to her mental health- it'll mean another year at home.

I keep hearing such horrible things from family members telling me I'm a horrible sister for not just taking the semester off from college to go be with her because her health is deteriorating. If I take the semester off, I lose an incredible internship I have this summer and risk not graduating on time. But on the other hand, I know she needs me.

I don't know what to do and while I know no one can give me the perfect path on how to help her, I was hoping I can get some suggestions: what has helped people succeed on their path to recovery? What can I do while being 500 miles away? Would me being at home make a big difference?

Tl;dr: Wondering what people suggest I do to help my sister who is at home dealing with an ED and depression while I'm 500 miles away at college.

Thank you all so much.

She read them and her religious programming caused her brain to short circuit and go into self righteous overdrive, condemning him for being associated with me and my ungodly actions. The letter was basically a long winded ultimatum between myself and Snow White, so my friend having half a brain at the time shut her out of his life. Unfortunately the pussy withdrawal eventually slingshot his poor soul back between her legs. The lack of backbone was so severe that my then friend agreed to cut me off to continue his pathetic streak of depression-induced dopamine drip. 

Hope you get a good laugh out of this like I did :)

Fyi we did visit swing clubs etc but only to hook up with others girls ;)

Full letter - (fake names)

Collin,

I first off I wanted to say that I care for you very much, and I appreciate all the effort you have put into making me happy. We’ve had countless laughter filled nights, and the best spontaneous adventures over the last two years. We have also shared many serious and intimate moments together. With all of these memories very dear to my heart, it is easy to say you have been, and are my best friend. 

I have to come clean with something that I have done, and in no way shape or form do I find justification in my actions. However, I do have a reason for what I did. The more time we spend together the more attached I become, and as a result, the more I think of our futures being intertwined. Because of what has happened to me in the past, I do come with certain baggage that sometimes drives me to do the things I do, and think the way I think. I am not all consumed by these issues, but they do effect me in moments of weakness or insecurity. I guess I want to make sure that when the day comes with the right person, there is no doubt in my mind that I can trust them completely. 

With all that being said, the other day when I asked to use you’re Ipad, I looked through your messages with George. I just had a bad feeling, a suspicion , and I acted on it. I am sorry for invading your privacy, and as I said before, in no way am I justified in doing so. If you choose to not read on, I totally understand that. 

I was very upset to find what I did. Especially because they were issues that I had previously made clear and addressed. I was not aware that George was a current participant in swinger clubs, orgies, and threesomes. The information you have shared with me about him was obviously only the tip of the iceberg. I guess it was smart of you to conceal these things from me, because if I had known the extent that he was involved with these disturbing and unclean things, I would have deeply questioned your character (as to why you would even associate yourself with this “type” of person.)and I’d certainly question the basis of the relationship. Had I known, I would have absolutely never wanted to meet him in person, or wanted to make something work with you when you moved to New York (originally keeping from me that you would be staying in his apartment with him and his girlfriend who is equally entangled and consumed in that life style). And I really hope the so called “jazz bar” that he “made you go to” was as harmless as you made it out to seem.
I knew that he and I were very different in our morals and value system, but I had no idea of the extent he was involved with such things, things that I find revolting, disturbing, and ultimately very sad. 


I know about the “photos” he sends you, and read for myself the graphic stories about the massages, the orgies, the swingers club, and the threesomes. I understand that this has been your “friend” for 8 years. Maybe he was the closest things to a friend you had during the dark parts of your life. Maybe you liked having him as an ally because you felt he wouldn’t “judge you” or maybe the fact that he wasn’t in close proximity to you gave you a sense of ease. What I don’t understand is why you would keep someone so close to you for so long that has these types of values. What is even more perplexing to me is how can you have a friend like this, and be in a relationship with me??? I knew you and I weren’t in complete unison in our beliefs and interests, but you never struck me as someone who would share the same interests as George. I am shocked. But he obviously feels very comfortable telling you all these gruesome stories and even sending you graphic photos. It’s clear that he thinks you want to hear them, and based upon your responses, you truly do what to hear/see. It’s obvious that this behavior is “normal” in your relationship, and has been a reoccurring theme over the years. You have been very careful as to make sure I do not see any of these messages, warning him “TMI … with my girl” or “watching a movie with my girl” 

Again, it just truly confuses me to no end that he is your best friend, and that you have pursued me as your girlfriend. It is possibly the biggest contradiction I have ever witnessed. He and I stand for polar opposites. I stand for a deep, loving and long term connection, and he stands for meaningless, hollow, disgusting (and potentially life threatening) sexual encounters. I am rich morally, and he is morally bankrupt. I have tried my whole life to preserve my purity and innocence (although not perfect), and he earnestly seeks to completely drowned himself in things that are dirty and corrupt abominations. 

I know I was very blessed to have grown up being taught right from wrong, and to have had parents who had strong moral convictions. I was even more blessed to have been given to opportunity to attend a school that sheltered, protected, and reinforced these values. I’m trying very hard to forgive George for his actions and exposing them to you. Because I know that he was not fortunate enough to brought up the same way, and his ignorance has enslaved him to be a product of his environment. However Collin, you have grown in a much more fortunate and blessed environment than he was. In no way am I saying your life has been easier than his, because I’m quite certain it hasn’t been, but at least you have been exposed to the truth. You had the support of your family, they put you in a great school, and you’re much smarter than George. So I do hold you more accountable, because I know you know right from wrong.
I am in no way giving you an ultimatum, or anything of that nature. He is who he is, you are who you are, and I can’t change that. The two of you have been “friends” for 8 years, and you and I have been together for 2. I hope that you know deep down who has been more of a friend to you for the time spent, and I really hope you realize that it’s always been me. But I am in no way delusional enough to ask you to choose, or to even think you would even choose me. However I think we can both agree that George would be a toxic, negative and corrupt influence on anyone. Where as I know I have been a positive influence in your life and have helped stimulate your growth as a person. I know your stomach would turn (and you would rightfully question my character) if I was “friends” with someone who mirrored his actions. I know the girls down here I hang out with are not perfect (and again I know I am not either), but in no way are they anywhere close in comparison to his level. I try my hardest to influence them in a positive way. You are influenced by those you choose to surround yourself with; anyone would be a fool to deny that fact. 

The thing that bothered me the most was the text conversation dating back to August. George had texted you saying “dude just got done having a threesome” you replied “with who?” He said “with Gina and this Spanish chick who had fat tits and a huge round ass” and you replied “Pic???” “Props bro” its one thing to try and appease your friends, because we have all been guilty of that on some level. But to encourage and congratulate him for such behavior is wrong. It is absolutely nothing to celebrate. It is not cool, and is nothing to admire. But what really crushed me was that you took it a step further and asked to be included in this abomination by asking for a picture. It made me sick. And I am hurt on a level I will never be able to express in words. This is something I cannot just “ignore or sweep under the rug” I can’t pretend this didn’t happen. I cannot be with someone who wants/encourages/is curious/is ok with this lifestyle. If you weren’t supportive/interested in these action or beliefs, you would have asked George a long time ago to not talk about those things with you, let alone ask for dirty pictures. At the very least you could have asked him to stop out of respect for me.

It is heart breaking and an utter shock to realize after so long, that we do not want the same things. That our morals, values, and interests are nowhere as similar as I once thought they were. I knew we were different, but I truly thought our core values were the same. I do believe you were attracted to the love and purity that I radiate, that you recognized and admired my beliefs and strong convictions. And ultimately I had hoped more than anything, that you would want the same for your life. 

I know I haven’t been the perfect example to you, but I know I have affected you in a very positive way. And you have helped me and supported me through some hard times. For that I am appreciative. And always will be. In no way does what I found discredit you for all the good you have done for me. 

I guess we just have to be honest with ourselves. We may need very different things. You may need someone who is OK with those specific interests or maybe even someone who supports them (and in this day in age I’m sure that won’t be hard to find). But I need to be someone’s one and only (not just physically, but mentally and emotionally) who shares the same values. Intern I will go above and beyond for that person, and will always be by their side. I tried very hard to meet your needs, constantly trying to make myself more attractive to you. But beyond that, I tried to be kind and love you more each day. 

I have come to some very healthy realizations- I am more than enough, and I will never let anyone make me feel like I am anything less than that. And also, no matter what you do for someone (how good you look, how kind you treat them) It will never be enough if they are not a happy content person. I hope you find what you’re looking for, whatever it is. "

I've spent the entire semester looking for internships with little success. Earlier in the semester our school had an engineering career fair that I attended, but I did not get a response from any of the companies I met. In a few weeks there will be another career fair, but I don't know what to do to differentiate myself from every other engineer there. 

I have a low gpa (2.64) and no work experience. What I lacked in grades and work experience I tried to make up with leadership experience with little sucess. 

What can I do to better myself as a candidate so that I can at least get to interviews. There is not much time left before it is too late for any internships this summer and any help would be appreciated.

20io4y,2,2014-03-15,"Am I batshit and beyond help? Self-loathing, depression, anxiety, all these fun things.",nope-pasaran,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/20io4y/am_i_batshit_and_beyond_help_selfloathing/,"Uhm, 27/f, depression, anxiety, been through 6 therapists, 2 meds and 1 12-week outpatient programme, and whoop-de-doo, feel worse than ever

**tl;dr I'm one of those old, jobless, forever alone, crazy people who are worried they're beyond help. **

* Took 7 years to now be almost finished with a BA that I have no passion for and that has terrible employment opportunities (English). I love learning and I don't think I'm one of those people who necessarily should have never set foot inside academia, I'm fascinated with history, sociology, critical theory and astronomy and if my brain worked better I'd probably go back to reading and discussing them for fun. Grades aren't stellar but slightly above average for my uni/department. Failed my undergrad thesis on the first try, have no clue what topic to choose for the second try, haven't even told my advisor about the debacle yet. I feel like adult life is just getting up every morning for 10 hours in some job one hates, and, as a woman, sacrificing yourself for a husband and children. Why develop passions and interests, hopes and dreams when they're irrelevant anyway? Also what employer will take me with a CV like this? (Apart from uni I've got one great internship and two student jobs, all in an intercultural/NGO setting, but not much else. I envy my friends for their creativity and political activism, but I'm too scared and talent-free to ever do anything to live up to them.)

* Sexual experience? Laughable. At least I've been kissed. Relationship experience? One relationship that failed horribly and a handful of amazing close friendships who did, I daresay, teach me a lot about communication, acceptance, caring and love. (Also boundaries but I still suck at that). I would give my life for these ladies. But yeah. Not looking good for someone my age. Add to that that I think I'm bi, leaning towards women romantically, and, unfortunately, have issues trusting men. (People have told me I'm only into women because I'm afraid of men, which I feel deep down may be untrue, but then I tend to trust other people's judgement over my own, so I've become confused over the years :/) Of course I don't believe ALL men are cheating, potentially violent, abusive, macho man-child scumbags, of course there's lots of decent, chill dudes, but I've encountered too many who were the former, and unfortunately, some who turned from decent to scumbag without warning.

* I try to numb my feelings with an internet addiction. I do go outside to work or to class, and sometimes to meet a friend or to party, but I don't really feel any connection to what I learn and do and whom I meet most of the time. I can be very outgoing, smiley, funny, and people say I'm very kind, but it's all shallow and as soon as I come home I just crash in a crying heap of self-loathing or numbness.

I went on a year abroad and had a great group of friends there, but for some reason it seems impossible for me to really connect with anyone in the place I live now. To be honest, I don't really see the point, either. For someone like me, who isn't special, smart, creative, with lots of sexual prowess, and who seems to just not fit in and be ""normal"", life is just about trying to fulfil other people's expectations to gain permission to exist, and the more people I meet, the more different expectations I have to fulfil, and the more tiring life gets. I'm a perfectionist because I've learned that only people who are at least completely ""normal"", at best stand out in a positive way are allowed some degree of freedom in life, and some degree of acceptance, but all I'm good at is failing and standing out in a negative way. For everyone else, life means nothing but sacrifice and one's self being irrelevant. So I'm just trying to hide, being a leech on my family and society until they kick me out and I become homeless like I deserve. I know this makes me sound like I'm lazy and self-pitying and blaming everyone else, but I'm really only blaming myself for not being good enough. I know these are all crazy thoughts and I just need to kick myself and be disciplined and suck it up, but for some reason I'm completely blocked and whenever I do try to kick myself and eg. work hard for uni, the words just dance on the page and I can't make sense of what I read, or alternatively I end up self-harming to punish myself for being crazy and a terrible, lazy, selfish etc. person. 

I know I should just pull myself together and change my thoughts as per CBT, but it's like they are so entrenched that I can't stop believing them :/ No matter how often I'm told they are irrational and I agree, as soon as I'm on my own I just succumb to the ""all the optimistic things are just unrealistic, irrational lies you tell yourself, look at the facts, the facts show you are worth nothing and only who works all the time to be perfect and fits in deserves happiness, but not you lazy, freaky, abnormal scum"". 

**Idk, I'm beyond help, am I? No chance for a healthy life? Is it too late for me to have a relationship? Can someone like me even hope for a job they feel comfortable in? Is there any way for me to stop hating myself and maybe even have my own interests and needs? (Or should I better kiss them good-bye anyway since these things are selfish in an adult woman?) Do I belong in a hospital? Can I do this *without* having to check into a hospital? I'm in therapy, but should I try meds again? (I also try to exercise but I'm often just too down to get up and go to the gym or dance class). Am I totally batshit and a burden?** "
20iot8,1,2014-03-15,How do you deal with hate?,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/20iot8/how_do_you_deal_with_hate/,"There is a guy on campus that I hate. Theres no other word for it. In fact he lives on the same floor a few doors down from me. Hes extremely pretentious, he thinks he is far more intelligent that he actually is, and he's creepy. He constantly pesters me via facebook and other people even though he knows I want absolutely nothing to do with him. The hate all started a few months to a year ago. We play the same game competitively and he consistently beats me (granted hes been playing 5 years longer than me) and he is very arrogant. When I think about him being a smartass to me I just want to slap the shit out of him. I'm trying to find a way to deal with the hate so that it never gets to that point (although it never will, since I am a pacifist). I just wish he would grow up and leave me alone. I'm 20 and busy with a full time internship (CS) and taking 5 classes. He is 26, an alcoholic, and a graduate (IT) student that shares classes with me (whenever I take an IT elective because apparently his graduate classes are my bullshit IT electives). 

TL;DR: This guy has no redeemable qualities. When I look at it objectively I find no reason to be in a pissing contest with him, because I know that I'm much more mature and farther along in my career (which at its core has a much larger potential). But I still can't help but hate him. Why is this?"

I'm the devoted family man with a hot, loyal wife and 4 gorgeous daughters aged 19 to 13. I've never dreamed of hurting you or the girls. I've done everything in my power to please you, to dote on our bright, vivacious girls But men are weak.

Then that girl, a young college intern, started at my office and I fell victim to her flirtation and my own male urges. One night I lied to you, a first, and said I was staying late to work. Ever my devoted wife, you came to bring me dinner. A full sirloin steak and baked potato. Arriving at the office you catch me redhanded nailing that slut on the conference room table. 

She tearfully retreated and I stopped the encounter, realizing I'd made a colossal mistake. You pack me a bag and told me to stay at my brother's house until further instructed. Knowing it's my only chance, I agree.

A week later you send me a message for me to return home where you'll give me one chance to make amends.

(Without giving away the whole plot: this would involve my being shamed by my family of women, then being ""forced"" to have sex with our daughters as you prove that I was a fool for seeking Sex outside of our family)

20ivqv,2039,2014-03-15,The hard realities of working at Riot Games,[deleted],leagueoflegends,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/20ivqv/the_hard_realities_of_working_at_riot_games/,"My name is Jon Pan. I work on the Internship Program team so I have been very involved in all aspects of recruiting. Because of my involvement with recruiting, I feel that most candidates who interview at Riot understand the pros of working here: passionate co-workers who are gamers, co-workers who care about the product/our players, the freedom to assume greater responsibilities, flexible work schedule, unlimited PTO, etc.

Yet very few candidates understand the cons of working here. That is why I’m here today – to shed some light on the hard realities of working at Riot Games, as well as to talk about my positive experiences through situations I've encountered. **Treat this as only one anecdote, find more stories, do more research.** 

The three main themes I want to cover are:

1. **Getting a project or initiative done at Riot is pretty damn hard, but satisfying.** There are a lot of complexities at Riot and everything is intertwined. Rioters are generally a passionate bunch and we've got a weird culture where there are tons of alphas yet everyone is willing to collaborate. Sometimes, because of our consensus culture, nothing gets done until someone with great compromising skills steps in and gets to the lowest common denominator- then the ball gets rolling. 

2.  **You need to have a presence to succeed at Riot.** Many at Riot have strong personalities and you need to be strong in your own genuine way. This may be controversial, but I think if you are unable or unwilling to stand out, look energetic, and get your thoughts across in a concise way, it is hard to be heard at Riot. I rarely, if ever, meet a wallflower at Riot. I love getting my ideas challenged by Rioters who started yesterday or three years ago. People are expected to hit the ground running here, and part of that is having a strong presence and having self-confidence. 

3. **Riot becomes your life.** Rioters truly care about the company mission: to be the most player-focused game company in the world. And sometimes, people can't turn off that passion. Some Rioters have never had to work a weekend. Some have to work weekends due to the nature of their work (being on call, shifts). Some work on the weekends when they don't really need to. I fall into the third category. There have only been a few weekends that I haven’t worked (think 1-4 hours spread over a weekend, not 8 hours). I do it because Riot has a mission that I believe in. This isn't some crap that’s printed in some brochure that we keep in our drawers. I don’t even have a drawer. However, I'm aware that I need to turn it off sometimes. If I don’t, at best I burn myself out, at worst, I negatively impact my team.

**In conclusion,** it has been both intellectually and emotionally rewarding and exhausting to work at Riot, but I have loved every minute of it. And if I scared off even one person, good. I want you to manifest your true human potential at the right company. I've only offered a glimpse, my glimpse, of my perception and experiences at Riot Games. Treat this as one anecdote, find more stories, do more research. I look forward to working with some of you in the future :)

Time to go break out of Silver……

**Edit 1:** Going to shorten a few things as this beast is kind of long, correct a few typos, adding a TL;DR to the top, removing a few things like the Glassdoor link (you can get that on your own), clarifying some thoughts

**Edit 2:** A lot of my own comments that I think really complement the original post have been buried pretty deep so I'm going to bring them into the original post here, like flexibility, etc.

**Edit 3:** I wrote a [follow-up](http://bit.ly/1AsC5ce) to this one year later

I moved in August to Honolulu to start a graduate program, and started at the gym just going to classes. After a totally sluggish Christmas break where I drank away my loneliness from my family, I got back in the groove with this semester and began lifting weights and running (which I NEVER thought I could do before). The results were crazy - and while I weighed the same amount as before plus or minus 5 pounds, I started to feel better in my clothes, began having to take clothes in, and started counting calories again. My boyfriend also began to get serious about training and eating healthfully.
Then, I decided to start training for roller derby. This is crazy - I work, I have an internship, and I'm a fulltime graduate student working on an optional thesis. I can barely bank gym hours, let alone skate practicing hours. Not to mention, I'm terrified of skating (which is the main reason why I'm doing it - I want to conquer my fear).
On the first practice, 2 weeks ago today, I fell directly on my ass and broke my tailbone. I haven't been able to work out, run, lift, skate, or really anything physical - my boyfriend and I have only had sex a handful of times since the I broke this stupid and totally useless bone. Watching practice today, I got so depressed - I won't be able to catch up to their skill level, I was already one of the less ""in shape"" girls to begin with, and now I've had two weeks of being totally sedentary. I feel sluggish, and my boyfriend and I are having money troubles. Should that happen, what's going to go first? Oh, the protective gear I haven't bought yet and the gym membership.
I'm feeling utterly lost right now. When I was on a roll, I was so happy and confident. Now, I'm don't know what to do with myself and sort of feel like it's all falling apart.
How much of a struggle did you guys go through on your weight loss journey? Please tell me I'm not the only one."

I am currently a junior studying CS at a small liberal arts college with a 3.5 GPA. After my sophomore year I had an internship with a start up working on their automatic test handler and testing their product's REST API for 3 months and the internship went very well.

I have coursework in Data Structures, Databases, Operating Systems, and a lot more. I have a lot of experience with Java, C++, Python, Ruby and some experience with Javascript, HTML, CSS, and Django.

I have a couple small side projects but not very many because until recently I was a varsity athlete and that took up a lot of my time.

This year I have applied for 50-60 internships at both small and large companies. I got one interview that went 3 rounds but did not end up getting the job and other than that I have had no interview opportunities. 

Is there something more I should be doing or other experience that I need to get? I feel like this summer is rapidly approaching and I am getting worried about not having an internship. I want more on the job experience to help with my job search next year and to increase my skills as an engineer.

TL; DR: I have internship experience and course experience, only got one interview that didn't work out, feeling nervous about prospects of getting a job for the summer.

20ks62,24,2014-03-16,Hypergamy from a Red Pill Doctor's Perspective (wall of text),rpthroway,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/20ks62/hypergamy_from_a_red_pill_doctors_perspective/,"I’ve lurked here for a while.  I have found my own experiences strikingly validative of hypergamy theory and decided to offer up some of my history (throwaway account for the obvious reasons).  Some background:  I'm now in my 40s.  I'm a physician in an upper-middle prestige specialty (i.e. psychiatry=low, neurosurgery=high).  I'm physically fairly attractive (7-8 face, six feet tall, muscular broad-shouldered build that fluctuates from lean to about twenty pounds overweight (which I carry fairly well).   I have a mix of alpha and beta tendencies but I would say that I'm considerably more weighted toward the alpha than the average male and certainly more than the average physician. I'm also an information junkie and that has led to the impression that I'm intelligent and worldly - vastly more than the average man and significantly more than the average doctor.  Finally, I've also been more financially successful than the average physician and have approaching an eight figure net worth.

Lest you think this is one big commercial for me, let me also confess at this point that I have a number of insecurities, character flaws, regrets, unfulfilled desires, disappointments, failures, and all of those other things that most of us struggle with.  I really don’t know what the source is that motivates one to push through the inhibitions and still try to achieve but I seem to have at least some of it.

I was blessed with intelligence and I've always been very academically successful.  I have a pretty good physique and I’ve also been decent at sports.  In my adolescence I did not have much confidence with women but the lack was more due to a lack of experience - and probably a lack of natural alphaness as I was naturally kind of a geeky, intelligence-dominant kid.  Even so, I usually had a girlfriend and/or the interest of other girls during that time.

When I received my M.D., it was like someone had let me behind the velvet rope.  Women became much more aggressive in showing their interest in me.  Being asked out by a woman had happened a few times in my life before this but now, while I wouldn't call it frequent, it became a more regular occurence.  I remember as an intern my car broke down.  The counter girl at the shop said ""I hear doctors are really busy when they're starting out - if you ever want a home-cooked meal, here's my number.""  Things like that began happening.

More to the point, this was when married women really started expressing interest in me.  I was in my late twenties, full of vigor and desire, so I fucked many of them.  I still have mixed feelings about this.  I regret getting involved with married women who had children.  As far as I know, none of those marriages ended because of me.  I hope that's truly the case.  I would like to say I regret fucking the married but childless, but deep down I have to admit that it was a rush, taking another man's woman.  My friends warned me that one day one of these husbands would burst through my door with vengeance on their mind but, honestly, that thought only made it more exciting.  (Several of the married women I had flings with had husbands in law enforcement.  I didn’t get involved with military wives.)  Again, I admit that I undoubtedly have some issues at play here to desire validation to that extent, but my point isn't so much about me as the women themselves.

It became so easy, that for a while I would see how many different women I could fuck in one day (three on multiple occasions but I never made it to four).  It progressed to my picking some woman that seemed like the most decent, loyal, sweet and loving wife I could find and see if I could get her to sleep with me.  I can't remember failing.   (The only cases of oneitis that I've ever had involved a couple of these women.)

Those two were the exceptions though.   I fucked women for the most part casually and then moved on.  If the women weren’t married, then most had boyfriends. In fact, it became evident to me early that life was a lot simpler if the women were attached in some way.   There were countless students (while I was training), secretaries, techs, and nurses.   My accountant (not wise although it worked out fine),  the Junior Leaguer arranging a hospital charity event (the most memorable of a number of Junior Leaguers over the years….), the Girl Scout troop leader who I met while she was chaperoning her girls selling cookies door to door.    Even though I found attached women less cumbersome/demanding of my time, often they got very upset when I broke things off - even though I had made it clear that I was not committed in advance.   It was clear to me that despite what I had said, many were hopeful that we would eventually end up a couple.   As time went on I figured out that if they were careful and secretive about being with me they were just in it for the fun.  On the other hand, if they were reckless and less discrete, they wanted to disrupt their current situation and end up with me.

There were a few women that didn’t stray.   Those tended to be married to competent and physically imposing men.   Money and influence by themselves in a man were easy to overcome.  Dumb meatheads were likewise easy to overcome.  But capable men with a raw and powerful physical presence were definitely the best at keeping their women from cheating.  In fact, I can’t think of an instance where that describes the husband of any of the married women I fucked.

After I went into private practice, I had money to work with and invested aggressively and successfully.   At this point I had dated and married a mid-western woman who was a nurse in one of the hospitals I worked in who in her early twenties had just come out of a four year relationship.   I married her because I wanted children and because she is a phenomenal woman.  She had turned me down the first time I asked her out.  I knew that she also had turned down a number of other doctors and that helped my opinion of her as well.  It has worked out beautifully in that she is a red pill woman - she is astoundingly beautiful, secure and not overly demanding of my time, keeps herself in shape, and devotedly takes care of me and my children.

For most of the early years of our marriage I still fucked around.  I loved and wanted my wife but I simply didn’t have the will power to turn away what was constantly available.  I was careful to not jeopardize my career so I ignored intimations from patient’s wives (and even several of my pediatric patient’s moms).    I also always turned down overtures from colleague’s and friend’s wives.  In fact, after my oneitis experiences, I tried to avoid married women altogether at this point.   However, then and now, far and away the most aggressive in their pursuit are married women.  They will start conversations with me and when they mention their husband, it is invariably accompanied by some dismissive or derogatory comment.  These are often women with husbands that are successful in their own right, although objectively of a lower socioeconomic status than me.  These women were not being abused or in any sort of real distress.  I couldn’t see any substantial reason for wanting to be involved with me other than for fun of it or for the chance to “trade up.”

At this stage of my life, I preferred to fuck the single or, better yet, boyfriended young and highly attractive.   Most knew their place in the scheme of things but several lacked restraint and even tried to break up my marriage to get what they wanted.  I remember a respiratory therapist had called my home late at night wanting to tell my wife I had been fucking her.   I intercepted the call without suspicion (doctors get a lot of night calls).  Her slightly older and more experienced friend and coworker (who I was also fucking) stepped in and set her straight.  I spent a lot of energy keeping the parts of my life separate.

When children came, I finally shut down the extracurricular activities.  It probably had more to do with normal age-related declining testosterone levels than any real wisdom or maturity on my part.  I'm happy with the way things are now, and I know that as bad as my character might be considered, the vast majority of women are just as bad or worse.  I know that my wife has the potential to be no different than all those women I fucked along the way.  With that awareness, I keep myself in shape and in a position of respect and authority - not just in my family but in my hospital and community.  She is several years younger than me and still very attractive.  She doesn’t have to do anything but stand there and men will attempt to hit on her.  She will occasionally playfully tease me about this but I will just point and say ""There's the door if you think you can do better.""   I love her but I would get over the loss of her, but I am unwilling to lose my children so I lay low these days.  I’ve had more than my share of women and at this point, it’s not too much to give up for stability (stability and tranquility become ever more valuable with age).   My wife knows that women find me attractive but if she knows of any of my past dalliances, she has never let on.   She's still here, and as far as my cynical mind can tell, she's never strayed.

I have some regrets, but overall I had a great time.  The women I fucked were all women who would be considered high quality.  Some in terms of their physical attractiveness alone, others in terms of attractiveness combined with accomplishment and social standing.  Yet, with only rare exception, they fucked me readily and with no overt promise from me of anything more.   They did this despite being attached, married, or even married with children.  I’m now in my forties and my physique is still good but definitely past its prime.  But I’m also wealthier and more prestigious in my small pond than ever before.   And every day it’s still made clear to me – those married women are there, and as willing as ever."

The work I am doing involves AJAX, JQuery, and Java. I am not very familiar with any of these, but I wanted this challenge - I am prepared to learn these technologies in order to solve problems. 

The issue is that I have stupid questions. I was asked to set up an environment, and to use git to get access to the dev environment I will be working in etc. However, I tried to take care of these things and ran into a number of issues.

 I am afraid of asking my superiors about this, because it seems like a trivial problem. I feel like a gnat confronting these people and getting them to solve basic dependency issues. I was the one that asked for this. I want to grow, but I do not want to seem incompetent to the extent that my request to be challenged will be undermined by these sorts of issues.

I would just like some advice on how to handle problems like this. I assume that they will be rampant in this line of work.

Okay so: we've been dating for six years and as you can tell, that means the whole high-school sweethearts deal. Our relationship has been pretty stable and we've dated throughout university. I am graduating this April (I spent a year doing an internship as part of my degree), she graduated last April, and started her Masters in October in Europe, which is a whole ocean away (7 hours time difference total). 

Long distance relationships are tough. We've done it before, as she's gone to another country in Europe for a semester of her udergrad as well as, she had a summer job on the other side of the country. This time though, it's much longer. She left in October, with plans on being back in December for Christmas. The last few months were pretty rough, definitely I felt like we were distant (emotionally). But when she came back, we were both very happy to be together and had a great time over the holidays. She left again in January and won't be back until September. I bought plane tickets to visit her over a school break that happened to be right over her birthday, at the end ish of February, and we had made plans for me to go live with her in June, after I graduated.

My time there wasn't the best. She had lots of schoolwork to do, so did I and I felt like she wasn't happy, which made me not very happy either. To me I figured that things like that happen though, that week wasn't the best for us but I didn't put a lot of weight on it.

Since then, we've been barely texting. Any message I send will take a while to be answered, and the responses are shorter, not to mention I was the one initiating any conversation.


**Finally**, today we Skyped and she told me she wasn't feeling good about our relationship. She's been unsure of where we're going and she wants a break, or maybe to break up (it's still not 100% sure what exactly our status is. or maybe I'm still in denial, I don't know). She says she cares for me, but she doesn't think she loves me. She confirmed he felt the same way over the time she's been gone, both the unease in November and the unhappiness from February onward. One of the things she told me is that I did what I ""needed to"" for her birthday, but I didn't go out of my way to do anything special. Maybe that's true, but I did also fly to London to see her.

She told me that she needed time to think about things and that we're basically not in a relationship for now. I asked if we were going to Skype again the next weekend (we have done so the whole time she's been gone), to which she answered no (she later said that we would, but she may change her mind again).

Now, we've had a semi-breakup in the past. The previous Christmas, we had talks where she wanted a break, but eventually we talked and sorted through it. So leading up to the conversation I had 3 hours ago, things were feeling very similar.

The difference is now that she's far away, there is no opportunity to meet with her face-to-face. I feel completely helpless that this relationship is ending and there's nothing I can do to fix that. She is my absolute best friend, and now I am alone and I don't know if there's anything I can do to help fix things.

I will also be seeing her in about a month and a half. One of my friends and I are  going on a backpacking trip through a few countries in Europe, ending in her city. She said we should talk then. I personally feel like that is a ridiculously long time to wait to talk again, however it will be our next opportunity to talk in person.

---   
**tl;dr**: GF of 6 years breaks up with me while on the other side of the Atlantic, and says she needs time to think about ""us"". I will be seeing her in a month and a half. All I really want is to fix it all, but what do I do?"

Thank you for reading this whoever you are. I don't want to bother you but I have no one to talk to. I feel a little silly writing this as I know there are many people out there with worse problems than me. But lately I've been feeling at the end of the rope and right now I am considering self-harm and ending my life as a way to relieve the pain I'm feeling or even to make people care, because I am completely alone. The only reason I haven't done it yet is because I'm afraid of pain. I don't want to bore you but to keep it short, right now I'm in college and I should be happy: I have good grades and internships lined up, a boyfriend, ""friends"", I smile a lot, I'm entertaining, volunteer, I'm involved on campus. But I've been feeling so numb and sad, I cry every evening. I am completely alone and unable to find emotional closeness in my life. So while I crave affection I try to attain fulfillement in other ways to feel alive: I go on shopping sprees in clothing stores, spend hours looking at myself in the mirror practicing make-up and social interactions, get new tattoos...






I know you will probably tell me to talk to someone. But no one cares. My family lives abroad (I moved when I started college two years ago when I was 16). My parents cheated on each other and blamed my 'snooping' when I found out. Dad: mostly absent, avoids being at home. Mom: bipolar so either manic and terrifying or depressive and indifferent. Claims she's cured now. Three siblings. We're not really close. My family are fundamentalist christians; I'm pro-choice, atheist, pro-LGBT rights, bisexual. They don't know and I'm not telling them because now that I'm doing well in college I'm 'the good child' - I was sort of a scapegoat before. I don't have any friends that I can talk to because they wouldn't want to hear about it, or maybe they'd listen to me and be nice and after the conversation think, 'what a freak'. I have a boyfriend, we've been together like a year and a half. Frankly I don't think our relationship is very healthy I am too screwed up in the head, there's something wrong with me. I don't think it's working out because we don't want the same things. I don't think he's taking me seriously, my opinions or my wishes or our relationship. I'm always the one chasing him, it crushes me. You probably think it is very silly to be heartbroken and I should just get 'rid of him' and go on with life, and how can I be happy with someone if I'm not happy with myself yadda yadda. I know. He told his family personal things I had told him (although he was trying to help me because his mom is a doctor). Also I will go abroad for 10 months for my internship and I think he doesn't want to do the long-distance thing but I can't go on alone really. This seems very teenage-girl-in-love but uh I guess I'm one, sorry.






I'm also terrified (and pretty sure) there is something wrong with me. Like i said mental problems run in my family and I sometimes take internet tests because I'm afraid of having anxiety or PTSD or BPD or OCD or bipolar or depression or just about everything that can be wrong with someone's mind. Last summer I was having night terrors, my mom took me to her psychiatrist who determined I was afraid of my father sexually (Freud much?) prescribed me an antipsychotic and repeated everything I said to my mom while declaring, 'there is no patient confidentiality in my office'. Sooo I don't really want to repeat that experience. Oh and he was always depicting my mother as a martyr and guilt-tripped me for not being closer to her and not telling her everything. I also went to a psychologist a few years ago, parents made me go but I can't remember why (I actually have trouble remembering details about sad moments in my life, what's up with that?) - it ended up in me having to take IQ tests and skipping grades and being repeatedly told to be more confident and assertive and I'm so sick of being told to be confident and to believe in myself! I can't just magically become confident and happy with myself!






I don't know what to do, I don't want to be dead but I can't go on like this. I'm sick of being alone. But if I tried to kill myself and it didn't work my parents would make me go back to my home country and I'd be living with them again and I don't want that. Is there anything I can do to feel better?





Sincerely,


some teenage girl

20linv,0,2014-03-16,I'm ready to switch careers - please help me figure out where to move next because I am lost,engrthrowaway2,AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/20linv/im_ready_to_switch_careers_please_help_me_figure/,"Current situation: Graduated with BSME. No internships. Employed for 2 years at an appliance factory as a generic mechanical engineer.

I do minor design/redesign, update drawings (with stuff like ""make wire 6"" instead of 4""), author engineering change notices, write other documentation (work instructions/documentation/etc), talk to vendors to source cheaper versions of existing parts, create unique configurations of our appliances for certain vendors (we don't sell directly to customers), write test plans, nag the testers to complete the testing, and then do a bit of code writing to play with the accounting database to make sure that we have the right amount of everything for each configuration.

Unfortunately I'm not very happy with my job. Our company is a bit of a revolving door - I think like 50% of the engineering department has been replaced (quit or fired) since I started. I end up with half-completed/half-baked/undefined-by-management projects that have been languishing for years in the hands of multiple of engineers and am unable to complete them since I've already got plenty of my own. We're asked to set monthly goals for ourselves, but I'm unable to meet them half the time since circumstances change (ie: project gets put on the back burner, parts don't come in on time for new configuration build) or I'm assigned to do something new.

Worst of all I'm not picking up any marketable skills at work - I feel that as an engineer I'm only picking up skills useful to my employer and nobody else. Who else would care why assembly X is put together in a certain way anyway? I've gotten some experience with solidworks and design, but only at a very minor level - certainly nothing to write home about. I've seen senior design projects that are more complicated and have more engineering thought &amp; design behind them than what I do. I hate the documentation &amp; pedestrian-level design aspect of my job.

Anyway, enough moping -

I really like coding, but don't want to be doing pure coding (ie: front+back end/business logic type things) - I want to put some of my engineering knowledge (or what I have of it) to work too. Figuring out algorithms/dynamic systems and then implementing them in code to drive things would be a fantastic endeavor for me.

Unfortunately: I have very limited work related experience with that stuff. I have some minor personal projects, but again - nothing to write home about. I'm also a bit confused as to what kind of fields I can get into or where I could fit in with my skill set. I know that it's a bit silly to be looking for a dream job with as little experience as I have, but heck I want to be happier.

Any suggestions? What do you all do? What kind of careers/employers can you suggest for me?"
20lo2p,36,2014-03-16,What should I expect in a 4-hour long face to face interview?,fedoraOrange,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/20lo2p/what_should_i_expect_in_a_4hour_long_face_to_face/,"So on a whim I decided to apply for an internship at a  software company that wanted seniors, not really believing that they would contact me since I'm currently a sophomore. About a week later I got contacted for a phone interview with an engineer at the company, which I thought I had botched and failed horribly. Seemingly against all odds, they contacted me again, this time for a face to face interview for an expected time of four hours.

What terrifies me is that I have no idea what to expect. The interviewer went over technical questions with me and some general stuff about my resume. 

What should I expect and what should I do to prepare for this interview? All I've done so far are phone and Skype interviews... 

EDIT:

 So for posterity and in case anyone goes searching like I did for info, I'm going to summarize what went down for me...

I interviewed at a really small company ~20 people and basically the interview consisted of 4 rounds, each with a different engineer at every level of the company up until I actually met and talked with the president of the company. 

Each round really was just a few technical questions to challenge me, mostly just basic concepts (what's a Java interface?) and nothing like ""here's a problem we're having, try to solve it"" problems. Other than that it was just getting to know the engineers and their role in the company. The interviews in total definitely did not take the four hours they were thinking it would take. 

And in the end I was given an offer which I gladly accepted!

Honestly I felt like what really sealed the deal was that I was really personable and really willing to talk about anything, being my projects and my experiences, to me actually weighing on the projects the engineers have been working on. So really, just relax and talk to the people you're interviewing with like as if they're your teammates because if you get the offer, they are going to be your teammates. "

20m1bk,2,2014-03-17,How to deal with flirtatious coworker?,Rexless,AskMen,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/20m1bk/how_to_deal_with_flirtatious_coworker/,"Going to try to make this brief.

I am a 22 year old female, doing a full time, paid, graphic design/illustration internship at a small software company. It is my dream job. There are very few females (other designers, one software engineer and the receptionist).

Up until a couple of weeks ago I have had NO problem. All the guys have been respectful and wonderful - I never have to feel like a woman, just an employee. 

A couple of weeks ago a coworker, to whom I had spoken about 30 seconds previously, bought me a few little gifts (all had reasons but it was still strange). I decided MAYBE he was just being friendly even though a couple of coworkers had 'warned' me about him. Then one day he walked with me while I was running errands and I agreed to grab food with him. I felt like I had no good reason to say no. 

1. He called me 'hot' about 10 times, but we were not on work premises.
2. He actually has seen my boyfriend of 2 years, and asked about him.

Important:

1. He is the top salesperson at the company. 
2. He is 30.
3. My roommate said he is ""hot"" and he looks younger than he is, and makes a shit ton of money. I do not think he is ""creepy"" because he's unattractive, I think he is because he is being inappropriate and saying things he wouldn't to a male coworker.
4. He was one of the first employees and is very close with all of the most top executives and men who will decide if they want to hire me full time.
5. Pretty much all males at the company LOVE him. LOVE. 

I want advice about how to TACTFULLY deal with this and get him to stop without him having any negative feelings towards me whatsoever. Please don't lecture me about standing up for myself and telling him off. Whether you want to admit it or not the world has not made enough progress for it to be that simple. I want this job SO MUCH and I don't want any conflict or negative feelings directed towards me.

...

TL;DR - I am 22/f intern at dream company - high up male coworker with lots of influence generating lots of revenue being flirtatious and inappropriate. Want him to stop without ANY conflict or negativity towards me.

Thank you so much!!

I can however switch positions within the company. I found this position on our job site labeled Network Analyst Intern the only issue is they do not seem to have a clear job description as far as what would be done. I will link it below.

My grades are subpar, I don't really have motivation, and it really feels like I'm wasting my dad's money. He's the one who really needs to go to college to further his own career.

Thing is, even though I do not-so-good in school, I'm actually a pretty competent web developer/programmer. I've learned a lot more teaching myself than trying to go to class, I've got lots of code on GitHub, and I can do pretty well on technical interviews at this point.

And even with just one CS class last year, I was still able to get an internship last summer because of both my ability to do okay on interviews and teaching myself a bunch of web dev stuff.

I'll probably have another internship this summer, if all goes well in interviews and such.

I'm just wondering at this point if it's still even worth it to stay in school. Is it worth it?

And if it's not, and I drop out, how do I break into the tech industry more so I can, you know...not starve?

Any help is appreciated."

Having read up on the Blue Card program (and their 35k Euro minimum for tech-jobs), I've been applying to a bunch of jobs, like 3 dozen in the past 2 weeks.

As optimistic as I can be, I am afraid inside (based on posts here recommending graduate programs, me just picking up the German language and being relatively 'new' to the working world, and as a non-EU outsider) that I won't find a job.

My citizenship is from a 3rd world country (made international news recently =) if that story doesn't 'prove' how third world it is, I don't know what else will) with really poor living standards and expensive cost of living, high crime, corruption etc I wouldn't want to raise a family there or live there any longer, so my long-term plan is to get out forever.

I see a lot of internships being posted by smaller/start-up level companies and was wondering if it was worth applying for these. Sure the pay would just be enough to cover 'warm' (German) rent and I would make a short-term loss paying for other living expenses out of pocket. But this gets my foot in the door and work experience in Germany. Has anyone done this before? What kind of visa would I need for this? If my employer likes me or I find a 'real' full-time job that means the Blue Card requirements, would I be able to 'convert'  (I'm assuming) short-term residence permit into a long-term one that lets me apply for a German PR after a while?"

My name is Jon and I am a Marketing Intern for Athletico Physical Therapy (www.athletico.com - Chicagoland area and Midwest). Any Chicago-area runners may recognize us as the guys who provide post-race stretching and partner with some of Chicago’s largest races, including the BOA Shamrock Shuffle, Race to Wrigley, and Chicago Triathlon. We have an Endurance program internally made up of Physical Therapists and Athletic Trainers that take running very seriously.

Being an active Reddit user myself, I recommended that we get involved with Reddit and figured we could be a great source of help to runners with our PT, stretching, rehabilitation, and endurance expertise. I was very fortunate to have been given the entire project of managing Reddit myself, which was a big step in my career as a young professional!

That said, Runners of Reddit, do you have any suggestions for how we could help you? This could include topics for running-related Blog Posts, AMA's with Athletico Physical Therapists or Athletic Trainers, general interaction, etc. Any suggestions or comments would be greatly appreciated. 

To start: For any of you from Chicago or the suburbs, we have a Runners Symposium event in Naperville this Saturday, March 22 featuring prominent speakers on the topics of Video Gait Analysis, lower extremity issues associated with running, sports nutrition, hydration, caloric balance, and training tips for endurance athletes. Registration is free but required, RSVP here: http://www.athletico.com/events/naperville-runners-symposium/ 

Thanks again Reddit, look forward to helping out soon!

I've been a stay at home mom for about 4 years now, and I still have some time before my youngest starts school.  I know I want to go back to work when that happens, but I don't know what I want to do.  I served in the military for six years as a paralegal, which as GREAT but I don't think I would really enjoy it as a civilian like I did when I was military.   When I was in the military, I received my associates in paralegal studies.  I got out and got my bachelors in criminal justice, then went on to get my masters in forensic psychology, which I'll be finishing in May.  They're both from online schools, which might hurt me a little bit... my forensic psych degree doesn't come with a license, and I have no idea what I need to do to get one?  I have no experience in that field at all, other than the tiny bit of court martial work I did in the military.  I'm kind of regretting online schools, but realistically, as a stay at home mom with a military husband who works strange, long hours, it was the only choice.  Plus, regardless of how they're perceived, I really did learn A LOT from the classes, and I really enjoyed them.  I feel like I'll never get a job as a forensic psychologist specifically, assessing individuals for mental competency and whatnot, but I worry all the time that my degrees are useless, and that even though I really feel I have the knowledge and skills needed to do jobs related to those fields, no one will ever take me seriously. 

I have so much that I'm interested in and I don't know where to start.  I've thought about blogging/writing, tutoring, teaching, politics, charities, even small counseling jobs and internships to help put me on a path to get my license.  Currently I'm most interested in juvenile corrections, specifically substance abuse counseling.  Is it worth it to try to climb that ladder, especially with a husband who plans on being in the military for the next 20 years with moves every 2-4 years, or should I stick with what I know and where I have experience, and just resign to the idea that I'll probably be working in a field that doesn't require my degrees, as a secretary or civilian paralegal or some other GS civilian job with the military for the rest of my life?

I would greatly appreciate your advice!",roadforks,OccupationalTherapy,https://www.reddit.com/r/OccupationalTherapy/comments/20ncuh/extremely_excited_to_work_towards_becoming_an_ot/,"Hey guys! I am seeking some advice regarding making my application to OT school more solid, and would love any feedback or suggestions that you may have!

Some information about myself: I am currently a student at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, soon to graduate (next month) with a Bachelors in Psychology. I am just finishing up physiology class and my overall/prereq GPA will be around a 3.86-3.9.

I have previously volunteered with an organization that meets in school with elementary aged children who are deemed ""at risk"", and had a subsequent internship with the same organization. I currently volunteer at Children's Hospital in the PT/OT outpatient clinic and have logged around 60 or so hours.

After I graduate in April, I will be working at a children's camp located outside of Denver, CO throughout the summer. I missed the application deadline for the upcoming fall 2014 semester and will be applying to school this coming fall (after taking the GRE) with hopes to start a program in 2015. I plan to apply to Colorado State University, University of Washington, and the University of Puget Sound. I have also been looking into Pacific University in Oregon (although it is an OTD program as opposed to a Masters).

Lately I have been doing some intense Google sessions, researching exactly what it takes to get into OT school. I have found that it is incredibly competitive and that the ""profile"" of an accepted student varies widely depending on the school. I'm starting to worry that my experiences are not well-rounded enough to make my application stand out, as it seems that many people hold jobs related to the field (such as working in a nursing home) prior to applying to a program and also logged hundreds of volunteer or observation hours.

My question to you guys is, what kind of experiences should I seek out to make myself stand out among the masses of people applying to these programs? Would spending time in other settings (such as a hand therapy clinic or a rehab facility) be a good addition? How did you go about getting these experiences/observation hours? Should I also apply to more than just these schools?

Thank you so much for taking the time to read! Any insight is incredibly welcome and appreciated!

[So what's the weirdest thing you've encountered when someone opened the door?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20mpiw/i_deliver_pizzas_for_a_living_ama/cg4qrun?context=5)|A few months back I took a delivery to this dude's apartment.

We both laughed, he invited me in to take a bong rip, gave me a pretty good tip, and we went our separate ways.

[Do you really draw the requests that some guys ask?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20mpiw/i_deliver_pizzas_for_a_living_ama/cg4rztz?context=5)|I've only had that happen to me twice. I'm a terrible artist, but I'll have someone else do it. We like doing it though.
 |There was a guy who once ordered online and put in the comment section ""Extra awesome"" or ""Awesome on the side"". So I printed out the word ""awesome"" multiple times on a receipt paper, put each paper in little to-go containers, and put them on the corners of the pizza box.

 |Every. Damn. Time.

 |""Actually, I'm happy someone asked this. I grew up in a relatively affluent area and had a great upbringing. I went to a very prestigious university and had a great internship that would most likely set me up with a job after I graduated. As my senior year went on, I started learning a lot about myself and what I was doing with my life. Though it sounds late, I was starting to form my own opinions on life and really started to adopt a universal and humanistic view on the world. My own personal evolution allowed me to realize that I shouldn't do something that helps the bureaucracy of business, but that I should something that helps other people. So I gave up on the ""dream"" that I had of getting a career and full time job, and have recently decided to open up my own business (One that would give a large portion of the proceeds to those who need help).
 |And believe it or not, I love delivering pizzas for a living. Sure the pay may not be the best, but I love interacting with other people and making them happy (even if it's on the minor scale of giving them pizza).
 |So I don't think that I ever went wrong in life. Success to me isn't measured by income. It's measured by happiness.""

[2 Heve you ever felt that the customer was somehow weird and dangerous, that made you run literally from the place?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20mpiw/i_deliver_pizzas_for_a_living_ama/cg4rsza?context=5)|Nope.
[3 Do you usually oder pizza yourself?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20mpiw/i_deliver_pizzas_for_a_living_ama/cg4rsza?context=5)|Yes I do. That being said, our restaurant has more than just pizzas, so I order those items just as much at a discounted rate.
[Has delivering pizza caused you to not enjoy eating it any more?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20mpiw/i_deliver_pizzas_for_a_living_ama/cg4y4ni?context=5)|My love for pizza (which has always been high) has stayed constant. 
[Since you work for a local restaurant, whats your favorite national chain pizza brand? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20mpiw/i_deliver_pizzas_for_a_living_ama/cg4umjb?context=5)|Good question. I'd probably go with Pizza Hut since it's relatively nostalgic for me and my childhood.
[What's the most challenging order that you've ever had to deliver?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20mpiw/i_deliver_pizzas_for_a_living_ama/cg4sy4e?context=5)|People who order 5 or more milkshakes can be annoying, especially if we're busy at the time. 
[Have you seen people naked while delivering? Maybe not like opening door but hiding in the back thinking you can't see them through the door crack. Also any interesting stories when delivering pizzas to hotels?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20mpiw/i_deliver_pizzas_for_a_living_ama/cg4tq8t?context=5)|No naked people yet. A few people who clearly had just gotten out of the shower and threw a robe on, but no ""accidental"" slips.
[Can I have some pizza?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20mpiw/i_deliver_pizzas_for_a_living_ama/cg4sia1?context=5)|As long as you're within 4 miles of my restaurant, sure.
[What do you earn in tips on a typical evening, and how long is a typical evening?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20mpiw/i_deliver_pizzas_for_a_living_ama/cg4y2n2?context=5)|Depends on the night and how long the shift is. Tip wise I've made anywhere from $10-$200 in a night. One can expect to work about 4-5 hours each night.
[If someone tips shitty or doesn't tip at all do you remember or write the address down?  Take longer to deliver, do something to the pizza or any other type of repercussion?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20mpiw/i_deliver_pizzas_for_a_living_ama/cg4xmk6?context=5)|Nah we don't write anything down. We just remember that they're shitty tippers. Actually, we'll all take one for the team from time to time and take it if we're having a good day tip wise. 
[Have you ever eaten a pizza instead of delivering it, then pretend like nothing has happened?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20mpiw/i_deliver_pizzas_for_a_living_ama/cg4qwbk?context=5)|No. Most likely would be out of a job if that happened.
[If someone orders a pizza but when you arrive you find out it was a prank call and no one wants the pizza do you get to eat it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20mpiw/i_deliver_pizzas_for_a_living_ama/cg4uftu?context=5)|Sure do.
[Are you in a band or are you a dj?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20mpiw/i_deliver_pizzas_for_a_living_ama/cg4rr4a?context=5)|Not currently. I was in a band back in high school. Played the keys, guitar, and sang.
[Did you ever deliver someone a pizza and hime/her become friends or more?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20mpiw/i_deliver_pizzas_for_a_living_ama/cg4ychw?context=5)|Yeah I've made a few friends from it. I've also gotten a couple of numbers.
[Do you carry any knives or type of weapon just in case?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20mpiw/i_deliver_pizzas_for_a_living_ama/cg4wbbh?context=5)|Since I deliver in a low crime area, I have no need to. 
[So, there is one question I want to ask. Have you gotten a porn scenario?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20mpiw/i_deliver_pizzas_for_a_living_ama/cg4zr9p?context=5)|0 porn scenarios.
[What was the most hectic delivery you've ever partaken in?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20mpiw/i_deliver_pizzas_for_a_living_ama/cg4ybrj?context=5)|About a year ago on a Friday night we were absolutely slammed with deliveries. There were 4 of us driving that night, and we had almost 10-15 up at one time. I was taking a quad (4 deliveries on one trip) and got towed at the first place I delivered to. One of the other drivers had to pick me up, but because we were so busy he couldn't make it for about an hour or so. I thankfully had all of the food with me, so we just called and explained the situation to the other customers. They were understanding.
[Was there a small panic when you discovered the car towed? I'd imagine there must have been a sinking feeling. Good thing the customers understood. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20mpiw/i_deliver_pizzas_for_a_living_ama/cg4yu7l?context=5)|Yeah it was awful. Especially because we were so busy and I had three other places I had to get to. Worst part is that I was only parked outside of this apartment complex for 5 minutes. 
[I've gotta say, this is a very interesting AMA. I was wondering, have you made any long-lasting relationships (friendly, no romantically\) with your co-workers over the time you've worked there?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20mpiw/i_deliver_pizzas_for_a_living_ama/cg54rb2?context=5)|Actually, I was able to get this job because my best friend was a bartender at my restaurant and put in a good word. He introduced me to everyone there and I've made some very great friendships with some of my coworkers.
[I've never tipped a pizza delivery guy before, only because I wasn't sure if I was supposed to. The pizza was delivered on time, which is what they're supposed to do.  Do you get offended when a customer doesn't tip? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20mpiw/i_deliver_pizzas_for_a_living_ama/cg52w0w?context=5)|I don't get offended, but it can be annoying if it was an already slow day tip wise. It's gonna happen every once in a while, but know that the majority of our income (probably around 75%) comes from tips. 
[Do you deliver into hotel rooms? Not just at the lobby or anything, but directly into a specific hotel room.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20mpiw/i_deliver_pizzas_for_a_living_ama/cg5qs1w?context=5)|Just depends on the hotel. Some let you go straight up to the room, but some ask you to wait at the front desk while they call them. 
[Is there a place in the city your company does not deliver for fear of being robbed? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20mpiw/i_deliver_pizzas_for_a_living_ama/cg4xjpw?context=5)|The area I deliver in is relatively affluent and with low crime rate. So simply put, no. We go anywhere within a 4 mile radius.
[Why did you do an AMA? Haha, I'm not trying to be mean, I just am really curious if you woke up today like ""F*ck yeah, I'm gonna do a mothafuckin AMA today!""](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20mpiw/i_deliver_pizzas_for_a_living_ama/cg52yvk?context=5)|We just got a bunch of snow and I was off today. Didn't get a chance to really do anything so I was pretty bored. 
[Has someone ever smoked you out when you delivered them a pie?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20mpiw/i_deliver_pizzas_for_a_living_ama/cg4wo05?context=5)|Sure have. But they give a cash tip too. Most people realize that we have to make some money.
[Is there any areas of town that your store will refuse to deliver to based on safety or high chance of robbery?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20mpiw/i_deliver_pizzas_for_a_living_ama/cg4wpgj?context=5)|Nah. The area I deliver in has a low crime rate.
[What was your best/funniest tip you ever gotten?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20mpiw/i_deliver_pizzas_for_a_living_ama/cg5l0y9?context=5)|Best tip: close to $100 Funniest tip: had a guy draw a big middle finger where you were supposed to tip. Handed it to me and looked at me with a straight face. I was kinda confused at first but then he started laughing and got out his wallet. Gave me $10. 
[Would you be offended if a customer slipped money through the door and told you to leave it? I'm super paranoid of answering the door for men. Like, I avoid ordering food for this reason. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20mpiw/i_deliver_pizzas_for_a_living_ama/cg56y8z?context=5)|Not at all. Actually this happens more often than you'd think. Whether it's the customer being uncomfortable, unavailable, or has a disability. 
[Does you cut the hole in the pizza first or do you stick your boner right through it. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20mpiw/i_deliver_pizzas_for_a_living_ama/cg4sz4j?context=5)|Boner normally goes right through.
[Please tell me you're not serious...](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20mpiw/i_deliver_pizzas_for_a_living_ama/cg4uq8z?context=5)|I'm not serious.
[Have you ever spat on or otherwise contaminated a pizza pre-delivery.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20mpiw/i_deliver_pizzas_for_a_living_ama/cg4v1qp?context=5)|Nope. I've worked at a few restaurants now and have never seen that. 
[Have you ever spit on a pizza or done something between those lines. Be honest.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20mpiw/i_deliver_pizzas_for_a_living_ama/cg4w7d6?context=5)|Nope, never.

20nezy,1,2014-03-17,I'm a college student who needs help sorting out my finances,[deleted],personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/20nezy/im_a_college_student_who_needs_help_sorting_out/,"I'm sorry if any of these questions have obvious answers, but I've been researching for a while and at this point would really appreciate specific advice for my current situation.

I am currently a sophomore in college and plan on going to law school. I work a student job 18 hours a week ($8.50/hr). My mom is unemployed and my dad is no longer in my life, so my parents can't offer much help. I'm on a merit scholarship and need-based financial aid which leaves me owing around 10k a year for school (not including books and living expenses). I'm reapplying for financial aid so that number might change for next year, but I'm hoping it doesn't increase. My great-grandfather left stocks for me, which I've used to pay for school with the help of my mom (plus whatever I save from working each semester, which usually ends up being around ~$1700). I've completely exhausted my stocks at this point. The only thing I have left is $400-500 worth of bonds that are still maturing, which is basically an emergency fund. 

Freshman year I got food poisoning and had to go to the ER and ended up with a huge hospital bill. The insurance card I had printed had cut part of my subscriber number or something, so they didn't submit the bill correctly to my insurance company. My mom called twice to try to get it resubmitted, and the first time they submitted it to the insurance company in the wrong state and the second time I don't know what happened. I'm going to call them again to check on this, but I'm worried because it's been over a year and I don't know if my insurance will still cover it. It's also completely TANKED my credit, I'm sure... I've had collectors calling me for almost a year. I (naively) had no idea it would affect my credit or anything at the time, and only figured out how serious it was after I started trying to get everything straightened out.

I guess my main questions are:

* How do I deal with the hospital/insurance company when I call? Is my insurance company obligated to pay or will they probably tell me I'm out of luck? Is there a way to make the hospital accept a much smaller amount of money (I think the bill was around $1500, it would be less than $500 if insurance covered it).
* What the hell do I do about my credit? I tried applying for DiscoverIt but got denied. They offered me a secured card - should I do that instead? How much should I deposit and how do I utilize it best to build my credit? Are there any disadvantages to doing this?  
* Should I do something with my bonds? I have $500 in my checking account plus the ~$400 in bonds; should I use this to pay my debt immediately even though I will barely have anything to pay for school next semester? 

I'm staying at my boyfriend's apartment for a month after school ends to work but his lease ends and I'm going home after that so I won't be working again until August... so I won't be making much money over the summer (I'm doing an unpaid internship when I get home). I'm worried about being able to pay for school next year and I'm extremely concerned that I won't be accepted for loans if I have to take them out for law school. Any advice is much appreciated!

20nl1y,1,2014-03-17,Would it be difficult to get a programming job without a HS diploma?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/20nl1y/would_it_be_difficult_to_get_a_programming_job/,"I'm in high school right now and I really want to drop out, so then I will have a lot more time to learn programming and other CS stuff on my own. I don't have much time to learn though because I get so much homework in school. I love programming so far and I could do it all day. If I drop out, then I would have an extra 8-12 hours a day to teach myself things. That is a lot of time.

I heard that a lot of companies don't really care too much about a degree/diploma, they just care about what you can do and the skills that you have. I was wondering if I build a portfolio online, would that be enough to get a good programming job? Also I heard hackathons are a great place for a job opportunity. I am nowhere near ready for a CS job but I just don't want to drop out if I absolutely need that HS Diploma. I was thinking maybe eventually I could get my GED if I needed to.

I forgot to mention that I have had an internship at State Farm developing web applications. That should look good on a resume."
20nmve,1,2014-03-17,Life of Sr. Software Developer/Software Architect,vikster93,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/20nmve/life_of_sr_software_developersoftware_architect/,"I currently intern at a mid-tier company that is not a tech company at heart; rather, it uses technology (and therefore employs a considerable amount of cs talent) to further its goals. My general impression of some of the older developers and architects is that they essentially had to learn one technology stack when they were younger, and after that they didn't really have to do much learning. It's more just come into work, use existing knowledge to solve company problems, leave, rinse&amp;repeat. The particular stack that seems to common around where I work is Linux+Apache Tomcat+Java+MySQL. This is, in my opinion at least, a pretty powerful and versatile stack, so I don't really see a reason for them to have to learn alternate technologies.

So my question is, am I mistaken in this perception? I consider learning new technologies to be the challenge, but once you get the hang of them, its just fun and easy. Does it end up becoming unchallenging or boring?

20np2c,2,2014-03-17,I 21(m) don't know what to think about my girlfriend 21(f),thatguywiththatonepr,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/20np2c/i_21m_dont_know_what_to_think_about_my_girlfriend/,"I am honestly very confused right now... My girlfriend just left my apartment after telling me that she cheated on me during her internship last summer while she was in another state. 

To give a little background, We have been dating for about a year and a half and on a whole, we are pretty happy with each other and enjoy each other's company. Our sex life has never been particularly good (approximately once a month at best), and she has told me on multiple occasions that she just doesn’t like sex. I never really saw this as a reason to break up with her though since I probably just need to tone down my own overactive sex-drive anyway.

Knowing her for as long as we’ve been together, I would never in a million years have guessed that she would cheat on me - she’s just not the type. We were fighting a lot at the time when we would chat on Skype, so it was a bit of a rough patch for us. I know for a fact that she would not have done it had we been in closer proximity. She told me that if she could go back and change it she would have.

I am really just at a loss for what to do. If I simply forgive and forget, what does that encourage/enable for our future? If I break up with her, then that would make her feel horrible for even admitting to it. I am not sure if I want to give up just yet, as I have been patient with myself, with her, and with our relationship for the entire time we’ve been together. I feel somewhat angry and betrayed, but I can also see her side of the story and understand why she was lashing out… I don’t know what to do.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated."
20npsp,2,2014-03-17,"How does it affect me if I couldn't get an internship at a ""good"" company?",picklebricks,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/20npsp/how_does_it_affect_me_if_i_couldnt_get_an/,"Am a third-year Computer Science student. I'm talking about not even being able to get into a certain *tier* of companies. I don't know how to describe this. I'm talking about modern companies using modern relevant tech stacks, where the engineers are smart and sharp and have a solid history of employment at other such companies. The best way to describe it is: a company that helps you grow your career in any way.

My first internship was at a non-high-tech company. I saw engineers playing around on Amazon, nobody cared or knew what was going on accept the tech lead, and this was about a technology as simple as front-end ASP.NET (pretty much just plain HTML/CSS). Work was slow, it would take an entire day to add a new page template when you could just copy an existing page template.

My second internship was much better, and I was surprised just how smart all my co-workers were. Everybody was on top of their game. It was a true high-tech startup. I thought to myself I wanted to work at companies like this from now on. I only got in through a strong connection to the CEO.

My second internship has filled their slots, and this year I wasn't able to get anything like my second. It's my fault I have such a terrible CS background (not practicing, zoning out of classes). I got interviews at some pretty nice companies, but I would always fail at the 3rd round because my CS fundamentals weren't enough (e.g. answering the 3-partition problem). I got an internship at another ""startup"" (they've been one for 10 years now?), and honestly everything is really nice (great culture, relevant tech stack) except I don't get the feeling this is a company that would help my career grow. It seems a bit *too* relaxed (almost lazy), and it feels like just a code-monkey job without applications of computer science or anything complex.

I'm concerned because I wanted to use this year's internship as a way to sneak in a full-time job, since I have such a low GPA (&lt; 2.8). I'm continuing to apply to more companies.

Do you guys see tech companies the same way (split into tiers of ""good""ness)? If so, is it a problem for me to start out full-time employment (after my 4th year, via my 3rd-year internship's company) at such a company?"

20nre4,2,2014-03-17,Seasonal position at big 4,[deleted],Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/20nre4/seasonal_position_at_big_4/,"Some background information: I'll be graduating in May of this year with 150 credits in accounting. 

I currently just accepted a seasonal position at a big 4 firm for the summer. The interviewer made it very clear that this was just a seasonal position. (not an internship!) The room for advancement is possible, but its a small chance. 

My questions are:
Did the interviewer tell me it was a small chance just to make sure I'm properly motivated as oppose to knowing this job is going nowhere?
How many people started off at temporary position at big 4?
What are the ways you established yourself so you can rise above that?
What approach did you take in speaking with your department heads on future employments?

It makes me nervous accepting this position because it's not permanent. I know big 4 experience will look good on a resume, but I'm a little hesitant because I interviewed for a couple of other government jobs and they have positive outlook. Any advice or experiences you have and can share would help a lot.

[Can you hook me up with a Jeter/Mariano autograph?  Kidding aside, how has being in the memorabilia business changed the way you watch sports? Do you watch games now and see something amazing happen, and think ""wow I'd love to get that bat"" rather than ""what an amazing play""? Has it taken any joy out of sports for you, or added to it?  Thanks for doing this Mr. Steiner!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20mxfb/iama_brandon_steiner_ceo_of_steiner_sports_author/cg4v3s3?context=5)|It's changed the way I watch sports every way. I'll never watch a game as a normal everyday fan again. I miss that. Sometimes I like watching a good high school game or a not-well-known college game to get that feeling back.. Anytime I'm watching a big-time athletic event means dollars. There's not any aspect of the game-people playing, watching, sponsoring, etc.- that I don't have a stake in. 
[Are there any secret/hidden rooms or old closets in Yankee stadium in which you could find old baseball equipment or paraphernalia from the days of old?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20mxfb/iama_brandon_steiner_ceo_of_steiner_sports_author/cg4t4wx?context=5)|Actually there were a bunch of things hiding in old rooms and different areas of the Stadium. Mr. Steinbrenner was a bit of a pack-rat and we were the beneficiaries of that...old jerseys, old bats, everything.
 |There's a good story about this in my most recent book, You Gotta Have Balls. It’s about the original bricks to the ORIGINAL Yankee Stadium (pre-1976). I knew that there was a possibility that we could find these bricks and I wanted them badly, but we had only found things from after the renovation. Couldn’t find them anywhere, though. A few days before the demolition started I walked through the old batting cages under the seats, in the Columbus Room of the Stadium—that was an informal name because “If you don’t get your swings in, they’re gonna send you back down to Columbus (home of the Yankees triple-A team at the time).” Sure, enough, the old Philip Goldbrick &amp; Sons bricks were in that room. We found 5,000 in all. 
[One of the last times I went to a Yanks game, I remember seeing cases full of preserved dirt and grass from the old stadium for sale. At first I laughed and asked myself who in their right mind would pay for a piece of dirt, and then ended up buying one. Who can say no to an actual piece of Yankees history??? Anyway, my question is, any idea how many of these pieces of dirt/grass were sold? Was it the entire stadium worth?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20mxfb/iama_brandon_steiner_ceo_of_steiner_sports_author/cg4u19t?context=5)|I’ve sold more grass than anyone reading this…legally! We’ve taken grass from a whole bunch of fields…Wrigley, Notre Dame, Yankee Stadium, etc, about $1 million worth of freeze-dried grass and we're expanding this from baseball stadiums into more football stadiums, even with turf.
 |As for dirt, my goal is by 2020 to have sold over $100 million of dirt. We are at about $50 million worth. That is sales, not profits-yes, there’s high margins in dirt…but to authenticate it properly and to sell it the right way, there are costs. We now sell dirt from all 30 MLB parks.

To highlight a few, from Hockey I'd have to go with Mark Messier. Messier was the first athlete that we signed for the collectibles end of our company. He was a winner on and off the ice. Football is definitely Eli Manning. He's the most cooperative and amazing guy. A lot of athletes you havegreat relationships with and then when they win a championship they change, but he never changed. He has so much respectfor our partnership and always wants to help us grow.  Baseball would be Derek Jeter. What makes things so great with Jeter, not just the partnership we've had with him, but the ways I've been able to participate with the Turn 2 Foundation. I love being able to work with an athlete on that level, not just with signing autographs. The common denominator is that they all come from amazing families.

He was in charge of the custodial staff at CCNY, a very hard-working guy. He told me, ""Brandon, I know you're struggling in school, but you gotta make a decision. Do you want to work from the neck  up or the neck down?"" People that work from the neck up tend to do well in school 2) I was struggling to get a job out of college. My mom had a friend who was a car salesman and he said to me, ""What's wrong with you? You can't sit there and wait for the right opportunity, you gotta make the right opportunity. You're that type of guy"" Very few people are like that. but

I would say 100% yes! I thought it was the crown jewel of our business. The most famous stadium with the most moments. At Steiner Sports we thrive and live on those moments. Taking apart that stadium was definitely a lot more complicated than I anticipated and was a much bigger undertaking than I had envisioned. I get into it in my book, You Gotta Have Balls, but to really answer your question: I didn’t want that stadium to be taken down without as many fans as possible getting something. My thought was to break it into hundreds of thousands of pieces, so that any fan could get something. I will say with conviction that goal was accomplished. Out of all the projects I've done, that was one of my most fun because of the partnership with the team and the interaction with so many players in helping them hold on to their memories with the lockers, signs, seats, etc. and of course, bringing it to the fans.

I love the Delta Club, I love the Legends Suite, the 100 level seats are great. I love the Audi Club, and once in a while I sit in the suites.

In Miami it's all the Latin food. In Milwaukee I have a brat. It all varies! 
[Hi Brandon, I own several game worn hockey jerseys from your company! I wanted to ask you two questions actually.  Do you ever worry about the sports memorabilia market being  saturated and how do you avoid that as an entrepreneur?  How do you authenticate your game worn sports memorabilia and how do I know when a particular item was worn or how do you track it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20mxfb/iama_brandon_steiner_ceo_of_steiner_sports_author/cg51ooe?context=5)|Never worried about that. On its best day, I don't think we're going to meet the needs and demands of the memorabilia market when you look through all sports. The demand is just so much greater than the supply. What takes me aback is the amount of people that claim that their product is a collectible...like when food companies call something thats fat free when it isn't...there's too many companies in this business like that and that concerns me.
[Also,what do you see as the future for your company?  Having constant sales on products you were just selling for much more a month ago devalues the product. Are you looking to sell products where customers get a true value out of the product, as opposed to feeling they spent too much 5-10 years later?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20mxfb/iama_brandon_steiner_ceo_of_steiner_sports_author/cg51he6?context=5)|I totally disagree with that statement. I think I can name you tons of products that people have bought that are all worth so much more money than they were then. If you're counting on product to go up in value, though and not looking to buy for the sheer enjoyment of the product, then my company probably isn't best for you. No where in any of my promotions have I said, ""Buy Steiner because you can get rich 10 years from now.""

I have two set 5 Rangers jerseys from last year that I just don't know when they were worn. I have talked to my Steiner sales rep and he didn't really know either. I know that last year there were at least 5 home and away regular season sets, 2 Heritage sets, and at least 2 home and away playoff sets. That makes for 16 jerseys per player in a 48 game + playoffs season.

My dad took me to a twi-night doubleheader where Mickey Mantle hit home runs from both sides of the plate. Also, everytime I went to bat day as a kid was a favorite. One of the biggest memories would be about my first autograph. I was 11 years old and a few of the older kids I was hanging out with invited me to a game. My mom gave me $5 and said to bring her back the change. The kids I was with got tickets right by the on-deck circle. It was $4. Between that, a hot dog, a scorecard and the subway, I spent all the money I had. Of course, when I was there I forgot about what my mother was going to say to me after. Joe Pepitone was signing autographs a few feet away from me. Tom Tresh came by, as well. I was beaming. When I got home my my said, ""You spent $4 on a baseball ticket?!"" She ran out of the house and screamed at the boys I went to the game with. I was petrified and of course, she got her money back.
[I understand you are running a business, but how do you feel about possibly keeping true fans from getting souvenirs? It's great there are so many things available on your site, but there's no way I can justify spending $220 on a base from a game I went to 3 years ago. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20mxfb/iama_brandon_steiner_ceo_of_steiner_sports_author/cg52k8x?context=5)|I first went into a Mercedes dealership and I asked for a discount and the salesman pointed me to another dealership is across the street.

I also really like to know what someone did when they were younger. What were their interests and what did they do in their spare time.

I am interested in finding steady employment or at least an unpaid internship so I have some sort of concrete experience and reference.  I have no experience other than working for myself and no references other than family.  I don't care what work I get if I can just get something.

First, my background. I am a first year CS student at a college with a top 10 CS program in the nation. I went to a hackathon, did some stuff on my own, nothing really impressive.

I had an interview with a big (non-CS) company a couple of months ago, and, I thought, it went ok. Today, I got an email from them, saying that the hiring manager wants to have a 30 min phone talk with me about the 2 positions (business analyst and developer; I absolutely don't want the first one) and my background. 

Since it is a hiring manager, I would assume he is not a CS person, so there should be no technical questions, right? What should I be ready for? If it is a hiring manager, does it mean that I pretty much got the internship?

Also, the deadline for the summer semester is coming very close, so, if I don't get an offer by the end of the call, should I tell him that I can't wait another few months for their decision? I was planning to do summer semester because of no offers, but this might make me reconsider this, but I don't want to get in position of not getting the internship and not being able to take classes."

All the entry level positions I see are internships, which I would LOVE to get, BUT they all say ""must be currently in school"", or ""students only"", or that they're just a summer program or 2-month program.

I don't know enough to get a regular-position programming job, but I already graduated and can't get into these student-only jobs.

I studied abroad instead of doing an internship.  How much comparative disadvantage over other candidates? 

2) GMAT scores?
I did not do too well on GMAT.  I just did well enough to get into Masters of Accountancy program at my university.  How much does GMAT or even SAT or ACT scores matter in consulting industry?

3) Accounting background?
I am studying accounting, but I want to work in business consulting (not tax or audit).  I know big4 are hiring accounting majors, but how about the other firms?  Is Accounting a good major to get an offer from consulting firms?

4) Computer and IT.
How much computer and IT knowledge is required?  I am not very expert in computer languages (knows basics of SQL and HTML).  Is other computer languages important to know? Excel VBA?  How about software such as SAP or Oracle?

20obws,3,2014-03-17,Double majoring in applied math and political science but not interested in either of them,[deleted],careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/20obws/double_majoring_in_applied_math_and_political/,"I am graduating college in one year and double majoring in applied mathematics &amp; statistics and political science.

I entered college as a political science major and starting taking the math sequence in my sophomore year because I wanted to change majors to computer science (because of the job prospects). I was good at programming and usually the first person done with labs but I was not at all passionate or interested in it. I liked my math classes much more, so I became an applied mathematics &amp; statistics major. I only needed a few more political science courses to double major and the department came out with a bunch of new classes, so I decided to add it back as a second major.

It could just be my depression talking, but I'm not at all passionate about either field. I started off with the intention of getting into data analysis and maybe working for campaigns or non-profits as a data analyst. My school only has one data analysis course, which I will be taking this summer. There are only two statistics courses, which I haven't taken because the teacher is awful and requires us to learn all the material on our own through group projects. I was just going to teach myself over the summer, then over winter break, now it's back to the next summer.

I'm pretty lost. I have an average 3.5 GPA, no strong recommendations, no internships (applying for an awesome online internship this summer). My math skills are slightly above average, but nothing great (unlike some of my peers who are math geniuses). I spend most of my time studying and taking care of my disabled grandmother who I live with. I have taken care of her since I graduated high school, which has made it impossible to get jobs and internships.

I don't know what I am passionate about. I like American political history. I'm taking a class on GIS now and that has been interesting and I enjoy it. I can program on a basic level even though I don't really like it/fit in in that industry. I will be learning data analysis, R and SPSS this summer and maybe taking another GIS course. 

Does anybody have any advice? Can you think of any jobs that might suit me? I would really appreciate it. Thank you."

20of54,1,2014-03-17,Why do I hate my job in audit.,Jeepologist,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/20of54/why_do_i_hate_my_job_in_audit/,"Ill try to keep it short but I really want to hear what everyone thinks. 

No its not busy season I hated it before it started but oh does it make it a whole lot worse.

I started 6 months ago in the audit dept at the firm I did my tax internship at. I requested audit since thats what I thought I would enjoy more.

The first is the largest in my immediate area but I am in a long end of a commute to NYC. We have about 100 accountants and are a McGladrey alliance firm. 

Since Ive started, I've hated waking up everyday and hated just about every minutes of being at the office. Im not sure which aspect of it is making me hate it so much.

Here's what I've narrowed it down to. The people, the office environment/public, auditing, or possibly even accounting in general. 

Office-everyone is crazy and I don't fit in at all. I hate to say it but everyone is a ""typical accountant"". We have the most ridiculous rules and from chats with friends at other places, its so much nicer and relaxed elsewhere.

People- Mostly my department. They suck. To give you an idea, from the time I got hired in June and started in October we had two people leave both who would've trained me and worked with me. Then two months after I start the other newest person left after being there for a year. We also have had a huge turnover in the past few years. I was yelled at because I'm not as far along on the learning curve as I should be at 6 months but my partner even said ""I know we have had some turn over lately and havent had the time to train you properly"". I hate going on jobs and sitting in a small room with them for 9 to 10 silent hours. I wish I had a job at any client we have been to. 

Auditing- The people I work with might have turned me off to accounting completely. 


I really don't know where to go from here. Ive started looking for a new job but I don't know if its really for me at all because of the place I started out at.

If your still reading, thank you. I haven't really had any help from anyone else about this.

I feel it's better if you understand my background.

I've been programming off and on, here and there, finally getting serious in the past 3-4 years. I've written some neat software around 12-14 years ago when I was a kid, but I stopped writing for a while.

I have had pretty much zero work history, other than sporadic self-employment (not enough people in this small town to afford my services) and the previous IT job which I quit. I quit the previous job because they were paying me minimum wage to do entry-level work (small town, only job I could find) and I decided to go back to school, get my GED, and then go to college.

Now that I'm in college, and I find the coursework extremely easy, I feel like I have the skills to find work somewhere, just not here. There are quite literally zero IT jobs in my town, and very few in this state. I don't want to live here anymore, anyway. I've finished the vast majority of my IT courses already, only about 3 or 4 courses remain.

I need help understanding what employers want the most. I need help understanding, beyond my personal portfolio, what I can do to make employers want me. I have marketable skills, but I think I might be missing something here.

Now, it doesn't help that I'm pretty much deaf and can't use the phone in any capacity. Employers call my house and a family member answers for me. They don't like that I can't hear, and they usually hang up the phone, even when we explain it's because I can't hear. I can still speak perfectly, and I even speak two languages (I'm pretty good at reading lips, too) despite my shitty hearing, but... it doesn't seem to matter. 

A lot of potential employers email me asking for a phone number, but when I explain that I can't hear and need to use email, they completely and totally stop responding to me. 

The last staffing agency I visited started giving me hearing tests for a web development position, and kept telling me that my disability would probably prevent me from obtaining employment with their clients. ""They're probably going to say no, but we can try it anyway."" 

Some employers tell me that the distance (when applying to jobs out of state) is the main reason I haven't been considered, but I've repeatedly offered to fly myself out for interviews, and pay for my own relocation. I've been sure to mention this on my cover letters and applications as well, but they still aren't satisfied.

I seriously feel like giving up. I know I have good skills, but nobody seems to want to give me a shot. What the hell am I doing wrong? What can I do to improve my chances of getting a job? I'm sick of welfare and being dependent on SSI/etc. I want to work. I want to work really hard and prove myself to SOMEONE, ANYONE.

Please help!

**EDIT I should add: since I'm still in college, I am looking for an internship. They're difficult to find here in my home town, and even the state, so I'm actually wondering if I could find an internship out of state since I'm looking to get out... It would be awesome to find some kind of paid internship where I could afford to survive off of.  I do have three stellar letters of recommendations, including one from my professor.**"

**Update 18 March 2014**
I've been asked if I've been doing anything on my own to try and help myself, so here's a few things that I'm working on:

* I've come across an organization called The Mission Continues, which is for post 9/11 Veterans [Link Here](http://www.themissioncontinues.org)
* I'm currently teaching myself a little bit of coding. Specifically, I've taught myself HTML and signed up at [Codecademy](www.codecademy.com) to begin learning CSS
* I'm looking for part-time networking/systems administration jobs

A couple of notes first:

1. A lot of this is going to be pasted from gofundme and a link will be at the bottom of this numbered list, (I read the rules and couldn't tell if it's against the rules but please let me know).
2. I have copies of my bills, proof of service, identification and photos ready upon anyone's request. I'm not sure what the right way is of doing this, but I can provide as much information as you need
3. If anyone knows of a better way to get assistance, please let me know.
4. Summary: Long story short, I'm asking for advice on how to make money on the side (my ""story"" - for lack of a better term - will hopefully indicate exactly what kind of work I can be capable of) and yes, as embarrassed as I am, I'm asking for a little funding - $700.00, to be exact. 

[Link to my Go Fund Me page](gofundme.com/7m1txg)

Now, I'll leave my situation here, and I'm deeply grateful for any assistance that can be provided.

 *Please know that any information you need in order to verifiy that I'm not some scam artist as well as proof of bills or photos of my kitchen are immediately available upon request*

I guess the basics should be knocked out first. My name is Josh, and I'm 26 years old living in Charlottesville, VA. I served in the Army from September 2006 -  September 2010, 12 months of which were in Iraq (Taji for 7 months, then Al Taqaduum, then Ramadi, then finally home). Upon leaving the military I immediately started pursuing a degree in Computer and Information Sciences with a concentration in Network Security. 

During my time at school, I held an internship at Norfolk Southern Corporation, then worked for a government contracting company called Secure Mission Solutions which ended due to that ""Sequester"" in the Federal Government. I then had an internship doing Systems Administration at Delta Career Education Corporation, where I worked with Windows Server 2008 R2. When I graduated school, Secure Mission Solutions called me and asked to come back to work as a Junior Network Engineer, which I did for six months until once again, the company had to make cuts -  I was one of eight people that were let go.

This convinced me to move out of the Virginia Beach area because I wanted something to offer job security. This brought me to Charlottesville, VA to work for Frontline Test Equipment. Long story short, this is a great friendly company for which I test bluetooth communications on devices like cell phones, tablets, etc.

Now, I guess I should state my problem. Between leaving Virginia Beach and living in Charlottesville, I had lost my job and emptied my bank account just keeping my bills up to speed - I hadn't been out of college that long. The GI Bill had helped but only to pay rent and have groceries for the month as well as food for my dog, which was enough for my preference. I had only Internet in my home - no cable TV, but over the air programming was fine by me too; I'm more of an Internet nerd anyway.

Anyway, 3 days after being laid off, I was rear ended by another car which totalled my explorer, which was paid off. This forced me to put 1200 out of my remaining 1500 dollars down on a Ford Focus (I have limited established credit due to me not ever - EVER - getting a credit card due to fear of debt and this helped to get approved for a car loan). I had to ask my father for help for the first time since I've been old enough to have a job just so I could have money to pack my things and move to Charlottesville.

Once I moved there, I didn't have enough money to pay my cell phone bill, which resulted in the account being closed. Add the bill to the late fees and early termination fees or whatever Verizon charges, I owe about 600 dollars to them (I can provide documentation reflecting this if necessary).

In addition, every pay check I've gotten every month since November has been used to get out of debt - or as much as possible anyway. I was lucky enough to convince Capital One to delay my first payment an additional 30 days after I first moved here. But I still had to pay rent on my apartment in Virginia Beach for the remaing two months of my lease (it was cheaper than paying the early termination price in addition to the two months rent to terminate the lease), which was around 860 dollars per month. Rent in Charlottesville is 725 per month, plus an additional 20 for my dog. 

Now, fast forward to today. Other than owing Verizon, I am completely up-to-date on my bills. As a result, however, with just a little over two weeks until pay day, I am out of money for food and gas. I have a little bit of chicken left over, and my dog is almost out of food. 

I am one hundred percent dedicated to be able to provide for myself and I'm a firm believer in it as well - it makes you a better person, and makes you appreciate the things you've done and built for yourself.

But I don't see what else I can do. I can apply for a loan, but one: I don't want to be in debt and two: I probably wouldn't be approved anyway because of this Verizon delinquency and my limited credit history.

I know there's a potential for nobody believing this because the Internet is full of scam artists, but I'm just annoyed with my stomach growling, and my dog looking at me with a sad face because I'm having to feed him a little less to try and save up until the beginning of the month. 

I'm doing everything I'm supposed to do - paying my bills on time, getting caught up on any debts I have, etc. - and I really am so close to being ""out of the woods"" that I'm actually anxious for it to be over with. But I guess I'm just asking for temporary help and hoping for the best. I can provide you with any documentation or proof of identification you'd like, just let me know what you need and how to get it to you.

[Why is so much corporate money involved in politics? Shouldn't it be up to the people, not the people with the most money?  Which decisions made it like this and how can we reverse them? When did american government stop being for the people? How many lobbyists are in Washington right now?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20o396/iama_senior_democratic_campaign_staffer_formerly/cg58qx1?context=5)|1) We DO need to get corporate money out of politics. The Supreme Court contributed to making it like this when they equated money to speech, essentially saying that if one denies a corporation the right to spend unlimited money to elect a candidate, you've denied their 1st Amendment rights. Which I think is just wrong. I support public financing of elections. No private donations or self-funding, everyone is on an equal platform, and may the best ideas win.  2) This may not be popular, but I believe it strongly. It STILL IS up to the people, and the people abrogate their responsibility by choosing to be ill-informed. Corporate money buys TV ads, it buys mail pieces, it buys radio ads. It does not buy votes.  If a corporation spends $100 million on a blatantly false TV ad, and everyone went to Google and did a quick search, and found ""Oh hey, that's total bullshit!"", then that money would have no power. The people are the ones who give power to corporate money by failing in their responsibility to be informed citizens.
[*The people are the ones who give power to corporate money by failing in their responsibility to be informed citizens.*](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20o396/iama_senior_democratic_campaign_staffer_formerly/cg5mfn7?context=5)|Yep. Can we tackle that without tackling campaign finance, though? I think if you first tackle campaign finance, and take away the ability of corporate/dark money to drown out other voices, you then make it easier to focus on education and substance. It really does make me sad, though. The influence of money in politics would be precisely dick if people did 5 minutes of online research before they voted.
[How did you get into your field? If you went to school, what did you go for?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20o396/iama_senior_democratic_campaign_staffer_formerly/cg54mv3?context=5)|The answer may be surprising. I was a recent grad, I saw a job posting for literally the most entry-level job ever, I applied, I got hired. I didn't know anyone.
 |There's no experience or education required to get into it. You just have to be willing to work 100+ hours a week for shit money, and love every minute of it. Which usually means you have to be young, but not always.
 |I went to school for political science, and learned nothing relevant to American political campaigns (though I got a great education and am grateful for it). If you or others reading are students looking to get a leg up on getting into campaigns: Major in mathematics. For real. 
[I'm a college freshman studying business with a focus in marketing. Do you think I could use the skills I learn in this field?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20o396/iama_senior_democratic_campaign_staffer_formerly/cg556h5?context=5)|Yes.
 |Really, all you need to get started is a willingness to work hard and talk to total strangers who don't want to talk to you for 12 hours a day. You can learn the rest as you go. 
[Why major in mathematics? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20o396/iama_senior_democratic_campaign_staffer_formerly/cg56bai?context=5)|Predictive modeling. People with the data analysis skills to generate support/turnout models are at an incredible premium right now. It's by far the easiest and most lucrative ""in"" to campaigns.
 |People are slowly realizing that the old-school, horserace-focused consultants who ""go with their gut"" are completely full of shit. The analogies to ""Moneyball"" are easy to see. It's about to be a whole new world.
[We are learning about political parties, and I was wondering, do you believe 2016 will be a critical election?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20o396/iama_senior_democratic_campaign_staffer_formerly/cg55rxn?context=5)|1) Yes. Any time you elect a President, it's critical.
[With the all different ideologies  between Congress and House of Rep., do you find that we may never reach a compromise on anything anytime soon?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20o396/iama_senior_democratic_campaign_staffer_formerly/cg55rxn?context=5)|2) No. And it's not about ideology, either. People in Washington only care about beating the Republicans or beating the Democrats. Nobody wants to get shit done. I don't see it changing. And that's too bad.
[Also, how does the administration deal with negativity from people, and especially from the media?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20o396/iama_senior_democratic_campaign_staffer_formerly/cg55rxn?context=5)|3) I can't speak for the administration, I don't work for them. On the campaign, it depends on what type of negativity. If it's unproductive, such as ""I hate Obama, he hates America,"" we ignore it. If it's productive policy criticism, such as ""I think Obamacare is wrong because X, Y, Z,"" then we respond and tell them why we think we're right. 
[What do senior staffers, people like yourself, do in between campaigns? Most of the people I've met were field staff, and didn't work in politics between elections. They worked retail, etc.  How did you get your senior jobs on these campaigns? Was it a call a friend who called a friend, and boom you have an offer kind of deal?  I am considering getting a PhD in Political Science, with a concentration in methodology and political statistical analysis. How do you think this would benefit me, and following earning the PhD, how would I go about getting a job crunching the polling numbers for campaigns?  If I were to work, for instance, as a data director for a campaign, how easy do you believe the switch to, for instance, the political team, or the communications  or strategy teams would be?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20o396/iama_senior_democratic_campaign_staffer_formerly/cg572yu?context=5)|We're often no different! I've worked in retail between campaigns. I have enough money saved that I COULD do nothing for a few months, but I prefer to be active. And I worked in retail forever in HS and college, so it's easy to find work. A lot of people do nothing for a few months, though. That shit is draining! You need a vacation sometimes.  I've worked for the same bosses a number of times. When they hire for a position, they know I do good work and they call me. As they get progressively higher in the ranks, so do I. You just have to a) do good work, and b) maintain good relationships. Probably no different than any other job, really.
 |3/4. This is not at all a bad career plan. Here's my suggestion: offer your services for free or for little money to small/local campaigns. ALL of the advanced data analysis stuff that Obama did can be done on any campaign by someone w/PhD level knowledge. Best part: nobody's out there doing it. Everyone's focused on the big, easy money in Senate races/statewide races. Local campaigns are the frontier for data analysis, dude. And it's an untapped market. Get in on that.

[Oddest experience with a candidate or member of the public?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20o396/iama_senior_democratic_campaign_staffer_formerly/cg55kmc?context=5)|2) Public financing. 100%. Give each candidate the same amount, and may the best ideas win.
[In theory you could ban candidates from using their own money, but the Supreme Court has ruled that spending your own money for your campaign is a form of speech and therefore can't be restricted. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20o396/iama_senior_democratic_campaign_staffer_formerly/cg56uh6?context=5)| 
[I'm left as they come but I view it as a freedom of speech issue. There's no good way to decide what is and is not political speech in an election season. The saving grace is that at a certain point you start to hit diminishing returns, so that 1$ in October gives less result than 1$ in march. Do you see that at all?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20o396/iama_senior_democratic_campaign_staffer_formerly/cg5kgw9?context=5)|You're not wrong about freedom of speech. It's a complicated issue, and I did oversimplify it a bit. It's possible, though, to have your cake and eat it too. For example, one could make contributions to political campaigns tax deductible up to a certain dollar amount--it's public financing (as that money comes out of the treasury), but citizens use their 1st Amendment rights to decide where the money goes.
 |And keep in mind we're talking about direct contributions to candidates here. The Supreme Court has found numerous times that government has a compelling interest to restrict and regulate direct contributions to prevent government corruption. Independent expenditures are completely separate from this discussion, and that largely satisfies the 1st Amendment issue as well.
 |You are incorrect about diminishing returns--at least in terms of timing. A voter contact in October is exponentially more effective than a voter contact in March, and there's a good bit of academic research to back that up. You ARE correct that you eventually reach a point of oversaturation, where additional contacts are less effective. If campaigns reach that point in October, it's because they spent their money inefficiently. Which I'll grant you, many do.
 |Also keep in mind that the discussion contributions and expenditures in re: political speech is very different. See Buckley v. Valeo.
[*Public financing. 100%. Give each candidate the same amount, and may the best ideas win.*](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20o396/iama_senior_democratic_campaign_staffer_formerly/cg5m8e8?context=5)|I THINK I know what you mean. Please correct me if I don't. I think what you mean is that if you outlaw all private donations, they'll just find another way to spend money--but since donations are now outlawed, they'll spend it totally anonymously, resulting in the same amount of money in politics, but way less transparency. If that's what you mean, it is a real concern.  Keep in mind ""public financing"" doesn't always mean candidates just get money for nothing without having to work, and doesn't always exclude donations. I posted elsewhere that some well-run systems have given tax credits to citizens who contribute up to a certain amount to candidates/parties. So the contributions themselves are publicly funded,  but private citizens choose where they go and everything is still reported as it is now. 
[It would destroy the jobs that exist in the sector of private financing.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20o396/iama_senior_democratic_campaign_staffer_formerly/cg5m8e8?context=5)|Worth it. Sorry to be blunt, all my finance director friends. Look, their skills are very valuable and translate well to private industry. They'll be fine.

[What do you think the ideal time to hit the saturation point is?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20o396/iama_senior_democratic_campaign_staffer_formerly/cg5njwj?context=5)|Election Day! The value of a contact on Election Day far outweighs the value of a contact on any day prior.
 |Answer differs depending on widespread availability/ease of early voting, too. Depends where you're running.
 |(Oh, and I should note I'm primarily talking about turnout/GOTV here. The value of persuasion contacts is incredibly difficult to study in a controlled experiment--because you can independently verify that a person voted, but it's quite difficult to independently verify WHO they voted for to prove/disprove your hypothesis.)

[In general, what's the pay scale looking like for senior staffers in all the fields (Communications, political, digital, grassroots, legal, finance\)? Some basic numbers, please.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20o396/iama_senior_democratic_campaign_staffer_formerly/cg58awq?context=5)|Most department directors will make about the same amount of money, and on a major statewide race, you're probably looking at around $5k - $7k per month. The field (grassroots) director (on campaigns I've worked on, again, YMMV) will sometimes make a bit more and have the title of Deputy Campaign Manager. Why? Because when you're a field director, you're managing 100+ direct/indirect full-time reports. Your job is management, and that's a valuable skill. On other campaigns, the finance director will make a bit more than the others. But yeah, generally all department heads make around the same.
[How do the consultants who start their own firms get consulting jobs, instead of being in-house staff?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20o396/iama_senior_democratic_campaign_staffer_formerly/cg58awq?context=5)|Starting your own firm is tough. Best way is to go to candidates you've worked for in the past. Getting work as a consultant from cold-calling campaigns is close to impossible if you're not an established name.  Remember--you're asking for a job from someone who got his/her start in campaigns by knocking on doors of strangers asking them to vote for a candidate. If you just walk right in and ask for a job, they'll respect your courage and they'll remember you. (You'll probably get rejected more often than not, of course--it's a tough job market. But you'll stand out from the crowd.) 
[For getting campaign jobs... would you recommend just like writing a generic cover letter and resume and sending it to the campaign totally unsolicited, without any sort of 'job posting?' What would you recommend?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20o396/iama_senior_democratic_campaign_staffer_formerly/cg58awq?context=5)|TOTALLY depends on the campaign. For the sake of discussion, let's assume we're talking about a major statewide or congressional campaign, with the understanding that YMMV.  Yes! I would recommend doing that (but not exclusively). Hell, just go to the office with your resume and ask to talk to someone. One of my best hires ever was a person who just walked in off the street, resume in hand, asking if we were hiring. We were, I had some free time, I interviewed them, hired them on the spot.
[What was your worst or best experience?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20o396/iama_senior_democratic_campaign_staffer_formerly/cg54mib?context=5)|Best experience was transitioning from the Hillary campaign to the Obama campaign. I was scared I wouldn't be accepted, or that it would be awkward, or that things would be clique-y.
 |A lot of us came over from Hillaryland after she dropped out, and we were welcomed as family from day one. People can say whatever they want about the candidate, the staff were top-notch talents and human beings.
[Wow that sounds really great!  How different were the two campaigns for you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20o396/iama_senior_democratic_campaign_staffer_formerly/cg54y2o?context=5)|Not that different, honestly.
 |Here's a thing I wish the media understood better: The Obama campaign didn't do anything revolutionary. None of the stuff the media slobbered over (predictive modeling/data analysis, neighborhood team-based organizing, et cetera) was new.
 |The Obama campaign was a typical 21st-century American campaign. It was differentiated by the fact that it was really, really, really fucking well-run. They just did the usual stuff so much better than everyone else that everyone thought it was new!
[What was the most intense moment on the campaign trail?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20o396/iama_senior_democratic_campaign_staffer_formerly/cg54q0i?context=5)|Tough to pick.
 |Not a single ""moment,"" but there was a week during the '08 primary where I had to do something like 30+ rallies w/President Clinton. It was...stressful.
 |Most intense single moment was (though not on the campaign trail), when President Obama arrived at the inaugural ball I was at in January '09 (there's not just one official ball, there are a ton--which I never knew before then!).
 |When they announced, ""the President of the United States of America,"" it was just...a surreal moment. After working so hard for the past year+, it was kind of the ""everything coming to fruition"" moment, you know?

 |I have very little experience on the official side, I've mostly stuck to campaigns, so I'm not the best person to help you navigate the Hill.

[As a senior staffer, what is a day in the life of the campaign political director, strategy officer, and the data director? How does these roles differ from similar roles, but for party organizations?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20o396/iama_senior_democratic_campaign_staffer_formerly/cg57qtn?context=5)|Most campaigns don't have a political director. Because they don't do much valuable work. Campaigns that do have them--the political director spends time managing relationships with elected officials, getting endorsements, that sort of thing. Thing is, though, that sort of shit just doesn't move votes. It's mostly a waste of time.
 |Strategy officer isn't really a thing? Closest thing would be ""General Consultant,"" who's kind of like the Grand Poobah of the consultants. Usually, this is not a full-time employee, but someone with decades of experience who just oversees, signs off on major decisions, and provides input when needed.
 |Data Director...Excel. Excel all day long. If you don't know what vlookup and pivot tables are, you'll find out real quick.
[What was the best campaign you were a part of and why?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20o396/iama_senior_democratic_campaign_staffer_formerly/cg54oi9?context=5)|The Hillary campaign. For reasons having nothing to do with the merits of one candidate over another.
 |Working on a presidential primary campaign, you're constantly moving from one place to another. One state has its primary, you're on to the next. So on and so forth. And you get to spend a ton of time around the candidate (and, in this case, her husband) at various events.
 |Incredible experience, for sure, despite the fact that we got beat.
[What's your primary expertise?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20o396/iama_senior_democratic_campaign_staffer_formerly/cg5cd81?context=5)|1) Field. You couldn't have guessed from where I said ""fuck advance?"" Haha. I dabble in comms/general consulting a bit.
[Are you on the consultancy side now? Did you join an existing shop or open your own?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20o396/iama_senior_democratic_campaign_staffer_formerly/cg5cd81?context=5)|2) Yes, kind of. The latter. It's a little complicated, and don't want to go too far toward revealing what I'm doing. You know how it is.
[What's your take on large single-issue voters on our side? I'm thinking of Tom Steyer most recently.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20o396/iama_senior_democratic_campaign_staffer_formerly/cg5cd81?context=5)|3) Ugh, man. I have no association with the DSCC and so it doesn't affect my professional life, but it irks me when they target vulnerable Dems (e.g. Mary Landrieu). Like, you really think replacing her with a Republican is going to help your cause? I just think they're often short-sighted.
[A lot of the cool modeling stuff that's being done requires large sample sizes, which is difficult to get on the local level. For campaigns that are smaller than their TV market, do you think there's a need to focus on data?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20o396/iama_senior_democratic_campaign_staffer_formerly/cg5cd81?context=5)|4) Generally true, yeah. Though one can do rougher support/turnout models with smaller sample sizes. However, no, I don't think there's AS much need to focus on data. Modeling is all about increasing efficiency. The cost of creating a model + contacting your highly targeted voters has to equal less than the cost of just contacting all the voters, or you haven't really gained much. And I think in smaller races, that's less likely to be the case.
[Are there knowledge bases available to vetted staff on best practices for this sort of thing? Like I said, I've been out of the game for a bit but I'm considering coming back. I'd just like something both more flexible and more in-depth than a training. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20o396/iama_senior_democratic_campaign_staffer_formerly/cg5cz5v?context=5)|I went back to a candidate I worked for full-time, who was running for office again. He had all-new staff this time around, and he wanted someone on call who he trusted. I think that's the best way to go, hit up old bosses who are running again.  I find a lot of stuff by following poli sci professors on Twitter. Hahaha. You'd be surprised how useful that is! The best knowledge base I know of is Analyst Institute--which I had access to at one time, but now 2012 is over, so...damn. That's something I'd like to create, perhaps. It's a good point that there's not a good central location for all that stuff. Like the info's all out there, but you have to search all over for it.
[How many people on a campaign staff, and how are responsibilities divvied up?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20o396/iama_senior_democratic_campaign_staffer_formerly/cg55akn?context=5)|1) Often way too much. I've seen campaigns where the campaign manager essentially runs the official (government) side office, as well as the campaign. During election season, government staff usually have to run press releases/policy proposals by the campaign manager for approval. I think that's wrong.  Additionally, I've seen a ton of candidates fight to take a stand on something because they believe it's right, only to be talked out of it by their staff because it'll hurt the campaign.
[10 years from now, what will be the 'rising' field in politics? I would say right now, it's the digital and social media teams. What is going to be hot?  Compare and contrast working for a national/state party organization and a political campaign.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20o396/iama_senior_democratic_campaign_staffer_formerly/cg5a9fv?context=5)|Most campaigns actually do digital/social media wrong, and render it useless. It's only useful if online engagement translates to offline action. The only reason for social media to exist is to get people to volunteer, donate, or vote for your candidate. Too many campaigns say, yayyy we got 1,000 Facebook fans...and then don't do shit with them.  1) This is rising right now, but it will rise further: Local elections. For two reasons. First is that actual government mostly happens on the local level. If you live in Omaha, NE, who the Mayor of Omaha is and who's on the council matters a whole lot more to your day-to-day life than who the President is. And as more advanced campaign tactics start to filter down to local elections, they'll become more ""professionalized."" The second reason is that local elections are candidate-makers for Congressional elections. The right has been very methodically getting people elected to state legislatures, city councils, et cetera for years, to groom them to run for Congress. The left needs to get their shit together and do so as well. For this reason, you'll soon see a lot more super PAC/outside money flowing into small-town races. Not making any value judgments on that being good/bad. Just a prediction.  2) This is sorta the other side of the coin, but I just want to throw it out there that TV advertising will be dead in ten years. There's a lot of academic research showing it's a bad investment, and people just don't consume TV in the same way. Because of that, I think the ""hot new thing"" will be something nobody's ever heard of. I'll let you know if I invent it. ;)
 |National/state party organizations almost never have their shit together. They're often staffed by the ""B team"" who couldn't handle the hours/stress of working full-time on a campaign. (Coordinated campaigns run through the state party = the exception). This is not always true, of course. I've worked with some amazing state party organizations.
[What is the state of international political consulting?  What do you plan on doing in the future if you don't work on national campaigns?  Who manages the campaigns... after the elections. Such as the Romney campaign, they still have reports they are filing, and people on payroll. They are still collecting donations, making disbursements, etc. Who manages these campaigns, and how much do you estimate they are being paid?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20o396/iama_senior_democratic_campaign_staffer_formerly/cg59zag?context=5)|1) There are some American firms doing fascinating work on this front. A lot of international candidates and parties REALLY want to work with Obama campaign vets, and some firms have smartly set themselves up as conduits. They hire people on, contract with candidates/parties in other countries, and send them out! It's extremely lucrative. I've never done it, but I have friends who have. I'd like to some day--sounds fun! If what you meant is what is the state of homegrown political consulting in other countries...I do not know.
 |2) I...have no idea. Haha. Which is why I'm still in campaigns. It's REALLY hard to get out. Here's why: most people don't understand what I do. People will see my resume, and see that I've hired/managed a staff of over 100 and managed a multi-million dollar budget, and literally ask, ""So, a campaign? So you like, put up signs? Did you get paid?"" It's quite frustrating, and I wish I knew how to better translate it into private sector-speak. I like management--I think I've learned a lot about how to manage staff in high-stress environments. So I'd like to stick with that, in some form or another.
 |4) This is a great question. Larger campaigns (like Romney/Obama) have large operations staff who manage budgets, process payroll, take care of compliance/insurance/all that stuff. Usually one of those people (often the COO) stays on for a while after the election to manage that stuff.  Not sure how much they're being paid, but I can tell you that every dime spent by every campaign in America is public record, as is who it goes to. So it should be pretty easy to look up.
[Yes, my intent for the question was exactly how you answered it. I know that many consultants take in some income from international clients. Do they want anyone from the Romney campaign really? How do they get these jobs, and what parts of the world are they in? Thanks!  Perhaps you could work for a think tank (even though you have done/not done policy work for the campaigns\), the government as some sort of appointee, work public affairs for a company, become a lobbyist, or join some sort of public affairs/political affairs firm?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20o396/iama_senior_democratic_campaign_staffer_formerly/cg5ajfu?context=5)|Haha, I don't think they want many people from the Romney campaign. All partisan differences aside, it was a poorly run campaign. I'm willing to give respect to opponents who run strong campaigns, but that wasn't one. Most of my friends who've done those jobs, they're in developing democracies--SE Asia, Eastern Europe, in particular. I think that the ""nicer"" places (Germany, UK, Japan, to name a few) are easily highly-developed enough to have their own professional consultant class.  On geography, there's a really interesting divide there. Some people set up shop in a single state and try to work exclusively for candidates there (often because it's their home!). I have been a little bit of everywhere, haha. I prefer it that way. It's a beautiful country, and I've gotten to see all of it.
[Do a lot of people working on campaign can make more money working elsewhere? I guess the real question is, how much of a financial sacrifice do people take on for the campaign? (or maybe perhaps it's a full career\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20o396/iama_senior_democratic_campaign_staffer_formerly/cg55bro?context=5)|Depends. If you stick with it, you can make a good living. In the mid-to-senior level staff range, you usually make a solid middle-class income. It's not a sacrifice, but I could definitely make more and work less doing something else.
 |When I was first starting out, I made no money at all. Less than retail. But once you pay your dues at the entry level, it's not bad.
 |Nobody's getting rich, though. Except the ""big name"" consultants. David Axelrod, those kinda guys.

I have no ""insider info"" that she's running or not running (that stuff is all INCREDIBLY close to the vest right now). But...I think we all know she is, yeah?
 |I want to say no. I loved the experience in '08, and I'll vote for her if she runs. But a presidential campaign is just such an incredibly exhausting experience, and I'm not as young as I used to be.
 |But...I don't know if I'll be able to say no. It was one of the defining experiences of my life the first time. It would be incredibly hard to say no to doing it again.
[Do people in your profession have an 'office' with a desk, stapler, office door, etc? Like, where do you work, sorta?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20o396/iama_senior_democratic_campaign_staffer_formerly/cg5b1a4?context=5)|1) Depends on the stage of the campaign! Campaigns go from 1 dude/girl sitting alone in Starbucks to 30+ offices in a state and over 100 paid staff in the space of 3 or 4 months. You always get a desk and a stapler eventually, though! But sometimes you gotta scrounge it yourself on Craigslist Free. Haha. Campaigns are frugal.
[What's the family life like?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20o396/iama_senior_democratic_campaign_staffer_formerly/cg5b1a4?context=5)|2) For most people it's non-existent. You work 7 days a week, minimum 12 hours a day. ""Relationships,"" such as they are, are generally with co-workers. It's not a super healthy ""family life."" That's why most people don't do it very long. I certainly won't do it forever.

[Another question- how does one ask for pay raises and/or promotions while working on a political campaign? I am transitioning into some paid political jobs, but am relatively unclear as to how to go about doing this with the raises and promotions. I'm aware of the bonuses involved for winning primaries, etc., but are these all the bonus/raise opportunities?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20o396/iama_senior_democratic_campaign_staffer_formerly/cg57e2u?context=5)|Yeah, that can be a tough one! Pay raises and promotions aren't that common on campaigns. Since it's a short-term job to begin with, you don't run into that many scenarios where your boss is leaving and you have an opportunity to interview for his/her job, you know?
 |One thing I can guarantee you: Almost no campaign manager will give you a raise if you don't ask. Go to them and ask. And come prepared with data to back up why you deserve it.
 |But, most people don't get raises/promotions during a campaign. It happens, but it isn't too common. Good news is that once you do a cycle at one level of a campaign, you generally move up a notch or two in your next campaign--people who stick with it tend to climb the ladder fast, since most people just do a campaign or two and then quit.
[How do you adjust to the constant moving across the country practically every year? What are you living circumstances; do you lease an apartment, stay extended stay at hotels, etc., assuming some campaigns don't last all the long, it's not really viable to lease something.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20o396/iama_senior_democratic_campaign_staffer_formerly/cg5pv94?context=5)|Depends on seniority/how much you're getting paid. Most entry-level folks live in what we call ""supporter housing:"" Volunteers donate spare bedrooms to the campaign, and you just crash there for a few months. It can be...awkward. I've lived w/some weird people. I have an apartment now. I've done the extended stay thing before, too. Usually it's easy enough to find a place that'll do a short-term lease though! I've got a good month-to-month place now. 
[How do you find campaign jobs, that are lets say, across the country, if you don't have any connections? Most of the time, there aren't any job boards for political jobs. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20o396/iama_senior_democratic_campaign_staffer_formerly/cg5pv94?context=5)|Two ways. First is that there are job boards for political jobs--quite a few, actually. Every position I've ever hired for, I've sent out job postings and reviewed resumes from strangers. Second way, though, is connections. Most people who run campaigns at all levels are transients like myself. So, if some guy is running a campaign in California, he's probably not from there, and I probably worked with him on a campaign in Ohio a couple years ago. That sort of thing. 
[When working for campaigns, do they offer any sort of sign on bonus or relocation for when you just get the job? Or are the only bonueses if the candidate wins primary, general, etc?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20o396/iama_senior_democratic_campaign_staffer_formerly/cg5pv94?context=5)|They'll offer whatever you can negotiate! It's just like any other job in that respect. If they want you bad enough, you can get it. Sometimes they just can't afford it, and you don't get it. At the very least I usually get gas expenses covered.

20owzh,1,2014-03-17,"Me [22F] with my boyfriend [23 M] 2yrs, my boyfriend says he is close to breaking up with me if i don't get a job soon",viedoll13,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/20owzh/me_22f_with_my_boyfriend_23_m_2yrs_my_boyfriend/,"first of all sorry for the wall of words but there 
are alot of factors to consider with this problem.i just need to get it out of my brain. 

we have been together for 2 years now in a long 
distance relationship, after 11 months of being 
together we decided to move in with each other, i 
tried to find a job in his town (basingstoke) and 
was willing to move away from my family and friends 
to be with him. 


after visiting many times i found that his mother 
didn't really like me (along with not really feeling 
comfortable being around his drug using friends) and 
started to re-evaluate the situation. 


Bearing in mind that i had to take care of my 
elderly parents who are in their mid 60's and being 
totally scared that i would get taken advantage of 
(again) going out on a limb travelling to a new city 
to live with him, i chickened out and was totally 
honest about why i didn't want to move to his town. 


so it seemed that if we were going to live together 
it would have to be in my city (milton keynes). so 
for now we would have to continue as we were, 
travelling back and fourth (mainly him coming to see 
me as his mother is hostile towards me for not 
having a job and again im not comfortable with all 
of his friends and all three siblings being involved 
with drugs)


fast forward to when i was able to get a job after 
attending a job center course - he made no attempt 
to move in or express any real concern for moving 
forward to be able to be with each other properly, 
understandably he was scared leaving his whole life 
behind to live with me.


 so i tried to get him excited about it and shared 
ideas for furniture and we communicated very well 
about it. up until this point we had been staying in 
my mothers bungalow that she was renovating (no bed- 
we had to sleep on sofas pushed together and 
mattresses on the floor with no carpet or gas for 
the cooker) and i made it livable by setting up 
forts essentially and camping out while the house 
was being transformed around us. this really got us 
excited about what we would have in our own living 
space. we didn't have much but we were really happy. 
he did at some point get all excited over furniture 
with another girl while i was sat there like... that 
was meant to be the exciting feeling we had.


he convinced me i was being crazy on that one (there 
was a whole thing of this work colleague not knowing 
her boundaries and him crossing his...- as in no. no 
im not ok with her drawing on you. that's my godamn 
job. no im not cool with you picking out apartment 
color schemes with her ur supposed to do that with 
me!- oh whats that she just broke up with her long 
time fiance, called off the wedding that was in 2 
months and is now chilling with u round her house 
alot. NO DUDE&gt; IM NOT COOL WITH THAT)


anyway--back tracking- unfortunately i lost my job 
due to absence as i was going through cancer 
treatment at the time and was on sick pay for a few 
months (my employers were very nice about it but as 
i had to call up every week to report how i was 
doing i was let go due to being so ill that i missed 
a week). i was employed for about a year (august 
2012-may 2013) 


since then i have had one temp job gained through 
another course i was put through with the job center 
and was picked for a better position with my agency. 
unfortunately i was let go- it was a 3 month 
contract with no possibility of employment after. i 
had three interviews with the national trust during 
the time (for a dream job starting as an intern) 
they fired me for attending the interviews (which 
the job center confirmed i should go to) and claimed 
a work incentive from the government for my 
employment anyway. this was in october 2013. i got 
spat out the system.


about a week ago i gained two city and guild 
qualifications since with another course i recently 
attended. i had an interview gauranteed at the end 
of my course and was short listed for a second 
interview. there were 5 people on the list and my 
course leaders told me outright that i was the main 
contender for the position. at the second interviews 
they told us that there were no positions available 
at the moment for any of us. i got spat out again as 
the company was a casino and was required by law to 
look at job center applicants to say that they tried 
to help the community to be able to trade with the 
public.


my boyfriend thinks that im not trying hard enough 
and makes no attempt to talk to me about what i am 
doing while he is in basingstoke. he said he would 
help but that was a year ago. since then he has 
still made no attempt to transfer to milton keynes 
and has now said that he doesn't want to move and 
live in an impoverished way while im out of work. we 
were sop happy before when we didn't even have a 
bed.


its not like im not trying. but he has no clue what 
i do do to find work or how far i have to stretch 
the little money i have to make things work for us 
and everytime i talk to him about it he turns into 
Mr passive aggressive and is only concerned with the 
outcome. it makes me feel like such a failure and so 
unsure of myself and just down right depressed. he 
says that im not trying hard enough and that 
everyone in the world has done it so why cant i.


 everyone i know is in the same boat except they 
have a degree under there belt. he says that he 
would have found a job by now and he did so when he 
knew he needed money to see me. (he got drunk the 
night before his interview and i wrote him a script 
to pass his assessment, putting him through drills 
of the script and if he got it wrong we would start 
again) then when he got the job i had to motivate 
him to get a little old car to cut the cost of 
travelling to see me. it seems ive had to do 
everything to get him where he is. and yet i cant do 
it for myself as im not able. i cant drive. 


there are many kinds of discrimination out there and 
it seems like i have everything against me and now 
him saying hes going to break up with me. im female, im ethnic and i have a mobile disability 
(patella recurrent dislocation- my knees seem to be 
eroding from the inside out, which affects my hips 
and lower back too). i did well in school but was 
unable to attend university as i needed to be a 
carer for both parents during that time. 


every time i bring up my disability he says that im 
lazy (i admit i am lazy sometimes when it comes to 
dishes but i sheerly don't have the stamina nor 
energy to even walk for very long and am unable to 
lift things, sitting typing this hurts!) 


the last time i went to the job center i 
accidentally wandered into where they assess 
disabilities without even knowing it as i wen to the 
wrong department. the lady sat me down and asked me 
the first 3 questions they asked which is do you 
have any special requirements. when they couldn't 
find out if i had an appointment and it was 
discovered i was in the wrong place. the lady told me that actually i should be there as 
everyone had completely overlooked that i had a 
disability that will unfortunately only get worse 
and either give me a knee replacement or put me in a 
wheelchair. so as icing on the cake for almost two 
years I've been trying to find work in the wrong 
conditions without the right support that i needed.


he is lovely (at least i think he is- i don't know 
im in love with him which makes me totally blind and 
coincidentally vulnerable to getting effed over in 
this relationship) and we do want to start a life 
together. we both love each other. but we both feel 
like we are the only ones trying to do anything for 
""us"" 



his behavior is putting me down and diminishing 
whatever self esteem i have left
he also expects to turn up from basingstoke and for 
me to clean and cook every day because 'i dont work 
like he does' when i don't have the energy and 
cannot even walk as far as a normal person. i try to 
explain that i have the same aches and pains as my 
63yr old mum but to no avail. he says that im 
perfectly happy for him to pay for everything. im 
not. not once have i asked him to pay for anything. 
as i rather do without. i remember when we had 
nothing only just barely a roof over our heads just 
to be able to see each other. i was happy with that. 
we both had a great time and both agree it was 
awesome. 


it seems that he only sees what he brings to the 
relationship. and throws it in my face every time we 
discuss whats bothering either of us which 
undoubtedly always boils down to this topic and im met with 'get a job'.  


one more thing! he does actually do things for me 
and then says aren't i a great boyfriend. am i crazy 
or is that not valid really? its like asking for a 
compliment- its not really a compliment if you've 
asked for it... because of this need he has to be 
nice he so desperately needs to be the good guy 
which leaves me asking Reddit for advice as im just 
persecuted and seen as making excuses- if i try to 
explain myself in any way it aparantly an excuse. i 
cant talk to him and this post has become more 
erratic the more and more i type.


 im still bitter about some of the problems we have 
had. but its becoming more clear to me that he is 
inconsiderate and doesn't know the difference 
between what you do for someone and how you are with 
someone- i.e. sorry i said that u like to make me 
feel bad by crying (he makes me cry and then feels 
bad for making me cry then blames me for feeling 
bad...which makes me cry from frustration.)  but its 
ok heres some ice cream-- see i did something nice 
aren't i a great boyfriend. as opposed to ah love im 
sorry i said that, i didn't mean it and ill make an 
effort not to say that kind of thing to hurt you 
feelings again (hug*)


we are at our whits end. can we get through this? 
and does anyone have any advice. am i being stupid? 
is he being a douche? i have no clue on any of these 
as hes made me feel as if im being too crazy to ask 
anyone i know. i don't want to end this relationship 
but can no longer see if i may need to or not.

20ox0x,1,2014-03-17,Me [21 F] with my boyfriend [21 M] of 2 years - struggling to move past issues with dishonesty and trust,xyggz1,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/20ox0x/me_21_f_with_my_boyfriend_21_m_of_2_years/,"I've been dating my boyfriend for over 2 years, with a 3 month break up at about the 1.5 year mark. See previous posts for the long version of why we broke up but in short: he got an internship that had him leave for a semester and it happened at the same time that my dad abandoned my family. Probably would have taken the boyfriend leaving thing a lot better, but I didn't. We decided not try long distance. But after 3 months, feelings were still there, so we did long distance until he got back home in January. 

When he got back home, he struggled to get used to being back home again. He's in engineering and the internship involved traveling across Canada in a train 24 hours a day, 5 days a week with weekends in hotels and staring at a computer screen all day long. It was a bit of a struggle for him to get used to living with his parents again and losing the freedom he got every weekend when the rail company paid him to rent a car and have a hotel room. 

He also didn't drink at all during the internship and when he came home I had a party about 2 weeks after he got back. Everything between us had been absolutely honeymoon mode amazing until that night when he got very drunk and screamed some hurtful things to me. It was really terrible timing, because the very next day he left to go on a trip for two weeks to Vietnam with a mutual friend of ours. I'm broke which is why I didn't go too.

Anyways, he leaves to go to Vietnam with things between us rocky at best. I was pretty alarmed by how aggressive and angry he got while drunk and worried the mean things he said were his true feelings. He's all broken up about it and basically starves himself while in Vietnam because he's so jet lagged and culture shocked and supposedly upset about hurting me. He loses 15 lbs in two weeks and then gets all depressed because he had worked really hard to gain that muscle. 

While he's in Vietnam he lies to me repeatedly about smoking weed while there. Normally I really try not to care about his weed smoking but my understanding is that the laws there are rather severe. Since he was with a mutual friend, I found out from the friend, who thought already I knew that my boyfriend was smoking weed again and a lot.

From there continued strings of lies on the premise that quote stuff between us was so shaky that he just didn't have the confidence to be truthful with me? 

Then as if it could get worse, I find out my little sister has a (thankfully not too serious and treatable) cancer. The day our family meets to talk about it, the boyfriend gets falling down drunk in Vietnam and calls me ten times begging me to talk to him. I wasn't ignoring him on purpose it was just a serious family discussion. I finally start answering some texts and it seems obvious to me he is black out drunk because he isn't remembering things I texted him earlier that day, and it's almost comedic when I tell him to talk to me when he's sober and he writes ""I  m soer enough t talk"". He almost never gets so drunk that his texts become incomprehensible. 

When he gets home, he gives me a super expensive swarovski ring and promises he will never pull the shit he pulled again.

When I want to talk about it, literally the same day he returns home and the first time we are face to face, he says I'm being unreasonable and that I should just forgive him already. 

It's been three months and I have really struggled to forgive him. Things weren't terrible at first, but now it seems that everytime we discuss any issues or what happened while he was in Vietnam, he is still extremely defensive and gives me excuses for why he hurt me. I don't know if I'm completely mixed up here, but my belief is that there is no excuse for lying or dishonesty - and it hurts when he continuously jumps to defend his actions, as though he is reasoning to himself that what he did wasn't wrong.

So of course deep down I don't trust him anymore. Even though his behavior since coming home has been absolutely phenomenal, I struggle with being intimate with him. I don't know if the issue is with me, but I just feel it's a matter of time before he pulls something like this again.

I feel like it's time to walk away, but I just can't. I want there to be a way to get my trust back in him. But I'm just struggling so hard with it. I tell him it would help if stopped trying to justify past actions where he has hurt me, but even then he resists. I feel like this is the only way to make things better. 

Ugh. I need advice.

Need advice on how to regain my trust in him, if it's even possible.**"

Since starting college, I've gained a considerable amount of weight, lost all the progress I've made from lifting during high school, and I feel weak, possibly due to stress, lack of sleep, and poor nutrition. People I've haven't seen me since high school have been unable to recognize me. Also, I want to be more physically attractive and improve my sex life. 

I am currently 5 feet and 9 inches tall. I am about 175 pounds. I am borderline overweight according to calculations I did to figure out my BMI. My main goal is to lose ten pounds of fat. Adding some muscle would be great as well. 

The problem is that I am having trouble sticking with a plan to lose weight. I've actually already lost ten pounds just by cutting fast food and junk food. However, I can't seem to lower my weight anymore. I've tried Insanity and eating healthy, but classes, work, research, and internships do not give me much free time. I've tried Insanity, and the daily commitment is not doable for me. 

I want to get back to lifting weights, and I plan to do it 3 times a week (Tuesdays, Thursdays, Saturdays). I need help putting together a workout plan. I had one in high school and I think I did it right. But, I need some advice from more experienced Redditors to make sure I do it right with certainty this time around.

First, do I need to take a protein supplement? I don't eat healthy most of the time. I eat a quick breakfast, eat at the cafeteria at lunch, and by something at the deli for dinner nearby school. I can definitely cut down my calorie intake but I am not sure if taking a protein supplement is good. I used Whey Protein previously.

Here is my workout plan: I plan to alternate between these routines every workout.

Day 1:
1) 15 minutes of jogging or jump roping
2) 3x8 Bench Press
3) 3x8 Incline Bench Press
4) 2x10 Butterfly Press
5) 3x8 Shrugs
6) 2x10 Skull Crushers

Day 2: 
1) 15 minutes of jogging or jump roping
2) 3x5 Squats
3) 3x5 Dead Lift
4) 3x8 Military Press
5) 3x8 Dumbbell Press
6) 20 Pullups
7) 2x10 Bicep Curls

20p258,1,2014-03-18,I don't think I'm happy at my current university,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/20p258/i_dont_think_im_happy_at_my_current_university/,"I currently go to a UC in Southern California.

Maybe it's just because it's finals week, or I've been sick and bedridden all week, or I've been hearing stories from my friends that go to Berkley or Harvey Mudd or Caltech, or I've had a few shitty professors this quarter, but:

I'm just not happy with my current university. The student moral is low as far as I can tell (students here have a reputation for complaining about it on social media outlets), and it has a stigma as being socially dead (this should be a giveaway as to where I go). 

In highschool, my parents would always tell me how I'd be going to MIT or Caltech, or some other big name private university known for its computer science. And I ate it up, too. I internalized that feeling of going to a school that said, ""This guy really knows his stuff, and he's talented at what he does"". And I can see why they'd tell me these things. I've been programming since I was pretty young, and I've kept doing that up until now. And I've gotten pretty decent at it too, for someone my age.

But, I didn't put nearly enough effort as I should have into my college applications, and so I ended up having to ""settle"" for where I'm going right now. Which sounds worse that it actually is; the university ranks well in CS and CE (although still behind Berkley and any of the privates I've listed here).

And so, here I am, post-two-finals, lamenting that I'm going to this university, instead of having applied myself better in highschool, and putting more effort into my college applications. I'm sitting here mulling over the idea of transferring to a different UC, or applying as a transfer to HM or Stanford, both of which I'm aware of are very difficult to do (Why is it so common to transfer from a CC to a UC/private, but not from a UC to a different UC/private?). I'm regretting the lost opportunities to work with the resources available at those schools, even though I can't name any specifically (although HM likes to brag about the companies that oft recruit directly from their graduating classes, and the many, many internship opportunities as an undergrad there). 

Then again, maybe it's not because I didn't put enough effort into applications. Maybe it was because I just really wasn't good enough to go to those schools. And here I was, thinking that I was such hot shit. 

And it's dawning on me that the only reason I'd be doing that is because I'm just not happy where I'm going. It's related to the name of the school, probably more than I'd like to admit to myself. I'm thinking to myself, ""wow, what kind of asshole am I? What right do I have to be disappointed or ashamed given that I go to a UC in the first place, of all levels of education, when so many others are stuck at CC or just didn't pursue higher education at all?""

I get along with my roommates, so I've got that going for me. And I'm doing fine in the classes that I'm taking (at least the ones related to the major I'm trying to get into, Computer Engineering, which is impacted). I've also got two companies that want me to do an internship with them (but that's posing some difficulties for me; that's a different /r/offmychest post entirely). 

But there's that pit in my stomach that I just didn't do enough work in the past to be happy now. And that wouldn't be too bad, if it wasn't for the fact that changing that situation now is basically impossible, given how hard it is to transfer inter-UC or to one of the privates that I'm looking at. 

Well, at least I got that off my chest.

Some dumbass/selfish student. "

But it definitely will not be like Crimea, there will be shooting, guerrila warfare and thousands of casualties. So I'm quite sure that this will not happen, because if Putin does try it - it will seriously undermine his support in Russia. Russia now is trying to push their agenda of Ukrainian federalization, basically to give very wide autonomy to every region, to try to take over several regions without shooting eventually. My best guess is that this will fail.  2) They feel this is a military intervention and not a legit vote. I don't mind a normal separation referendum like they are planning in Scotland. It should come after a lot of debate on how to divide both assets and liabilities etc. In Crimea armed men took over Crimean parliament, declared that it voted for a referendum and that it will happen in a few weeks, took all the assets and none of the liabilities and everyone who was against it was too scared to speak and boycotted the referendum. The polls I've seen before showed between 40 and 50% crimeans want to join Russia, and much more in Sevastopol.
[Are Russia's actions a complete surprise to the Ukranian people? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20pf21/iama_portfolio_manager_in_a_ukrainian_investment/cg5hx2h?context=5)|Yes, it was a complete surprise and everyone was shocked.  
[What is something the media misinterprets or publishes wrong and everyone seems to believe?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20pf21/iama_portfolio_manager_in_a_ukrainian_investment/cg5i39c?context=5)|The worst lie is that Ukrainian radicals with guns took power in the country. Very large part of the population supported and took part in the protests. The whole Kiev investment community was there, most of local businessmen, artists, etc.  I've met many classmates from school and University I haven't seen for years. My programming teacher was beat up and arrested, a colleague of my dad was shot and killed. The actual role of far right radicals and their support in society is not higher that any other european country, it's hust a huge success of russian propaganda to display it otherwise. Just so you know: Svoboda far right party has very little support and is quite lickely to not pass 5% barrier in the next parliamental elections. Right sector - probably the same. They posed a lot for the cameras, but there just not much of them and not much support. Out of the 100 dead there's 1 from the right sector.
[What ""lies"" do we read in the News?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20pf21/iama_portfolio_manager_in_a_ukrainian_investment/cg5i39c?context=5)|Also, the parliament is the same, it appointed new cabinet of ministers with a consitutional majority and scheduled a presidential election on may 25th.
[Also: Should or could we take the referendum serious?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20pf21/iama_portfolio_manager_in_a_ukrainian_investment/cg5i39c?context=5)|Another great lie is that russian speakers are somehow opressed in Ukraine. They are more oppressed in Russia IMO and I'm a russian speaker.
[Do you believe that taking Crimea was always on Putin's 'to-do' list or was Russia just taking advantage of the turmoil created by the overthrow of the government?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20pf21/iama_portfolio_manager_in_a_ukrainian_investment/cg5iupr?context=5)|It was always on the list. He deliberately helped a very weak leader stay in power while russian agents have been infiltrating Ukrainian secret services, army, police and local goverments for years. Protests on Maidan were certainly not planned, so after protestors won it was a now or never moment for Putin. And he acted. 
[So, in your opinion, is Crimea lost? And should the west just stay out of it at this point, or is there something that can be done?  Edit: thank you for doing this, btw... its refreshing hearing the perspective of someone with firsthand knowledge.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20pf21/iama_portfolio_manager_in_a_ukrainian_investment/cg5kqo6?context=5)|For now - yes, it is lost.
[Do you think there's anything that the west should be doing to help Ukraine?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20pf21/iama_portfolio_manager_in_a_ukrainian_investment/cg5lqg2?context=5)|Economic support is very important and it is on the way. I understand that western leaders don't want to hurt their own economies with heavy economic sanctions on Russia and I don't really blame them, but the sentiment here is that the west always does too little too late.
 |A much bigger story than most realize is the arrest of mr Firtash in Austria. He's worth about 4 billion dollars, a business partner of Putin and his friends and a very powerful pro russian agent. He knows a lot about shady russian gas deals and is super valuable for USA. 
[Has the rest of ukraine given up on retaining/regaining Crimea?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20pf21/iama_portfolio_manager_in_a_ukrainian_investment/cg5ieyo?context=5)|1) Some (me) have, but overall not.  2) Not sure.
[Do you worry that if Russia succeeds in annexing Crimea it will grow even bolder?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20pf21/iama_portfolio_manager_in_a_ukrainian_investment/cg5ieyo?context=5)|3) This is a great question. There are several reasons.
[Is it purely the naval base?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20pf21/iama_portfolio_manager_in_a_ukrainian_investment/cg5ieyo?context=5)|First, there's a widespread belief in Russia that Crimea was just given to Ukraine, that this was unfair and it should be Russian again. So biggest motivation for Putin is to please his voters. What they forget is the economic and other reasons for the ""gift"" and the fact that about the same amount of ukrainian land was exchanged and given to Russia at that time (no, they are not planning to give it back). Another issue is that a lot of local population were deported and a lot of russians were encouraged to come there, so this high percentage of russian population is not something that happened naturally. But I won't claim to be a history expert, what done is done.
 |Another reason is because he can and no one can do anything about it.
[How much money have you lost / gained directly related to the issues happening there?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20pf21/iama_portfolio_manager_in_a_ukrainian_investment/cg5ih2z?context=5)|It was a roller coaster. Overall we made good money on Ukrainian eurobonds but it added some grey hair. 
[Wall Street guy here (I'm a sell-side analyst\). I'd like to ask more about how financial services operates in the Ukraine.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20pf21/iama_portfolio_manager_in_a_ukrainian_investment/cg5ju1x?context=5)|I was considering that a year ago. Now I see a posibility of a huge 30 year bull market here, the kind of that makes fortunes, so I'm definitely staying.
[Do you guys have hedge funds and is the 2/20 fee structure common?  Did you see capital flight from Ukraine and/or Crimea before the conflict that might suggest some people knew this was coming?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20pf21/iama_portfolio_manager_in_a_ukrainian_investment/cg5ju1x?context=5)|There are several 2/20 hedge funds in Ukraine. We run two :). Also there's a trend for some rich people to not invest in a outside funds, but hire a team to invest their money in global markets. There are a few such teams also.
 |Language issues and reputation of some businessmen that you can not see from the numbers  No, there has been capital flight for previous 5 years, but now there's hope again with all the western help etc.
[American here, I've heard several reports stating that some of the protesting Ukrainian citizens had seized and used firearms against the police agencies of the Ukraine and killed several law enforcement officers. Is this true?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20pf21/iama_portfolio_manager_in_a_ukrainian_investment/cg5ixny?context=5)|I believe it is true. But they were certainly not the first to start beating up police. And they were not the first to start shooting and killing. I'm not sure about total number of police fatalities. I believe it's about 5-6 men. vs over 100 dead protesters and about 30 who has gone missing and was never found and thousands injured.
 |Also in many countries people don't like police, but there's a spectrum to it. In Ukraine before the protests public support of police was about 2-3%, which is about the number of policemen and their families in the population :). All organized crime here is well connected to people in power and police. All drug trade is controlled by police etc.
[So, what's the process for replacing law enforcement? Are there people willing to train to be police officers to replace the corrupt ones, or is it gonna be a transition where people are gonna have to self-enforce? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20pf21/iama_portfolio_manager_in_a_ukrainian_investment/cg5krhn?context=5)|It's a huge problem, probably one of the most important right now. Basically police bosses are very corrupt and won't do anything. Lower ranked guys depended a lot on corruption too, because their official salary is really low. They are very demoralized now and won't do anything too. Now the government is recruiting people into the new National Guard. Is being made in a rush and there are doubts it work out right, but it's a good idea.  
[Do you think if the protest never got violent and people went about in more peaceful manner that there still could have been change?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20pf21/iama_portfolio_manager_in_a_ukrainian_investment/cg5i8vo?context=5)|Great question. No simple anwser to this one. Theoretically if the government did something when the large protest errupted, like fire the prime minister and internal affairs minister - no more violence would have ensued. But after the violence and deaths we got much more than we would not have gotten otherwise.
[Do you feel your situation is better right now being on the brink of war, or the way it was before with the old government and no war about to happen?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20pf21/iama_portfolio_manager_in_a_ukrainian_investment/cg5icdp?context=5)|What doesn't kill us makes us stronger. Long term this is all for the good.
[What is your hope for the elections in May? Are there any candidates yet, or any who might be strong candidates?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20pf21/iama_portfolio_manager_in_a_ukrainian_investment/cg5irhu?context=5)|It's going to be very competitive. There are three potential leaders: Tymoshenko, Klitchko and Poroshenko. From what I see Tymoshenko is a bit behind the other two. I hope she doesn't win, I have issues with her corruption scandals and affilation to gas deals in 90s, also it would be a preferred candidate for Putin.
 |Poroshenko is very smart and good businessman/manager, although there weren't any huge corruption scandals about him - I still doubt his motives. For example while being affilated with a local car factory he raised car import tariffs while being the economy minister. But he's definitely not a hardcore gangster like Yanukovitch.
 |You know Klitchko, he is not a great manager, doesn't have a great team, but I have less doubts about his inner values and I won't mind if he wins. Also he took part in protests a lot. 
[Thanks for answering these pretty objectively. What do you think about far-right Pravy Sektor (Right Sector\) Leader Dmytro Yarosh announcing his run for presidency as well; what would his chances be considering the protests may have stricken up feelings of pride or nationalism? Also, from what I've read (and what you've said\), the new candidates don't seem to be much better than the old; do you see protests happening again in a year or so akin to what happened in Egypt?  Edit: official party name.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20pf21/iama_portfolio_manager_in_a_ukrainian_investment/cg5lyxx?context=5)|He's not a serious contender. And you read what he actually says on facebook and not in Russian media - he's not that bad, and he is not really far right eather. But I don't know. Saying what people want to hear is one thing. Living up to it is another.
[Is it an age rift that separates the ideals in your region? Do the older folks want to become part of Russia, and the younger folks want to stay independent?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20pf21/iama_portfolio_manager_in_a_ukrainian_investment/cg5hxvw?context=5)|Yes. Older population that lived ok in USSR and could never adapt aftewards are more often pro-russian.
 |But many younger Crimeans also want to Russia, I do know a few.
[I am surprised that there aren't more people talking about the Budapest ~~treaty~~ memorandum. Obama has declared the crisis in Ukraine a threat to national (US\) security but did not elaborate. John McCain is one of the few people I've seen who has discussed the ~~treaty~~ memorandum and that it must be upheld. I think the issue with Crimea might also be that the ~~treaty~~ memorandum considers it part of Ukrainian territory and it splitting off is in violation of the ~~treaty~~ memorandum. This is important because it deals with upholding non proliferation laws and affects much more than Ukraine. From this angle it seems like Putin really needed an excuse to invade Crimea so he's not just blatantly violating this international agreement. I saw that the Ukrainian parliament has asked the other countries for protection from Russia under the ~~treaty~~ memorandum but it was just a quick article and, again, I'm very surprised how little attention this aspect is getting.. at least here in the US. Do you have any thoughts on this?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20pf21/iama_portfolio_manager_in_a_ukrainian_investment/cg5ieh2?context=5)|This is a great test of real values in the western world. From the viewpoint of fairness and civilized international society - it's quite clear that it is in fact a violation of Budapest treaty, UN charter, etc. and should be punished.
[Edit: as the comments below have pointed out, I was referring to the Budapest memorandum. Here's a release from a more official source regarding current state of US involvement: Link to m.state.gov ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20pf21/iama_portfolio_manager_in_a_ukrainian_investment/cg5ieh2?context=5)|But to really do something about it the west has to hurt it's own economic interests. EU gets a third of it's gas from Russia, London parks money of russian oligarchs etc.
[I have a simple yes-no question if you don't mind answering!  Do you believe the IMF will help Ukraine?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20pf21/iama_portfolio_manager_in_a_ukrainian_investment/cg5k4b9?context=5)|Yes! and not only financially, they are also trying to make sure the money doesn't get stolen/wasted with varying degrees of success.
[Do you think the referendum in Crimea was legitimate? Namely, do the Crimeans overall want to leave Ukraine for Russia?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20pf21/iama_portfolio_manager_in_a_ukrainian_investment/cg5hzzq?context=5)|50-50.
[Thanks for doing this, by the way. As a Ukrainian, do you feel a sense of possessiveness about Crimea in general? Will its loss impact you greatly or is it more of a feeling that it's an acceptable loss? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20pf21/iama_portfolio_manager_in_a_ukrainian_investment/cg5i262?context=5)|I think everyone should have a choice. This annexation would not be possible if there wasn't a lot of support for it by locals. I feel that we can not force Crimeans to love Ukraine. We need to focus on economy, quickly become much richer and Crimeans will want back. Many Crimeans have been fooled by propaganda and made the worst mistake ever.  I'm really fearfull that there will be some ethnic cleansing there now. 
[Can you elaborate more about your concerns of ethnic cleansing?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20pf21/iama_portfolio_manager_in_a_ukrainian_investment/cg5ilv3?context=5)|First of all - the new Crimean leaders will have unlimited power there, they armed a lot of local sort of militia forces with ak - 74s and they can do what the fuck they want.
 |At the same time - there will be horrific buerocratic mess. All ukrainian property rights have pretty much zero value now. They are already doubting some tatars land ownership. They will be able to just take the property of everyone who opposes their rule etc. The mess will last for years. 
[Your command of English is very impressive. You obviously lived/studied in an English speaking country. Your position as a money manager for the kleptocrats makes you  very upper middle class .  How do you think average Ukrainian outside of Kiev feel about the rift between Eastern and Western Ukraine?

My spoken English is worse than written. Not many people care about Bandera, and those who do are often very nice and educated people, not some bloodthirsty fascists russian propaganda would like you to believe. 
[Thanks for doing this. As someone who lives outside of Ukraine and in the U.S. it is always very hard for us to understand what is actually going on over there. What we here and see may not be the truth/ the whole truth which can be very misleading.  My question is with the turmoil and all that is happening what do you think will happen next. I know I am asking you to speculate but being on the ground with activism and being heavily involved in the world markets as a portfolio manager I think you are in a relatively good position to make a small judgement on what you think the next step is on this whole situation and how it will proceed. I.E do you see this ending with bullets flying, or do you see this ending without bullets and simply cutting Russia off economically at the knees and starting a battle of starvation between Russia and Ukraine and Germany and the rest of Europe. Everyone is so economically tied together that shutting dow trade and pipelines would have nasty results. Im afraid it will be a battle of who will last longer starving its people and im hoping Putin isn't as crazy as I think he is. What is your take?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20pf21/iama_portfolio_manager_in_a_ukrainian_investment/cg5jg3z?context=5)|I see it ending without bullets. I see Ukraine loosing Crimea for at least 10 years. I think Russia will try to destabilize other regions and my educated guess that it will fail. Western sanctions will be relatively weak, but there will be no intervention to other regions. I see russian corrupt system growing further until it collapses under it's own weight in 5-10 years. After that some regions will separate from Russia.
 |Ukrainian society has definitely made a huge leap forward in development, the politicians have not yet caught up. If they don't screw up - with all the western help we have a decent chance of really transforming the country into the like of Poland. 
[How can the average citizen of the USA best help?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20pf21/iama_portfolio_manager_in_a_ukrainian_investment/cg5hznd?context=5)|Not by much. Support your government actions in helping Ukraine (I'm not talking about fighting Russia, but economic sanctions against Russia and economic help to Ukraine are very useful).
[What is the most important thing for us to understand from the perspective of the people living in the middle of this turmoil?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20pf21/iama_portfolio_manager_in_a_ukrainian_investment/cg5hznd?context=5)|Also don't let russian propaganda spread. The role of far right radicals in the protests was negligible, we don't have more far right supporters than any other european country for example. 
[How concerned are Ukrainian citizens about the possibility of fighting to hold/take back Crimea?  Also, how much support is there for such action?  Also, thanks for that superb write-up! ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20pf21/iama_portfolio_manager_in_a_ukrainian_investment/cg5jr12?context=5)|People understand it's not realistic. They are critisizing the government a lot for not supporing Ukrainian army which is locked there more. They are critisizing secret services for allowing this.

It's ridiculous to even talk about it as Russian troops are taking over some Ukrainian regions. 
[Do you think the economic state of Ukraine will improve with the new government? IF yes, by how much?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20pf21/iama_portfolio_manager_in_a_ukrainian_investment/cg5kj6t?context=5)|1) Definitely not immediately. Long term if proper reforms are made - Ukrainian economy can be the fastest growing on the continent because of very low starting base.
[Also, do you think that it's possible that the same kleptocracy will come back, but with new faces and new slogans?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20pf21/iama_portfolio_manager_in_a_ukrainian_investment/cg5kj6t?context=5)|2) It's possible and kleptocracy is trying to come back as we speak. However I have faith that the people who were ready to die for democratic values will never allow the same level of corruption to return. There's really zero tolerance to corruption among society but not among politicians.

No it's not likely in near term. Unlike Ukraine there's a certain feeling of order there among the population. Corruption is contained only at the highest level (in Ukraine it's everywhere), so there's a general feeling among belorussians that life's kind of ok.

I was wondering, now that a new government is in power in Ukraine how will this effect relations and possible integration with the EU? Do you think that a new president might pursue integration? Also you mentioned earlier the three primary candidates, where do you think each one would sit on the issue, if elected? The process is a very long one, certainly, but do you favor integration and if so how do do you think it would effect your business?

[Hey there! I'm probably too late to the party, but here's my question: did you drink tea while being at Maidan?  I lvie in Kharkiv, and since the events i've heard quite a few stories about people coming home from there with symptoms of narcotic withdrawal.  Story #1: My mom's coworker has a daugther, who visited dance classes (namely hip-hop\). The teacher went to Maidan, and came back with a hefty sum of money. Then he just died. All out of a sudden. A young, healthy, sporty guy. Story #2: My mother-in-law told us about a granny in their town, who also was protesting at Maidan, but didn't feel quite well for a week after coming back home. The doctor said, and i quote: ""Oh, you better stop taking that ""medicine"", dear."" ""What medicine? I'm not taking any."" To which doctor just smiled knowingly.  The culprit here, as we heard, is that protesters were given tea with something narcotic mixed in. It may be just rumors, but that's why i'm asking: have you heard anything about this?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20pf21/iama_portfolio_manager_in_a_ukrainian_investment/cg5vgwm?context=5)|Oh that is just rediculous propaganda. I drank a lot of tea, because it was often very cold. It's and easy explanation for people who don't understand the protest to just assume they're on drugs.

20pz4s,1,2014-03-18,How can I get my foot in the door with no internships or CS degree?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/20pz4s/how_can_i_get_my_foot_in_the_door_with_no/,"Here's where I'm at:

Current Job: Internet Sales Manager @ Car Dealership. 
Income: About $70k/year
School: BA in Journalism
Goal: Transition into CS Position. I'm starting to lean heavily toward pursuing a career as a software engineer. It turns out I really enjoy programming.

Being that I already have a Bachelors, it seems the consensus is that it would be unproductive to pursue a second one. I'm currently taking classes at my local community college. It's inexpensive and I'm actually very impressed with the quality of the courses. I realize I could learn most of this for free, but structure, financial investment, and deadlines seem to help keep me motivated.

If I'm working full time and making a solid living, how can I transition into a CS field? Presumably I won't have any internships or a BA/BS in the field. Is it more realistic to first aim for a help-desk type of job and try to transition from there?"
20q0b0,21,2014-03-18,Conditional Basic Income idea (x-post basicincome),Bornflying,Futurology,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/20q0b0/conditional_basic_income_idea_xpost_basicincome/,"My idea is a conditional basic income.  

   01: The standard full time work week would be reduced gradually say over 20 years to an average of a 20 hour work week to decrease unemployment (by doubling the amount of workers needed).   Anything over 20 hours would be required to pay 1.5x the rate.

   1.1:  Workers could choose a weekly limit or yearly limit on hours worked.  If a yearly limit is chosen, full time would be considered  1,040 hours per year, anything over would be considered over time and require employers pay 1.5x the hourly rate.  If the yearly option is chosen by the employee, anything over 12 hours per day or 60 hours per week and/or 1,040 hrs/yr must be paid 1.5x the hourly rate.  The employer would not be allowed to mandate the yearly option be chosen.

    1.2:   Subsidies would be limited to 20 hours per week or 1,040 hours per year.  

   1.3:  Hours worked would be verified by two supervisors and the employee them self.  The penalty for falsifying information would be equal to 200 times the hourly subsidy rate for each hour falsified for each supervisor and the employee.  

   02:  Minimum wage and payroll taxes would be gradually reduced to $0 to help workers compete with automation.

   03:  The government would start subsidizing each hour any citizen works, goes to school, interns, or volunteers.

   3.1: For each dollar the minimum wage is decreased, this income subsidy would increase by the same amount. 

   3.2: Once minimum wage reaches zero, the income subsidy would continue to rise at the same rate until all citizens earn a basic income level.

   3.3: The subsidized income would apply equally to all people based on hours.  Any money earned working would be in addition to the subsidy.

   3.4: Persons unable to work because of inability to afford daycare or because of disabilities could choose to have modified work weeks as follows:

   3.4.1:  Parents of children under 5 years old
would be able to choose to do guided online or traditional child development education or online/traditional parenting classes and would be subsidized for those classes up to 10 hours per week at 1.5x the normal subsidy rate.  

They would also be allowed a subsidy to work,telecommute,do online classes, or volunteer up to 5 hours per week at the normal subsidy rate.  

Parents with prior drug or alcohol history would require random drug/alcohol testing to qualify. 

   3.4.2:   Anyone with a diagnosis of a disability from a doctor (no government assessment other then verification of documentation) would be allowed to opt for a reduced work week.  

Subsidies for work, telecommuting, online classes, or volunteering would be allowed for up to 10 hours at 2x the normal rate as long as accompanied by at least 5 hours per week of therapy.   

Therapy would include things such as physical therapy , occupational therapy, speech therapy, counseling, medical treatments, or any other therapeutic activity prescribed by a doctor. 

3.4.3:  Anyone completely unable to do any work at all or could not benefit from any therapy would be paid a basic income equal to 20 hours per week subsidy.  A licensed doctor would need to certify this annually.The penalty for falsifying this information would be equal to one year of the doctors salary.

    04:  A national retail luxury sales tax would need to be added to increase revenue.  

    4.1: Items would be taxed a percentage equal one half the percentage above the average consumer price of an item. 

For example, say the average american car is $20,000 and someone purchases a $40,000 car...that is 100% over the average price so the tax would be 50%, $20,000 and that vehicle would cost $60,000 to purchase.

   05:  Welfare, disability, and unemployment pay would be gradually phased out during this period.

   06:  College tuition would be subsidized at a rate equal to the average cost per credit hour in the US.  Tuition over that amount would need to be paid by the student. Anything under would be paid to the student.  Classes must be passed with a C or better or must be paid back.

  07:  Volunteer organizations would be expanded through a government program.

   7.1:  Any established non-profit organization would be allowed to verify volunteer hours.  All hours volunteered would need to be verified by two supervisors and the volunteer them self. The penalty for falsifying the information would be 200 times the hourly subsidy rate for each hour falsified for each supervisor and the volunteer.  Random checks by the government volunteer organization would be done to ensure work is actually being done.

        The effect of subsidizing hours contributed  would be beneficial in many ways.

- It would reduce unemployment to near zero

- It would keep people ""off the streets"".  Busy, educated people are less likely to commit crimes. It would keep people's minds active and give them a sense of accomplishment and purpose.

-Eliminates the ""race to the bottom"" problem  such as people having kids to receive welfare instead of working, or abusing the system in other similar ways without benefiting society.

-It would have all the same economic benefits as an unconditional basic income, allowing the base of the economy to continue earning enough money to feed demand for products and services. 

-It would massively redistribute wealth and close the huge and rapidly widening income disparity between the upper, middle, and lower classes.

-It would benefit society over just giving an unconditional basic income.  Whether people are working, getting educated, or volunteering, society benefits: 

A). People may decide to become career students in the subject that interest them most such as scientific research, engineering, medical research, art, music, theatre, philosophy, psychology.  Resulting in a richer, fuller society and possibly a second Age of Enlightenment.

B). Other people may decide to become lifelong volunteers, helping society in the way they choose.  Government programs would ensure there are enough volunteer jobs for every person whom wants one.

C). The traditional worker still can work, and with minimum wage gone and a subsidy for every hour worked would add value to a worker for a company.  With no payroll tax or minimum wage,  employees can compete against automation better because they could potentially be paid near zero or be unpaid interns.  Workers in skilled trades with little risk of technological unemployment would earn even more due to the subsidy, yet work half as much and would have at least twice as many full time workers due to the decreased work week.

Comments welcome, I know some will shoot this down in flames but I want to know the criticisms! 

TL;DR:  subsidy for every hour worked, educated, or volunteered.  No minimum wage, payroll tax, welfare, or unemployment.  Free college. Add luxury sales tax.

Edit: Added hourly cap if yearly option is chosen as suggested below.  Changed wording from ""compete with any machine"" to ""compete against automation better"".  "
20q3t4,1,2014-03-18,Series: Fear,TheSockGenius,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/20q3t4/series_fear/,"I was always fascinated with fear, the way it toys with our minds and influences our thoughts to morbid conclusions without reasonable evidence. I always tried to frighten myself with scary stories or movies, just to experience and study what fear did to the human psyche. As I grew older I recognized my interest in psychology as an opportunity to get paid for studying a wildly fascinating subject. Long story short I majored in Abnormal Psychology and got a job in a mental hospital in Chicago as an ""intern"", but pretty much did all the things that the lead psychiatrist would do. Three years later, I had the job of ""Assistant Psychiatrist"" and got paid plenty. I never had many friends, and the ones I did have when I was young split and went their separate ways. So there I was, living in a house far away from my parents on the outskirts of the city, with more land and more money than I knew what to do with. My life grew extremely monotonous and my constant routine sent me home  leaving a piece of my personality behind those thick glass doors. My childhood dreams had dissipated into a fleeting memory of my former self, clouded by the ""vast luxuries"" of adulthood, and then Mr. Hellman was admitted to the hospital. I was the first to see him, as the assistant has to bring in new patients for the  doctor to interview. When I first saw him, he had an uncomfortable air about him that made him seem... sinister. His eyes were colorless, his pupils were extremely dilated and the whites of his eyes were grayish and cloudy. He was very still, which isn't too uncommon, but his behavior and look made me feel very uneasy. He was with who I presumed to be his wife, her face looked distraught, she had the look of one who had lost a husband or a child, and as they walked towards me I could see this frightened and sad emotion on her face intensify. Mr. Hellman's gait was more of a shuffle than a stride, and he nervously clutched his the inside end of his wrist. As they made their way up the stairs, I watched with anticipation as the couple neared the front desk which I was standing beside. The facility was rather small, but it was well equipped and had plenty of patients. Large windows graced the walls around the front desk and reception, allowing the fleeting sunlight to silhouette the two in their entrance. I hated this time of day, the light was always blinding when you faced the windows. The man approached me, independent from his assumed spouse, who stood by the doors, waiting. My hand was resting on the counter, and he placed his hands on mine, still clutching his wrist. His palm was ice cold, his black eyes rested on mine in extreme focus, those eyes... I couldn't see any emotion behind them, no life residing in those pitch black pupils. I don't know how long I stared at him, until Nancy the receptionist greeted him. He kept his gaze on me and the only thing he said was ""hello friends! Do you wanna play?"" I recognized this feeling, it was fear. And I loved it.
**Update:** I welcomed him to the ward and directed him to the lead psychiatrist, Dr. Kyle. I sat him down in the seat, and asked his wife to take a seat as well. I then took my seat and waited for Dr. Kyle to speak. He opened his laptop to make a file for our new patient, then thanked me and pardoned me from the room. After the interview I accessed my laptop to read Mr. Hellman's file. Lou Hellman was his full name, according to his file, and the elderly woman with him was his wife, Lynette Hellman. He was 56 years old, and lived in Chicago all his life. I looked down at the Irregular Behavior area on the form and gasped. Unlike all the other loonies here, who were brought in because of Alzheimer's, or other common brain illnesses, this man (if I can even call him that) was brought in for what his wife called ""black magic"". Dr Kyle simply assumed they were both off their rockers and sent them both to be screened for - schizophrenia. I paused, confused, then found a note on the bottom corner of the file, the wife's testament to her spouse's insanity. The note read: ""It started with the incantations, he would mumble by the open window at night, and talk to the empty space in the room. I was confused and scared at first, until I figured out he was talking to spirits."" I thought some kind of artifact was required to summon spirits, like an Ouija board or a vessel, but the note read on ""he finally told me one day when I asked him who he's constantly talking to at night, and he said to me 'my friends are here to play.' This window mumbling and late night conversations with spirits had gone on for two months."" The note ended there. I smiled in excitement and thought to myself with my old child-mentality, 'this woman abandoned her husband out of fear, even thought he hadn't harmed her, interesting.' I closed the laptop and proceeded to my new patient's room. He didn't look at me when I came in, but instead stared out the window, by now the sun had almost set and it cast a mellow crimson orange across the evening sky. He had a malicious stare in his look, like a man who was about to start a bar fight. I almost skipped up to him, I was so interested to discover what was in the workings of this man's mind. ""Feeling okay, Lou?"" I spoke with a gentle tongue, like a parent trying to persuade a child. He turned to me and grinned, his eyes now burning with intensity that would engulf all life with its black flames, the more I looked into his eyes the more they grew, I escaped his glare and glanced down at my touch pad computer.

20qk1i,8,2014-03-18,A student injured me (intern) while I tried to discipline him. Any tips on returning to the classroom normally?,ollenollebolle,Teachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/20qk1i/a_student_injured_me_intern_while_i_tried_to/,"I'm an intern teaching four year olds. Yesterday, one of them (student X) hit me when I told him not to jump off a chair. I tried to discipline him, getting down to his level and explaining in a firm voice that he is not allowed to hit a teacher. Student X got away from me, which resulted in a chase through the classroom. I caught up with him, put him in a chair and once again told him it was not acceptable to hit a teacher. I asked him to stay seated. 
Student X did not remain seated, so I went after him and tried to get him back to the chair I put him on as punishment. The student got violent, tried to bite me and scratched my hands until I started bleeding. At this point I let go and another teacher took care of him. 

I have learned from other teachers that this was not personal, but that the child can get violent. The parents and the school board have been informed about this incident, so that's all taken care of. 

I was terribly shocked by this incident, but I will be returning to school tomorrow as a part of my internship. 

I was advised to leave this incident at home, and I will do my best to do so. Nonetheless, I'm not quite sure how this will effect me in the classroom tomorrow. Any tips or advice on how to deal with this? Especially on how to interact with the student in question.   

EDIT: Thank you all so much for answering! "
20qmo3,1,2014-03-18,Living with my mom...in my mid-twenties with my girlfriend.,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/20qmo3/living_with_my_momin_my_midtwenties_with_my/,"My girlfriend and I live in my mom's basement. We are so grateful that we can live here while only paying her 200 bucks a month while we finish up at the state university. I have a part time job, I am a full time student and I also have an internship. My girlfriend is also a full time student and has a part time job. We are both in our early and mid twenties. I love my mom but it is so hard to live with her. We do not like her boyfriend. He is a conservative rich republican and my mom is starting to act like him. The main issue is living in the dark basement. It is very depressing down there. Also, I have ALOT of house work and I get asked regularly if I am going to be able to do housework that week. On a normal day I take care of the dog, take out the trash, and clean up the dishes. Not a big deal. But I also clean up after she makes food for her boyfriend after I have been at school from 9-6. I also wax the floors every week and vacuum. I dust everything and vacuum the stairs weekly. I also clean the kitchen. I know that my mom means well but she is very overbearing. Tells me how to live my life for example, I wanted to take a break before going to grad school and she snapped at me. She yelled NO! and went on about it. I don't want to go straight to grad school so that I can start working and move out. I get hassled alot about the housework not being done up to her standards like putting the wrong size spoons in the wrong spots. It is a very hard situation. Also if I cut back on my hours at my part time job to focus on midterms or my internship she makes me feel guilty and tells me I need to make money. Money money money is her main focus. I tried to tell her about the progress at school but she responds with how much money she is going to make that month. I love her and I know things with her will be better when we move out.     "
20qrms,190,2014-03-18,Humanity's Children.,Zorkamork,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/20qrms/humanitys_children/,"I was so excited to start my work. I was so honored to be part of this. I've been studying all my life for this, ever since I was little I loved animals.

I went to a great school on a biology degree path, I even went to grad school. I studied the great apes for my thesis, I went full on Goodall for a while, living out of a tent, studying a group of gorillas.  It was great while it lasted, I honestly was sad to leave them when I did, it was like we kinda became family, you know?

I got some solid work after that, nothing quite as fulfilling to me as my past work but it was good. I spent a lot of time in the field, but just for short times broken up with long periods in some sterile, dull, lab. Eventually I started taking near any job the bosses offered that would get me out, I couldn't stand to be locked away all day.

Doctor Yu approached me after that, I guess she noticed that a young guy was pretty eager to do anything but stay in a lab, and figured I'd be up for spending a few years working on an experiment with a big chance of failing.

She was brilliant don't get me wrong, but we never really talked much. She seemed pretty intense, and that's a lot coming from me, always with her nose in a book or computer, writing things down like a machine would. When she offered me a place in her team I thought she was just trying to fill a spot out, you know?

Still, it sounded interesting. We were going to expand on previous work done teaching sign language and such to apes. We were going to teach a gorilla to talk. Well, not TALK talk, but we were trying to bridge the gap from sign language over to more 'proper' speech.  She had already done the prep work, a box was implanted in a male gorilla's throat, hooked to the brain and vocal cords. He had already been taught sign language and showed promise in reading and other areas. Basically he was as close to understanding human language as we could get, so he was who we were riding all our hopes on.

His name was Wukong, a more respectful name than most get I grant but still didn't seem quite right, I'm pretty sure that dude in the myths was a monkey, not an ape. He was in a cage, recovering from the surgery, kinda wobbly walking, but seemed mostly alright to me. When we approached Doctor Yu took out a treat from her pocket, a granola bar with fruits and nuts in it, apparently Wukong's favorite. She knocked it on the bars a bit to get his attention and he came eagerly bounding over. She held it out, but when he reached for it she pulled it back, wanting him to know he could have it, but not quite yet. Without missing a beat she asked ""What do we say?"" Just like that, like she was talking to a little kid who forgot his manners.

Wukong looked frustrated for a bit, obviously thinking he was being teased, before she repeated the gesture again, with the same question. He paused then, looking between her and me before raising his hands like he was about to sign. To be honest that alone surprised me, I never saw a gorilla respond that fast to a communication command. If we ended the tour right there I'd already think Yu was a genius, but she just shook her head.

""No no, not like that. Use big boy words"" again she talked to this thing that could throw her across the room like a child, and he just paused, like he was really being scolded by his mother.

""Wukong has been raised in the lab"" she explained ""We rescued him from poachers as just a baby, he's spent his whole life being trained in communication, he knows what we want.""

He lowered his hands, slowly ambled back over right to the bars before opening his mouth, face contorting not quite in pain but in discomfort. Then it happened, a robotic, child like, voice came out of that massive mouth. ""Please, treat. Wukong want treat. Wukong good.""

I could have been knocked over if the AC was running, the ape talked. Sure not with his own voice, he had a microphone in his throat, but still it was his brain controlling it, his brain sending impulses, Yu's technology taking those impulses and translating them into human speech. It was like hearing that famous ""Watson come in here, I need you"" test that Bell did! Yu didn't even seem that phased, simply smiling proudly and handing the treat over, free hand rubbing the gorilla's head. ""Yes you are,"" she cooed, ""Mama's good boy.""

Things went by in a whirlwind after that. We kept everything under wraps, wanting to be absolutely sure the results were right. We spent night after night with Wukong, getting him to say everything from simple baby talk to reciting the constitution. He never really got complex grammar, but hey he was a gorilla who could speak, he already won the gold.

We were about to go public, a big press conference with Wukong right next to us, we even trained him to be able to answer some questions, that'd really impress them.

It was the night before, Yu and I were in the lab with just a few interns, wrapping our projects up, preparing our speeches, it was gonna be a big damn day for all of us. Us nerds don't get to be rock stars often, so we really savor the few times we can swagger around a stage saying ""Look at what we did, plebeians, you can't even imagine this crap can you?""

Yu went down to check on Wukong, I let her go alone.

Fuck I should have gone with her.

We didn't notice she was still gone until an hour or so later, we figured she was just enjoying the last quiet moment she'd have with him. I went down to check on them, tell Yu to get some sleep. I grabbed a granola treat for Wukong from the bucket and entered his enclosure. We gave him a nice place to stay, not zoo big, but big enough for one gorilla, trees, grass, all that jazz, it wasn't home but it was a nice place.

I didn't notice Yu right away, I just saw Wukong, hunched over, his microphone making a low whine.

""Hurt,"" god that voice, that childlike monotone voice.

""Mama hurt Wukong...""

I got closer, I asked what was wrong, we had some issues with Wukong thinking us putting him in his cage or giving him a shot or something was 'hurting' him. I figured that was what this was.

""Mama hurt Wukong...Wukong head hurt...""

I kinda paused there, the room was way too quiet, just me and the gorilla, both breathing heavier than we should be.

""Wukong, where's mama?"" I asked, he didn't answer, just kept repeating.

""Wukong head hurt, mama hurt...""

I looked where he was looking, there she was. Yu was a beautiful woman, a bit older than me but not much, I always thought her long black hair was her best feature, it was always kept in a bun or something else to keep it up, but a few times, after work when we were chatting, she let it down, and it looked like a silk tapestry connected to her head.

Now it was covered in blood, stuck together in clumps, chunks torn out. She was laying against a rock, her head was bashed open, blood and brain splattering the rock behind her. She had a shocked look on her face, she had no idea what was coming. Her glassy eyes were huge, like she didn't know why this happened.

Wukong turned to face me, then I saw it. His right eye was bright red, blood vessels had broken. His nose was bleeding too, these were all warning signs we had been told to watch for. The things in his brain were supposed to be secure but we just had no way of knowing.

""Wukong hurt, papa"" he continued, ambling closer to me, eyes locked on me. God that stung, since Yu and I started working together with him I became the 'papa' to her 'mama' I guess.

""Wukong hurt, doctors make hurt"" he said, that voice never changed, but god I knew he was in agony. I couldn't move, I knew running would make it worse.

It wasn't fair. He had no idea what was going on. One day he fell asleep and woke up with a sore throat, then we kept talking to him, making him follow every order, throwing...shitty lumps of oats and fruit at him every time he did. Now he was in pain, with a wound he couldn't see. I felt so bad for him, but there was nothing to do.

""Wukong hurt, here"" he said. With that his hand came crashing down on my head. I crumpled like a sack of potatoes. That must have been how Yu died, she fell onto the rocks. Maybe Wukong didn't even mean it, maybe he was legitimately just trying to show his 'mama' where it hurt.

I don't remember what happened next, an intern found me and thank god she was smarter than me, she brought a tranq gun. I woke up in the hospital a couple days later. The doctors told me I was lucky, I had a crack in the head but nothing major beyond that, I was able to get back to work in a few days, though I now have the occasional migraine.

Wukong had been put down, they said the intern said it looked like he bashed Yu's head against the rock, they figured for a violent animal it was easier to 'put him out of his misery' that way instead of fixing what they broke. I don't know who's right, but that never sat well. We broke this animal, we turned him into an oddity for our own fame, and then we threw him away.

I still see them when I sleep, that bloody eye, that pained look, Yu's shocked face. I should have gotten worse than a headache, I deserve worse. I was an absentee father, I never thought of what could happen to Wukong until it was too late. Everyone looks at me like a victim, they ask me if I'm ok, if I need time off, they tell me Yu's death was a tragedy, but no one says anything about Wukong, I don't think anyone even remembers his name.

I was so excited to start this, this was my dream. Now all I can dream of is that pain, that suffering I was proudly party to. We like to think we're oh so advanced, but how great can we be if this is how we treat our children?"
20qta8,5,2014-03-18,Questions about the quality of the internship I've been offered at an IB,internshipquestions,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/20qta8/questions_about_the_quality_of_the_internship_ive/,"Hey all,

so i'm a graduating senior at a non-target school, and i was offered an internship at a top 20 IB. The position i originally applied for was a summer analyst, but i'm being offered a position at the marketing desk in their cross-asset solutions group.

I'm confused because the position i applied for sounded great, i'd have the opportunity to do trading for the IB, and even do some financial engineering. 

Here is the description of the position i'm being offered:

&gt;You will join the Marketing desk on a trading floor designing and selling structured products linked to any asset class, including equities, indices, commodities, interest rates, credit, currencies, hedge funds and hidden assets.  The position serves the American market (the US, LATAM and Canada), targeting retail as well as institutional clients.

&gt;This position is at the crossroads of different internal desks in the Cross-Asset Solutions Group: Sales, Financial Engineering, Legal, Research.
 
&gt;Typical tasks and day-to-day responsibilities will include:

&gt;Producing detailed commercial presentations, Term Sheets for distribution to clients and / or potential investors;

&gt;Developing/creating brochures, newsletters, marketing campaigns, in order to keep the clients informed of our capabilities, services, and latest product innovations and ideas;

 &gt;Backtesting products / excel computation (historical simulations of investment scenarios and product performance as well as analysis of returns - using macros (VBA or not) or requiring the development of macros);

&gt;Liaising with Legal department to develop and maintain US / Canada / LATAM compliant marketing and sales documents;

 &gt;Producing analytical reports;

 &gt;Strategic watching and competitive analysis on Structured Products markets in the Americas (data analysis &amp; statistics, competitors’ new releases and evolution, new development analysis – payoffs, underlyings…

&gt;Assisting with the organization of conference and related events for client and salesperson networking and education, including liaising with Conference Organizers and delegates.


now this doesnt sound all that bad to me, i'm definitely interested in designing products, and doing the backtesting, creating reports, and especially the data analysis part.

My only concern is that this position wont lead to many more opportunities afterwards.

I'm a senior so i need to have a job after this (unless i opt to do an MS in finance). 

I guess my questions are: what kind of jobs would i be able to go into after this? I'm definitely interested in doing research for banks or financial firms. I'd also be interested in doing trading. I'm just hoping this sort of job will open doors in data analysis/modeling? I'm guessing this experience plus getting the MS in Finance would be the best option? 

I just don't want to be a glorified office jockey doing basic marketing tasks (making brochures) unless it means theres opportunity to move to more advanced positions. 

Any input is greatly appreciated, i'm getting sort of concerned here.

20qtpt,7,2014-03-18,"New to the sub-Reddit... Absolutely love Austin, currently looking to relocate, have about a year of experience at brewery... Anybody looking to take on staff?",Bootscraper,AustinBeer,https://www.reddit.com/r/AustinBeer/comments/20qtpt/new_to_the_subreddit_absolutely_love_austin/,"Might as well get an introduction out of the way; my name is Zach, hello!
I'll attempt to keep this as brief as I can.

I have been in love with craft beer heavily for 5 years now. It started with ""beer classes"" and special tastings, then went on to reviewing the stuff online, aging it, trading, etc. I have always wanted to attend Seibel Institute, but never had the money. I figured i should get involved at the bottom of some brewery and work my way up from there.

I started hanging out a lot at Milwaukee Brewing Company (best brewery in the city, 
imo. 50% annual sales growth, started in 2007 now at 8,500 bbl per year, Drink Me! Magazine's best brewery of 2013) last winter and becoming  loosely associated with them. Eventually, they decided that they liked both my industrial factory experience and my homebrews enough to officially take me on as an employee last April.

Since that time, I tackled nearly every responsibility they rapidly threw at me. This includes warehouse duties &amp; operating machinery as part of canning &amp; bottling days, as well as assisting the brewers with various tasks around the brewery associated with the actual production of the beer. In addition, they wasted no time including me into their marketing effort, having me pour and represent the product at various beer festivals, tasting events, and pairings. This aspect quickly got me behind the bar, and eventually as a guide, at their weekend tours of the brewery. I'm humble enough not to toot my own horn too often, but this area is where I'll say I was an asset, training newer employees on proper keg usage, rocking stellar crowd control, being told I gave the best tours that people ever took there, and so on.
Weather it was being there during the weekdays as a grunt or guiding the tours on the weekend (I was only one of two staff that did both), It was more than just a job to me. It was a part of my identity, and I've never taken more pride in my work than through them.

My plan was to continue helping the company grow while I gained enough experience to feel comfortable enough to take my talents down to Austin within a year or 2; I vacationed there last November and loved everything you got going on down there, feel like the city wad tailor-made for me!
Suffice to say, they unexpectedly let me go 2 weeks ago. This was nothing short of heartbreaking for me. I was told that it was not for personal reasons, and that they just didn't see a place for me on their dream team as they expanded into the future. My boss simply explained that he understood I wanted to become a brewer but felt bad that he couldn't give me full-time hours or higher responsibilities, and didn't want to ""waste my time."" Personally, I happen to think there is holes in the story, as I had politely talked with him the week before about my own dreams &amp; aspirations/future with the company, and was JUST about to start shadowing one of the brewers weekly off the clock on my own time. I am not in a position to confirm our deny that there was some politics going on above me, but either way, there is no bad blood and my boss even sent me off with some letters of recommendation.

So now I'm back to square one.

On one hand, I want to remain a player in the beer scene up here and head to Austin a lot later than I originally wanted, but, well... I'll just be honest: The scene here sucks. A lot.
Of the only 2 other breweries in the city, I have good enough connections at Lakefront to be an easy-in, but told that no positions would be opening until summer.
All the craft beer bars that I know of love my patronage but are are already fully staffed. Regarding the brand new brewery &amp; brew pub each opening in my neighborhood that my boss recommended I check out, it looks from my perspective that they squandered their money and will not be open on time or possibly ever. A beer &amp; food bistro even told me I may be too experienced to join their staff =/
 
On the other hand, I'm thinking if have to start over from scratch anyway, that I just take whatever experience I have, and just head down to Austin right now.
Since I currently am on a month-to-month lease, have no girlfriend, no pets, no kids, and now no job, this option seems to make the most sense to me. My unemployment compensation won't last forever, and I'll be damned if end up back inside a factory through a temp service or behind the counter of a gas station.

I, essentially have nothing to lose and everything to gain. I will be willing to work either part time or full, any shift, and can be residing in Texas asap.
I intend on homebrewing every single weekend for the next couple months, loading up my trunk with whatever's fully fermented, and making the drive down before summer to pass them out along with my resume to every single brewery, brew pub, and craft beer bar that has a door I can knock on.

In the meantime, I was hoping someone in here could help me out if they know of any places that are for sure hiring, or will be looking to fill any positions; either by bringing this Reddit post to their attention or by forwarding me the necessary contact information for them to receive my resume by email or fax.
As a reward, you will earn liquid payment as soon as I make the move ^_^

I'm looking to advance my career, but am willing to serve any entry-level roles. And oh yeah, I am perfectly happy to COME IN ON MY OWN TIME AS A VOLUNTEER TO MEET THE COMPANY'S SPECIFIC STANDARDS. Either a few weeks or a few months, the amount of unpaid internship I will be willing to work depends on technicality of the position I will be filling.

..

I will be happy to answer any questions you may have, and give out my contact info privately if asked. This is already waaaaaay too long, so sorry and thank you for reading.

Cheers!

Kids with lisps, the elderly who cannot swallow or had a stroke resulting in paralysis, all kinds of things). I was going through a lot of depression and anxiety my last semester (worsened by a break up that really fucked me up) and I was doubting how much I wanted to get my Masters and make this my career. I have a 3.75 GPA, and was involved in a few clubs, mainly the photography club, because that is what I really love to do. So instead of taking my GRE and applying to grad schools, I took a year to take some more photography classes while working two part-time jobs as a newborn photographer working on commission and at the university library. The next year I got a job at a daycare and began a 4 month Medical Billing and Coding course. I want to get my certification, but have heard a lot of people have trouble getting jobs in this job without experience, and that many of those jobs are also going overseas. 

Soooo basically: 
-I did well in school &amp; graduated Magna Cum Lauda. 
-I'm six classes away from a Psych degree, but I don't know if that would be anymore useful than the one I already have.
-I'd like to do medical billing and coding but I don't know if I can get a job without experience. 
-I love photography more than anything but don't know if I can do this realistically--I am not business savvy in the least and everytime I want to make marketing materials I feel braggy and annoying.
-I'm starting to think about saving money and going to grad school for Communication Disorders, but I don't know if I'd have a good chance getting in considering I took 2 years off doing things that have nothing to do with the field. I am so broke right now so I can't really afford to volunteer anymore.  

For the short term, I'm thinking of trying to get an office job to save money and sustain myself for a little while and then enter a program I can complete quickly that offers internships and job assistance that will allow me to have a secure career. 

Sorry if this is long and convoluted, but I'd really, really appreciate any advice!

What happens now?",[deleted],findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/20r8cy/im_22_dropped_out_of_college_making_six_figures/,"I'm really hoping you guys can give me some idea of what's wrong with me. Here's a rundown of my situation:

I was a pretty bright kid in high school, never did AP classes but had mostly straight A's and scored high on standardized tests. After graduating, I went to a private university for software engineering for 2 years and hated it miserably. My university failed me at allowing me to switch to a major I was more interested in, so I hopelessly stuck with it. 

After 2 years of barely making it to class every day, I ended up landing a paid internship (~$40k salary) that I somewhat enjoyed doing web development as part of my school's co-op program. The plan was to go back to school, but they liked my work so much that they offered me a full time position (at ~$60k salary) and I decided to take it since I was dreading returning to campus so much.

About a year passes, and I (unsurprisingly) begin to hate my job. Management was clueless and I had no interest in my work, as well as the town I was located in began to feel pretty boring and dried up. Just as I'm starting to think about returning to school, I got **really** lucky and landed a position at an up and coming television channel in a very affluent city with ~$100k salary, benefits, 401k, and everything else you would want from your employer.

Guess what? I hate it. I hate every minute of this job, even though I'm doing more of what I thought I'd like doing (front end design work rather than backend database work).

Part of me thinks that I may suffer from depression. Another part of me thinks that I'm getting burnt out too young and I'm going to start losing my hair by the time I'm 24. And another part of me thinks I'm being an ungrateful Pusswhip-McGangBang. I really feel lost in the world right now.

I have a several other interests, I play music, draw, write, love to travel, architecture, etc., but I'm terrified that I'll go back to school and repeat the entire process all over again, but this time end up being 32, ready to quit my next career and hating my life and my job.

Since I have relatives in Canada I thought it would be a good idea to search for a company near them.

The problem is I got overwhelmed by the many different locations where I can look for a company and I really don't know where to start.

So i came up with this maybe silly idea that it could be possible that the Canadian people of reddit can help me with my search.

I'm wondering if people who have interned at Google or Facebook for sofware or Microsoft for PM (or, if possible, more than one) can shed light on which internship they preferred and which internship they learned the most from? I received summer internship offers for these three companies and am wondering which one to choose. Here are details and pros and cons that I've come up with for each company:


Microsoft

Pros:

- It's a PM role. I haven't done a PM role in the past and it seems like the type of role I'd want to do long term.

Cons:

- It's in Redmond, which is far far far from from my family, friends, and bf. It shouldn't be a big thing but it is (otherwise I would take it).

- The team sounded kinda boring.


Google

Pros:

- The name, mostly. 

- It's in NYC!

Cons:

- I've done software dev internships already. 

- I heard google projects are kinda boring and you don't get to do much.



Facebook

Pros:

- I've heard from a friend who interned at both Facebook and Google that Facebook was better because it 
had more of a startup culture.

- Potentially interesting project in graph search.

- It's in NYC as well!

- Gives out return offers and good signing bonuses for interns if I get it!

Cons:

- The software dev issue.

- I guess if I were to do software dev, Google would be a better name?

Help! I know it should be an issue but distance is kind of a big thing, and I figure that whatever jobs I can get having done Microsoft PM internship, I can get with google or facebook as well?"

I'm a junior in college and in about a year I'll be released into the big wide world on my own, with the responsibilities of paying for my own existence. My fiance and I are planning on getting married shortly after graduation, and if everything goes according to his plan he'll start medical school that fall. That leaves me as the only source of income and I'm scared shitless that I'll be less than able to provide. All I seem to hear are things like, ""Oh you're not graduating with a STEM degree? Good luck being able to feed yourself."" I'm actually starting to believe it! 

I'm terrified that I'm never going to be able to find a job that actually pays money. I'm afraid that I'm going to be stuck in a never-ending cycle of unpaid internships. I'm too educated with not enough experience to even get a second glance for all of the entry-level jobs that I see. 

I also hear so many people telling me, ""Well if you can't find a job or pay your bills than obviously don't get married yet. You're not 'financially stable'."" Which is absolute horse shit. We've been together for 5 years, 3 of those being long-distance, and quite frankly I don't think I want to spend any more time apart.

- Did a round of interviews for a winter 2015 internship and still waiting to hear on a few of them.

- Multiple recruiters have told me that they are reluctant to offer graduating students internships because they can't give full-time spots until another year after the internship.  Some told me not even to apply for the winter internships because they wouldn't interview a graduating student.

- Every recruiter has suggested that nearly all their entry level hires are from the internship programs.  I have not seen any on-campus recruiting for full-time hires (maybe that comes in the fall?)

Is the best case situation that I get accepted for an internship in the winter and then find something else to do (finish CPA, work somewhere else) for a year until a full-time spot opens?  Anyone have  any experience or inside knowledge on these types of situation?

20s04a,58,2014-03-18,The Psych Ward,[deleted],LetsNotMeet,https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/20s04a/the_psych_ward/,"As a senior in college, I heard a shocking story that has stayed with me for the last decade. 

My friends and I were sitting at our local haunt, a quiet bar far enough off the beaten path to be ignored by most college students, drinking beers.  A small group of college girls walks in. One of my friends was friends with one of the girls and before long our two groups were co-mingled.  We were talking about whatever small talk was interesting to college kids at the time, and we felt like intellectuals who had a bar to themselves.

One of the girls, Lindsay, was a fairly attractive psychology major. She was a soccer player and very personable.  We hit it off immediately. 

After several beers I learned that she had been doing some sort of internship at a local asylum for the criminally insane. I was fascinated by her stories and hearing tales of crazy people. Plus, she was attractive and I enjoyed her attention. I made the mistake of asking her to tell me about the craziest thing she had ever seen. 

She hesitated and declined. It took a few more drinks, non-stop coaxing,  and the promise that I'd never judge her before she capitulated.

She begins, visibly uncomfortable, by telling me that one of her responsibilities during her intership was to do a bed check of all inmates after lights out. This required a visual inspection of all the rooms by looking through little windows into the cells. 

The night of this event, Lindsay is doing this part of her routine. All is normal until she reaches the cell of a female patient who was notorious for being particularly disturbed.

Lindsay looked into the cell of this particularly disturbed inmate and doesn't see anything. She is short, so even on her tiptoes it is difficult to get a full view of the room but it is clear that there is something amiss. Concerned, Lindsay goes to tell her supervisor that the patient isn't in her bed, as required.

The supervisor grabs the keys and they rush back to the cell. They unlock and open the door. There, laying face down on the floor, is this patient in a pool of blood that is shockingly stark against the white of the cell. 

Lindsay is crying at this point in our conversation. I urge her, selfishly, to continue. I even hold her hand and assure her it's alright, that she needs to talk about it.

So Lindsay continues to tell me that her and her supervisor rush into this cell and start triage. The patient has a pulse but isn't responsive.  Lindsay and the supervisor roll the patient onto her back to determine the cause of the trauma, and then...

Lindsay is hysterical at this point. She is sobbing, and almost hyperventilating. Whatever she is about to tell me effected her deeply. 

As Lindsay and the supervisor roll the patient onto her back, blood pours from her face. It is evident that trauma is to the patient's eyes that are thick with coagulated blood and matted hair. It took a few moments for Lindsay to realize that the patient had one eye completely missing, and the other was dangling from a sinewy strand, probably the remnants of the optic nerve.

Lindsay and the supervisor continue treatment, trying to get the patient to respond. The patient opens her mouth, gurgling blood, and moans with a hacking, choking cough. They notice an object lodged in the back of the patients mouth, and the supervisor does a quick finger sweep to clear the airway.

The other eye falls onto the floor.

This crazy-ass patient had plucked her own eyes out of her head and was in the process of eating them when she began choking and passed out.

Lindsay tells me that the patient lived and was still recovering. When asked by the Doctors why she would dig her own eyes out of her head, the patient says that she couldn't stand to see all of the evil anymore. 

After telling me this, Lindsay was almost in a fetal position, curled up and crying into her knees that she had pulled up to her face.  She choked back a few sobs, looked at me through tear-streaked, raccoon-mascara eyes, grabbed her purse and almost ran to the door.

I never saw her again, but that night left an indellible mark.

20s5bn,1,2014-03-18,Trespass Warning - what does it mean?,sonsofminerva,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/20s5bn/trespass_warning_what_does_it_mean/,"Hello, I received a trespass warning or a trespass form from the Holiday Inn in Panama City Beach.  I am wondering what this means for me going forward.  I was confronted by security and taken to the security office, where the deputy and security officers scanned my ID and the deputy said they were going to ""send it back to my home state"".  He wouldn't answer any of my questions and escorted me off the property and gave me my ID back.  I wasn't arrested, put in cuffs, or given a written citation, but am afraid that this might show up on a background check when I am applying for internships this summer (I'm a college student).  I called the hotel today and they said that the warning will be filed with the PCB sherif's department but the lady almost ensured that it's not something that would show up on a background check.  Is this something that will show up on background checks or my criminal record?

I have also read online that I can expect to receive certified mail with the formal written warning, explaining that I will be arrested if I return to their property.  Is this true? I really don't want my mother to find out as this information will sorely disappoint her."

We were both working for the same company but different cities.

She was in a very controlling relationship before... hence asked for time before she could commit to me. 3 months into knowing each other, we got exclusive. With me, she had the freedom to do anything she wanted in terms of travel, meeting people, pursuing hobbies (she loves to dance but had to give up due to her previous guy). At times, this created problems because she was not used to it hence, often doubted my commitment towards her. Things got better gradually. We met often on weekends, almost every weekend and spent time either at her place or mine. We also lived together for couple of months at a stretch whenever we had time. 
I am the fun types and she is also attractive and adventurous. We often went vacation and hikes together. Nothing major problematic happened for first three years of relationship. Things were going smooth.

A point to note here is that I never stopped her from keeping in touch with her friends, even her ex-bf. They almost grew up together, so it could not be completely avoided.

A couple of years ago, I moved to Europe for higher studies. she felt abandoned and long distance has its problems as everyone knows. Next year, she also moved to Europe but I had to be in Asia for 6 months for an internship. She almost hated me for it but adjusted well to new life in new country, new friends.

Last year, things were awesome, we had many a months living together and travelling across Europe. I missed one vacation with her where she was going with her friends due to a job interview. Not such a big deal. 

We were so looking forward to our first summer in Europe when shit hit the fan and I had to go for another project in Asia for 2 months. She resented it real bad and felt abandoned again. Though there was not a fight about it, she bottled it all inside. She was job hunting too and under serious stress.

Through out our relationship, she has had a problem with one female friend of mine (lets call her D) whom I know for many years. D &amp; I never had anything romantic ever. P hated the fact that D &amp; I often met. Couple of time D, P &amp; I also hung out together but her dislike didn't change.

When I was in Asia for 2 months, my meeting with D blew out into something very big... and P decided to give up on me blaming it for the separation. we have never discussed an official break up.

Now the problem- When I came back to Europe after those 2 months, P was all evasive. It later turned out she went on a road trip for 5 days with her group of friends without telling me. We had an ugly fight about it and chose to go separate ways. I tried to go NC but was difficult. P was seriously frustrated with job search and I needed to focus on my part of career too. Thus, we kept in touch through messaging. I didn't force the issue, as it was almost after 10 years that P was living a single and  free life. In my mind, I believed she will let me know if she wants to maintain the status quo with me. After a few months gap, I went to meet her in December, she didn't like it at all as it was like a surprise. She said she is not in a mood for surprises. We spent new year apart.

Current situation:- 

we both came to Europe for each other. So irrespective of the situation, we have kept in touch and supported each other. (Not on a daily basis but once a week types) Mostly very basic and cordial. Since the separation, Skype chat has been cut down to zero which was almost a daily habit. This year has been good, we both have jobs now. She got a contract couple of days ago. We are still in different countries, like 2 hours away by flight. There has been no discussion of meeting or our current status but conversations off late have been happy and stress free.

Why am I posting - 
she posted lots of pictures on facebook... saying her fav clicks... the album contains lots of pics from our vacations through the years. There has to be some emotion involved if you go through memories of 3 years together.  Curious to know what should I read of her actions? A female perspective would be so helpful. She also started a pic blog of hers and said, I inspired her to do it as i am into blogging.  

What should I do in such a situation? Is there a way to woo her again? Or should I wait for her to make the first move.

My current status - for last 7 months, I have met people, made new friends. No relationships but yes I have lived the single life. 
We both agreed that we will let the other person know if anyone finds someone new.

**tl;dr**:4 year relationship, often long distance but also lived together, went separate ways 7 months ago due to career and personal stress, now we have jobs, mixed signals from her what to do next?"
20s7y6,0,2014-03-19,Anyone else think Belle Knox wasn't that bad?,Hardriveofhits,opieandanthony,https://www.reddit.com/r/opieandanthony/comments/20s7y6/anyone_else_think_belle_knox_wasnt_that_bad/,"Hear me out. First off, she is a very disillusioned 18 year old. There is no way she will end up getting her degree, much less getting hired after any respectable employer finds out who she is and what she has done. In addition, her handler was annoying as hell and wouldn't stop talking about herself.

However, as far as pornstar interviews on O&amp;A go, she was actually pretty good. She was honest, at times funny, went into detail about sexual behaviors (Which many pornstars don't, they behave uptight), she also was able hang with the boys and their sense of humor. She even tolerated Lady Di's verbal assaults and ""got it"".

What made the interview interesting for me was she opened up and discussed the history behind the facialabuse stuff. Essentially, it was one of her first vids and the guys who did it were complete dicks. I actually paid attention to her on the show rather than drone out like I usually do with every other pornstar they bring in. Hearing about the douchebag frat boy haters and all that other stuff was actually pretty good radio.

For an 18 year old on the radio, she did really well to be honest. Think about every other hot intern, porn chick, or pretty girl in the hallway they brought into the studio in the past. They were shit. She on the other hand actually managed to hold a conversation and keep things going.

Just food for thought. Feel free to downvote now.

20s869,44,2014-03-19,Desperate times...,wannabesq,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/20s869/desperate_times/,"Here's a story of a time when I was out of work.  My previous employer, which was an MSP had to downsize me, which is another story.  I was out of work for a while, had a temp job that was decent, but after that was done, I was running out of time on my unemployment, so I started lowering the bar...

I had a successful phone interview with a local mom and pop computer shop, and even though the pay was half what I was used to, and the work was a bit below what I could handle, I went in anyway.  Remember, I was desperate, I literally had one half of one week worth of unemployment before I was cut off, no more extensions.  I come to find out that the ""Mom and Pop"" owners don't even live in the state, and they have another shop two states over that they run themselves, and they have two employees that run day to day at the remote shop.  

I start my first day, where I will be working with their only tech $lazytech, who is lowering his hours to have more time for school, and that's where my hours would be coming from.  When I walked in, I was immediately saddened by the place, it was old looking, there was some ""inventory"" of software and old computers, that were worth more as doorstoppers than anything else, some vendor signs for long replaced lines of product.  I knew I wouldn't like it there, nor would I want to stay very long, this was just a stop gap until I could get back into the swing of things at another MSP or IT dept.  After the usual ""guided tour"" They sit me down where I have a final skype video chat with the owners telling me their processes.  The usual BS, but the part that got me, was that they claim to offer ""free diagnosis"" but they told me to inflate the hours worked on the invoice to reflect the time spent diagnosing...  I guess it's only free if you decline the work.  

After the paperwork, I finally sit down to start working.  This is a run of the mill virus removal.  It's not even that seriously infected, just your average fake antimalware infection with a browser hijacker.  I proceed to run some scans and manually removing some registry entries (I love autoruns for doing this btw) and the conversation between me and $lazytech goes like this

&gt;*Me:          ""Where to you keep your removal tools?  Or can I use the ones I have on my USB drive?""*


&gt;$lazytech: ""That's not how we do things here"" 


&gt;Me:     *dafuq?*


&gt;$lazytech: ""We just wipe and reformat/reinstall than remove the virus, because traces of the virus remain and it's just easier to reinstall""  


&gt;*Me:           ""But this virus is simple to remove.  On top of that, they have office installed, it would take longer to reinstall windows, run patches, install office, patch office, and restore backup.""*


&gt;$lazytech: ""This is the way we do it here, just backup the My docs folder, and the drivers and reinstall.  As for Office, the customer can install that themselves when they get it home.""


&gt;*Me:           ""Ok, but if it were my PC, I would be pissed if my drive was wiped without my consent, and that this is a simple infection to remove, what if the customer doesn't have the key to MS Office?*


&gt;$lazytech: ""If they can't manage their own software, maybe they shouldn't be using computers""


My words fell on deaf ears, and I had to do it ""their way"" which involved very specific backup of specific folders in user profile, documents, favorites, etc, exporting the drivers and backing that up as well.  I was used to imaging a whole drive, to make damned sure I didn't miss anything, in addition to a file backup of the obviously important stuff.  I mean, 1TB USB drives are cheap right?  Taking an image saved my bacon once when a user had a program that liked to store its data files in c:\program files\$application.  I was so glad I had a whole backup that time.  After I made the backups, the shop owner asked to skype him again where he drilled me on which folders I had backed up, as if he had hired an IT Intern that had never done this before.  I get that he's trying to cover his own ass, but why not at least attempt a virus removal, or even clone the drive before DBANing the thing...  Anyway, I wipe the partition table, get windows reinstalled and start downloading thousands of megs of updates,.  I then ask the tech for an MS office install CD, but of course they don't have one, and won't let me download one.  I'm told to just to put a note on the ticket that the customer will need to do it himself....  I am so shocked at this point that I know I'm gonna have to get out quick.  I begin formulating my exit strategy, maybe I can work there for a week or two to get a check, whilst keeping an eye out for a real job.  Luckily for me, I ended up leaving sooner than that.  The entire staff (even the remote mom and pop) are heavy smokers, and since they all smoke, they do so INSIDE the store...  That was it, I was done.  I left at the end of the shift (only 4 hours) head home, tell my wife all about it, she gives her blessing for me to quit, and I let the owners know I won't be coming back.  

As luck would have it, the VERY next day I land an interview for the job I have now (going on 3 years), twice the hours, twice the pay, and competent people that know how to do things right.  I still feel bad for that poor customer.  I never did hear what happened, but I'm sure he wasn't happy.  "

Immediately after graduating I got an internship which lasted for 6 months at a local Web Design Firm. The internship then turned into a full time position. I started out a minimum wage which for SC was $7.50 at the time. I have been there for 5 years now and have been the ONLY applications developer there turning out large scale MySQL and Microsoft SQL driven applications in PHP and VB ASP.NET. I'm currently only making $16 an hour. In just curious if that is good or if I should be getting more?

Edit: Thanks you to all who posted. I've found that the reason for low pay in my city is because there isn't a large market for web development and there are not many in my specific city. However in an adjacent city the average pay for someone with my experience is almost triple what I'm making now. Roughly $25-$35 per hour. I've reached out to a job recruiter and gave my resume. He has made me aware of several positions that will provide the pay I deserve.

Like you, our team of developers are passionate life long gamers. I remember waking up on Saturday morning in my footsie pajamas, drinking warm milk, and playing ""Atari Breakout"" until I fell asleep again.

I really don't understand what is happening here.,[deleted],resumes,https://www.reddit.com/r/resumes/comments/20sclo/6_month_checkin_still_no_callbacks_i_really_dont/,"After 6 months of job hunting I am just at a loss for what I can do.  I have two degrees from some of the best colleges in the US, including a BSEE.  I do have some employment gaps/travel abroad which may be hurting me, but this job search is just utterly destroying me.  I don't understand why nobody, not a single employer, has called me in for an interview after hundreds of applications.  

I've been going for all types of jobs: entry level test engineer, entry level analyst (various kinds), product mangers, technical specialists... everything that I think I could be qualified for.  I've even applied for technician type jobs that only require AAs.  

[My resume is here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BwikM7KKXnHtTndGT0ZveDdxT2M/edit?usp=sharing).  I've applied to some analyst/product manager type positions with this resume.  I also mix in the other jobs into the main category if they seem relevant to the role I am applying to.  

Aside from applying online, I have also fully updated my Linkedin profile and use it to view companies and recruiters on a regular basis.  I've connected with several recruiters by cold contacting them (usually alumni from my university), telling them I'd like to ""keep in touch about future opportunities.""  Usually I am either ignored or allowed to connect, but with no further communication.  I usually only get around 1-5 page views per week.  Sometimes they are anonymous recruiters, but nobody has ever actually contacted me about any opportunities.

I've even had my friend pass my resume on to the VP of his company.  He was told that HR would contact me, but that was two weeks ago and I still haven't heard from them.  If I can't even land an interview through an internal referral like this, I just don't know what else I can do.  

I never had a problem landing internships or jobs at anytime else in my career, but now that I have this master's degree, it is like the black death for my job search.  I really feel like I need a change in my strategy even though I feel like I've tried it all already.  What more can I do?  At this point I will take basically any job I can get.  I'm afraid I'm just not the 'average' candidate and for that I get constantly overlooked.

Any ideas?

She's currently working part-time and finding internships in the immediate area that she's hoping will offer her a full-time position. My question is: should I live with my girlfriend?


Factors to Consider:

* We've been together for almost 2 years

* We frequently sleep at each other's places, have taken showers together, aware of each other's habits, etc.

* We're both tidy people

* The lease would probably be for an apartment for a 12 month period

* We both like cats (she has a cat already but I want one of my own)

* I'm 100% financially supported by my parents whereas my gf supports herself and has some financial support from her dad

* rent for a 2bdr around here is ~$1700-$1900 and 1 bdr would be around ~$1100

I'm currently a Junior CS student, and wanted to know if internships are really as important as people make them out to be. 

I recently applied to several internships for this summer and got rejected from all of them (I did end up getting a coding challenge for one, and an interview for another, getting rejected from both after). This didn't surprise me, because all of the requirements seemed ridiculous for an undergraduate student to have.

Right now it seems too late to even try to apply to more, and now I won't have any internship during my undergrad. Is this going to hurt me in the long run? Should I drag out my education an extra semester so I can apply next summer, and attempt to land one? Is it worth it, or should I just graduate and hope to find an entry level job with no experience?"

In addition I also have a couple of years of startup experience. However, I've wanted to get into the big 4 and seem to have a hard time converting their calls, mostly because I choked up (nervousness ) during their interviews. I've not lost hope and have been preparing for them. But, are these repeated setbacks going to affect my chances of getting calls in the future? Plus, does it get harder to get these calls with experience ? I notice they seem to be recruiting a lot of recent college grads .

EDIT:When I say ""Big 4"", I dont really mean just Amazon, Facebook, Google and Apple. I intended it to be rather loosely covering top companies Y!, LinkedIn etc. Sorry for the confusion!

I spent the majority of last year thinking about career paths and I realized I didn't want to become an analyst.  I like meeting new people and that's what I want to do.


I read a lot about financial advisers/planners and how a lot of people have had negative experiences with them (being ripped off, not having the client's best interests) and with that in mind I began to interview at a lot of places.  Most of them wanted me to list hundreds of people within my natural market and the interviewers didn't seem to care about me (one even took out a phone and started texting during the middle of Q&amp;A).


I finally decided on an internship position (that will turn into full-time after graduation) at an independent broker-dealer.  The principals were the people that interviewed me and they expressed that they put a lot of value in ethics.  They heavily discourage selling to friends and family cause they personally believe that it's a moral hazard.


I've been going to my internship for the past few months and I'm learning a ton of stuff that I never learned before in a classroom.  I'm finding many of my future co-workers have become mentors to me.


I guess the point of my rambling back story is that I'm entering Finance with the ""right"" attitude towards helping people meet their financial goals and dreams.


Does /r/personalfinance have any advice in terms of balancing my personal and business lives, managing client relationships, or even ideas for meeting prospective clients?  Anything would help!


Thanks!

20tcc7,14,2014-03-19,Going through a rough time.,labellavida,TrueChristian,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueChristian/comments/20tcc7/going_through_a_rough_time/,"Hi guys,

I've been going through a pretty rough patch recently. I'm at a point in my life where I have to make some life-changing decisions, and even through I've been praying, I still feel lost and confused. I gaduate this year and have been accepted into grad school, which I feel extremely blessed about. However, I just got back from a mission trip that completely convicted my heart and showed me some of the distractions in my life (e.g.school, boyfriend, etc.). 

To top it off, I've hit a bad financial crisis. I'm a full time student in college and am working part-time. Even though I'd like to work more, I'm really involved with the BSM on my campus and another college ministry in town. I also need to start saving up for the summer as I need to find an internship, but I don't know if I'll be able to find a paid one. This worries me because I might have to quit my current job once I start it, and I won't have an income. 

Furthermore, my mom knows that I've been struggling financially and she's helped me out as much as she can, but I'm honestly too ashamed to ask for anymore help as to not worry her. I don't know how I'm going to pay my bills this month and I'm just worried. As for my boyfriend, he has been a great support, but our relationship is not Christ centered. My friends say that while he is a great guy, if he is not seeking The Lord, it will eventually raise problems within our relationship.

Could you please pray for me? I just don't know what to do. I know God is here...He is always here but it's so hard to feel His love and presence sometimes. Thank you so much for taking the time to read this. It means a lot to me. God Bless "

I'm a recent grad looking for a position, internship, or work experience, in Android app development.

I currently have two apps published on the Google Play store and am eager to learn and make more. I'm set on getting as much commercial experience as I can with the aim of eventually being employed full time in this role. I work well within a team, have worked both for a startup and in a corporate setting and have great communication skills.

My most recent app is [Cookies in Space](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jamessandford.cookiesinspace), an action game which incorporates the Google Services API. The first app I published was [Toothbrush Timer](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jamessandford.toothbrushtimer), a very simple timer concept I used to introduce myself to the platform.

Please send me a message or alternatively leave a reply if you want a copy of my CV or any other information.

Thanks!"
20toi0,5,2014-03-19,"1 month clean, having second thoughts",[deleted],leaves,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/20toi0/1_month_clean_having_second_thoughts/,"So I'm 22 years old and I've smoked daily for just about 5 years. My roommate of the past 4 years (whose been my best friend since age 16) sells a good deal of weed and smokes all day every day. Because of this situation, I grew accustomed to smoking however much I wanted, whenever I felt like it. For almost 2 years I would wake and bake and stay high all day. The only way it seemed to ever affect me negatively was a result of its illegal status. I got in trouble with my college once and with the law once, but I only got caught because of alcohol induced stupidity. Aside from those instances I was a highly functional stoner. Good grades, student athlete, good internships etc. In the past 2 years though I've been working 30+ hours a week and going to school full time, so my smoking has dropped to a few tokes a night about 5-6 nights a week. I don't miss smoking all day every and don't really plan on reverting back to that.

My relationship with alcohol is quite different though. Alcoholism is highly prevalent on both sides of my family, and I was never good at controlling my drinking. Over the past year, my drinking started to get worse and worse. A little over a month ago, I hit a bottom (story for another thread) and my girlfriend convinced me to go to AA. Since then I've been going to AA meetings a few times a week. I have a sponsor and have met some really cool people in the program. When I stopped drinking, I thought it best to take a break from smoking as well. I haven't smoked or drank in 31 days. I still have no plans to pick up drinking again, but it's becoming increasingly difficult to resist smoking. At first I was fully against smoking again, mainly because I drank the AA kool-aid of total sobriety. The more meetings I go to though, the more I think that AA might not be for me. I'm confident that I can stay away from drinking without AA (r/stopdrinking has been a huge help).

So I'm at a crossroads now. I've always seen weed as a positive force in my life, and the only thing that's kept me from smoking is AA rhetoric, which I don't fully buy. I just finished my last final exam of my college career and I really really want to blaze one with my friends to celebrate. Any advice on how to deal with this?"

**Dad** (D): 57 year old man, college educated, landed himself a full time job as a mid-level paper-pusher for an oil company thanks to his friends from his fraternity. Concerned whether his son is still on the right track.

**Bill** (B): 20 year old young adult, working on his bachelor's degree in economics. Somewhat shy with a tendency towards depression.

**Scenario 1:**

*D is calling his son, waits for him to pick up.*

D: Hey son, how you doin'?

B: Oh hey dad, I'm fine, thanks, how 'bout you?

D: Quite busy frankly, dealing with the logistics here of setting up a new project, but eh, I won't bore you with that. How was your weekend?

B: Oh it was great dad! Me and my mates from the frat went to this club in town here where some big DJ would show up. We paid 50 bucks each to get in, but it was full of people and the heat was horrible so we decided to get something to drink and paid five dollar each for a beer. 

Well the band was late and we were still sweatin' like pigs so we took another round and another and then some girl walked up to me and started talking but I didn't wanna look like a bitch in front of my friend so I called her a fat slut and she ran away crying and my friends high-fived me and bought me all my drinks for the rest of the night. 

So anyway, the band finally showed up and we had waited an hour to stand in front of the row so we could see something, but the sound was so hard that we tried to move more to the back, I still heard a beep in my ears when I woke up the next morning. 

D: Ouch, watch out with that son, you could damage your ears!

B: Yeah I won't do that anymore, trust me. So yeah, finally we decided to head home and we had to stand in line for half an hour first to get Joe's backpack because everyone else was trying to leave at the same time. It was hilarious though because Joe was hammered and thought he was rubbing his dick on the girl in front of him, only for him to figure out it's a dude when he turned around and gave him a nasty look, so Dave had to laugh so hard he spat his beer out on the guy in front of him, who then tried to start a fight with Dave until John who's a fitness freak stepped in and the guy backed off. You should've seen his face! Well anyway, we headed off to go back to campus on foot, which is like two hours almost and decided to go through the park where Dave saw this homeless dude sleeping on a bench, so he decided to wake him up by pissing on him and the guy ran away screaming. 

B: Jesus, that Dave kid sounds like a dick...

D: Well, he's having a hard time lately, he fucked up his finals and he's afraid of telling his dad who thinks everything is fine.

But anyway, then all of a sudden Joe remembers he had a bottle of Bacardi stashed in his backpack, so he gets it out and John is like dude why the fuck didn't you tell us earlier, so we sit down in the park and start doing shots straight from the bottle. Well this is where my memory goes black, but the next thing I really remember is Dave betting John five dollars that he can't ninja-kick through the broken window of a bus stop so John runs up to this bus stop and kicks and the glass shatters and John falls on the ground, so he freaks out because he realizes he has glass in him. So we walk away with John dripping on the pavement and try to get some of the glass out, but then we hear the sirens so we decide to make a run for it, including John who didn't feel any pain thanks to the alcohol. 

D: Well, I'm glad you know you can be honest to me son. I don't blame you, I was once young too, but try not to drink so much next time alright? It's good to see you making connections though, it's very important in life and I was getting worried you were just sitting alone playing video games every night...

B: Yeah well, about that, Dave is the son of this rich state senator whose brother runs a small hedge fund and Dave says he can probably convince his uncle to set me up with an internship there, so I'm glad I met these guys, you were right dad, joining the fraternity was a great decision.

D: Yeah frankly, everyone does stuff like this when young, but you know what? When you know things about people that they'd rather keep private, you'll find out that they will do great stuff for you by the time you're entering your forties. I hope you all learned from this night, just try to avoid getting in trouble with the law, because Dave's dad might be able to bail his son out of trouble, but you're on your own boy.

B: I know dad, don't worry.

D: Alright son, well, break's over, I'm gonna have to get back to work here, take care.

**Scenario 2:**

*D is calling his son, waits for him to pick up.*

D: Hey son, how you doin'?

B: Oh hey dad, I'm fine, thanks, how 'bout you?

D: Quite busy frankly, dealing with the logistics here of setting up a new project, but eh, I won't bore you with that. How was your weekend?

B: Oh it was great dad! I've gotten sick of these frat bro's around me having fun at other people's expense, so some time ago I decided to chat up Steve, this lonely weird kid in class with the pentagram and the ponytail and I've been hanging out with him lately. We went to the forest because he claims he saw a lot of Psilocybe mushrooms growing there behind some trees, so we went there and we gathered them.

Then we started walking and noticed there were no people, so we started eating the mushrooms and began to giggle, I was kind of embarrassed, because we did see one guy who walked past us and I think he thought we were giggling at him, but he said hi and walked on so I guess it's alright. We walked past some powerlines and I couldn't help but feel as if they felt demonic for reasons I didn't yet fully understand. Anyway, we continued walking and I didn't really notice much, until the colors began to change. 

That's when it got really nice and I started seeing hallucinations. It was not frightening at all, but rather felt as if every neuron in my brain performed a special show to introduce himself and proudly demonstrate his role within the greater collective. I looked around and saw that the flowers in the field looked like the eyes of cats and the trees seemed to breathe. It felt as if we were on a boat docking in the harbor and the entire natural world consisted of people standing on the shore and happy to finally welcome us home. We went down the valley where nobody ever comes to drink from the stream to quench our thirst. 

We stumbled upon a large oak tree that looked inviting and decided to sit in the shadow. When we sat down we finished the last mushrooms we had left and started talking and thinking. My friend argued to me that most of the material universe actually consists of empty space and that our perception of objects and color is actually a subjective interpretation. This led me to wonder whether the entire material universe is actually contained within a complex yet elegant mathematical formula. As I thought about this my friend started giggling again. I asked him what's up and he told me that he no longer fears death because he became convinced there is just a single global consciousness experiencing itself by exploring differing alternate possible outcomes.

As I started to relax while sitting against the tree I felt as if the spirit of the forest contained in the mycelium beneath my feet wanted to communicate with me, although it might just have been a different aspect of my own subconsciousness. She explained to me that ever since the invention of agriculture my species has been in a diseased state and that civilized life is a tragic accident that is traumatizing for our minds that evolved to pursue a maximal state of individual autonomy. The forest spirit told me that the Earth is now undergoing a cleansing and that all her children should migrate to the north.

As we realized that it was getting late we decided to walk back in the direction we came from. We saw the sun set and sat down in the field to watch the fireflies dance in the dark. This is when the effects began to wear off and we decided it was time to go back home. I now feel more at peace and no longer want to kill myself. I also decided to start eating healthier. Dad... dad? Why are you crying?

D: Son, I'm not paying 20,000 dollar a year in tuition for you to get high and hang out with drug addicted losers! You come home now, right away! What am I going to tell your mother? What do you think our family friends would say if we told them our son is on drugs? Why are you doing this to me? How are you going to get an internship if your urine tests positive for drugs? Have you ever thought about any of that?

Where did I go wrong as a father? I thought I always did everything right for you! How could you betray my trust like that? Why would you do that?"

This fall I will be a CS freshman. I have some background in programming, but no projects just algorithm experience (C++) and recently I began to learn OOP in Java. I was wondering what should I do my freshman year and before in order to 1) secure an internship and 2) make some extra money during the year. What do companies look for? I bet that some basic programming skills are no use to any (big) company and that if I want to make some extra buck during school I should do some projects from scratch to finish. What do you recommend I do? Also how do you think I should take advantage of the college environment (professors, student orgs, frat)? Thank you!"

[Hi, I am a student in a coding bootcamp in the SF bay area.  What kind of development technologies did you use to build this?  Java? Javascript? Ruby on Rails? Python? C++? etc..](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20tw05/my_crowdfunding_campaign_went_viral_was_funded/cg6o5zr?context=5)|It's an Android app, so most of it is written in Java. The core algorithms that power our disambiguation need to be fast and portable to other platforms, so we wrote them in straight C99. -- Xavier.
[What have you implemented which you were initially really against?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20tw05/my_crowdfunding_campaign_went_viral_was_funded/cg6o7u4?context=5)|Our original beta testers (who supported us on Indiegogo) got to experience the first ever version of the keyboard with no full-sized keyboard mode. We resisted the concept of having a full-sized keyboard because we were worried it would detract from the concept of the smaller keyboard.
[How does the language model algorithm differ for US English and the yet to implemented UK English?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20tw05/my_crowdfunding_campaign_went_viral_was_funded/cg6o7u4?context=5)|Since announcing Minuum 2.0 last week, we've heard even more requests from people who actually want to use Minuum for its full keyboard mode, because they only occasionally need to switch to the smaller version. While this initially seemed quite strange to us, we ended up building in a bunch of new full-keyboard-specific customizable settings for the 2.1 release this morning.
 |We've come around to accepting people's desire for a full keyboard once in a while; I feel that giving people access to the full keyboard through a quick gesture shortcut might actually help to reinforce the direct visual+functional connection between the full/compact modes. That's why the little keyboard works, after all - because it's so similar to the big one!
 |The algorithm doesn't change there; it's all about getting the right dataset to build the language models from. We've built our current English language model as a hybrid between the two (US and UK) until we obtain enough UK-specific data to build a separate module.
 |We've been thinking of our bottom panel as a means of providing additional benefit to people who don't care enough about their screen space, and would rather us provide additional functionality instead. We're actually curious about the literary implications of having Emoji characters always present; i.e. how does the structure of the input method inform how people choose to communicate?
 |What do you find so horrid about the panel, and what would you prefer? An emoji mode that can be selected analogous to the switch to numbers mode?
 |Will.
[To whit, have you considered a feature which aggregated screen take and the corrected word to get some gainful form of average data about the word they were intending to type? Of might then also build up a database of contextually frequent words and refine the guess algorithm.  If you detect a used preferring the Canadian/UK spellings, could you weight the autocorrect to the S variants until the proper dictionary?  I must congratulate the team for simple but powerful gestures like the double press for switching between one-line and full keyboards. The odd occasion I'm using another keyboard or device, it frustrates me when it doesn't do anything.  Also, the mistype detection (and on the fly correction for full mode\) are great. I just wish there was an expandable smiley panel which you could add your own to!  Could a full character map style panel be added from the Shift button menu or something?  Finally, a more general AMA question - have you had any expressions of interest from OEMs or other companies about acquisition or exclusive licensing of the IP yet? ;-\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20tw05/my_crowdfunding_campaign_went_viral_was_funded/cg6r48u?context=5)|Re: US vs. Canadian/UK spellings, a process of detection + weighting as you describe would certainly help to refine your language model much more rapidly, but we first need to get enough data about the differences between the dialects so that we can perform that detection properly.  We've considered letting the smiley panel serve as something closer to a ""character map"" style panel, with customizable symbols; but the hard part is figuring out how to limit what set of symbols you get so that it doesn't take too long to find what you're looking for.
[Don't know if you remember me but I was in /r/android suggesting things for the keyboard. You guys are freaking awesome.  The autocorrect turns off when the  keyboard goes down. Any way for that to stay on? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20tw05/my_crowdfunding_campaign_went_viral_was_funded/cg6z2f7?context=5)|This should have been fixed in the version 2.1 update today - what version are you using? -Will.
[Just downloaded the app again (had purchased a while back\) so the 2.1 update. This is the full keyboard btw...and when i mean down, i mean goes away. Not the small keyboard. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20tw05/my_crowdfunding_campaign_went_viral_was_funded/cg6zas2?context=5)|Good catch! That was a last minute bug introduced yesterday, we'll put out a fix shortly. -Will.
[Hey, happy birthday! I'm curious, have you any plans on implementing minuum on the Moto 360? I don't even know if it's worth it but it would be interesting to type qwerty on a circle display. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20tw05/my_crowdfunding_campaign_went_viral_was_funded/cg6o1i3?context=5)|Definitely! We're signed up already :)
 |The best thing about being a one-line keyboard is that you can curve more nicely than a full keyboard can. Alternatively, because we're so thin, we could nicely fit along the center of the circle display and have room for content both above and below the keyboard.
 |One of our ideas for a rounded watch display, depending on the hardware, would be to actually rotate the bezel from left to right to choose letters (so no touchscreen required). Kind of like the interface on the Nest... which we'd also love to type on.
 |Will.
[Like this? Link to mattlisac.com.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20tw05/my_crowdfunding_campaign_went_viral_was_funded/cg6p99f?context=5)|Precisely :)
 |[Edit: well, except for the whole knob-in-the-middle part]
 |Will.
[Can you describe your method of marketing while your Indiegogo campaign was live?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20tw05/my_crowdfunding_campaign_went_viral_was_funded/cg6nu62?context=5)|In the end, it was quite simple: we emailed a couple of tech journalists, and [TechCrunch](http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/18/minuum-turns-to-indiegogo-to-fund-a-new-mobile-software-keyboard-for-smartphones-and-beyond/) wrote an article about us within 3 hours of launching - from there, the internet exploded with media coverage, and the single biggest contributor to our million YouTube views was someone's [Reddit post of our video](http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/1akas9/), which hit the front page.
 |My opinion is generally that our success was entirely dependent upon the shareability of that [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=niV2KCkKmRw).
 |It's actually quite funny how we had a detailed plan for the whole month of the crowdfunding campaign, which we never ended up following - we heard that it was important to hit 20% of your funding goal within the first two days, so we had carefully prepared emails ready to send to everyone we knew. We also had a long list of events that we planned to attend to promote Minuum in. In the end, we never had a chance to do any of this because we were inundated with media inquiries for the next few weeks.
 |Will.
[I've been using your keyboard since being accepted into the beta. There was a rough patch where the keyboard would crash fairly often on my phone, so I had to use a different keyboard for a while. You guys fixed that issue though and I'm back to using Minuum full time.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20tw05/my_crowdfunding_campaign_went_viral_was_funded/cg6opzs?context=5)|Another thing that we struggle with is different applications' implementations of the API that connects them with keyboards. If people just use the standard Android text fields they're fine, but a number of applications customize things and then don't implement the APIs correctly. We have our own workarounds for a number of popular applications that all fail in subtle ways. For instance, one application has strange behaviour if we ever empty its text-field, so we have to make sure to always temporarily introduce extra characters before correcting the text. -- Xavier.
[What are you going to do with your millions once a large tech company buys you out?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20tw05/my_crowdfunding_campaign_went_viral_was_funded/cg6o6fl?context=5)|[Link to imgur.com](http://imgur.com/puQBp)
[Which are your future projects? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20tw05/my_crowdfunding_campaign_went_viral_was_funded/cg6nvle?context=5)|Aside from our Android app, we're planning to focus a lot on [smart watches](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lA6ey1SzHdM), and are talking to a bunch of manufacturers about getting Minuum in on their devices.
 |Smart TVs / game consoles are also in [dire need](http://minuum.com/who-forgot-the-smart-tv/) of better typing solutions, and I especially like that any motion-sensing device could be used to fix that typing experience (e.g. a [wiimote](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxQoXajSCi4), [Myo](https://www.thalmic.com/en/myo/), [Ring](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1761670738/ring-shortcut-everything), your phone, etc.).
 |I'm mostly passionate about the smart watch case because we really feel like we're unlocking so much more functionality in the device by letting you type there.
 |Will.
[Congratulations guys, do you have in mind adding a short way to add new words to personal dictionary?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20tw05/my_crowdfunding_campaign_went_viral_was_funded/cg6o2mo?context=5)|Hey tabrizz,
 |Right now if you precisely enter a new word, either by long-pressing to access the precise selection popups, or by switching to the 2d keyboard (long-press with 2 fingers), that word is learned, and will be in your personal dictionary. -- Xavier.
[Happy birthday!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20tw05/my_crowdfunding_campaign_went_viral_was_funded/cg6u9es?context=5)|We have not yet talked to Valve, but if you have a connection there let us know.
[I don't know if you're still here but I have a couple questions that cover two areas: Minuum itself and entrepreneurship.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20tw05/my_crowdfunding_campaign_went_viral_was_funded/cg6u9es?context=5)|Split Minuum for tablets has been put on the back-burner because so many more people use phones, but that's definitely intended to be a core part of Minuum's design there.
[Have you talked to valve to bring Minuum to the steam machines? The steam controller seems to be specifically made for a circular Minuum keyboard (eg 1 pad for the letters and the other pad for cursor control/other functions\).](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20tw05/my_crowdfunding_campaign_went_viral_was_funded/cg6u9es?context=5)|Most of the machine learning that Minuum does occurs outside of the phone, when we're building language models that encapsulate the structure of an entire language (really, the work that we do is closer to natural language processing). If you want to learn more about machine learning, you might want to start with this online course: [Link to www.coursera.org](https://www.coursera.org/course/ml)
[When can we have a split keyboard (probably even 2 arcs\) for tablets?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20tw05/my_crowdfunding_campaign_went_viral_was_funded/cg6u9es?context=5)|There is no perfect approach to Play Store pricing - our price is mostly determined by the standard rates that other keyboards charge - we've considered choosing radically different prices, but in the end $3.99 for a keyboard seems like a good in-between kind of price for something that will be so thoroughly used if you choose to adopt it as your primary method of input.
[How much machine learning is build into Minuum? Where can I learn about machine learning (books/online courses/..\)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20tw05/my_crowdfunding_campaign_went_viral_was_funded/cg6u9es?context=5)|Will.
[How did you figure out what the optimal price on the play store?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20tw05/my_crowdfunding_campaign_went_viral_was_funded/cg6u9es?context=5)|For the ML and stats that power Minuum specifically: we wrote [a blog post](http://minuum.com/model-your-users-algorithms-behind-the-minuum-keyboard/) outlining some of the details. -- Xavier.
[I watched your video form androidpolice and I was curious as to why all ""viral"" videos have the same up-beat music and editting style.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20tw05/my_crowdfunding_campaign_went_viral_was_funded/cg6o021?context=5)|We made that video entirely ourselves (I've done a bit of video work in the past), and I actually spent about four months starting-and-stopping on making the video, because we kept writing scripts and I kept not liking them. Finally, this one emerged and just felt right - the tone clearly is a bit over-the-top, but it made the video more fun. We actually ""borrowed"" a bunch of high-end cameras from a computer vision research lab at the University of Toronto (which Xavier was part of at the time), and captured all of the footage around campus - the total budget for the video was under $100 (mostly spent on buying the vintage typewriter).
[Is there a company you go to that specializes in these kinds of videos, or is it a multitude of companies that emulate the style because it works?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20tw05/my_crowdfunding_campaign_went_viral_was_funded/cg6o021?context=5)|Setting up the video to be slightly made fun of actually turned out to be one of the major contributors to its success, at least on Reddit. The most rewarding part was having all of the complaints be about the video's tone, and not about the technical content :)
[How long does a video like that take to create, and how expensive is it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20tw05/my_crowdfunding_campaign_went_viral_was_funded/cg6o021?context=5)|Will.
[I really loved Minuum when I tried it, the only problem is, and that is why I don't leave SwiftKey is the simultaneous multiple languages. Is there a plan to support this feature on future releases? Like using the dictionary for 2 or more languages at the same time, not having to switch?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20tw05/my_crowdfunding_campaign_went_viral_was_funded/cg6ptwq?context=5)|That's a difficult problem, but one that we hope we can address (some of us write in multiple languages, too). It will also be a bit more difficult for Minuum because it's already expecting such imprecise typing... So no promises, but we're as eager for this functionality as you are! -Will.
[I understand the difficulties. Perhaps it's easier to not support two languages at the same time, but allow for faster switching than it is now.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20tw05/my_crowdfunding_campaign_went_viral_was_funded/cg6uhna?context=5)|Have you tried our Turbo mode? (It's experimental, and only works on some devices) Go to Settings-&gt;Experimental and advanced-&gt;Turbo Mode to enable faster language switching. -Will.
[Is there a particular reason why it takes so long to give support for other languages? I really like the idea but i really need to have it in Dutch before i can use it. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20tw05/my_crowdfunding_campaign_went_viral_was_funded/cg6pazl?context=5)|We took a step back to focus on improving our original language models before moving on to the next set - we're aware that Dutch is one of our most highly requested languages, and we'll be building support as soon as we get enough Dutch language put together. I also can't wait to let you use it! -Will.
[Will you ever bring back the quick "":\)"" key that was located above the ""k"" I  believe?  That was one of my most used quick keys and I was sad to see when it was gone.  I love everything about your keyboard though, keep up the good work!!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20tw05/my_crowdfunding_campaign_went_viral_was_funded/cg6o2b1?context=5)|You know, that key was originally always a placeholder, we meant to replace it with access to different functionality, as we have now. However, since then, we've all come to miss the little guy :(, and we've had a number of people tell us that they loved fast-access to their smiley too :), so we're looking to put it back in. -- Xavier.
[Really? Sorry like I said I drop in and out of keyboards as I feel like I can't fully commit to one just yet!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20tw05/my_crowdfunding_campaign_went_viral_was_funded/cg6xbcq?context=5)|Emoji bar height sizing is something we don't have yet, but I'll think about. We already do have an option to important words from the stock Google Keyboard, but unfortunately other third-party keyboards tend to be a bit more closed about their data storage.
[Is or will it ever be possible to import say dictionaries or common words from other keyboards? Although I assume that this may be something that might not be possible due to the way each dev stores this data? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20tw05/my_crowdfunding_campaign_went_viral_was_funded/cg6xbcq?context=5)|Will.
[Minuum represents one of many solutions to the above problem. What advantages does Minuum have that generates staying power in the market place as Minuum alternatives (Voice, Retina, Large Keyboard 2.0\) make steady improvements?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20tw05/my_crowdfunding_campaign_went_viral_was_funded/cg6ofd0?context=5)|Other communication alternatives (like voice typing) are certainly a very natural way to use technology - but they just aren't practical in every situation. Voice typing breaks down in social/professional circumstances where you don't want to speak everything out loud to your device, or when you're simply in a noisy environment. We're a big fan of voice typing, and we've made sure to integrate it into Minuum for Android as a gesture shortcut; I see Minuum as complementary there, not a replacement.  The real staying power behind Minuum is its extensibility to any imaginable input dimension; with only one dimension of input required, Minuum is less constrained (which is useful both to the manufacturer of a device, and to the user of a device). Whatever the future holds, Minuum will have a way to type there.
[I use Minuum as my primary keyboard.  You've successfully implemented a brilliant idea.  What's next on the Minuum roadmap?  New ideas?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20tw05/my_crowdfunding_campaign_went_viral_was_funded/cg6ofgf?context=5)|Our major direction now is smart watches. Letting people type on wearable devices makes communication that much more immediate, and we're excited about unlocking the potential that watches have to become standard devices.
 |Within the Android app, we've been playing around with an interesting new direction - we're exploring how the keyboard can be more than just a keyboard, especially because we have this extra screen space to work with. We just added in an optional dictionary/thesaurus-lookup bonus panel, and are curious to see what more we can do to provide useful tools/content/functionality when you're typing... We're always open to hearing more ideas on this front, let us know if you have any thoughts on the matter!
 |Will.
[Hey there, thanks for taking the time out of your day to answer some absurd questions from the Internet. I was an Indiegogo supporter, and continue to be an active user of the keyboard today. It's an awesome product, and I look forward to seeing what you make of it moving forward. Speaking of that..  What potential implementation of the minuum technology most excites you? We've seen demo videos of input using all sorts of creative methods (Wii remote dial-style, pointing at a screen\), but which ones are you guys looking forward to the most?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20tw05/my_crowdfunding_campaign_went_viral_was_funded/cg6o9ph?context=5)|While I think that typing on smart watches will have the most potential to make a big difference in the world of mobile computing devices, I'm personally most excited by the concept of having a small-as-possible finger-worn device (i.e., a ring) that uses motion-sensing technology to let you interact with anything in your life (be it your computer, TV, car, public information displays, other people's devices, etc.).
 |I'm also excited by the concept of enabling many different useful types of input devices, which can be ultra-personalized to each user - perhaps one person prefers a ring, while another prefers a watch, and another a crazy fabric-based piece of smart clothing.
[Congrats, great to hear success stories like yours.  Besides reddit, where else did you raise awareness of your Indiegogo campaign?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20tw05/my_crowdfunding_campaign_went_viral_was_funded/cg6noqo?context=5)|We actually never even considered using Reddit to promote the Indiegogo campaign - that just happened naturally, apparently. As I mentioned in a post above, all that we did was seed a wave of media attention by contacting a few tech journalists (we did also put out a press release, but that proved less effective than a small handful of the direct emails that we sent).
 |Will.
[Is there any ETA on support for Russian language?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20tw05/my_crowdfunding_campaign_went_viral_was_funded/cg6o3uy?context=5)|We're working with some Russian datasets now, we'll see how it goes. :) -Will.
[I love the keyboard, but one thing I would love to see is swype texting when the keyboard is full sized. Any chance of seeing that in the near future? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20tw05/my_crowdfunding_campaign_went_viral_was_funded/cg6seuj?context=5)|We're not focusing on that kind of gesture typing at the moment, but it's not out of the question. Tapping with two fingers is distinctly faster than swiping with one hand, and we're really want to focus on perfecting the interaction with the one-dimensional keyboard before moving on to retrofitting other typing methods.
 |If we can get gesture typing working well on the one-dimensional keyboard, we'll ramp up our development of building custom gesture typing on the full keyboard as well.
 |Will.
[Just saw the video--be honest, did you dub it after you recorded the video?  lol...audio is sometimes the hardest part of starting out filmmakers/videographers.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20tw05/my_crowdfunding_campaign_went_viral_was_funded/cg6wdgm?context=5)|:) That audio was remixed at about 4am the night before launching the video, leading to some poor mixing levels and some last-minute dubbing of a few words - we fixed all this, though, 24 hours later (after hundreds of thousands of views and much complaining from redditors) - hence our updated Youtube video at [Link to www.youtube.com](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=niV2KCkKmRw)
 |Will.
[Wow, that sounds GREAT if you could implement that!  Also, when you do this, will you then be able to store our typing habits/dictionary in the cloud, so when we get new phone, we can sync right back up with no worries about lost local files (dictionary, etc.\) backups on our phone?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20tw05/my_crowdfunding_campaign_went_viral_was_funded/cg6xvsi?context=5)|Cloud sync would be a separate feature, but yes, it's something we're hoping to work on soon. For now you can always export and re-import your data to your downloads folder in case you have to migrate to a new phone (just go to Settings-&gt;User Data). -Will.
[Using the trial now and quite like it after the last few days.  Do you have any plans for automatic spacing? Also the other difficulty I experience with your keyboard is typing things like passwords and URLs or any irregular word. I may purchase! ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20tw05/my_crowdfunding_campaign_went_viral_was_funded/cg6oitc?context=5)|Automatic spacing is a more distant feature; we have more impactful auto-correction/prediction features that we'll be working on first.
 |The keyboard is currently to automatically switch to a full-sized keyboard for password/URL entry, to make that simpler - in general, temporarily switching to the full keyboard (by long-pressing with two fingers) can help when typing irregular words (and will still learn the words so that you can type them fast with the little keyboard next time).
 |Also, any time you type precisely by long-pressing on the little keyboard and using the magnified view to confirm each letter, the word won't be autocorrected (and will be learned for next time).
 |Will.
[I really like the idea, and I supported the IndieGoGo campaign, but I have found that I just type faster with more traditional keyboards. What are your plans for the future?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20tw05/my_crowdfunding_campaign_went_viral_was_funded/cg6o29t?context=5)|We do find that some people encounter a few hurdles when first using the keyboard, especially if they never manage to fully get into the mindset of imagining that they're typing on a normal keyboard and just letting the disambiguation do its work. Have you tried Minuum recently? A few months ago we shifted to putting the space bar on by default, which has helped many people type faster much sooner.
 |I also accept that some people may never be fully convinced by the desire to save screen space on their smartphones, which is why our future plans lead more towards Minuum for smart watches: [Link to www.youtube.com](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lA6ey1SzHdM)

[As an Israeli user are there any plans to implement Hebrew?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20tw05/my_crowdfunding_campaign_went_viral_was_funded/cg6qe76?context=5)|We have some more research to do fully understand what is involved with supporting Hebrew, but we have some data available to us and so may get this supported in the near future. Keep your fingers crossed!
 |Will.
[Why did you decide to go with indiegogo rather than kickstarter? I feel like kickstarter was more widely known...](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20tw05/my_crowdfunding_campaign_went_viral_was_funded/cg6pnf5?context=5)|Two reasons: 1) At the time, Kickstarter was not available in Canada (we're Canadian) 2) Kickstarter has very specific rules about software - we wouldn't have been allowed to post the project on Kickstarter unless we went completely open source (which is not out of the question, by the way - just not something we'll be doing in the near-term)
[(Funded you anyway on indiegogo\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20tw05/my_crowdfunding_campaign_went_viral_was_funded/cg6pnf5?context=5)|Will.
[I have Minuum as my second keyboard (after Swype\) and I must say the prediction is quite remarkable. That said I find it's weakness to be adding new words.  I switch to the full-sized keyboard to do this.  Might there be an option for displaying the literal input you're making and then you can tap to add it to the sentence and dictionary?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20tw05/my_crowdfunding_campaign_went_viral_was_funded/cg6vehr?context=5)|All new words typed in the full or small keyboard are learned automatically. You can ensure that a new word typed with the little keyboard remains unchanged: just confirm each letter by pressing and holding until you see the magnified view appear, and auto-correction won't kick in.
 |Will.
[Howdy!  I like the keyboard quite a bit for how much screen space I get back.  I've also been liking the incremental improvements in word guessing.  Secondary question -- Anyone been playing around with Pebble (/r/Pebble\) and the accelerometer?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20tw05/my_crowdfunding_campaign_went_viral_was_funded/cg6oe28?context=5)|1) That was an issue on a much older version of the keyboard - have you updated to version 2.1? Double-spacing for punctuation should be right as rain these days.  2) We've played with Pebble (and chatted with its creator, Eric), and the accelerometer is useful for typing onto a separate display (e.g. a TV), but unfortunately not really useful for typing onto the watch itself, because the watch screen moves while you wave it around. If anyone wants to try building/testing something like this for themselves, you might be able to whip something up with our SDK - just email us at developers@minuum.com for access.
[Hey man, do you know when Minuum will support Danish? I've been waiting so long, hoping it would be available in the beta (I donated money for the crowdfunding\). I tried it out with English, and it works amazingly well, but I'd love to see it for my native language one day. Take care!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20tw05/my_crowdfunding_campaign_went_viral_was_funded/cg6p6uy?context=5)|Thanks for the support! As I've mentioned above, Danish is a bit farther out that some other languages that have come up here, but we'll get to it eventually (hopefully over the course of the next few months).
 |Will.
[Ergonomic question for you: I find the bottom edge of the phone to be fairly hard to reach compared to other parts of the screen. Is there a user interaction argument for putting a keyboard at the bottom (vs along the side, top or floating\) or is it just aesthetics?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20tw05/my_crowdfunding_campaign_went_viral_was_funded/cg6pc5q?context=5)|It's all about letting you see as much screen as possible when your fingers are pressing on the keyboard - so mostly aesthetic, but I consider this to be somewhat functional as well. If you're able to hold your phone low enough (depends on the phone model), it doesn't have to be any less ergonomic. I used to think that functionality to allow Minuum to be resizable and float around on the screen was its most important feature - I think that's still useful, but not quite as dramatically useful on a smaller phone as on tablet, and we haven't very many requests for this, so haven't prioritized it. (We've had this mostly built for a while now, it's just a matter of squeezing out some major bugs that we haven't had time for.)
[Will we see a dedicated numbers bar on future updates? Or an option to increase, decrease long press special character key duration?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20tw05/my_crowdfunding_campaign_went_viral_was_funded/cg6oxdz?context=5)|Are you specifically wondering if a numbers bar could be added as a bonus panel, à la our Emoji support? Because that's certainly a possibility, though we're trying to figure out how to build out our bonus panels while minimizing feature creep.
[What are the odds of getting more granular control over the gesture settings?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20tw05/my_crowdfunding_campaign_went_viral_was_funded/cg6pbwn?context=5)|What device are you using? We're currently working on tuning these gestures, and I'd love to know which devices have it worst at the moment.
[Are there any plans to have ""shortcuts""? Like being able to define a mnemonic that gets replaced with a longer word? So if I type ""#pm"" it get's replaced with my email address, eg.?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20tw05/my_crowdfunding_campaign_went_viral_was_funded/cg6un31?context=5)|No fixed plans yet, but I like the idea.
 |Will.
[He plans to predict several words without typing space?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20tw05/my_crowdfunding_campaign_went_viral_was_funded/cg6pt9k?context=5)|Yes! Not sure when exactly but we definitely want to add this. -- Xavier.
[Hi, I'm a first-year student from the University of Waterloo, studying Computer Science. I have a big passion for technology and entrepreneurship, but have been struggling to get a summer co-op job.

[Any plans on Korean support? If so, are you hiring?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20tw05/my_crowdfunding_campaign_went_viral_was_funded/cg6otb9?context=5)|We're considering it! Give us a shout at hiring@whirlscape.com.
[long press time is crucial to me](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20tw05/my_crowdfunding_campaign_went_viral_was_funded/cg6re1q?context=5)|On the big keyboard, are you referring to the time it takes for long-pressing on a key to make the view appear, or for the actual jump to the secondary character to appear?
[While typing a word I delete a letter and continue to finish it, and than put comma or period, the trailing space is not added!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20tw05/my_crowdfunding_campaign_went_viral_was_funded/cg6re1q?context=5)|We designed that action to work fastest with a slide-up instead of a long-press gesture, so the view appears immediately in case you want to immediately slide up to choose the punctuation mark; long-pressing is more of an option to help transition new users into the slide-up feature. Do you prefer to long-press, or were you unaware of the slide-up functionality? We could fairly easily make this delay configurable, if that's really important to you...
 |That's an interesting edge case about punctuation typing that you've pointed out, we're looking into fixing it now :)
 |We're currently investigating support Russian, at which point we'll very naturally have a Cyrillic layout available. Do you type in Russian, or a different Slavic language?
 |Will.
[Hey guys big fan and beta user here...since getting a Samsung GS4 recently I have found that minuum is SUPER sensitive to touches (especially in Google hangouts\), I imagine due to the S4 AirGesture feature, but its so sensitive that it gets really confused by fast typing, I have to consciously slow down so it doesn't jumble words... have you seen this and/or are you working on it ?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20tw05/my_crowdfunding_campaign_went_viral_was_funded/cg6rwpz?context=5)|Hey upvizzle, we actually wrote a blog post about the gesture detection algorithms that can cause these kind of errors when fast typing: [Link to minuum.com](http://minuum.com/taps-and-swipes/)  We're in the process of recalibrating our algorithms to adapt to various devices, so we should be able to make fast typing work a bit more reliably for you. Thanks for letting us know that it can an issue on the GS4, I'll test that specifically!
[Why does it take so long to implement other languages?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20tw05/my_crowdfunding_campaign_went_viral_was_funded/cg6ohy1?context=5)|See earlier reply: ""Because Minuum relies on really good auto-correct to work our language models have to be fairly complex. So (as you probably guessed) it's not as simple as a list words and counts. As a result we need a big corpus of decent quality to generate a new language model. So far it's been challenging to find decent corpora for each new language. So that's really what limits us.""
[I'm so happy that despite my limited cash I could support a project this awesome (Oh and fellow Canadian here!\). I'm really proud to have the Minuum Indiegogo edition in the play store!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20tw05/my_crowdfunding_campaign_went_viral_was_funded/cg6q1ny?context=5)|We majorly improved on our handling of misspellings back in November when we revamped our algorithms to handle accidental inserted and omitted letters, though there is certainly more that we could do in this area. Have you used Minuum much since then? I'm not sure if we'll ever entirely be able to handle misspellings quite the same way a big-buttoned keyboard can.
[There is a Minuum subreddit, might you consider officially adopting it for soliciting feedback and interacting with users? Other users and fans could simultaneously offer support and tips to other users. BaconReader does this in a really good way. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20tw05/my_crowdfunding_campaign_went_viral_was_funded/cg6rf0q?context=5)|Perhaps, though it seems to have died out a few months back.

20udg5,3,2014-03-19,College student here. I don't know how to do this whole bridesmaid thing. Help.,[deleted],weddingplanning,https://www.reddit.com/r/weddingplanning/comments/20udg5/college_student_here_i_dont_know_how_to_do_this/,"I have a tight group of friends that I've been friends with since September of our freshman year. It's made up of myself, my heterosexual life partner/bff, and our other two friends (let's call them Girl and Boy) who have been dating since October of freshman year.

We're now juniors, but real life is fast approaching. Girl is graduating in May 2015, but the rest of us are graduating a semester early in December. We go to school on the east coast, but none of us are even from the same region of the US. And all of us (esp. BFF and I) really get around. This summer two of us are in our university town on the east coast, one has a job outside the US, and one of us has an internship on the west coast. And all of us are about to enter a somewhat dicey job market, which adds a lot of ambiguity to our futures post-December.

And now Boy and Girl are getting married in May, about two weeks after actual graduation.Obviously they're a bit young. Anyone that's friends with them on FB can see that they're engaged, and some people know that they're getting married in June. So I get a lot of, ""So, like are you good friends with her/him/them? Are they really getting married?""

My standard response is ""Yes, this is real. They're very serious and have a really solid relationship compared to friends in equally long relationships, and while I don't know if I would want to do it right away, it's their choice and it's really none of my business."" That generally doesn't really leave it open to questions. 

They know that we approve of their relationship, but just the whole getting married at 22 thing is sort of strange. I don't know why anyone who do this to themselves, since I'm busy enough trying to plan my career, much less a wedding. 

And this is a pretty legit wedding, by the way. I don't think it's going to be gaudy but her parents are fully on-board and it's probably going to be a solidly middle of the road affair. Girl is very girly/traditional. I have seen this girl in jeans 3-4 times in all of the time I've known her. She is not a barefoot on the beach in a tea length dress kind of person.


I'm kind of worried that Girl will be really really stressed by the time she actually gets married. To be honest, I think that school stress + wedding planning stress + rocky relationship with her mom + the fact that the wedding is in her hometown and her mom is the one on the ground (and paying) + her general girliness/hope for the big/perfect wedding + her general tendency to bottle up her feelings = major stress. She's not the angry brideszilla type, but I wouldn't describe her as the kind of person to ""go with the flow"" either. 

And frankly, I know nothing about being a (good) bridesmaid. What am I supposed to be doing here? What am I supposed to be paying for? I can't figure out what's expected and what's not, and it's not like I have any experience. I've been told that some brides pay for the dress, others don't. And now she's reminding us that the wedding shower is during winter break (six months before the wedding) so that people can make it. Am I expected to buy a plane ticket and spend the weekend there? Would I normally have to pay for a hotel as well?

We're college students so we're not exactly rolling in money, but most of us manage to travel quite a bit and fly back and forth from home/school quite a bit. Like I'm abroad right now and just came back from a multi-country spring break trip that cost about $700, and the four of us are also trying to figure out some sort of last hurrah that will probably be about $500. All of us are sort of in that place where you're still paying 40k tuition so a couple hundred dollars seems like a drop in the bucket, but the gravy train is going to stop very very soon.

Basically, I have no idea what I'm doing. Or how to do this."
20ugfb,5,2014-03-19,"Graduating in May, What do I do?",iJacksparrow,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/20ugfb/graduating_in_may_what_do_i_do/,"I am graduating in May of this year with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. I have no internships under my belt simply because I’ve had no time to do one, I have been enrolled in 18+ credit hours since I started the program (including summers.). I was in the military for 5 years, other than that I have no work experience. At my university we have used nothing but VB.net, Asp.net, along with html/CSS and some JavaScript, I have touched on C++ and Java in my own free time but other than that I have no idea about the two. After reviewing the requirements for Jobs and even entry level positions, I’ve come to the conclusion there is no way I will be hired without experience. So I guess this leads me to questions about internships. 

1)	Is it possible for someone graduating in a few months that knows little about C++ or Java to get an internship somewhere? 

2)	Will companies train interns in the language they use or will they not even consider someone if they lack said language?

3)	Are companies even looking for people that are recent graduates or are the positions reserved for freshmen-juniors? 

4)	Is a 3.3 GPA good enough to get an internship?

5)	I have applied to over 50 internships throughout the United States and even one in South Korea, How long does the application process take and what should I be prepared for?

6)	Do companies really only pick people that go to like Harvard, Yale, etc..? I go to a smaller private university.



Any feedback would be great, I am kind of in panic mode at this point. Reddit save me please. Thanks in advance.

I want to walk through a couple examples, can anyone point out my mistakes?

My first question is starting the node.js web frame work

    node server.js

So node calls server.js

server.js uses http and express

    var http = require('http'),
          express = require('express'),
          backend = require('/backend.js');

server.js create a server using http.createServer

    var app = express();
    app.use(app.router);
    app.use(express.static(__dirname + '/public'));
    var server = http.createServer(app).listen('4000', '127.....);

backend.js listens to server

    backend.listen(server);

Now here is the first question, who calls app.get('/')?

In server.js  
 
    app.get('/', function(req, res){
        res.sendfile(__dirname + 'main.html)
    });

In backend.js

    var socketio = require('socket.io');
    exports.listen = function(server){  
        var io = socketio.listen(server);
        io.socket.on('connection', function(socket){
            
        });
    }

No one seems to call app.get to get index.html?


My second question is  what is the difference between socket.io and express

1. From my understanding express seems to handle routing, and socket seems to handle the connection, but what if I want to handle both connection and routing at the same time? Say a user click on an html element that redirect to other page, how would maintain that connection


My third question is what is post, get and put, and how do you use them in the backend

From my understanding 

1. Post is when you want to hand information from frontend to backend, and it doesn't depend on what backend, you can have your html making post to twitter or google, or just simply your own server, 

but how would you actually do it ? for example if you want to make a search on google from one of your form, what would you do?

html

      &lt;form id= method=""POST"" action=""/search""&gt;
        &lt;input type=""text""&gt;&lt;/input&gt;
        &lt;input type=""submit"" value=""Submit""&gt;
      &lt;/form&gt;

server.js

    app.post('/test', function(req, res){

    });

how about redirecting pages? If you want to redirect pages to another html on click?

html

    &lt;input type=""button"" method=""POST"" action=""route""&gt;

backend 

    app.post('/route', function(req, res){
	res.sendfile(__dirname + '/views/test.html');
        res.render(__dirname + '/views/test.html');
	console.log(""you have being redirected"");
    });


2. How about get and put, what actions do they correspond to?

do you always need an associate action ="""" to communicate between backend and fronend?


I am pretty sure most of my understandings are incorrect, can someone clarify these concepts?"

I'm a university student who has done 4 internships (co-op) over course of my studies from sept 2011.
The 4 terms are so -

Jan 2012 to April (end) 2012 (ONT)

Sept (2012) to Dec (end) 2012 (ONT)

I have no Idea how to start. What forms to fill up What I can claim e.t.c

I know for a fact that my university tuition costs for the year is definitely more than what I earned as a co-op student. My term in Alberta the company paid for my housing and basically called it a taxable benefit. i.e. it my pay check was reduced by ~600$ bi-weekly. However this reduction is the total reduction and not the effective reduction from ""rent"".

Please Help me out, Letting me know where to start out.

20um2f,2,2014-03-19,Me [21F] with my BF[25 M] of 3 years; A question to those who have been with childish SOs,thrwawygf,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/20um2f/me_21f_with_my_bf25_m_of_3_years_a_question_to/,"Did you stay with your childish SO or did you ultimately leave them because they act too childish at times?

I have no idea what to do other than thinking I have to put a bullet into this relationship of mine.  What drives me nuts is that my BF is a man-child and when he acts like one, it instantly sends me into ""Why?!  Why do you look so angry?"".  Like he can't even figure out why after I had told him?  Here are reasons why I get instantly pissed at him, yet calm down after a couple of hours of not interacting with him (WARNING: Long body of text):

* Online, he likes to call me ""WUSSY"", ""PUSSY""*, and say things like ""I wanna r* u and s* u and tie u up"" (* meant that he thinks omitting the rest of the word won't upset me, when I already told him stupid S&amp;M talk annoys me and makes me think he has a problem).  He says this crap to me online, on the phone, AND EVEN IN PERSON.  Eventually, I got fed up and start mimicking him, with his response being ""NOOOoooOOoOoooO, you can't say that!  It's against nature's law."" and then I retaliate and say things like ""Well nature's law changes"", "" ""SMACK YO BALLS (or dick)"".  It's obvious he doesn't like it and responds in a childish manner, but he can't friggin' figure out why my face sours when he acts like this and says I ""always am moody whenever I visit"".  Every time I call him out on this shit, he always evades the questions and sometimes let out a ""TEEHEEHEHEEHEHEHE"".  And then when I get royally annoyed, he tries to physically nudge me and asks in a concerning manner like ""Why?  Is there something wrong?  Why are you angry?"".  IF I ALREADY TOLD YOU WHY, WHY DO YOU KEEP DOING IT?  His excuse is that things like ""Wussy"", ""Pussy"", and the last bit are just his way to letting off some steam for some unknown reason.  He also likes to say things like ""You're my property"" and wonders why we can't get married.

* He always dodges questions I ask him that are personal, like ""Why do you act like a goddamn kid?"" or ""How's your day?"" or ""What did you do today?"" and responds with ""NO!"".

* He already bailed out on my 21st birthday party at an upscale restaurant because he waited at the last minute to look at the menu and decided he can't pay for it.  Of course he could barely do so and my parents were treating, yet he said he wasn't gonna come and my parents and I were upset.  He claimed that being an outsider, he expects to pay his share even though it's clear he doesn't have to and then after the whole ordeal, he says I'm to blame for it because he wanted to go but I didn't beg/nag at him enough to do so.  My graduation ceremony is at 8 am on a Saturday, so if his reason was too much of an inconvenience like the birthday then I might as well not invite anyone to graduation, right?  Because I would really feel like breaking up then.

* He can carry a decent conversation with his buddies on Steam, but he can't with me because he only talks about games and nothing else.  He can be arsed to find out about gaming-related info, but he couldn't be arsed enough to go to Google and figure out how to write in APA style, know definitions to words like ""empirical"", or the basics of the layout of his car like oil changes, tire changes, windshield fluids, etc.  He always asks ME to search it for him when he could have bloody done it himself, and gets upset if I don't.  Hell, he never washed his car by hand.

* As far as the description of an independently functioning man goes, he fails probably half or more.  He's going through a teaching credential to teach HS kids, he used to tutor when he had time, he always paid his bills on time.  He likes to take the two of us out to boba milk teas, brick toast, food, or window shopping.  Beyond that, he's a helpless person in front of his mom.  His mom's over 60, really nice, but I wonder if she's fully aware how big of a child he is.  And she even mentions it like ""Ha!  That _____, he acts like a kid"", but to me it comes off as she KNOWS he's a grown-ass kid with his ""NnnnnOoooo!"".  Are there other 25 year old men who act like this in front of their mothers?  His prefrontal cortex should have fully developed on how to behave like an adult.  I never even called him by his first name anymore in 2 years because he thinks it's super weird and creepy, like calling me by my first name feels like incest.

* I used to lie to him about petty things, but I don't anymore yet it contributes to a severe problem.  The first time was that I lied to him about telling my close friends that we had sex for the first time and nothing else, because I realized it was super stupid and embarrassing at the time.  Another time was when he was bent on playing co-op games, so while he like FPS competition, I don't.  Yet, he bought a FPS competitive game and nagged me to play it and get better so we can play together.  I get the sentiment, but I thought he would just leave me alone since I made it clear I suck at shooters.  NOPE, fast forward 2 years later, I'm OK at competitive FPS depending on the conditions (and I got to playtest BF4 at EA).  Somewhere down the line, I lied about leveling up my character and another one down the line was when he has this habit of just buying games he thinks is good and I should play and finish it.  I lied about playing those games because I had 0 interest, but I sucked at lying so he found out and got upset.  Eventually, he established a ""Lie again, and it's over policy"" because white lies just don't fly in his world.  And then he's quick to say ""And don't lie just to make me happy"", YOU MOFO YOU WOULDN'T BE HAPPY EITHER WAY, so I just flat out told him game X is terrible and game Y is boring.  

* **EDIT**: Forgot one more thing, after so many arguments he pretty much established an ultimatum of ""You have to give your all into this relationship.  No 'working things out', no, it's all or nothing.  If you're not willing, then break up"" like he's saying that he thinks relationships should run smoothly with no maintenance whatsoever.  Any talks of counseling or mentioning that the relationship is going into a downturn and needs work = BREAK UP.

The first year he wasn't childish was when I was madly in love with him, like:

* He isn't stingy with money, so he'll be real nice about going out to eat and stuff.  He's willing to take me anywhere within reason for food and drinks.

* He's fun playing online with when he didn't have a stick in his ass about how to play FPS.  Now whether or not my intention was malicious in Saints Row 4 to drive a car straight into the ocean and jump out at the last second with him hanging is questionable...    When he did, and became incapable of understanding the UI of MMORPGs, I like to tell him to eat his words and figure it out because we went though dozens of free MMORPGs that UI layout shouldn't be rocket science.  He seemed upset that he can criticize my playing, but I can't criticize his lack of learning.

* Interacting with him was normal at the time when we went out on a few dates.

* When he was living near campus and away from home, he was normal and mature while living with a good friend of his.  His disposition at the time attracted me.  When he moved back home, it's like he mutated into a kid.

* He was sincere to the point where I had an weird expectation that I want to date someone with a GPA above 3.0, and he was hovering at a 2.5 but at the time I didn't care because he wasn't too stupid (yet...).

* He was supportive with my decisions to study for grad school or get an internship I wanted, even if it meant moving further away or out-of-state.  Maybe at the time my self-evaluation of myself was low because he was the only close person who believed in my abilities.

* His words at the time were very romantic and made me gush.  Now, he never compliments me and says he only say things like ""You're pretty today"" or ""cute"" or ""look nice"" when he means it (which is never).  Last year, he liked to make a point that I had love handles and was fat even though I weighed less than 120 lbs for 5'2"".

**TL;DR**: BF always say that he misses me and loves me more than I do (which is true because he started acting like a fucking kid).  So he might genuinely love me, but doesn't understand why I don't want to marry him is because he acts like a kid with the way he types, talk, and acts.  He's like a loving kid with some money his mama gives him for us to enjoy ourselves."

Wanted to get some advice from y'all about what to do about school. Right now I go to a liberal arts school in connecticut for computer science and I hate the education I'm getting. I really have a passion for automotive and I would like to do something with that but I'm afraid I wouldn't make enough money to really support myself or that I will hate it once I get into the industry. 

I found a school in Pennsylvania that offers a four year degree in Automotive. Two years is labs and classes about the cars and two is more about management stuff and more internship stuff. It sounds really cool to me to be given a $4000 tool set and have half my classes be about automotive stuff and cars and half labs but once again I'm afraid of a couple of things. Im afraid that once I leave with my four year degree I won't be able to make a whole lot of money if I start at a dealership or somewhere. Im also afraid that wherever I start I won't really be able to move up to anything more than like a service advisor. 

Does anyone have any advice or experience on what I should do? I really just don't know if I should stick with my computer science degree and go into a safer field where I think I could do better or go out and do what I love with the potential to be stuck living day by day or stuck doing the same thing?

20vfar,7,2014-03-19,I think I just broke up with my boyfriend?,gawddamnTA,TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/20vfar/i_think_i_just_broke_up_with_my_boyfriend/," We have been together for almost 6 years. It is an extremely long and complicated story. 

Long story short, I feel like I just cannot be with him. We are just not working out. I have known this for a while now, but I haven't found the right time to tell him and end it.

We got together when I was 19 and he was 22. We were both heavy, heavy drinkers for almost the entirety of the relationship.

Both of his parents passed away within 6 months of each other about 2 years ago. He turned heavily to drugs at this point. I tried to be understanding but he continued to lie to me about, time and time again. At one point, I did break up with him and he went to stay with his cousin (he has no where else to live).

The only thing was that we have been taking his nephew overnight every weekend, and I did not want to end my relationship with this little boy (he has had a very tumultuous life already). Basically, we agreed to still take him on the weekends. Those weekends turned into us getting back together. 

He completed an NA drug program, but continued to fuck up occasionally. To me, the worst part was that he was lying about doing heroin - JUST TELL ME. Anyways, it's basically continued like this for a while. We have discussed the importance of him seeking treatment, getting counseling, *anything* to help him alleviate what he is going through. I feel like I am carrying the weight of his problems around on my shoulders (and I have enough fucked up shit of my own to deal with). I have begged him to get help, and it's fallen on deaf ears. He has spent the last six months in bed. I beg him, telling him that he is either a) chronically, seriously ill, b) still doing drugs, or c) severally depressed. He denies it all!!! He hasn't gotten a job in the time period we had both expected; he just lays in bed all day. I am so sick of it all. 

We both quit drinking. He thought I didn't give him enough credit, which may have some merit, but that motherfucker still did not have a job (after 3 months) and was not bringing in any income to our living situation. I feel for him if he is going through some serious depression, but I just can't have it on my plate any longer. He is holding me down and I feel like I am drowning.

I have been spending a lot of time on the internet, looking at funny things on reddit, watching Veronica Mars, and seeking support for my sobriety. He does not like this and feels that I ignore him. I finally realized and expressed that I felt like I needed to seek solace from all of his problems.

He was being mean to me today about the fact that he did have two jobs last year and he felt that I was still ""a bitch"" (his words) to him then. I explained that I was unbelievably super busy that year dealing with a lot of stress of my own (full time internship with a crazzzyyy supervisor, full time grad program, part time waiting tables). I mentioned how we weren't together, and then we were, and how it was sort of his doing. He said, ""You know, no one is forcing you to date me."" and I was like, huhh.. and He said, ""You could just break up with me if you wanted to."" So I replied, ""okay."" He freaked out. And he left, he came back, he said and did all sorts of manipulative things (lots of crying, like making me look at him crying, ""You really just want me out of your life?! Are you just going to kick me out on the street like that?"" He promised to get counseling tomorrow - I told him that is great but to talk to me way later after the fact. I was firm in my decision and kept reminding him that he told me that no one was forcing me to date him).

As sort of an out, I told him that I really did love him once, and I would love to have him in my life non-romantically but I do not think it would be possible at this stage. I said he could stay here for one week while he looks for a place (this is probably a terrible idea but where else is this poor kid gunna go? ughakdgkf)

I'm just so surprised with what I put up with for so long. Now that I have written it down, I know the 100% truth - I need to leave him, for good. Idk, I need strength to get through this (and not fucking drink) and idk, has anyone else been in this situation? 

I don't want to hurt him but I need to worry about myself, first and foremost."

If you can actually be bothered to read this whole thing I promise I'll be very grateful!



I have been dating my boyfriend J for 2.5 years, and we have lived together for all but the first 9 months. Our relationship is very strong and loving, we’ve had some fights before but nothing major and neither of us have ever done anything to hurt the other. I am really happy with him, and I’m pretty sure I want to marry him one day. But lately he has been worrying about his career and I am afraid that the answers he’s coming up with are going to tear us apart.


I finished university just after I met J and at the moment I am establishing myself in a career that I really want. I have a pretty great job which I was really lucky to get into, but since it’s my first job in this industry I don’t have enough experience or skills to move into a similar or better job elsewhere. If I keep with what I’m doing I think everything will work really well for my career, but I definitely need to stay in this job for another few years, at least.


J hasn’t had such a straightforward life trajectory as me – when he was in his teens and a large part of his 20s he had lots of family and relationship troubles, he suffered from really bad depression and anxiety, and he never found a job that he could continue with long-term. He did a few short courses and had short-term jobs here and there doing mostly manual labour. When I met him he was in full-time work for the first time in quite a while, managing a pizza store. After a while he quit to go to uni, which was great at first while he was doing the adult-entry bridging course, but then he started a degree which wasn’t right for him which kind of wasted a semester, and then after that he found it difficult to get back into studying and failed his next semester. At the end of last year he went back to work full-time, managing the same pizza store at a different location, because we were struggling on just my income. He’s still at uni at the same time, currently studying part-time around his full-time work, but already he’s having troubles and has missed classes and tests.


Right now J is conflicted about what he wants to do. He doesn’t want to work in hospitality all his life. He wants to get his degree, but if he does it 1 subject at a time which is really the only way he could fit it around work, it would take him 12 years(!!) which at the age of 32 is definitely not ideal. If he was studying full-time it would be 4 years of us living on one income which isn’t sustainable, and if he has the same issues as last semester there’s no guarantee it would even be that short a time. Plus then there’s the issue of whether he’ll be able to get a job at the end of it.

J has been trying to find a solution to this and he has thought of two, but I don’t think either of them would work for us. The first one he thought of was last year, he wanted to do an internship in Costa Rica for a minimum of 6 months. That upset me because we live in Australia, so that’s way too far away for visiting on my salary, and he would be paying to do the internship and not earning money so he couldn’t visit me either. That option doesn’t end up with a job either. He has since scrapped that idea because he wants our relationship to be for the long-term and he knows it wouldn’t be good for the relationship.


His second solution, which he just thought of over the last few days, is to join the defense force. They have a program where they will pay you to go to university, and guarantee you a job at the end of it. However – it would involve moving him across the country for a minimum of four years, and then four more years of work wherever they chose to put him. The program sounds absolutely awesome – for him. For me however, not so much. I wouldn’t be able to keep my job if I moved with him, and it’s extremely unlikely that I’d be able to get another job in my industry. No matter what happened, it would be a big derailment or step back for my career. I also don’t want to move away from my family, who are all here – while he doesn’t have much family, I have a large and very close family who give both of us a lot of emotional support. I also don’t want us to be long distance for 4+ years. 


J can’t see any other option for him than what I’ve already listed. What I want is for him to think about what kind of job he would enjoy doing longer-term, which he can do here, and preferably which doesn’t rely on him studying because he finds it difficult. I want our relationship to work but I also want my career to work. That being said, I don’t want him to feel like I’m just shooting down all of his ideas.


I’m not sure what my question is, really. I guess I just need some advice on how I can help him work out his career, and whether I’m being reasonable. I have already suggested he see a careers counselor to help work out what kind of career he would be good at but he hasn’t made an appointment.

**tl;dr**: My boyfriend can't see a career for himself without doing something big like moving across the country, which would not work at all for my career. He can't work in hospitality all his life, and studying isn't really working for him. I think there are more options but don't know how to help him."

20vvdl,42,2014-03-20,You can't win.,[deleted],TalesFromRetail,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/20vvdl/you_cant_win/,"TFR, I need to vent.

It's been awhile since I've posted here. I've had stories, but my busy schedule with school and new gf have made it impossible to pump one of these out so people here likely do not remember me.

I work at an aftermarket autoparts chain that we're going to call ""Car Area"" or CA for short. I was promoted to commercial sales, which gives me a relief from the DIY counter (the retail side of things), but since my store is small and often short handed I work the two 50/50.

This was my day today working the DIY counter...

Chapter 1: The Rosie Perez-ening

Over the weekend I had a lower back injury. Lumbar strain and pinched sciatica. It sucks, but it's manageable with help of some pain meds. At the time there's only two people working the counter and, as per company policy, there must be at least one person manning the counter at all times. My coworker is a smoker; he takes his break every hour and a half or so. 

The dust settles from a rush and my coworker, who we'll call G, makes his escape for the door so he can puff one down before the next outbreak of the mindless DIY horde. 

I also take this opportunity to lean against the counter to help mitigate the strain my lower back is being put through on this 10 hour shift while no one is present in the store. Well, none other than our district manager rolls up in a company vehicle and scolds me like a child for leaning on the counter.

""Sorry, ma'am, but no one was in the store.""

[Rosie Perez accent] ""Maybe chu should do something productive.""[/Rosie Perez accent] (she seriously said this)

""uh, we just got done with a rush and I'm taking a break.""

[Rosie Perez accent] ""Isn't that whatchu get a lunch break for?"" [/Rosie Perez]

""... I didn't get one today and plus I have a lower back injury, want to see my pain med prescription?""

She leaves unimpressed with my response as usual. This even will likely reach my boss later on.

Chapter 2: Yes, I'M the asshole.

Our company has a fetish for free services and courtesies that the consumer sometimes like to take advantage of as if they're paying for it. It's certainly not my favorite thing to do, but it comes with the counter. One of these free services is ""Check engine light help."" 

What that entails is me plugging in an OBDII scanner, pulling a code, cross-referencing codes to possible causes, explaining to the customer what the light could mean and essentially telling them they should probably go to a technician to get a more definitive answer. Customers with a better grasp on DIY repair can sometimes and rather intuitively extrapolate from this data, but to the average person this is Moonspeak.

""You mean this service isn't the same as the diagnostic I would receive after paying a shop 1 hour of labor and a mark up for the cost of service?"" (~$100 depending on where you're from)

""Yes""

""oh..."" 

""Yeah...""

Anyway, like usual, a customer asks for this service in the middle of a gigantic rush of people. Again, only two people in the store, G and myself. I say it could be up to 10 or 15 minutes before we can get to him, but if he liked he could pull the vehicle up closer and I could pull the code quickly. He agrees and pulls it to the door.

I fight my way through the masses, scanner and notepad in hand. Open the customers groaning jalopy car door, turn the key in the ignition only I'm not met with the familiar sound of an engine that's on life support, but the loudest Mexican polka anyone has ever heard. It was so loud I practically shat flautas all over this mans beaded car seat. I try in vain to shut the music off, but he has a new fangled Stargate-esque aftermarket radio in his practically horse-drawn carriage of a vehicle. I tap the button a few times, but secede to just pulling the code, turning off the key and ending the madness. 

Lo and behold, his OBDII port has malfunctioned. I try as I may and I cannot get a connection. I struggle for a minute or so before giving up, a valiant effort I believe. I turn his key, hand them back to him and say, ""sorry, but your port isn't working. I can't read the light.""

C: ""Oh, well can you try again? I tried it this morning with mine and it worked."" (wut.. why are you here then?)

Me: ""Sorry, I tried everything I could.""

C: ""Do you have another one you could use? Maybe your machine is broken?""

Me: ""No, I don't.""

C: ""I see you just don't want to help me.""

I'm annoyed at this point, the horde is building inside and I've already spent too much time on this.

Me: ""That's not true, I've tried. I don't know what you expect, man.""

I start to walk away at this point.
 
C: ""You know, you're an asshole.""

Me: ""Excuse me?""

C: ""I want your name and your manager's number.""

Me: ""You can have that if you want, but I will not be talked to that way""

C: ""I don't know if you're having a bad day or what, but you should be more helpful and you hit my radio.""

Me: ""My day was going fine until you called me an asshole for attempting a service you're not even paying for, my name's _____ and all the numbers are on the door, complain all you want. And I didn't hit your radio, dunno how you got that from me tapping the button.""

Chapter 3: The Myth of Sisyphus

Another free service we offer is ""Starting and Charging system help."" Basically, we go out to the customers vehicle and hook a portable load tester up to the battery which can run a system of tests to check the proper amperage of the battery as well as the output of the alternator and starter. 

G went outside to perform such a service on a ladies vehicle parked right outside the front doors. G returns alone and unscathed. The lady comes in some time after him and I end up talking with her as G is with another customer at this point.

She wants her battery charged. (we offer this free service as well, go figure). 

Me: ""Ok, do you have the battery with you?""

C: ""No, it's still in the vehicle. You guys will take it out right?""

Me: ""Well, hold on. If the vehicles charging system is functional that should charge the battery.""

C: ""well that guy said the battery is good but needs to be charged.""

Me: ""That very well may be the case, but me charging the battery and putting it back into the vehicle will not solve your problem, only hold it off for a short amount of time.""

C: ""There must be a communication issue because he said it needs to be charged.""

Me: ""Uhm, ok, I'm just trying to understand the situation here and I'm not trying to disrespect you.""

C: ""That's what it seems like.""

Me: ""I assure you I'm not."" I call over G who I've asked to take out the customers battery (which isn't even one the company has sold her) and charge it, which could take up to an hour and a half. 

They go out and I go about what I was doing prior.

G again returns solo. Unscathed. Thank god. But with no battery in hand. 

G says that upon examination the battery had massive amounts of corrosion on the terminals and after explaining this to the customer she stated that, ""we were just trying to get out of helping her"" and she no longer wanted our help.

I go out to her vehicle which is still parked in front of our store to see if I could fix the problem. I ask her if she'd maybe like a jumpstart instead. She says no. She has someone coming to help. Ok, that's good. I ask if she'd rather come and sit inside and wait instead of out in the cold. She says no. Ok, won't force the situation.

45 minutes later I see a man hooking jumper cables up to her car. I go out and see if they need some help.

The man says, ""NO, we're just fine without YOUR help.""

Me: ""Uhm, ok is there a problem?""

Man: ""I work for [my company's name] and we're supposed to be focused on customer service. This is embarrassing that I have to come out here to do this. You left a lady out in the cold and didn't help her. I already told your coworker that I'm talking with [regional manager] and [district manager] and they're going to come and put this place in line.""

Me: ""I really don't have any idea why that's necessary as I tried to help her, but I can't help someone who refuses my help.""

Man: ""You'll be hearing from me and [upper management] in the morning.""

Me: ""All right."" 

Cue ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"" Theme

Closing notes: I have yet to hear about this, I just closed. All I can say is that I've completely lost faith in my community and I am hopeful that I get this paid internship at an engineering firm this spring so I can peace the fuck out. Until then, all need all the support I can get. "

I need some advice with getting started with a freelance video editing career.

I've been editing off and on for a couple years, but I've only used footage from other movies to practice my editing to make fan edits/fan trailers, so essentially I have nothing that's 100% mine to put on a reel at this moment.
I've looked at various freelancing websites such as odesk, elance, and freelancer.com, but the fact that I don't have any past work or a solid reel makes it close to impossible to get work.

Should I just go out and shoot stuff/edit it to start building up a reel? Should I find an internship and go from there? "
20ws64,3,2014-03-20,"Contemplating Studying Abroad in Istanbul, Turkey or do something else with a free semester (travel related) ?",LongandLanky,studyAbroad,https://www.reddit.com/r/studyAbroad/comments/20ws64/contemplating_studying_abroad_in_istanbul_turkey/,"So I went and talked to all the school officials and am currently working on paper work to study abroad in Istanbul, Turkey. I am getting close to the deadline and am planning on going in and getting help with some of the paperwork today after work. 

A little background:

This is my junior year of college and I know that might be considered a little late to be thinking about studying abroad, but I am currently way ahead in classes. I started an internship in the Fall and have been working 30 hours plus taking 15 hours these last two semesters and originally was planning on trying to graduate early this summer, but after working this many hours and seeing like the grown up life is like, I really want to take a semester off and be a kid one last time before I enter the corporate life. My plan is to work and take classes through the summer and then study abroad next fall in Istanbul, Turkey, then come back in the spring, try and get my internship back and pretty much kiss my childhood away. 

My only concern, is that I don't even need the classes that I would be taking when studying abroad, I really just want to travel and see the world one last time before its only 3 weeks off a year corporate style. However, I'm not sure if I should spend the money on tuition and study abroad in Turkey, or if I should just backpack across Europe or something more along those lines. I'm open to other ideas as well, and am not restricted to Turkey, or even Europe for that matter. I just want one last great experience while I'm young. 

TL;DR Should I study abroad in Istanbul Turkey even though I don't need the classes/hours or should I do something else with a free semester, and if I choose to do something else what should I do - obviously want to keep it travel related. 

Oh and I'm not new to reddit, for the first couple years I was strictly a lurker, and then when I wanted to comment on things I realized my username was not anonymous, so I created a new username, but didn't like it so I created this one, which I like better.

20wzu9,2,2014-03-20,I can't be the only one who feels this way,savannahwithnoh,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/20wzu9/i_cant_be_the_only_one_who_feels_this_way/,"TIL Michigan is planning on testing out a ""free"" higher education program for public college, where if you attend a community college or university you do not pay tuition while you are enrolled. To fund this a fixed percentage will be taken from your income for a specified number of years with no interest, in this case it is currently set at 5 years for every year attended with 2% being taken from those who attend community college and 4% for university students. And they aren't the only state that will be trying or has tried to attempt a tuition-less college experience.

I first began to post this exciting news on Facebook but I soon thought about where I live and how most of the people I associate with would find this tactic a way to ""punish"" those who will make more and will see it as a very socialist view. I do have many people who would back me up but they would ultimately start fights on my page and I didn't want to be apart of an internet battle of politics. So I am posting here in order to get how I feel about this out in the open and into a place where I am mostly unknown and where I can feel like my opinion is part of a conversation not an argument. 

As someone who has a student loan debt that is equivalent to that of the new Cadillac CTS and has hopes of my future children going to pursue a higher education I would like to see more states take hold of this idea. Many people like myself struggle under the pressure to pay back student loans and many times will have the option to defer them for a year but continue to build interest on those loans anywhere from 3-7% per month making the cost of payment after the deferment much higher than the original payments per month causing many to defer payments yet again because they continually cannot pay eventually defaulting on their loans. Even those who have filed for bankruptcy must pay back their student loans in full including interest. Much like standard education for children higher education should be a right not a privilege as it has been for many years. 

Yes those who out of college that make more will ultimately have to pay more for their education but that is still only 2-4% of your total yearly income. An amount that is generally negligible no matter your income. Especially when compared to how much is paid on student loans annually. With the amount of interest paid on these loans the cost of educations is much greater than the actual cost of tuition. Traditionally throughout history education has only been available to those who are well off financially which I think is incredibly elitist. The expansion of knowledge and technology has been brought to us through many who were uneducated like Gregor Mendel who discovered how genetic inheritance works though the study of pea plants. Just because we become adults does not mean we lose the excitement and urge to learn more. Imagine if we could expand the knowledge of everyone who wished to go to school but could not because of financial hardships; the strides we would be making in technological advancement, scientific studies, advancement in cancer treatments or the curing of other fatal illnesses like AIDS or Alzheimer's. Even the solution our dependence on oil could be remedied by someone who just does not have the ability to attend a place of higher education. 

There are so many schools who are now opening online courses to the public for free, however these courses do not gain you a much needed diploma in many cases because you are only able to access the lectures of these courses. You do not take the tests in most of these classes, you will not get credit for these classes as you are not exactly enrolled but you can still learn whatever you want to learn. You can study what it is you are interested in and you can know so much about the world but without that degree most places will not hire you; internships you apply for will be given to someone who is attempting a degree or someone who has more ""real world"" experience. Self study is not seen in the modern world as very reliable because of how important our society has made higher education and how focused the job markets have become on a degree. In many cases it doesn't actually matter what you have a degree for in order to get a job you are applying for which I find fantastically absurd. 

Education is a right, you cannot control what people learn and how they learn. You can only control so much of education by financial means and an application process, however libraries are free houses of knowledge just waiting to harnessed. Anything you can learn in a classroom you can learn from reading books, recreating simple experiments, watching documentaries, solving equations and just by asking a question. Knowledge is a freely traded commodity it is not a profit making scam.

When students pay for their own classes they are supposed to appreciate the opportunity to learn, however you must have your parent's tax information in order to apply for financial aid. Even if you are on your own and your parents refuse to pay for your schooling to ""build character"" your aid is based on what their income is. If they make over a certian amount you are not awarded any financial aid other than scholarships earned by grades or volunteer work and you must pay the rest either out of pocket or with a loan which your parents must cosign. Students whose parents pay for their college education, in my personal experience, do not take their education as seriously as someone who has worked hard but still has to pay out of their own pocket and take out loan after loan in hopes of bettering their lives with a well paying job in order to help their family, themselves or other people. Just how many of these low income high school graduates have dreams of becoming an engineer or a doctor or even a school teacher? How can we keep such bright intelligent students from achieving more with their lives? What good does it do society to keep so many people blind to such vast knowledge about the world other than the fact that financially it is profitable to do so. Greed is will be the downfall of us. Profit is not a bad thing, but when all you care about is profit and not how to better the society you live in there is something selfish and wrong about it. There is nothing more amazing than when you learn more people who are in poverty donate more to charities than those who are well off. The poor are generally good people. Science and politics and history and all the subjects you can learn are there to better society, to keep it going strong and to make our lives better. Why not let people who are good in spirit who want to change the world and learn to make life better for all of us get the education that they too deserve? I am just amazed at how much negative attention will be brought to such an amazing opportunity and how selfish we as a people have become. 

When I was younger I had aspirations of going to Harvard to study psychology, as a grew up I realized that it would be a financial burden on my family and the only way to pay would be to obtain a full scholarship to the school. I was 8 years old when I realized this would never happen for me. I settled on getting good grades and extra curricular activities and decided to go to a private college in my hometown because it was slightly cheaper than going to the state school near by. I wasn't happy there and I have always looked back and thought about what I could have done had I been able to afford Harvard. I gave up on my dream and I gave up on myself because of it. No child should have to worry about if they will be able to become what they want to be. This needs to be fixed and we all need to receive the education we deserve.

20x6xv,0,2014-03-20,Recent Graduate with mechE degree - looking to get work with/on robots,SpaghettiEars,engineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/20x6xv/recent_graduate_with_meche_degree_looking_to_get/,"Hi Everyone,

In about 3 months it'll be 1 year since I graduated from uni with a MechE Degree. I'm sure like most of you, I graduated not really knowing what I wanted to do yet, so I took the first offers thrown my way. Thankfully I've been employed since before I graduated:

* Engineering in the Food Industry internship 3 months
* Civil engineering Work 7 months
* currently back in the Food Industry for engineering on a contract to last at least 9 months

However, I feel like after being in the Food Industry for a good amount of time I feel like I wouldn't want to be here for a substantial amount of time. After thinking back on what classes I really liked and what I can really put my passion into I decided to try and go into the robotics field. 

I know it's vague, and I'm trying to specifically figure out what in that field I want to work on, but right now I thought it would be best to learn some coding(C++)/ refresh on control systems &amp; circuits/do DIY projects using Ardunio/ and get some certifications. So I was wondering if I could ask 2 things from you r/engineering:

1) How would a person in my situation go about getting into this field (what would I need to learn?)

2) Is there any certifications I can get to raise my chances? I am aware of CAPM and Scrum Master ( it's expensive!!!) but are there any others? ( I already have my F.E./E.I.T. btw)

as a side note: is there an collective opinion on the CAPM here?

Thanks! if there's anything needed from me just ask!

20x8ku,12,2014-03-20,My Mother Was Beautiful,nursebib,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/20x8ku/my_mother_was_beautiful/,"Hey, I wrote this and it was published here: www.youareleaving.com. I am a 27 year old girl who has been taking care of her mom who has dementia. Read this is you have dealt with this before or know anyone who has! Thanks for reading!




I knew I’d be trading in daily bike rides and Strawberry Street in Richmond, Virginia for loud crowds and politics in the nation’s capital. It was one of those rare moments where I knew what I had to do. I knew before my dad asked me, eyes cast downward, if I would. Some would later call me heroic, a saint, an exemplary daughter. I could only wonder, “Wouldn’t you, too?” I knew I would cry if I had to tell anyone face-to-face, so I emailed a lot. I cried a lot too. Still do.

My mom started getting sick when I was 18. Our first indication was when she said, “You better thank us for those movie tickets we bought you,” to our good friends. “That was weird, that was rude, that was out of character,” we thought. Now, nine years later, I’m here, grasping her hand and pressing her head against mine, hoping this is just a bad dream, that she will come back, her frontal lobe will sprout perennial shoots like her carefully tended garden used to. Now it too stands in shambles covered in dead leaves, obscuring the life that grows beneath.

Her gardenia perfume replaced with the smell of baby powder. Her long, ivory fingers sleeping, after decades of piano concertos and high school accompaniments. My mother will always feel the same. If I close my eyes and lean my head on her shoulder, she exists there still. But today even her bright eyes are beginning to fade away slowly. Sometimes I pretend she will speak to me again, say my name, that her beautiful essence can somehow machete its way through the jungle of shrinking brain tissue, that her memory of and love for me will outweigh this dark cloud that manipulates her reality, stole her language, and made her incontinent.

My dad, older sister, and I brushed it off for a few years, attributing her idiosyncrasies to getting older or going through menopause. Then she started forgetting our names, nearly shoved my 70-year-old dad down the stairs, fought with us over hair dye, stomped her feet, tired us out. A 63-year-old woman throwing a temper tantrum over an unwashed plate is a sight to behold. There was humor somewhere–once, she smacked my boyfriend on the bum with a wooden spoon the way she did when we were children and needed a swift, strong punishment. Another time she got caught stealing Hershey bars from the local Rite Aid and the cops bashfully delivered the news to us.

I moved home to DC two and a half years ago from a carefree life with best friend roommates, thrift store art of crocheted flowers, PBR in the fridge, and a favorite bar down the street, Joe’s Inn. I thought I had it all, at least as much as a recent graduate with an internship could. I spent my days worrying about what bar we’d go to, who would be there, would I run into my ex? I made goals, tried to plan out my life. I made about $600 a month, just enough to pay rent in a cheap town and go out drinking once or twice a week. We ate a lot of rice and opted for no air conditioning. It was perfect and just what we needed, graduating during The Great Recession.

These days I wonder, will this be the UTI that will kill her? Does she want volunteer strangers to sit with her? How will we pay for the funeral? Which funeral home will we use? Is this burial plot beautiful enough for her resting place? Does it matter? These questions don’t stop–the search for meaning amidst loss. I am a 27-year-old with no idea what my mother wanted for her end of life, no idea how to make a choice about her brain tissue donation. Two years ago I came back here to my childhood room, my childhood home. I was broken by the pain of the slow death, this FTLD, or dementia, that slowly crept into our lives, stealing my mother’s personality slivers at a time over eight years, almost nine.

My mother was beautiful. Red lips, black hair. She could command a room with her elegance. She still can. “She’s still so beautiful,” people say. But she is now shockingly pale with sagging cheeks. She keeps her mouth closed at all times, except for eating or drinking. Her eyes no longer gleam with excitement when she sees me. Her salt-and-pepper hair has thinned, no longer set in curls. She zones out on reality television and goes to bed at 7 PM in her new home, a caring facility that keeps watch over her in a way we never could. I wonder if she thinks about me, if she thinks about my dad, about my sister. I wonder if she misses us when we are too busy with our lives and can’t see her for a day or two. I ask myself, “Does she know me?” I won’t ever know, the way I never knew if I was in the right job or dating the right boy.

She has been on and off hospice for a year, her body quickly ravaged by infection and then recovering on its own. I sat with her the other day and on a whim, decided to play her favorite song, “The Prayer,” sung by Josh Groban and Celine Dion. I have not heard my mother laugh in over a year, but within moments of pressing play, I found something in that shrinking brain of hers. Her eyes lit up with recognition, she opened her mouth, and she let out the sweetest laugh I could ever imagine."

Over this school year, I've applied to over 15 internships without a single interview. Recently, I've been having a change of heart with my major. But I feel it's a little too late. I want to work with computers. At least I think I do. I found a research opportunity with a professor in the IT dept (clearly unrelated to petroleum engineering). How can I market myself to him? The research is about search engines. I have experience in C++ and MATLAB. My cumulative GPA is only a 2.97. My major GPA, which seems irrelevant now, is a 3.6. I have volunteer work, and I am also active in my fraternity. Am I stupid for wanting something like this? Or should I just tough it out and get my petrol degree and hope I can find a job?

Thanks guys."
20xfjk,16,2014-03-20,I just finished the whole series! [Spoilers],TheBauhausCure,dresdenfiles,https://www.reddit.com/r/dresdenfiles/comments/20xfjk/i_just_finished_the_whole_series_spoilers/,"Over four years ago a friend gifted me with 'Fool Moon' when my beloved pet rat died. The poor book sat on my desk at my internship for a year. The cover was so dark, how could it be related to anything in the fantasy genre?

I wound up reading 'Storm Front' cover to cover on a very slow day at work a few months ago, and was immediately hooked. 

This morning I finished 'Cold Days' and I have to say, no other book series has touched me the way 'The Dresden Files' has. I've laughed, I've cried (sometimes through a whole book...) and I've been so mad I nearly punched a hole in the wall. There's just something so...so human, so empathetic about Harry.

There are a few things that have me completely frustrated, though.

For one, the whole Harry/Murphy thing drives me up a wall. I find myself screaming at them to just get in on already. I squealed like a school girl during 'Love Hurts', and again when Harry and Murphy kissed during 'Cold Days'. Usually it's obvious when two characters are going to *eventually* get together, but the back and forth between them really rubs me the wrong way. Perhaps someone has some insight on this.

How exactly is Harry protecting Maggie by not being in her life? The entire Red Court knew that Maggie was Harry's daughter, all of his friends do, and now the Summer Court has this knowledge. She's under protection at the Carpenter household, so why can't he go visit her? Him entering the home isn't going to make the guards go away, is it? He can be involved in her life to the point that she knows he cares...give her more than what he had growing up. She's nine now, which means that somewhere in the series she'll be a teenager/young adult and able to make her own decisions, and he shouldn't hold that option back from her. I really don't see how him not even going for a visit changes anything. 

Also, I've done some research on Harry's age. He should be in late thirties now, right? Wouldn't that place Murphy in her early forties? Harry has never described her with any signs of aging, which seems off, since he met her in her mid to late twenties. 

Anyway, so I'm now going through a major withdrawal, and eagerly await 'Skin Game'!"

I have two options and need to make a choice soon. I'm earning a decent pay and able to keep my head above the water with bills and driving 1 hr to and from work. 

My choices are stay as an intern/co-op until a position in IT becomes available or take a phone tech support position unrelated to System and Network administration work. The phone tech position is for the product the company sells. 

I'm almost guaranteed the position as phone tech. But They are unsure when they could create a position for me as a System Admin. My life has always been about IT and my first job ever was 6 years of stockboy at a small town grocery store. 

If I stay as a co-op they'll most likely never see the need to hire a fulltime because I'm already doing a ton of the work along with another System admin out of the 5 man team (including me). Any advice? Questions?"

* Working on my BS in Mechanical Engineering at UT Austin

* Junior (Last summer to intern anywhere)

* Strong programming background 

* Worked in a research lab here at UT that has a partnership with Los Alamos

---


Job 1: Intern at a national lab (Los Alamos)

Pros

* A national lab, awesome resume material

* Exposure to government work environments. I have a strong feeling I wont *enjoy* this aspect, but it's a good experience to have without a HUGE commitment (only a few months internship)

Cons

* The work I would be doing is less exciting to me, probably working on really old programming

* Pay is marginally worse (~$5/hr less)

---

Job 2: Working at a contractor that does work for NASA

Pros

* Smaller company (20-30 employees)

* Would have 'my own' project to work on that I would probably enjoy

* Work is probably closer to what I would want to do in the long run, but who knows?

* Closer to home (~2 hrs away vs. ~15 hrs)

Cons

*  Tiny company that nobody has ever heard of, so if I decide I don't much care for the work I do here it doesn't look like much on a resume

---

So basically I need to weight the prestige and life experiences that come with a national lab vs. the more relevant work experience. I probably won't ever get a chance to 'try out' a national lab ever again in my life, if I ever go back it would be a larger commitment (full time job). 


 I suppose this is a better position to be in than not having any offers but nevertheless I'm still having a tough time deciding. Does anyone have any helpful incite/experiences/career advice that they care to share?"

Being single for the past few years does hurt a lot but i try to further my career and enjoy the freedom i currently have. 

Now my 27 year old coworker and his rude ""i am a mom, worship me"" girlfriend had their first baby last September and number 2 is due to arrive later this year. Several other coworkers have also had babies the past year, making me the only guy at the small company i work for that has no partner or kids.

A new guy started today and mentioned he has a gf who is pregnant. We had a chuckle about the baby boom at our company after which my 27 year old coworker started laughing and thought it would be funny to mention, quote: 

&gt; ""Troubleshooter11 has nothing, no girlfriend or kids. Only his apartment and computer.""


They laughed at that (?), though the new guy and the intern saw i was shocked/stunned by that comment and dropped their smiles instantly. Two other coworkers added that maybe i should marry my computer and get a bunch of cats.

I want to punch them all, except the new guy and the intern.

I am an International student into my first year pursuing Master's in Computer Science at Northeastern University. I am currently looking for internships in software companies and startups. 

I had made a mess on a phone interview for internship at the Top 4 last November. Since then I haven't received calls from any company. I am feeling a little lost here and I am not sure where and what has gone wrong with my job applications. My friends that I know have all received calls and few of them even with couple of offers in hand. 

Can I hope to get calls for summer internships now? Anyhow I'm looking at other options, maybe plan to intern during Fall (if I do get one).

In need of money, I began working as a debt collector for the US dept of education. Salary was $32k a year along with commission. I would make anywhere between $1k-3k in commission a month. At the 3 year mark, I decided to quit. I have always been applying during my tenure as a collector, but didn't even land one interview. The reason I quit was because there was no growth at that job. I would trade in short term financial success for more of a long term position with growth. 

While unemployed I have been applying to marketing/advertising positions. I scored an interview with Comcast Spotlight. I went through a phone interview along with 3 face to face interviews during a month long process. Just got word today they went with someone who has ""direct experience.""  They said this was an entry level position. I just feel very frustrated and scared for my future. 


I am even being rejected for internships at this point. I just want to expand my skill set with an established company, but it seems no one wants to give me an opportunity.

I spent the whole week spiralling into the lowest of lows, literally woke up one morning in tears because I was dreaming about him again and just wished I didn't wake up at all. I have been doing so well until now. And now I've realized I have every right to feel like this because what I went through was not a normal break up, it was traumatic and cruel, he tried to fucking strangle me. He literally pressed his fingers into my throat and tried to stop me from breathing. Then deserted me in a foreign country away from my support network to pick up the pieces, while he fled the country to run home to his enabler of a mother like the useless coward that he is.


I felt hopeless this week. I felt like I was never going to get over him, all his verbal and mental abuse over the years was playing over and over in my head. Wondering why he didn't love me enough, why he flirted and probably cheated with other girls, why did he call me ugly, a slut a whore, a piece of shit, worthless, told me to kill myself. Now I know it's not me with the problem. 

I got an internship today. I was so nervous it was unreal, just before I left home I had been crying and feeling like crap because I couldn't focus, all I could think about was him. Then I went to the interview, gave a presentation of my work infront of a recruitment panel and there and then on the spot they offered it to me. It just gave me the confidence boost I needed. I am capable. I am worth something. I don't need him to define who I am. I moved to a foreign country on my leaf alone, passed my semester there with full marks, made the most amazing friends from around the world.He never supported my education. Always put me down, saying it wasn't worth my time, saying I needed a piece of paper to prove something to myself. 

Coming from him, the fucking waster who has nothing in his life,no job, no career,who quite happily let his girlfriend take him on dates, pay for his rent, his food, his flights. He has no ambition, no goals. Nothing. He is talented,and intelligent. But I'm starting to wonder if that intelligence is intellectual or conniving. I did my best to encourage him to use his talent, but nope. Lets drag my girlfriend down instead because that's way more fulfilling! 


I've been dwelling far too much on the fact that I love him. Yes I love him but if he loved me he would never have did what he did, he never treated me right. He made me fucking miserable, he always made me stressed out and insecure. I've never met anyone who was able to tug at my emotions like they were a yoyo the way he did. It was not natural. I don't know how I haven't taken a mental break down yet, a relationship with him is like one massive chaotic fucking time bomb. He was never happy until all attention and drama was focused on him.

I just have to deal with the fact that he didn't love me enough and learn from it, which is okay because in reality what has he really got? An abusive personality, no ambition, no morals, no backbone and now no girlfriend, and I feel sorry for anyone who ends up with him because he is unable to provide love and compassion like a normal human being. 


I start my internship soon, and then my final year of my degree, I'm in the midst of teaching myself French and German. I'm getting the fuck out of this town because this is not where I'm suppose to be.  I can see and do whatever I want, I do something as simple as wear lipstick without worrying about him putting me down and pointing out how much he hates it, I can spend my money on me and not him, I can get through each day without feeling on a high one minute and a low the next. 

I'll get over it, and I'll live. Fuck his relationship. He was a shit boyfriend. I cried more times than I smiled over him. I just really need to man up now and deal with it. I'm really angry. Most likely because I'm on my period and hormonal as fuck. Fuck him. "

The company hasn't told me anything about paying for my housing or giving me a stipend and whatnot so I want to get a jump start on looking for it myself.

I'll be making good money for someone still in college and would ideally like a place below $1000/mo but that would allow me to commute to midtown in at most 30 minutes. 

I also have family living in New Jersey (literally right on the Hudson) that I could ask to live with. I know they live right by the Lincoln Tunnel but I don't know how quick I would be able to get to Park Avenue from this location, although my housing would essentially be free.

Could anyone give me ideas on where to look? I'd rather not deal with Craigslist and will be asking friends in the city for advice as well. From what I've read, I would be looking into a place on Queens or Brooklyn but I'm not sure how far they are from midtown Manhattan on the metro. I am open to having roommates.

20ygcl,5,2014-03-20,Getting into a prestigious private school such as Harvard or Stanford.,xCH4RLIExSQU4Dx,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/20ygcl/getting_into_a_prestigious_private_school_such_as/,"Currently I am looking at going to a state school here in Missouri but I would rather be at a school like Harvard or Stanford. I am currently taking an online course from Harvard and I absolutely love it. I have learned more in that class than any other class I have taken in my life, including AP Calculus BC (a class where my high school has an exceptional teacher and we have a high success rate with the AP test).

I know that my current choice will be an exceptional education and I have about 75% of the cost paid for already. What is now bothering me it that a friend of mine told me about the financial aid provided by private universities such as these. I found out that I would be paying the same or less to attend Harvard/Stanford than the state school I am slated to go to.

At the beginning of this year I choose not to apply because I thought that even if I was accepted there is no way that I can pay to attend. I didn't want to waste my time and money applying. But this new knowledge has me kicking myself and I am very interested in attending Harvard or Stanford.

The way I see it I have a few options. First is to attend the state school all the way through for my degree. Second is to attend the state school for 1/2 years and transfer. Third is to attend a community college and transfer. And last is to take a year off, do volunteer work and job shadowing, then apply for these universities.

Going about life alone is a very hard thing. My family is not in a very good financial position which is why cost of attending these private institutions will be so low for me. I am looking for advice on what to do as I graduate high school and begin to go off on my own.

Here is some information about myself.
GPA: 3.5
ACT: 30 Composite (30 Writing, 34 Math, 27 Reading, 34 Science)
SAT: 2010 Composite (620 Reading, 800 Math, 590 Writing, Essay 9)
AP Tests: Calculus BC and Computer Science A (haven't taken them yet)
Activities: Varsity Track and Cross Country, FIRST Robotics, Relay for Life.
Work Experience: 2 Summers of Grounds-keeping for my local school district. And an IT internship for a local insurance company.
Interest in Major: Computer Science and Business.

The more I think about it the more appealing a year off sounds in order to try and get into Harvard, Stanford or another prestigious private school. I feel that I can make myself a more desirable applicant if I take a year to continue my internship, do volunteer work, and find job shadowing opportunities. Another thing for me to consider is athletics. I am currently being offered a scholarship to run for the state school I mentioned earlier. However, I am not sure if I have the ability to run at a more prestigious school. I will find out more after this track season, which will actually be my first full season.

Academically, concepts come fairly easily to me. This actually caused a problem for me early in my high school career. I had built up a habit of not doing work and relying on my natural intelligence to pick up the slack. I spent the later half of my high school career teaching myself habits such as studying, reading, and actually doing my homework. As a result of this my GPA suffers from freshman and sophomore year. While I may not have the best numbers I have become a motivated person who legitimately values my education.

Sorry if this post is somewhat unorganized, I have a lot on my mind at the moment and I also have classwork to finish up. I appreciate all of your input. Thank You."

I had an interview a week and a half ago with a great civil engineering firm last Friday (12 days ago) for a summer internship position.  Here's the story:
Mid January, I went to a career fair at my school.  While I was there I met a woman from HR from this company who immediately took an interest in my resume.  She gave me a card and asked how I would feel about working on a dam project that they are doing about two hours away.  We did all the career fair small talk, and she seemed really interested.

I called towards the end of February and she immediately scheduled an interview for me. I had three weeks to prepare; I got a haircut, practiced answers, all that good stuff.

I went to the interview and she was running late coming back from another career fair.  When she arrived (about 30 minutes after we we rescheduled to meet) the first thing she said was how great it was for me to wait for her.  Now, I had been stressing out and going crazy about this interview for three weeks by this point, but this immediately made me feel good.

So we go into her office and go through the interview motions.  She asks me about what I want to do, why I'm interested in civil engineering, my favorite subject, stuff like that.  She mentioned that I was able to keep my GPA up while working tow jobs, then she told me about the work that she would have me doing.
The entire time, I was feeling very confident about getting the job.   Then she told me that she would have a project engineer call me the week after to set up another interview.

We concluded the interview shortly after, following a bit of small talk.   I thanked her for her time, and she thanked me for coming in, and I drove home with the confidence of a thousand warriors.

Then nothing.   No call, no email.   Nothing.     I haven't heard from the engineer or the woman I met with.   I distinctly remember her saying that he would call the week after the interview.   I waited the whole week and didn't get that call.   It's now Wednesday of the second week, and I have yet to hear anything.    I've been feeling a bit worried since last week, and now it seems too long to simply be due to them being busy.  Should I be worried? Or am I just overanalyzing things? 

tl;dr: haven't been contacted almost two weeks after a what felt like a successful interview

But my boyfriend and I have been dating for a little over two years, and after about a year of us dating we went through a major rough patch. We got through it… but since then I feel like we've switch places almost. The first year, he was pretty insecure and needy at times… I was really comfortable in the relationship. And then after the rough patch it switched…


He just recently started an internship where he's working from 9-5… and with tax season he has to stay even later sometimes. The other day he stayed as late as 9:45. We usually talk frequently throughout the day so it was an adjustment for me to not talk to him pretty much all day.


A couple of weeks ago I saw that a girl had texted him really early in the morning before he was about to leave for work, I asked him what she said and he said she was just asking if they had work that morning… which I thought was weird.


Every since then I have been so paranoid about him and that girl… I don't know why. I even went as far as looking her up… she's pretty and blonde. Of course. Probably the only pretty girl there. He would call me a couple of times a day from work or text me random things at first, but now he very rarely texts me during the day.


I feel like the other day he kept checking his phone, almost like he was checking the time? But he did it quite frequently… but then I think to myself ok maybe I'm just THINKING he's doing it in a sketchy way because I'm being insecure and I think crazy thoughts like ""maybe he's seeing if she texted him""


And then my insecurity has made me act needy, like this past weekend I felt like I always needed him to be touching me for some weird reason… and I know that's because I was being insecure and I wanted the reassurance from him.


Today… I hadn't talked to him since 1 in the afternoon… when I got off work around 10, I still hadn't heard from him and he always calls me when he leaves work. But no call, no texts. So I called him and he didn't answer. I texted him saying, ""Hey are u still at work?"" and he just texted me back saying ""I'm at the rodeo! It's almost over tho"" and so I just texted him saying ""Ok call me when u leave""


He told me a couple of weeks ago that his internship was paying him to go to the rodeo… but hadn't mentioned anything since.


It reallllyyy bothered me that he didn't even call me when he got off or bother texting me saying ""hey I'm going to the rodeo when I get off work I'll call you when I leave"" or something… it's like I had to ask him almost. Plus we hadn't really talked all day...


Anyways, this all boils down to the question of why am I acting so insecure? Why does all of this bother me so much? 


I used to be such a content person and have high self esteem but now I feel so insecure and needy and just… not me. I don't want to feel this way. I don't want to have these crazy thoughts of him having fun at the rodeo with some girl or why he took so long to call me back or why he kept checking his phone that one day.


Help me : (

20z0fo,1,2014-03-21,"Interned at law firms through undergrad, got a job interview with a major financial institution. How do I prepare?",whitehat511,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/20z0fo/interned_at_law_firms_through_undergrad_got_a_job/,"I studied Economics and Finance in undergrad, and I interned at law firms in the summers. I'm interested in becoming a lawyer or working in a law-related field eventually, but I've elected to hold off on law school in the short term due to the disproportionately poor current job prospects and disproportionately high current cost of law school. I'm an extremely detail-oriented person. 

I worked at law firms instead of financial institutions because even though I applied for legal and financial positions, my first job practically fell into my lap. I made friends with the managing partner of a small law firm in a park one day, and he offered me an internship at the end of our conversation.  I found further internships in law firms as a result of contacts I made while working in the first law firm. As you all probably know, it's much easier to find jobs and internships when you know somebody who can get your resume in the door. 

That's not to say I don't have the interest in the subjects of my degrees, though.  I *loved* my finance courses, especially the ones acquainting me with how banks work. I love learning why they do what they do, what drives their profit and how it interacts with the economy, and how that relates to the government's interests in the form of regulation.  While I easily understand corporate governance conceptually and the basic math of finance, I struggle with the more advanced mathematics and instruments. I've also steered away from microeconomics to focus on macroeconomics, which interests me far more.

All of that said, I'm searching for employment since I will be graduating in May. I managed to get an interview for an Operations position at a major bank. The position appears to be a nice crossover of my areas of interest.  Here are the details from the job description:


**Responsibilities Include:**
Interpreting guidelines and builds logic based rules for automated compliance testing and monitoring

Preparing for account on-boarding by requesting set up of accounts in various systems

Reviewing new and existing rules to ensure compliance with account mandates

Interacting with Client Portfolio Managers, Portfolio Managers and 
Investment Assistants to resolve any pre &amp; post trade issues

Partnering with the Client Service Team to ensure timely on-boarding / account closings – coordinating dates to ensure guideline rules are coded effectively prior to any trades taking place

Ensuring timely and accurate completion of assigned workload

Managing accurate guideline coding in various systems

Working on projects with strict deadlines, including the migration of accounts from one compliance system to another
 
**Qualifications**
 
Qualifications / Skill Set

Bachelor's Degree in Accounting, Business Administration, 

Economics, Finance or equivalent work experience

Financial product knowledge of fixed income, equities, and derivatives preferred

Detail oriented

Strong organization, time management, communication and multi-tasking skills

Ability to identify inefficiencies in a process and drive change

Self motivated individual with ability to identify issues and escalate

Strong awareness of cause and effect

Understanding of risk and controls

Industry tools and software suites such as Microsoft Office

Experience with guideline coding in compliance systems (Charles River, Linedata, thinkFolio, Sentinel) a plus

I guess what I'm asking is- given what I've told you about my background and the details of this position, how should I approach this interview to make the best impression?  I really want this job, so  I'd appreciate any advice you might have. If you need more information to give me meaningful advice, please let me know."

I need this  off of my chest. 

I'm 23 and I feel soul-crushingly lost in life. 
I know I will be bombarded with ""you're so young, though,"" and the like but soon enough, I fear, I will be writing this post with, ""I'm 29 and.."" then ""I'm 34 and.."" 

I have a huge passion for a lot of (different) things. The trouble is that these things are widely regarded as being either pipedreams or they need requirements that I basically already missed. 

Cliches first: expression. I've been a musician for all of my life and constantly daydream about playing onstage, touring the country or the world and emotionally connecting to people. Everyone has had this dream, I know, and it is like playing the lottery, but what lured me into continually trying was to travel. I want to live in hotels, be on the road constantly, and know that someone enjoys something I created. Travel and passion is all I care about, even if it isn't my long term solution. I'm a realistic guy, but at the same time, if it is possible to do it, why can't I? 
But the odds of me living that reality are becoming depressingly low. I've sent out songs, hooked up with as many acts as possible, but sometimes it just drains you when 5 years goes by and some random 16 year old with two months experience on a Macbook is given the key to the world instead of you. I've been beaten down in this field for years, although I'm legitimately competent at a lot of instruments. It's always received well (from the public and even some press) but I could never graduate regardless of whatever research and networking attempted.
I thought I finally caught a break when I saw an ad for a band that was looking for a drummer to tour the country along with some of my favorite bands ever (like Bright Eyes, Cursive). I thought I was a shoo-in. I'm great at my instrument, have the time, energy and commitment, and I genuinely felt the music.

So I drive an hour to meet the band for an meet-and-greet. We really hit it off, or so I thought, talking about our histories and joked around a lot. We had a great time and the last I heard they were eager to get a date together and have a proper audition. A week goes by and nothing. I decide to text a follow-up and no reply. It's embarrassing to admit this, but I actually prayed - and a lot - for this to happen. I want to see California, Seattle, Texas, Miami, all these places I daydream about. I focused all positive energy since all I can do at this point is wait - and I later find out that they're still looking. Still looking.. They haven't chosen someone over me, they just know that they don't want me. They haven't even heard me play, so this judgment is coming personally. I fit RIGHT in and genuinely thought this was it, and everything was in its right place to connect, but they would rather spend more weeks ""filtering through dead ends"" than to even give me a chance? I've only prayed twice in my life and both times, the exact opposite happens. It might sound like an immature connection to make, but it almost seems like resorting to it hurt my universal odds. I don't just extort my vaguely-guided pseudo-spiritual faith in exchange for favors, it's actually an active part of my inner-dialogue because sometimes yes, success is part luck. I don't know why, but it feels as if the world just flat out denies me at every turn.

I think this was the final nail in the coffin. After years of grabbing at opportunities and working my soul and heart to its rawness for not even a spec of satisfaction, this was the ultimate tease and I feel defeated. The odds that I can tour even the country just are not in my favor, no matter how much effort I exert. The special coating of ""but my determination and flexibility will set me apart"" has been scraped off me completely. I don't even believe I am asking for much. Not a million dollars, not fame. Just travel and memories outside of my fucking hometown. If my heart could want something else, I would pay money for the exchange.

MEANWHILE - - -

Okay, just so you don't think that I invested all my life in music, I should tell you my other passion is drastically different than my first. This is my brain passion: private investigation. I've went to college for forensics and criminal investigation due to my obsession with, as lame as it sounds, helping people and honoring justice (cue Batman theme music). It took me awhile to get into the university because it was hard to channel my interests into a clear career. When I finally got in, I worked my ass off. I learned different languages and got really good grades. I aspired to join the FBI. While music had me relying on my heart, the option to rely on my stone cold logic and reason appealed to me. I'm actually just as sensitive as I am insensitive (huh?) so I feel at home in both expression and stoicism. Halfway through, things went awry when applying for internships. I knew there were limitations with color blindness, but I spoke to the agent at my campus and it was a harsher sentence than I expected. I was to remain a desk jocky or some other filler-definition. I wasn't going to get the experience I wanted. I have no problem with being behind-the-scenes, but I can't deny that it isn't my end goal. In a competitive profession, there is bound to be someone with my numbers and capability without the (pretty severe) deficiency. Field work is closed to me unless I (and have sincerely tried) train myself to not be ""severely color deficient."" I couldn't even pass 56% in the hue module. 

Not only that, but financially I was crippled. I couldn't afford to take out another loan and pay the thousands to even continue and get a vague criminology degree. I have one life. I don't want to just get by as some manager of some place or a paper-filer. I want to achieve at least ONE of my most cherished goals. Do I strive for impossible and risky things? Should I just accept and compromise with life? I often think so, yet I am forced to watch other people walk around casually with the life I so desperately want.


I don't lack drive, I lack direction and maybe even a realistic view. The way things are panned out, I feel more like my fate was blocked since I was born and there is very little I can do except trust in (something) or continue accepting an underwhelming life that should be filled with potential. At this point, I'm just considering moving, but it seems like something to do to fake my way of feeling like I accomplished anything through all this work and heart-wrenching miscarriage. I really want to support the rest of my family instead of the other way around, already, so maybe I just have to settle.


Thank you for listening. I know I'm not alone in fearing mediocrity since hey, we get one life. Ugh."
20z9nx,1,2014-03-21,Ridding the struggle bus hard in college.,[deleted],Narcolepsy,https://www.reddit.com/r/Narcolepsy/comments/20z9nx/ridding_the_struggle_bus_hard_in_college/,"
I love school and sacrifice everything for it. I'm good at it too, except I have to work extremely hard and I work freakishly slow. Sometimes I have to do things I REALLY hate, like showing up late or turning things in late. I fear that my professors get the impression that I'm irresponsible but  that I get by because of natural intelligence. In reality, nothing could be further from the truth. 

For the first 7 semesters (and even in high school), I avoided diagnosis because of self-doubt and self-blame and lack of money. Then once I did get the tests done a few months ago, I didn't bother asking for accommodations. I was so close to the end and had done well without them so far. I wanted to be strong enough to power through without help, because I'm dumb. 

 I was too stubborn to admit that I might need a little extra help and now the ""stuff"" is hitting the fan, hard. Only 50 days until graduation and I can't keep it together. The harder I work, the less it pays off. Suddenly I'm late to the most important things, I can't turn things in on time, I'm losing complete control. All attempts to self-correct, throw me further off balance. Again, I'm afraid it looks like a case of ""senioritis"" when it just feels like a case of completely suffocating drowning.

Example: I neglected homework the other night so I could sleep 8 hours, so that I could safely commute to campus for my first real job interview. I got special permission to leave my internship early so that I'd have 1.5 hours to make the 45 minute drive. I arrived at my interview 5 minutes late. Even with so much extra time planned in for traffic and to stop for naps. I was so tired that all of my energy was focused on staying in my lane that I suppose I must have been going drastically under the speed limit. 

But here's the deal: I drove the same drive the day before and it took nearly 2.5 hours. I tried to drive a very familiar 30 minute route home today and must have slipped into microsleeps and automatic behaviors because I looked up and realized that I had missed my turn. At my last memory, I had been close to the turn, which meant close to home. When I gathered some consciousness back, I had no idea where I was. The only place to pull over was a hiking trail. A gravel lot in the middle of nowhere, big enough for about four cars, and in the forest. Potentially unsafe place to sleep, but my only option. After taking a lengthy nap there, I still had difficulty staying awake on the way back home. My GPS took me the quickest route, which appeared to be simple back tracking. Apparently, I had driven for about 20-30 minutes past my turn, in my hometown, without realizing it. This was a first for me, and an extremely scary one. 

When I got home, I fell into another nap before I could get started on my assignments. I have random alarms set in case this happens so I did spend the next 6 hours working on papers. But when my midnight deadline had rolled around, I still had not finished one of the most important assignments of my school career - And one of the few that won't be accepted late. Which, in combination with the late interview and other recent incidents, is what has led me to somewhat of a crisis point. 

I hate to ever mention Narcolepsy in relation to school work because I despise it sounding like an excuse. Plus I blame myself for not taking the proper academic actions before these issues arose. My stupid pride has been more than humbled. Even though I hate to draw the connection, it IS getting rather difficult to get work done when 30 minute drives take 2.5 hours. It's difficult to get to places on time when I can set 2 hours worth of alarms at 2 minute interviews and not be able to wake up in time. 

50 days left, and I'm destroying years of the hardest work I could imagine. AND I'm leaving a bad lasting impression on my main professors, 3 of the most important people to have ever been in my life. It's gotten to the point, where I feel that I owe them an explanation - even if I don't feel like I deserve special treatment and even if I don't want to seem attention seeking. 

I'm also terrified about how this is going to affect me as I hope to enter career-life. I guess I don't know what the point of this is for any of you. Maybe I want to know how to get some balance back? Maybe I want to know if certain medications are more effective for these things? What kind of accommodations are actually helpful in school and work? How do I stop blaming myself but still avoid victim status? Could there be a secondary issue (even though you can't say for sure), or a misdiagnosis?I'll take any kind of answers or stories at this point.

(Male, 6'1, 22 years old)",Mesk_Arak,Fitness,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/20zqbd/with_my_schedule_should_i_exercise_in_the_early/,"For the next couple of years (the last two years of college), my schedule will continue to be tight and I lack time for exercise.

From Monday to Friday, I:
Get up at 7:30,
Internship from 9am to 4pm,
Go straight to class due to heavy traffic,
Classes from 7pm to 11pm.
Go to bed (if I'm lucky) at midnight.

As you can see, I have next to no time for exercise. However, I had an idea of getting up earlier to run on the treadmill every day. An ideal time would be to get up at 6am and run for an hour, just in time to get ready to go to work afterwards.

Is this a wise idea? Should I sacrifice an hour and a half of sleep for an hour of exercise?

Thank you in advance for your time and for  your responses!"

I have had 2 offers so far from company's at my schools job fair along with a few other interviews, but they are for jobs I really don't want and don't think will give me the experience I need for my dream job(Design or Test engineer). Out of all the places I have applied for that I actually want to work for, I have only gotten one interview and I am currently waiting to hear back from them. The dilemma is, if the dream job falls through, do I take the offer I have that I dislike the commute, is under my bottom dollar amount, and wont give me the type of experience I want. I am not hurting for money,I can go back to working in the trades if I have to, it is just depressing sitting in my parents house all day doing nothing.

20zw3g,2,2014-03-21,"Contemplating studying abroad at Ozyegin university, in Istanbul, Turkey or do something else with a free semester? Thoughts?",LongandLanky,Erasmus,https://www.reddit.com/r/Erasmus/comments/20zw3g/contemplating_studying_abroad_at_ozyegin/,"So I went and talked to all the school officials and am currently working on paper work to study abroad in Istanbul, Turkey. I am getting close to the deadline and am planning on going in and getting help with some of the paperwork today after work.

A little background:

This is my junior year of college and I know that might be considered a little late to be thinking about studying abroad, but I am currently way ahead in classes. I started an internship in the Fall and have been working 30 hours plus taking 15 hours these last two semesters and originally was planning on trying to graduate early this summer, but after working this many hours and seeing like the grown up life is like, I really want to take a semester off and be a kid one last time before I enter the corporate life. My plan is to work and take classes through the summer and then study abroad next fall in Istanbul, Turkey, then come back in the spring, try and get my internship back and pretty much kiss my childhood away.

My only concern, is that I don't even need the classes that I would be taking when studying abroad, I really just want to travel and see the world one last time before its only 3 weeks off a year corporate style. However, I'm not sure if I should spend the money on tuition and study abroad in Turkey, or if I should just backpack across Europe or something more along those lines. I'm open to other ideas as well, and am not restricted to Turkey, or even Europe for that matter. I just want one last great experience while I'm young.

TL;DR Should I study abroad in Istanbul Turkey even though I don't need the classes/hours or should I do something else with a free semester, and if I choose to do something else what should I do - obviously want to keep it travel related.

Oh and I'm not new to reddit, for the first couple years I was strictly a lurker, and then when I wanted to comment on things I realized my username was not anonymous, so I created a new username, but didn't like it so I created this one, which I like better. (As you can tell I'm going through a semi-mid-mid life crisis)

You were the first relationship I had that lasted more than a few weeks after my relationship in freshman year. My boyfriend in freshman year manipulated me emotionally to get his way. Always crying about how I didn't trust him and that's why I should be okay with doing things I wasn't comfortable with.

I told you that and you said you ""understood"" why I didn't feel comfortable kissing and making out and you having your hand in my pants. I thought you were different and you loved me. I thought maybe you could be someone special. So I let myself be abused. 

You told me two months was enough time to have sex. I mean, I wasn't waiting for marriage but I wanted to be in love. But you told me there was no love without sex and I gave you my first time. You didn't even care to ask if it was my first time until you saw the blood. 

You fingered me in class often and fought with me when I said it didn't make me comfortable. You said things like you would dance with me and then go disappear with your friends. You'd break up with me over nothings like loving you too much and not being excited over getting accepted into a college I didn't want to go to for a major I hated. But I was going through hard stuff and being with someone brought me comfort.

After graduation I couldn't hold more than a seasonal job so my stepmother and my father kicked me out. No friends could/would help me so you and your family let me in. I appreciated it I really did, even if I had to sleep in your sisters room and we couldn't be in the same room with the door closed. You wanted to have sex all the time though. In the parking garage at your uni, in parking lots at burger king, even in your bed room while your little sister with down syndrome slept in your bed right next to us. I hated that.

You worked all weekend and went to school during the week and the only attention you could spare me was for sex or to cook (because your parents were never home) the rest of the time was dedicated to your computer. Even with a pregnancy scare you left me on my own. Then you broke up with me because you didn't know what to do with your career but you wanted to be friends with benefits. I wanted to stay together so I took it until you took me back.  You controlled me. I wanted to do an internship over the summer and you told me if I did we would break up. So I didn't.

I thought we were going to be together for a long time. I hated it. I hated you. But I needed you. I needed this. I wanted to love and be loved. I wound up cheating on you emotionally. I met him in a online game. He told me all the things you didn't. Gave me attention when you didn't. But he didn't want to love a girl so far away so we stopped talking and I felt more broken than before.

My grades were dropping. I couldn't find a job. Things were going bad between your sister and myself. One night you and I fought and I left to my friend's apartment. I couldn't stay long and my life had no direction so I tried to kill myself. I failed and my parents took me back home and you took me back. I thought I was so broken no one else would want me so I stayed with you.

I found a job around that time. The same job as you but another location. I loved customer service so it made me happy. I'd go to school with you, come home, then work my weekends away. You had a job too. Not even 3 minutes away from my house. When I was lonely I'd call you to come over just a few minutes but you were always too tired. 

Time passed and I made a friend at work. I was shy but it happened fast. He had a crush on me and tried to give fate a push by doing things like asking the manager on shift to put me with him so he could show me the ropes. Our work was 30 minutes away from my house and he lived right by our workplace. But he would drive me home, take me to work, pick me up to hang out. 

Things were getting bad with my stepmother again and I fought with her. This boy drove to my house after work to climb through my window and hold me as I cried. You could not even stay on the phone to comfort me. I cheated on you again. I was afraid to leave you with our two years between us. I was afraid to leave you for someone I barely knew. You talked about how we would marry and I thought that was my only fate. 

I gathered up the courage to at the least tell you I needed a break. I needed time. I needed to assess my life. You said no and we broke up. But you came back days later to tell me you wanted to be friends with benefits.   I didn't want that so you said you didn't want to talk to me again. 

That's fine. I'm with the boy that was once my coworker. We have an apartment. We have a cat. I don't feel neglected. I don't feel forced into anything. He cooks with me. I play video games with him. I am happy and though I did you wrong the world isn't black and white. I've come to terms with myself. I don't hate me. I don't hate you. I will finally move on now that it is off my chest."

I have had two previous internships and believe I have a well polished resume: https://www.dropbox.com/s/8aqsd4gdtsuqq8v/Resume4Reddit.docx

I've been getting a lot of phone interviews but have been hearing the broken record of ""pursuing other qualified candidates.""

I've been looking on angellist.co, indeed.com, and have been getting calls from recruiters after putting my resume on dice.com.

Am I doing something wrong? Is there a site out there that I should be using?


Edit: I've recently accepted a full time position and will be starting next Monday!

What I did was I kept applying to entry level software engineering/developer jobs on indeed.com.
I actually didn't change much to my resume and have actually received praise from interviewers on it.
Looking up companies around me on Google Maps was also really helpful. As many don't put their openings on job boards.

My advice is to:

* Keep yourself busy with side projects and always keep learning.

* Read *Programming Interviews Exposed* by Eric Giguere, John Mongan, Noah Suojanen.

* Keep interviewing and study for all of them. The more you interview, the better you get at it so don't get discouraged!

* Dress nicely. I can't say that this was the reason for my hire, but I decided to wear a blazer, dress shirt, tie, jeans, and dress shoes and was able to get offers from 2 places I interviewed at wearing that attire.

* Exercise. Who wants to hire someone who doesn't look healthy?

* Cater your responses to fit the job description. Especially ""What do you enjoy doing?"", ""What classes did you really enjoy during your time at school?"".

* Enjoy yourself and never stop improving yourself!"
210ue6,6,2014-03-21,Is this really what working at a startup is like?,BansheeThief,startups,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/210ue6/is_this_really_what_working_at_a_startup_is_like/,"I posted this on r/entrepreneur, but I don't know if that subreddit gets many visitors. 
Just to preface, I am currently a student studying CS, getting ready to graduate in June. I've always wanted to work at a startup and haven't been interested in working at a big company since my last internship. I've applied to a few companies, but none of them have really interested me and I've been denied from all of them.


Recently, I went to a startup career fair and met another student who has his own startup. He is not a technical founder and doesn't seem to know much about programming. However, he is very passionate about his company and I think he is a hard worker. I think his company is a great idea and it seems like it has potential.


Last summer he had a team of ""interns"" working all summer, unpaid, developing the site. They were somewhat successful, but the site still has A TON of work before it is really ready. No one returned or really communicates with him anymore either.

I recently joined him as the head (and only) programmer. He wants me to be a founder with him, which means I'll get more stake in the company and have more responsibilities. At first, I was really excited about the idea, and actually joining a startup. I've always wanted to do this, and I know there will be many struggles along the way.


However, I think I bit off more than I can chew. First, there is no documentation for the code and very few comments. The style is terrible and I now understand why schools stress little things like relevant variable names (so many variables with only 3 letters), proper indentation and comments. 


I'm the only programmer and he has almost no idea how the site actually works. I've tried reaching out to the ""interns"" from last summer, but none of them have responded. Its using NodeJS, Javascript and MongoDB, which I know, but I'm still fairly new to. 


On top of this, it is all unpaid and I really need money so I'm working 2 part time jobs on top of going to school full time and being an active member of 2 student organizations. He has given me equity in the company, but if it isn't making any money, I could have 90% equity but that means nothing. 


Finally, he has been kinda unrealistic about the deadlines. I only joined a few weeks ago and he is already bugging me about a release when the site is no where near close. A friend of mine worked on the site last summer and warned me about this. He said the founder was terrible about deadlines and kept pushing the coders to release the site even though it was nowhere near close. I understand the importance of deadlines but I also think its important to listen to your team and be realistic about a deadline. 



I hope this isn't complaining, but I'm starting to wonder if I made a poor choice in joining this startup. One of the last things in life I want is to be working at a big company that I care nothing about. I want to be passionate about what I'm working for, and I think I can do that by founding my own company.


I'm starting to think I should quit, join a startup with some funding already, learn some more from people who are doing it right than go off to start/cofound my own company. But is that unrealistic and will these problems just exist at any other startup?


**TL;DR:**Passionate about startups and music. Joined a student startup with only one other person, a non-technical founder. Excited at first, but after stressful deadlines, no help and no money, I'm starting to wonder if I made the right decision. Is this seriously the startup life?"

**Google - Engineering Practicum**

* Formerly had a FEP (Freshmen EP) and an EP but starting 2013, it's just known as EP. 
* Applications start somewhere in September/October. 
* Apply online, there's a few essay questions (3 with one optional, around 200 words maximum). 
* Do **not** wait until the last minute to apply, seats will fill up a few weeks before the deadline.
* This is for freshmen and sophomores.

**Microsoft - Explore Program**

* Don't really know when applications open up but I applied around the 1st of October and interviews had begun by the first week or so of November. So keep going back to the Explore page around early September.
* Apply online. Really easy, just need to upload a resume and a very short title.
* This is for freshmen and sophomores.

**Facebook - Facebook U**

* As of March 2014, this is their second summer hosting this internship so it's relatively new.
* Really really short application timeline ... started around January 6th, 2014 until February 28, 2014.
* Apply through your Facebook account with your resume and then you need to send in your college and high school transcripts and your SAT/ACT scores. Also, they will give you a prompt for an essay - 1 page maximum.
* **Important** First years/freshmen ONLY!

**Qualcomm - Early Identification Program**

* This one is a bit more unique, it is less advertised. So when Qualcomm visits your career fair, make sure to talk to the recruiters and give them your resume. Then do a followup around late December/early January. Last year, interviews were held in January, this year it was late February and early March.
* Just need your resume to apply. 
* Again, freshmen/first years only.

**Intel - IRISE**

* This is the one I know the least about.. I heard about it in early January so I don't know when the application process opened up. All you need to do is submit your resume when applying online.
* Freshmen/first years only.

My advice for all of these? Apply to all and apply early. Bookmark all the links to these internships and keep checking every few days to see if the application has opened or not. Go to the career fair (yes even as a first year) and talk to the recruiters. Mention that you're interested in their programs and ask if they can tell you more. It also helps to have some computer science knowledge (but not required) when applying - at the end of the day, companies want to see your passion for cs. Good luck!"

Don't see any alternatives.,[deleted],getting_over_it,https://www.reddit.com/r/getting_over_it/comments/211e49/i_15m_want_to_kill_myself_dont_see_any/,"To start off a story, I've had a stressful life. My mom left me when I wasn't even 3, barely pays the child support she is court-ordered to pay, and only shows up in my life when its convenient for her. I live with my step-mom and dad. They are on the brink of divorce. Dad treats us (kids) like shit sometimes, and doesn't ever spend time with us. When he does spend time with us its either at the dinner table or when he wants the house clean. Stepmom has told him he's an asshole because he expects too much. Dad used to be abusive to me and my older brother but not to my younger sister. He spoils her with about everything he can give her, but when I ask to do something little, he always asks me ""Can you pay for yourself? You are gonna get a job because life's not gonna hand you everything you need in life."" Little being that I want to take my girlfriend out to a movie tonight or tomorrow because she's vacationing in Florida for 2 weeks starting Monday. My dad always goes off about me not having a job. I dont know where I'd get one, considering I'm 15, and would rather not do an internship/ work program because I'm struggling academically. Who's going to hire a 15 year old who has personal problems and is suicidal and also lacks academically?  

I've tried getting help for the stress but the counselors at my HS don't listen like they should. They just nod their head and at the end say ""I don't know what to tell ya."" I've talked to my parents and they tell me I'm too sensitive and that being this way gets me nowhere in life. They simply don't listen. My dad threatens to kick me out when I have emotional breakdowns. I talk to my grandma once in a while about it and she said she'd take care of me if I need her to once I get out of the house. I don't believe her because my grandpa died 2 years ago in a car accident (I was there with him and her) and now my grandma has found another boyfriend and she just really doesn't seem the same since she's met him. She never answers my late-night emotional calls because she's out with her new boyfriend. I don't want my grandpa replaced because he was one of the only people who I actually looked up to in my life. Now he's gone.  

My friends are out of the question. They don't listen worth shit and most of them are out doing drugs or partying. Funny thing is, I believe drugs / drinking / smoking is bad. It seems like the only people who are actually here for me are my girlfriend, grandma (somewhat) and my birth mother's ex-boyfriend who was more of a father figure than my dad.  

tl;dr - I'm having emotional, academical, and immediate family problems. Nobody will really help me or comfort me with the exception of maybe 3 people. I've attempted suicide and am thinking about it again. Only problem is I feel that's my only resort. Any help would be appreciated. Are there any alternatives except Suicide? I've tried everything I can but nothing just seems to work."

Let me preface by saying that I know what mistakes I made and I have to live with those mistakes for the rest of my life.  I'm not asking for people to point out that I made the mistakes as I already understand some of the things that I have done regarding this situation are wrong.


With that, I'll start from when I first met the friend with benefits (we'll call him Luke).  I've known him since last August when I started taking his kickboxing classes at our university.  We hung out a few times with other people, and then the first time we hung out just me and him, one thing led to another and the whole FWB thing started.  This is where we encounter mistake #1, I was dating someone at the time (who will be referred to as Tim).  Unfortunately, he was gone on an internship for 3 months, so I didn't want to ruin that for him by ending our 3+ year relationship while he's having the best time of his life.  I waited till he got back to break it off, which was a disaster.  I was honest, I told him what happened, and it sucked.


Back to Luke.  While it didn't seem that he wanted much more than FWB, he still didn't want to mess up what I had with Tim, so he cut things off and eventually started dating someone else (Rachel).  By cut things off, he completely avoided me from December-January.  At the beginning of February, he texts me out of the blue and says he wants to hang out.  We go out to dinner, he tells me Rachel broke up with him that morning, which was fine with him because apparently they just argued most of the time.  He told me I was the first person he thought of talking to, and that he felt bad for dropping me the way he did but didn't expect things to start up with us sexually again.  He just wanted to be friends and start hanging out again.  


Of course that didn't last long.  Back to being FWB, but now I'm starting to feel a little more serious about him.  We constantly spend time together and we know we care about each other a lot, but he doesn't trust me with the whole issue the first time back in October when I was still dating Tim.  Honestly, I don't trust him much either.  He's an asshole and I know he is, all his friends have told me he is.  But then they tell me he is still a good guy, and I still see that side as well.  Twist in the story, I would pursue a relationship with him if I were staying in this area, but I am leaving for an internship in Florida come mid-May.  It will last for the summer and after that I will be done with university and have no set plans (so I could come back here, I could stay there, etc.).  I'm not sure if I would trust starting a relationship with him and then leave for 3 months, and frankly he shouldn't trust me either considering the way things started.  That's the main reason I am trying to avoid deep emotions.  But the heart is stupid sometimes and falls for people it sometimes shouldn't.  I haven't really discussed furthering this relationship yet, but we both make little hints about it suggesting that there is something a little more there.


Advice?  Should I just stick with the FWB thing till I leave, should I talk to him about possibly furthering our relationship to become actual bf/gf, should I drop everything (not preferable), or is there another suggestion?

What should I do moving forward?,[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/211ftf/is_this_girl_21f_interested_in_me_20m_what_should/,"So, I'm in a weekly, three-hour course with this girl, and I've kind of developed a crush on her recently. She sits by me, and we haven't really talked too much, but when we have talked it's been kind of flirty. I see her glancing or looking at me or over in my direction a lot, she's laughed at a lot of the things I say, plays with her hair a lot, and she's complimented me on class or this big time internship I'm getting a bunch of times. 

She's a bit out of my league, but I figured I have nothing to lose. So, I added her to Facebook yesterday, and we messaged back and forth for about 4 hours (with a few breaks) about class at first. We ended up talking for a while, eventually moving completely off the topic of class and just talking about random stuff haha. She seemed pretty into the conversation, sending back needlessly long answers to questions I would ask and kinda playing around with me. I told her I'd message her again the next day with some info for class we were trying to figure out.

So, I did and talked to her again for a little bit about that class again first of all, and then mainly about herself, like what her plans are for after college, what she's into, and stuff like that. We talked for like 2 or 3 hours (though there were a couple breaks), and it as going really well. But then the conversation just kinda ended. 

What do you think? Is she into me? How should I go about asking for her number and eventually out on a date? Should I be worried she never messaged me back (although admittedly the conversation was probably going to end soon anyway)?"

I am the 2013-2014 Chairperson of the student branch chapter of IEEE at San Jose State University.

Throughout the semester the IEEE officers and I have organized different types of events for the other students in the Electrical Engineering Department as well as the College of Engineering. Some of the events we organize are Workshops, Information Sessions, Technical Talks, Industry Talks, and Professional Talks.

As the summer is quickly approaching I've been trying to focus on getting companies to come in and do Information Sessions since I know there are a few quality individuals still looking for positions.

An Information Session is an:
&gt;Event in which companies have the opportunity to explain their various job and internship positions as well as give information about the company and its organizational culture.

Basically it's a chance for companies who are still looking to fill full-time and internship position to promote their company and take resumes from exceptional candidates.

In the past we've had Information Sessions featuring Texas Instruments, Xilinx, PLX Devices, Anritsu, NASA Glenn Research Center, and Brocade. This semester we still have two tentative talks from Ericsson and Lam Research.

So, if there are any Silicon Valley companies still trying to fill a decent amount of Electrical Engineering internship and full-time positions I'd love to get in contact with you and schedule something. Send me a PM if you're interested or I can give you my email and we can collaborate that way.

Thank you."

Well, there are things that I have noticed that might help you as well.

1. Never stay at home and keep yourself as busy as possible. I am in college so I debate and have taken up an internship
 
2. Yoga and meditation does help. It might seem ineffective at start but over a period of time it starts helping you
 
3. exercise in whatever way you like. For me it was cycling. It is relaxing and redirect your energy somewhere else.

4. Maintain hygiene, though sounds pretty unrelated and small against PMO. But hygiene is very important like brushingm and taking a bath.

5. Go out and interact. My acne stops me sometimes from doing that but it is very important. Unless you wont open up you wont heal 

6. IF you are on the verge of relapsing start talking to somebody on facebook immediately. Regardless of whoever he/she is it would take your mind of PMO for a while giving the room for decision making that this is gonna end up bad 

Hope this helps :)"

In the most important stage of my adolescent life, my oldest sister ran away from home because of problems I didnt understand at the time. My parents were devestated and were in severe depression. They often contemplated suicide infront of a 17 year old me very confused at the time. With my parents not really acting as a parents and sort of stuck in 'idle mode' I went to university, paid completely on my own through heavy student loans and working 2-3 part time jobs. During that period of my life, I blocked everything out and just became indifferent. 

I realized now that I'm older, I have had no one in life to look up to or talk to about problems or learn from. I feel I have done everything on my own and find it so hard to do things. I learned how to shave on my own, how to drive, how to be a man, but sometimes I feel like I cant do and wish I had someone I could talk to. 

My relationship with my dad has been none. All I've ever talked to him about was the Maple Leafs and weather. He sees me now as a man (Im 21) and how much I've done on my own and tries to bring me food to make it better but its just too late. I landed an awesome internship making amazing money, doing really well in school, travelling for work and going on exchange to Singapore, working out and learning to play the piano. I just wish I had someone to tell me to stand tall when I felt small and walk with my head high than doing it on my own. 

I have no family here except for one set of cousins since my parents were immigrants. Ofcourse family problems limited how close I was with them and dont have any other family around. Because of my sister running away, my parents cut off all ties with there friends. No older brothers, only an older sister who ran away. My only role models were Goku and Mats Sundin, and once I become old enough to realize I needed a real one, I become my own role model. Telling myself what I know needs to be done vs. whats wrong.

I know this is all an excuse, and it is what it is, but somedays I break down because I need some guidance in my life. The world is big and I'm tired of going on my own. Sadly, today is one of those days where I just didnt have the courage to tell this girl how I feel about her, and I dont know who talk to about this. 

I dont know what I want to hear right now but it feels good to get this off my chest. Why is it so frustrating? I get really sad when I hear people have awesome relationships with their dad/ rolemodels"
212i1o,1,2014-03-22,My [19M] ex-girlfriend [17F] and I recently broke up but we're still extremely close and talk everyday like everything is fine. It hurts sometimes.,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/212i1o/my_19m_exgirlfriend_17f_and_i_recently_broke_up/,"Backstory:  I'm extremely picky about girls (call me Ted Mosby).  About 3 years ago I met this girl who I absolutely clicked with on every level.  We both loved the same things, played the same sports, and could talk for hours on end about anything.  Nicest, quirkiest, most down to Earth girl I've ever met.  I, who takes forever to really like someone, fell for her instantly.  It was blissful, and I went off the college 2 years ago as I was 2 years older, and things were wonderful despite long distance.  I'm an engineering major at a top university and I really made it a point to be on top of my schoolwork so I don't go out and ""experience"" college in terms of partying and socializing.  My closest friends are people in my classes.  Instead I'm swamped with hours and hours of projects a week- averaging at least one all-nighter per week.  She's what actually keeps me sane through all of this.


But in the last half-year or so of our relationship, things kind of got distant between us.  I was frustrated/stresed a lot with school, and she would start to neglect me, which be would frustrate/stress me out more.  I love making grand gestures to share that I care, like flying back home and surprising her at her high school dance last year.  This year I came down again for the same dance (we agreed this time), ended up talking about the issues in our relationship, and we kind of broke up the next day.  I believed we could fix our issues (I don't like to give up), she had it in her head that she couldn't bring herself to try in our relationship anymore, so she ended things.


The weird thing is that right after that we were talking not an hour after the breakup like normal.  I think it hadn't hit me at that point that it actually happened, and we were still talking like normal for a month after that 'as best friends'.


Pretty much after that my life kind of went into a downward spiral.  I found out I'm very at risk for cancer, my grades started to plummet due to suddenly being unable to focus on school, my internship for the summer fell through, and I found myself angrier, more stressed out, etc (typical break up stuff I guess).  What got me through all that?  Her.


We still Skyped everyday and talked.  I'd have to remind myself all the time that things aren't the same, but I'm still very much in love with this girl.  She's perfect.  She's my happy place when I'm stressed beyond belief.  For 3+ years I've wanted nothing more than to just talk to her all the time.  She's the only person I can go to to get problems like school off my chest... but what who do I talk to when she becomes the problem?


Recently I came home for spring break.  Things for the last 2 weeks had been fine.  We were still talking *alot* and we were really close still.  For some reason I came home with the unwavering confidence that everything would end up OK.  So I asked her out again... but no.  Then it hit me.  Everything I should've been feeling for the last month+.  All the grief, the realization that I'm never going to move on if we keep doing this, the emotional pain.  The realization that either I was going to have to lose my best friend or keep living with this and hope one day I just won't feel the same about her anymore (and even then, would we be this close anymore?) or hope she comes back around.  She admitted that we did connect as much as two people could, but she didn't want to go back to being in a relationship.  I didn't know how to take it, and I didn't know how to deal with the *massive* weight suddenly on my chest... so I told her we couldn't be friends anymore then.  It would just be too hard for me.  


I don't want that.  I *do* want to be her friend again.  I want to be more than that again.  I don't know if I'm better off cutting her out of my life and dealing with this immense pain for as long as it takes me to get over her (as well as the inevitable Fs/Ds in my technical courses that will come along with the depression), or keep talking to her, finding a way to deal with the small knot growing in my chest, and hope one day in the future things work out.  I never doubted they would when we first broke up ... but now I don't know how to feel or think anymore.  I like the idea of hoping. I know it's stupid because she's still in high school going to college next year and I'm in college but... she's my lobster.
---   
**tl;dr**:I'd really prefer if you read my story but...perfect relationship for 2.5 years, starts to go south a bit.  I think we can work it out, she breaks up with me.  I'm still her best/closest friend and we talk 24/7.  I love talking to her and I want to, but it sucks for me because I know I'm not as happy anymore/ can't move on if I keep doing this.  Ask her out again, get rejected, cut off all ties with her- don't know if i want to.  Life in shambles.  Help? :/"
212w19,12,2014-03-22,Staying with my girlfriend out of guilt/insecurities...,[deleted],confession,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/212w19/staying_with_my_girlfriend_out_of/,"A bit of a backstory: We've been together for the better part of the last seven years. We broke up for about six months and I was pretty lonely. I moved to a new city after our breakup to live with a friend and continue my community college education before transferring to a university. We ended up getting back together and I moved to another new city and she followed.

Ever since we moved in together (again) in this new city, things have been rocky, up until the past couple of weeks. She had trouble adjusting to everything, was pretty depressed, and ended up dropping out of community college for a second time and now attends cosmetology school. She smokes so much weed that it definitely interfered with her studies. She finally admitted to having an addiction to weed recently but she won't try to quit because she can't do it without any sort of outside help. She doesn't have health insurance, so even seeing a psychologist is out of the question because neither of us can afford it. She works third shift at a fast food restaurant and can't get a decent job because she can't pass a drug test to save her life. She had an opportunity at a retail store to make more money and have normal day hours - but I was out of town and she didn't wake up to go to her job and they wouldn't give her another chance. She hasn't applied for any other jobs and the only reason she got the first one is because I filled out the application for her - She has no motivation to do find a new job even though she absolutely hates her current one. She suffers from depression and can be very bipolar and often sleeps 10-12 hours a day.

Now I've received an opportunity to intern at the most prestigious hospital in my state, which will require me to move about an hour and a half away. I accepted the position and she can't move with me because of her attending cosmetology school. She's complaining that I don't put her first and how she moved here to be with me and now I'm leaving her here shows that I can't put her first. I feel really bad about it and I know I'm an asshole for it and maybe she's right - but this opportunity could open up so many doors in my future. This scenario is oddly enough bringing us closer together, mainly because her attitude completely changed, but I think it's mainly because she's afraid I'm going to break up with her.

I can't bring myself to break up with her because I dragged her hours away from home and pretty much wasted the last year of her life by getting back together with her. We have so much history together and even though it may not seem like it, I do love her - Unfortunately it's difficult to say something good about someone when you're so frustrated. 

I'm also afraid of being alone. I know I'm a good looking guy and could probably find someone else - but I'm not all that confident in my conversational skills or ability to impress a woman. This past year I haven't even made a single new friend in this new city because of how quiet I am and how shitty I am at making small talk. If I break up with her, I'll be completely alone when I come back after summer.

Honestly, I don't expect much advice other than ""Just break up with her"". I just needed to get my thoughts and feelings out there because I haven't told anyone any of this stuff."

I'm currently finishing my second year of college for my Computer Science degree. I recently realized that I only have two more Computer Science classes (AI and Software Engineering) I have to take for my major because my advisor recommended that I start my Comp Sci classes early in order to have more experience by the time I graduate. The rest will be either Gen Ed classes or classes for my minor. I do plan to take a couple of Comp Sci electives though.

   My problem is that I feel sort of lost at this point. My first year of college was marred by some depression and because of that I wasn't taking my schoolwork all that seriously. I had no motivation to do any programming (or school work in general); I just wanted to be at home and play video games all day. My GPA and my learning in general sort of suffered (my GPA less than my learning), and while I've gotten out of that phase and am more motivated and serious about my work, I feel like I missed out on a lot of important foundational knowledge.

   I'm not really sure where I'm supposed to be at this point or how much of that information I should have absorbed. It's difficult for me to sit down for more than 10 minutes at a time to read a complex OS concept in a book in the first place. With that on top of the depression I was going through my first year, I feel like I missed out on fully understanding some of the foundational principles I was taught. Now I feel like I'm trying to learn new concepts that rely so much on things I should have learned earlier that I'm too far down the rabbit hole to catch up.
     
   I know C#, a little bit of C++, Object Oriented concepts, some SQL, and html/javascript. I've come out of most of my more ""conceptual"" classes like Operating Systems and Algorithms a bit dazed and not really sure of what I'd learned, despite having gotten decent grades in the classes.

   On top of all this, I'm starting to plan on doing more independent work and contributions, since I'll have more time to dedicate to non-schoolwork programming. I'm also going to talk to my advisor about looking for internships soon. 

   (tl;dr) To sum it all up, I'm finishing up the ""Computer Science"" part of my Computer Science degree and feel like I haven't learned as much or done as much independent work as I could've/should've. I'm afraid that I'll be stuck doing some mid to low level corporate job I don't really enjoy doing because I screwed up my education and therefore limited my options. How can I gauge where I am as opposed to where I should be? Additionally, what are some good places to start for independent learning (books to read, sites to visit, etc.)? How should I move forward from here, in more general terms?"

I hope this is an okay place to post this, but I'm a recent grad who moved to the Princeton area about a year ago from NY to start work at a consulting firm. The work has been fun, but I've found myself becoming more and more interested in learning about computers and programming. I did not study CS in school, so everything I've learned on the subject has been from google or by reading books I've found and I feel as though I'm kinda running out of steam and spinning my wheels.

I'm looking to see if anyone knows of any opportunities for internships (paid or unpaid) that would help me grow my programming skills. My interests lie mainly in the data analysis/app or web development realms, but I'm really just interested in learning as much as possible in a hands on situation. However the big thing is that since I work full time, I'd have to have my involvement be mainly on the weekends or at nights.

Thanks a lot for reading this and any for help you can provide!"

213hcp,1,2014-03-22,Me [22 F] with my boyfriend [24 M] ~2 years. I am having trouble managing with his anxiety and depression.,heisjustsosad,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/213hcp/me_22_f_with_my_boyfriend_24_m_2_years_i_am/,"Hi,

My boyfriend and I have been together for almost two years. We’ve been living together for a bit over one year, and we began renting together our current house last summer. I’m not going to bore you with justification about how much we love each other—we do!!!, and this post is going to be long enough as it is. I am looking for advice on how to deal with my (selfish?) feelings and still being there completely for my boyfriend. Let me apologize in advance for my ramblings. 

**His personal issues**: He suffers from anxiety and depression. He is on antidepressants, but I’m not sure if they’re working for him. From what I have learned about antidepressants, they take a while to kick in and it takes some time to find something that is right for an individual. When he misses a dose, he feels sadder and blames it on being late on his medication. Sometimes I feel like that is some sort of placebo effect. He doesn’t want to go see any mental health professional (his normal doctor prescribes the antidepressants) because they’ve failed him and someone close to him in the past. I’ve previously asked him if he had ever considered seeing someone again for his anxiety and depression for help. He was offended and explained his hatred for the mental health field. 

And while he does have mental health issues, his recent life events have not been easy. He quit his horrible job last May, which lessened his anxiety and sparked a deep depression in his inability to contribute to our household income. His little brother passed away suddenly last July. It is absolutely tragic, and everyone in their lives is still a mess. He wants to be there for his family, and he needs them there for him, but things are hard for all of them right now. His mother had emotional and medical trauma within the past month. Additionally, his best friend suddenly passed away. In sum, life is not easy for him right now. He had a part-time business internship from July-October, but he hasn’t been working since then. He’s in this rut and I don’t know how to pull him out.

**My personal issues**: I feel so overwhelmed. I am a full time college student (senior) and I work full time. I take on most of the household duties and have little to no free time. I’m afraid of falling into a rut, but I’m set to graduate soon. So that is going to be a huge lift of responsibilities. I get stressed out when the house is messy, or I have homework due/test coming up, and that completely demotivates me to clean or study. He is also not really interested in sex (once or twice a week). He tells me that it is because he is depressed and cannot just make himself have relations with me. This is understandable, and I really try not to push the subject. It is just very difficult for me. I don’t just want sex—I don’t desire anyone else, I don’t desire masturbation—I just want to be with him in that intimate way… if that makes sense. I feel unattractive because he rarely initiates, and I usually get shot down, except, he doesn’t want to shoot me down directly. He usually just says ‘Okay, we can do that later.’ But that later time doesn’t happen. I’ve asked him to directly say when he’s not feeling it instead of leading me on, but that hasn’t gotten us anywhere. When he still says ‘later,’ I don’t push the subject and say ‘when?’ because he feels like I’m pressuring him into it.

Additionally, I am so broke. My family has offered to give me cash to help pay bills, but I do not accept (except last month—a family member gave me an early graduation gift of two hundred dollars. I used it for groceries). I put myself in this situation; no one should have to bail me out. It is just so frustrating to spend so much of my time working/schooling/cleaning/cooking, and not have money to pay for an oil change on my car I can’t afford. Last April, I bought a new car (life was going well and I had a relatively high income surplus). I’ve already looked into selling it and getting something cheaper, but my payments wouldn’t be reduced for a while due to the amount I owe and the amount it is worth. We’re living outside of our means because we thought we’d have two income sources when we signed the lease. The bills are covered with my income, but we have about $100-200 per month for food/gas/toiletries for two people. I’m also afraid I’m neglecting others in my life. My mom has a full hysterectomy in January and had a big mass (non-cancerous!!!!) removed from an ovary (15 cm x 17 cm x 2 cm). I was there for her, but I was afraid I wasn’t there for her enough due to me being consumed with my boyfriend and his family issues. I’m working on visiting my family and friends more often. 

The worst of it is that I am afraid to share my issues with anyone. I don’t want friends or family to judge him without any considerations to what he is going through (they’ve already mentioned him needed to put more fiscal effort into our lives). I am not comfortable discussing my issues with him because he gets upset. He feels at fault, and then I feel like I’m putting him through a guilt trip. That is never my intention. I want to give him space and an environment that he can recover from his recent losses. Relationships are meant to give and take, and I want to be selfless for him in his time of need. But, I’ve developed mixed feelings about our situation. I feel like I’m overworked and I’m enabling him to further into his depression because he isn’t getting any better. On the other hand, I feel like I’m being selfish. He has been through so much in the past year, and he isn’t getting better yet because things keep adding up. It really is my responsibility to be there for him—not for his happiness, but as a support line. We’ve made an agreement to take the dog on a walk every day—I’ve heard that physical exercise helps—but he is hesitant when I ask him to go, and he is cranky on the duration of the walks. I’ve also considered making a chore list for the house, but I’m really not sure of a tactful way to do this. Our current situation has been ongoing for so long, I don’t know how to bring it up without making him feel guilty.

My question is: what is the best way to deal with someone with depression experiencing major losses? I’ve experienced multiple-month long depressions where I’ve felt helpless and numb, but I’m not clinically depressed. My worst bout was cured with adopting a puppy. I’m so afraid I’m not helping him. I don’t know what to do. I’ve never had a younger sibling pass away, I’ve never had a 20-something year-old friend pass away. I don’t know how to comfort him. I feel so selfish for putting my needs in front of his. I just need to know how to function. I am afraid that I am losing myself in his depression.

**TL;DR**: My long term, live in boyfriend has depression and anxiety and is going through a really hard time (unemployed, death of little brother, death of best friend, worries about his mom’s physical and mental health). I’m feeling selfish about my inability to balance supporting him and supporting myself. How can I make things better for the both of us?"

Then I look at entry level jobs and they are all like, do you have a bachelors?  have you heard of CAD? can you talk to people? then come on over we will teach and train you the rest of the way!!! Why is it like this, it seems very backwards to me. Are the internships just extra picky? Ive pretty much given up hope for an internship this summer, I am taking the FE in May and i have a goal to turn in one resume a day after this semester.

213qs7,7,2014-03-22,I [28F] am about done with the emotional abuse my boyfriend [28M] dishes out to me. [Long],iamfinished1223,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/213qs7/i_28f_am_about_done_with_the_emotional_abuse_my/,"Alright, I'm going to divide this by years, because he is my high school sweetheart and there is a lot to cover. We will call him ""Liam"". I am here to write things out, get constructive criticism, and words of advice for help to cope and solve the situation to best point possible.

**When we were 16:**

We began dating when were sixteen years old. We'd known of each since we were in elementary school, but didn't really start noticing each other and talking until high school. We ran into each other at the local skate park our freshmen year. He was being taught to skate by a buddy of his, but I already knew how, could drop into the bowl, and whatnot. He hung around while I skated and we talked and figured out we shared the same musical interest, video game interest, and had a lot of mutual friends. The following year, during sophomore year, he asked me out and I said yes.

Being his girlfriend sounded like a dream to me. I wanted somebody to listen to music with, skate with, and play video games with. He seemed like the right candidate for the job, too. He also had a band. Liam played guitar really well so his music inclination was always higher than mine, because I could not play stringed instruments well, keep a beat well, and I stopped playing the flute in middle school. I became instant friends with the bassist (Dan), other guitarist (Sam), and their drummer (Eddy). They readily accepted me into their group. In the first six months of our relationship, I attended a lot of his band practices, but the practices were hot and loud and I could have been devoting those hours doing something I enjoyed than sitting there and not even being able to talk to anybody because they were involved in their instruments so heavily.

So, I talked to Liam about it, and told him I'd still come to practices, but not as often as I was. He seemed little peeved about it. He has a short fuse, and he asked me what I was going to be doing if I wasn't going to be at practice. I told him school work, reading, and writing. I loved reading and writing and prided myself heavily on my writing. He seemed agitated and told me I could bring all of that stuff to practice, but I said I wanted peace and quiet. He got mad and told me something along the lines of do whatever you want, I don't care. I continued going to practices often, though I wasn't at all of them either.

Just before Liam's birthday, their bassist Dan, got arrested for selling marijuana at school, so he left the band as he had a lot going on. Liam was pretty upset his bassist was gone, but took on the bass himself. He learned quickly because he can pick instruments up like nothing.

Liam's birthday came and went and he turned 17. I arranged a little get together at the place his band practiced with some of his closest friends. I baked him cupcakes and an entire cake and made it a surprise. The drummer, Eddy, drove Liam to the practice house because Liam did not have his license yet due to his family not being to afford drivers ed. He was surprised, I gave him some band merchandise, his band played for his friends, and we all had a lot of fun. He told me he was very happy with everything and thanked me.

**When we were 17:**

My birthday approached not long after his. Two weeks before my birthday, he gave me the bass and told me he wanted me to learn it and join the band. I was really hesitant at first. I was not good at keeping a beat and it was extremely important the bassist stayed on time. And my hand was actually way too small to even fit around the neck of the bass. I tried and he began giving me lessons, but he grew impatient with me quickly, ending up yelling at me if I couldn't keep up or didn't understand how to play it or pluck it, or strum it. It set me on edge and made it very difficult for me to learn. I was scared to play in fear that he was going to snap at me. I tried so hard to learn, but his lessons were doing nothing for me. I felt trapped, like I had to be apart of his band, and told him right then and there, I could not join his band. I told him girlfriends had no business in the band anyways. He seemed okay with it.

My birthday came and on the way to school he said happy birthday! I was kind of excited to see if maybe he had something like my favorite candy, but there was nothing. He played his guitar all evening while I read a book. We did this often, we did our own things while laying in his room, not talking much. I enjoyed this quality time together, even if we were not talking, it was nice to know he was right next to me. When it was time for me to leave, he kissed me good bye and told me happy birthday again. While I was driving home, I felt slightly disappointed, but also knew he didn't have a job, so it's not like he could buy me anything cause he had no money.

A month after that, our one year anniversary came. We went out to eat and I presented him with some more band merchandise because he ate that stuff up like crazy. He didn't get me anything, but I didn't think much of it because he still had no job.

Shortly after the new year began, I got Liam a hook up as a dishboy at the local restaurant I waitressed at. He made more money than me, and actually kind of rubbed it in my face. He began buying food more for us and always asking if I wanted something, which is great.

**When we were 18:**

I got accepted into the college I hoped so dearly I would get accepted into. I was going to major in radiation therapy because I wanted to help people so much. When I got accepted, I called Liam, nearly crying tears of happiness, and told him. The college was only 15 minutes away and to save money for my parents, I was going to commute back and forth. When I told Liam, all he said was, ""Cool."" no congratulations, not a thing more. Just a ""cool"" and then ""I have to go. The guys are over."" He hung up and I didn't hear from him for the rest of the day. My feelings were hurt so much, that he wasn't excited for me. I was going to college for my dream job, but his music was suddenly more important than my accomplishment.

A month passed since I got accepted and Eddy asked what I was doing after high school. I asked him if Liam had told him I got accepted to college, since they were over when I told him, and Eddy said Liam never mentioned a thing. I was a bit peeved, so I confronted Liam and asked why he didn't tell anybody I got accepted into my dream college for my dream job. He said it wasn't a big deal and a lot of people got accepted into college, even though he wasn't going to college. I was so mad I almost couldn't see straight.

Graduation came rolling through and Liam decided, three days before graduation, he didn't want to walk the stage and encouraged me not to either, claiming it was stupid. I told him I wanted to walk the stage since my sisters did too. He told me it was stupid and I was a conformist, and cue big fight about it. We actually fought about walking the damn stage.

Graduation day comes and he tells me he is going to walk the stage. I told him good. We walked the stage and afterwards, skipped out on that weird high school walk in, and we all and the band went out to eat and hang out in the park, drinking and whatnot. That's when Liam announced he was applying to go to a culinary school. I was really happy for him and encouraged him, telling him he'd make a great chef and he said he would, too.

So college rolls around and I begin going to classes. I am beyond ecstatic and enjoying my classes so much. Liam wasn't in culinary school at that point, and spent most his days playing his guitar and going to work for a bit, only to come back and delve harder into his music. I told him all the time about college and how it was everything I ever imagined, and he always shut me down about it, saying that I was going to grow to hate it and that it was going to become the worst thing I ever did. Everytime I talked about college to him, he tuned me out or put me down, so I quit talking to him about it.

**When we were 19:**

Our three year anniversary rolled around. I got him some computer games and he bought me some college merchandise. He got me school spirit pens, a few T-shirts, and bought himself one, too, and wore it when he gave me my stuff. I was happy he was coming more around about taking my college seriously. He was accepted into culinary school and scheduled to start that spring. He was excited and I listened to him talk about it feverishly, all the time. It was like he was bit by the excitement bug. He also began talking to me about my classes and listened to me talk about college life.

Well, spring came around and he liked culinary school, but at the same time it stressed him out. He didn't have as much as time as he liked to have band practice, but I told him he had to make that sacrifice while he worked to become a great chef. He was distant during these times and mostly pushed me away, even though I wanted to help him. He told me my studies in radiation therapy was nothing compared to his culinary studies and that made me mad and withdrawn from him. I felt separated by him because he always played the ""poor me"" game. No matter what I said, if I was slightly agitated with something, he always told me he had it worse somehow.

For awhile, I buried myself harder in my studies and when summer break came, I missed college more than I realized I had ever missed Liam in the past months. His school also went on break and we took this time to relax together. We had steady jobs and were able to afford for us to go to Disney Land together. We had so much fun, I took a million photos, and made a whole photo album.

When school rolled back around, we fell into the same rut, where Liam was irritated with everything, that culinary arts was hard, that radiation therapy was still nothing compared to what he had to do. That he had to think on his toes while I was training to work in a controlled environment. It was irritating and I told him I didn't like to be put down like that and that my studies were just as hard as his were. Still he refused to believe and continued playing the victim game. I became so mad with him, I wouldn't contact him first. I would be sure to bury myself in something else and not think about him until my phone rang. And even when he called me to chat, all he talked about was himself and I rarely got a word in.

**When we were 20:**

My parents sold the house because they decided they wanted to travel in their retirement. So I found a two roomed apartment I could afford on my own because I was making good money at my current job and I was going to be getting an internship soon at a radiation center. My studies were coming along great and I was completing my classes effectively. Liam was still in his culinary studies, complaining as usual, wanting to already be a chef.

His band was getting gigs, so in his free time, instead of seeing me, he'd see the band and bandmates. I'd come over, work on my homework while they played, though Liam usually complained that I wasn't paying enough attention to the band and giving them constructive feedback, even though I had already written out an entire sheet of paper of things I liked and didn't like about their set list for the upcoming gigs.

He picked a fight over how I was always so busy and always playing the victim. He told me I was taking school way too seriously and that I should devote more time into the band. I told him I devoted as much as I could as I was trying to make sure I passed school with flying colors, worked enough so I had plenty of money, and make sure my apartment remained mine. He told me I was playing victim again, so I left band practice and didn't talk to him for nearly three days before he called me, acting like nothing happened, asking if I wanted to go out to eat with the band.

In the summer, during break, Liam stayed at my place a lot and began playing with the idea of moving in. To which I told him maybe not yet, mostly because I enjoyed living alone and it made my studies easier. Cue another fight about how I thought I was better than him because I was going to a full time university and that I thought he was inferior because he was just going to a small time culinary school. I told him that wasn't the case and that I was just trying to make it through school with flying colors. I told him maybe in a few years we could think about moving in, but as of now, I did not want that yet. He was pretty pissed, but a month or so later, got an apartment with his guitarist, Sam, a block away from me.

We spent equal time back and forth. We spent more time at my apartment because I did not want to intrude of Sam's personal space. Liam always left a mess, though, and I told him if he was going to stay the night, he was going to have to clean up after himself. He said he didn't like me mothering him, but complied anyway. He got mad when one evening I decided I wanted to study for an hour before we laid down for the night to watch movies and fall asleep. He was mad even though I tried to explain I had a big test the next day and wanted to be sure I was ready for it. He let me study, but made sure to play his guitar so I'd give up easier.

**When we were 21:**

Sam came up with the idea to take me to a bar for my 21st birthday. He was already 22, so when Liam's birthday came by, he took him to a bar because I was not of age to go. I bought Liam a new amp for his band, though and he was very happy for it. When my 21st birthday rolled around, Liam bought me my drinks at the bar, which I enjoyed very much. Liam got pretty drunk though, causing scene, so I had to take him home and clean up where vomited in the middle of my kitchen, but other than that, my birthday was pretty nice.

Liam began finding alcohol a lot better than when we were teenagers and when I went over to his apartment, he always had his coffee table littered with bottles while he was writing music or playing his guitar. He was always tipsy by 3 in the afternoon, and I confronted him, telling him he was drinking too much. To which he called me a prude.

That spring, Liam graduated from school and became a certified chef. Finding work was easy for him. He was making fantastic money. He bought me a new set of tires for my car, too. His drinking was getting out of hand, though. He was drinking so much, that when I called for him the evenings after he got off work, Sam told me he was already passed out. I worried for him and confronted him again, pleading he just drinking casually and for him to stop binge drinking to the point he passes out. He blew me off and told me I didn't know anything.

He really enjoyed his job and I could tell he was less stressed than when he was in culinary school. He enjoyed being a chef, he loved cooking, and he cooked for our dates often at my house. He cooked fancy things, as he worked at a nice restaurant that had a dress code and only hired chefs with college degrees in cooking. He was still drinking quite a bit, though. It was maddening to watch him wash down beer after beer as we casually hung out and watched TV. I told him to take it easy with the beer, but he said it was better to drink it fast. He'd be passed out by 9 in the evening, leaving me bored, and to the point I just got up and left, instead of staying the night with him.

**When we were 22:**

I got an internship at a radiation therapy treatment center. I was really enjoying it and that internship proved to me this is definitely what I wanted to do with my life. I was entering my internship years, coming closer and closer to graduating and it excited me.

I talked about it excitedly with Liam, who simply shut me down and began talking about work. And when I saw Liam on our free times, he looked horrible in my opinion. I asked Sam what was wrong with him and he didn't know. Liam was still downing beer like there was no tomorrow, but he looked tired all the time, physically drained. I urged him to go the doctor, which he finally did. He wasn't ill, but the doctor was able to prod out of him that he was abusing prescription medicines he was obtaining from work ties. I demanded he stopped drinking and stopped taking these pills immediately. I actually began crying and asking him if he realized mixing alcohol with meds could kill you, to which he didn't know.

And from then on, I didn't see him drink as much. He went through a bit of withdrawl to where he was grouchy and easily snapped at people if they crossed him wrong. But slowly, he grew back to his normal self. Just in time for our five year anniversary. He took me to the a get away resort and we had a good time and we came back feeling refreshed. During this time, Liam apologized for the time he spent in a different world. He made me feel like one of the happiest girls around. I talked to him about my radiation therapy course and he actually took an interest in it and told me I was doing a great job.

When we came back, it seemed like he reverted to his normal self. He wasn't interested in my work, but talked about his all the time, and was always playing guitar. Suddenly, I realized if I didn't call me, he could go a week without talking to me. I told him I didn't appreciate this and he asked if he had to do all the work. But he did begin calling more.

**When we were 23:**

My studies were coming to a close and I would be graduating soon. The place I worked at with my internship offered me a job after I graduated, where I would be making great money. I told Liam excitedly about my job offer, but he shut it down again and told me about how he made good money, too, and not to get so excited.

His band was still getting gigs and I attended all the practices and the shows, but he still complained I did more schoolwork than pay attention to the band. A huge fight broke out and Sam tried to break it up, but I stormed out of the venue and went home. He called me the evening and I told him I was at my wits end, that he didn't care about me it seemed, that it always had to be about him, and how he always shut me down when I talked about my career. He apologized over and over again and asked to come over.

He came over with some alcohol and we talked about everything as we casually drank on the couch. He said he was sorry he had been such a jerk lately, that he was stressed at work because a wedding was coming and he had never tried his hand at making a wedding cake himself and that he was nervous. And the bands recent success in the local scene made him jittery that it could become too overwhelming to have a band and a demanding cooking job.

I accepted his apology and asked that he just paid more attention to the things I liked to do and he said he could do that. He said he cared about me a lot and that he didn't want to lose me and that I had been with him through thick and thin.

The next couple of months were great, until he fell back into his normal self of neglecting me and shutting me down and I told him what he was doing and he told me to get over myself and give him space. I did. We didn't talk for nearly two weeks. He contacted me first to tell me he loved me and wanted to take me out to dinner, that he was trying his best to control his stress.

He talked to me about work at dinner, mostly. But I also got to talk about my work, too, and he listened. He told me that wedding he was baking the cake for was coming up this weekend and invited me to come sit in the kitchen and watch them make it and then watch the ceremony outside. I agreed. The day came to go attend the wedding. He came and picked me up, told me I looked nice, and drove us to his work.

The kitchen was busy and I stayed out of the staffs way. I gave them all water and coffee has they ordered for it. Everybody was frazzled to get this cake made. It was done beautifully. Liam was the one in charge and the one who created the cakes design and it was absolutely beautiful and all I could think about was how talented Liam was. The wedding was also beautiful. I stood with all the staff while the couple was married. The bride cried when she saw how beautiful the cake was and fell into Liam's arms thanking him over and over again.

After he got off work, we went and ate and spent some quality time together. Things were going really well.

**When we were 24:**

I told Liam my graduation date and talked about how excited I was. He half listened. My graduation came up fast. The night before, though, Liam came to my house and explained how he forgot to take work off for my graduation and now it was too late, as another big project was scheduled in the kitchen that he had to lead. I cried. He never apologized, but he left when he saw I wasn't going to cheer up about this.

My graduation day came up and I was supposed to feel happy as I readied myself to walk the stage into the next chapter of my life, but I couldn't feel happy knowing my boyfriend forgot about my graduation. I was so upset. I put time out for his graduation weeks in advanced. He called me before I left for graduation to tell my congratulations and that he loved me. All I said was thanks and hung up. My heart literally felt like it had been ripped out of my chest.

I walked the stage. My parents and sisters (27, 31) were there for me. Sam even came, too. Sam took me out to dinner and told me not to worry about Liam, that he was truly sorry and felt horrible about it. Sam told me Liam didn't sleep very well because all he could think about was missing my graduation. Sam and I went to a bar to celebrate more. Liam called Sam and told him he was home, so we went to their apartment. Liam greeted me with a hug and then they began working on their songs and music. Liam completely ignored me as I sat there for an hour and half. And eventually I got so bored, I got up and took the bus home. Liam called me and asked where I went. *He didn't even noticed I left*. I told him I went home because I was bored and being ignored on my graduation day. And he told me it was just another day and that I needed to chill out. I hung up on him.

He tried calling me the next day, but I ignored it all day long and opted to watch TV, order pizza, and read. He came over that evening to see me still doing what I had decided to do earlier and asked why I wasn't answering the phone. I lied and told him I hadn't heard it ring all day. He hung out with me, but we had to watch what he wanted to watch on TV, which pissed me off, but he told me it was better than the crap I watched on TV. I talked to him about how internship was turning into an actual job and he wasn't interested and even asked if I said anything because he was too engrossed in the TV, pizza, and beer I had laying out. We sat there in silence for two hours while he watched his show, and when it was over, he kissed me and left.

**When we were 25:**

My dream job was going just how I wanted it to and I was enjoying myself very much. Liam offered we move in together and this time I accepted. We found a bit of a bigger apartment and moved in together, splitting everything 50/50. He spent a lot of time on his guitar, writing music, and watching TV. I was fine with that, we spent time together of course, but most of the time he did his thing while I did my thing.

On weekends, we went out to eat usually, argued about something like music and what not, and then he went to do guitar stuff while I went to the gym to workout. Living together was simple, we were intimate and had good times, just I felt myself growing further and further about with him, because all it seemed like he did was complain.

I spent longer time at work to avoid his complaining, to have him always just ignoring me but just to acknowledge me by criticizing whatever I was doing. It was all getting so annoying.

**When we were 26:**

He suddenly had a problem with me going to the gym and told me he worried for me because I was going alone. I had been going to the gym during down time for three years. I didn't have a set schedule to work out to, it's just when I wasn't working or doing anything, I killed time by going to the gym. All I did was run on the treadmills. I put my headphones in and ran and cleared my head. It helped keep my weight balanced, too. It was doing no harm and I spoke to nobody at the gym.

I told him I wasn't going to quit going to the gym because I enjoyed running and didn't want to run around our neighborhood. It felt weird to just run out in the public. I worked I'd step on a crack or curve and twist my ankle, or attracted unwanted attention. I enjoyed running in a well lit and occupied gym in air conditioning. He finally stopped riding my back about it because he saw I wasn't going to budge, but he was so annoyed with me, I could see it.

He stopped cooking dinner for us, claiming he did too much of the cooking. I didn't care I had to cook, but after he started complaining about the way I cooked, I told him we would handle dinner in an ""everybody for them self"" manner. I told him he would have to find and cook his own food and I would do the same. This made for a little war between us. I would eat at the table and he would he eat in the living room. And finally he gave in and said he couldn't stand not eating together and he started cooking again.

He hated I made more money than him. He hated I was the breadwinner because he was always usually the breadwinner. He studied my labcoats extensively and when I asked what he was doing, he said he was just looking at the material to see if it matched his cooking uniforms material. Which it did. But something in the back of my mind said he was looking at it and looked for signs I may have cheated on him, which was weird of Liam because I didn't think he'd ever become paranoid I was cheating on him.

We went on Vacation to Mexico that summer and had a good time together. It always seemed like when we were on vacation we were back to being sixteen years old together, that we were laughing and enjoying each other more and that we were back to being a fresh couple with the future to look forward to.

But when we came back from vacation, it melted away and he was back to being lovey-dovey with a side of criticism.

**When we were 27:**

Sam lost his job and moved in with us, paying what he could as he took a job to tide him over. I had no problem with Sam moving in with us. He was one of the greatest friend Liam and I had ever had. Tensions seemed to evaporate for a bit but after Sam got settled into our household, he had to watch Liam and I fight over something stupid, like a TV shows plot, a video games graphics, about why one of us didn't like a certain type of food. It was pitiful, all we seemed to being doing was arguing. Sam told us to seek counseling, but Liam said he'd rather break up than receive counselling and I asked what was stopping him and stormed out.

I went to the gym for awhile and when I came home, Liam was mad I stormed out and he asked what gave me the right to do that. I blew up and told him I had the right to do whatever I want. I said I worked hard to have the money I have now and that I wasn't going to let him keep me from doing anything. He told me once again that I needed to cancel my membership because I did not have to pay to get a work out. I told him no because I paid for it so it was my choice if I wanted to continue it or not.

He told me I was immature and that's when I lost it and began crying and I asked him why in the world he thought he pulled rank over me like this. I asked him what made him think he could dominate me and control my life and I told him I couldn't take it anymore. I told him I wanted him to trust me no matter what I did and said I didn't liked to be undermined like this. Liam told me to stop crying. And that was it. He walked away.

**Now**

Things haven't become much better. Everything I do, he feels a need to comment on it and it's driving me crazy. How do I leave this ten year relationship as gracefully as possible? Any help would be great.

213qwv,2,2014-03-22,I'm confused and don't know what to think.,[deleted],dating_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/213qwv/im_confused_and_dont_know_what_to_think/,"Okay so I(17 Male) met this girl(18) that I fell desperately in love with (hell i even have her in my dreams) at work 2 months ago. She's an Intern and she's there for another week until her internship is over. 


We first met when I had to show her around in the goods recieving department. My boss is a cool guy so if we have girl interns he always sends them to me.

Usually I will just stand there and listen to their boring stories about all the stuff that I don't care about and show them what to do but this time it was different. Judging by her looks she wasn't my type at all but when I worked with her she talked about a lot of great stuff, made me laugh a lot and while doing all that she worked pretty hard.
While we were talking she also told me that she's single and never had a boyfriend and I told her the same about me.


So later that day she asks me if I would go to the canteen for lunch and if I wanted to take her with me. I always go to the canteen with a colleague so I said she can come with us. She worked with me for one week until she went to another department and i thought i wouldn't really talk to her again. 


Fast forward 2 weeks she randomly stops by and asks me if i go to the canteen and if i take her with me, i say yes and we do the same thing we did before. Just go and have lunch but this time it was different. She talked more than the last time, she looked me in the eyes all the time and she had this amazing smile on her face all the time. Now almost 2 months later we still go to lunch almost every day (never alone, usually theres 2-3 other colleagues with us) where we talk a lot, write a lot of e-mails to eachother at work but the signals are kinda getting weaker. 


There are days where we will sit there for lunch and she won't even look at me, not talk to me at all and I'm afraid it will seem weird if i'd just start talking to her while someone else at the desk is telling a story. So at lunch we didn't talk a lot? Well can just message her on facebook when I'm home and ask her how her day was, right? That's what I thought but often she will be online in facebook for hours and not even respond to my messages, if she responds its usually only one word. 


I feel like she's getting more and more attracted to my colleague who is always with us for lunch. I know that they get along pretty well but I also know that he isn't interested in her and he says that she's probably not interested in him. 


But there are still days where she will constantly look into my eyes, always give me that amazing smile and sit with me in the canteen for another 20 minutes even after all the other colleagues already left. I really don't know what is happening here. There are days where I feel like she's clearly telling me she likes me but sometimes I feel like she's completely ignoring me and not even trying to talk to me. 


I was almost certain that she liked me and was about to ask her to go see a movie with me but then came another day where she said like 2 words to me for the whole day. 


Now I'm completely unaware of what she might be thinking of me and I think that I misjudged the whole situation but next week it could go in the complete opposite direction again. We're rarely alone together so it's really hard to ask her out and I know that I had some perfect chances to ask her out where I didn't realize what a great moment it was to ask her out before so I'm afraid I will miss the next chance again. I don't know what the next week will bring but I know that I have to do something before she's gone. 

What is the next step? Should I just ask her out in front of colleagues at lunch? If I asked her out via e-mail or facebook that would be extremely weird, wouldn't it?


TL;DR: no

I have an internship starting in May and I need to dress ""business casual.""  It will be in the midwest, so it might be a bit toasty at times.  I've already looked through guides and inspiration galleries and have a fine idea on *what* to get, but where to get it and other specifics are unclear.  I've been trying to make improvements since I found MFA, and I think this is a great time to work on being ""fashionable.""

I already have 4 button-down shirts (casual), 2 dress shirts, 1 pair of dress pants (that I'm getting rid of) and a pair of skinny chinos.  Should I get slim instead?  Aside from that, I have a lot of purchasing to do.  I am on a budget, so let's say all-in-all sub $500, give or take.

Plain-toe Oxfords - Too plain?  Should I go with cap-toe or wing-tip instead?  Where can I get them for under $100?  I'm unsure on color as well, does it not matter brown or black as long as the belt matches?  Should I look to get two pairs or will one suffice?  Also, does a size 12 in vans and other shoes translate to a size 12 in dress shoe?  [Here's a pair I found myself](http://us.asos.com/ASOS-Shoes-in-Leather/zyxso/iid=2792924&amp;cid=4209&amp;Rf947=3574&amp;sh=0&amp;pge=0&amp;pgesize=36&amp;sort=-1&amp;clr=Black&amp;mporgp=L0FTT1MvQVNPUy1TaG9lcy1pbi1MZWF0aGVyL1Byb2Qv).  What do you think?

How many pairs of slacks vs chinos vs whatever should I buy for pants?  Where should I get them, what's a good price?  I really liked the fit of my [ASOS Skinny Chino](http://i.imgur.com/zsxu2bx.jpg) , but are they too tight for a work atmosphere/dress shoes?  (Side-note:  Does 'creasing' in the waist area after wearing for a bit mean they are too big, or is this typical with chinos?)

I'd like to get a blazer and ties to wear occasionally, though this isn't a necessity (especially in the summer).  Should I try and find one at Goodwill?  I like [this](http://imgur.com/nwx71) and [this](http://imgur.com/0R3gpTP).  I feel like that might be an expensive item.  As for ties, I think a linen/cotton ties will work fine, just not sure where to find them.

For belts, I think I can find one or two at JCPenney's or something, as well as [this Timex watch](http://www.jcpenney.com/timex-mens-brown-leather-easy-reader-watch/prod.jump?ppId=1c3bfc9&amp;catId=cat1002300029&amp;deptId=dept20000020&amp;Nao=24&amp;pN=2&amp;topDim=Brand&amp;topDimvalue=timex&amp;dimCombo=Brand%7C&amp;dimComboVal=timex%7C&amp;currentDim=Brand&amp;currentDimVal=timex&amp;colorizedImg=0900631b81c62008M.tif&amp;urlState=/jewelry-watches/shop-departments/watches/shop-watches/men-s-watches/timex/_/N-gkqrnhZvg/cat.jump).

Given the above, is $500 a good budget for this or am I looking at more money?

Thanks in advance."

214ai2,4,2014-03-22,It took a trip to the ER for me to realize it's time to quit.,[deleted],leaves,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/214ai2/it_took_a_trip_to_the_er_for_me_to_realize_its/,"On Tuesday night I prepared for my nightly ritual. Hop into some pajamas, lay down on the couch, put on a funny show and grab my pax. Now lately I've been experimenting with eating by AVB and it was working fabulously. You see I have a ridiculously high tolerance and I really wasn't getting as high as I wanted anymore, but this AVB really did the trick. I made a piece of toast, spread some butter and apple butter and then sprinkled around a tablespoon of AVB on top. My last few doses were around this and they worked out just fine so I figured this would too.

About 30 minutes later I started to feel it. AVB comes on fast and it comes on strong but that's what I liked about it. Unfortunately this high was unlike anything I had experienced before. I had always heard stories about people saying how the got ""too high"" and I would think to myself that they just don't know how to relax and let it happen, that they didn't know HOW to be high. Well now I know that there is such thing as being too high.

About 15 minutes after first feeling the effects it got a little too intense so I told my SO I was going to go lay in bed. When I got to bed I knew I wouldn't be able to fall asleep because my brain felt like it was thinking a million different things at one. I could literally feel my thoughts happening and it wasn't a good feeling. I stumbled back into the room where my SO was watching TV and I asked if I could lay down with him because I was feeling a little anxious. Soon the words coming from the TV ceased to have meaning. It just sounded like gibberish coming from the speakers. Then the words I was saying sounded like gibberish. My thoughts were fine but it was like my body was slow to react and my sentences were missing words. Then life stopped having meaning. The next 5 hours were the worst.

This was not a normal panic attack. I know what those feel like. I have mild/moderate PTSD from witnessing a murder a few years back so I have quite a few tactics for calming myself down when I'm feeling anxious. None of those helped. After what seemed like forever I confessed to my SO ""I'm having a panic attack, it's really bad and I'm afraid that I may need medical attention."" He got me a glass of water and a bucket in case I felt like throwing up (we have a long standing feud regarding whether pot can make you puke and I always maintained that it only does the opposite and reduces nausea) I heaved a few times but nothing would come out, although I wished that it would. I begged him to take me to the hospital and even though my rational brain knew I would be alright my irrational brain was convinced I was dying.

So many things went through my mind on the way to the hospital. ""They're going to put me in the psych ward"" and ""I hope they do because I think I am going insane"" another recurring though was that ""I'm going to be like this forever"" and ""my husband is going to have to put me in a home and visit me on weekends"" It all sounds silly looking back but at the time I honestly thought that something inside me was brought to the surface and I was going to be like this for the rest of my life whether I died that night or 60 years from now.

Right about the time we arrived at the ER, a five minute drive that either felt like five hours or two seconds I didn't know because time no longer had meaning at that point, my muscles started to give out. First it was difficult to walk, then I found my hands constantly clenched in a fist no matter how hard I tried to stop. I was constantly moving when they sat me down in the waiting room. I would kick my legs and stretch my arms every few seconds. Soon the admitting nurse took me back to a room for some intake questions. I told her I might throw up and she gave me a cardboard bowl just in case. She asked me if I had panic attacks before and I said yes but not like this. Then she asked me if I had any drugs or alcohol. I said that I didn't drink but I did have some marijuana (it's legal in my state). She asked what form I had and I told her I ate it. At this point I couldn't answer my own questions anymore and my SO took over. I simply nodded yes or no to many of the questions. The nurse looked at me and said ""you need to slow your breathing or you're going to pass out. That's a promise"" until then I hadn't realized how quickly I was breathing. I was hyperventilating. She took me back to the waiting area where I threw up twice. It felt so good even though throwing up is my biggest phobia. I couldn't smell, taste, feel and my vision was tunneled. When they took me back to my own room the nurse told me ""I guess I'm just not used to pot being legal here, I'm from Ohio"" I gave her a courtesy laugh but all I really wanted to do was yell out ""somebody get me a xanax!"" unfortunately my brain no longer controlled what came out of my mouth. The doctor came in with an intern and asked me if I had done more than usual or if it was a different kind. I shook my head no and my husband chimed in that it was a normal dose and I use marijuana on a daily basis and had never had this problem in the past. 

At no point did anyone offer to give me anything to calm down and I was too far gone to tell them that I have PTSD and these attacks aren't just because of pot. I wonder now if that would have made a difference. An X-ray tech came in and said I would have to have chest X-ray's and wheeled me back to another room. She said I would need to stand up for the x-ray but I couldn't quite grasp what that meant and just stared at her. Finally I realized what she was saying and slumped out of the bed.

When I was back in the room another nurse started putting sticky things all over my chest. She said I would have to have an EKG to make sure my heart was healthy. All I could think was ""xanax, valium, anything please!"" She hooked up the machine and said as long as the EKG is fine I would be released. I thought to myself ""Released? You haven't even done anything! I'm still going crazy!"" The doctor came back and said my heart looked fine and shoved some information on stress and anxiety into my husbands hands. The nurse looked at me and said ""listen I don't know what's going on at home but you need to calm down."" ""Who is this?"" She said, pointing to my husband ""a friend? Boyfriend?"" ""I'm her husband"" he said. Clearly sounding annoyed. ""oh wow, ok, newlyweds?"" I don't even know what this had to do with anything but it pissed me off that she was judging us. We are a middle class couple who own our own home, we both work, drive nice cars, and like to smoke pot, what's wrong with that? She showed me to a bathroom and told me to change out of my gown and back into my clothes. I was a little confused because I didn't remember changing in the first place. My husband handed me my clothes and I went in and changed. 

When I came back out the nurse was gone, I looked at my husband and asked where she went. He said he didn't know and that she just walked away. I walked up to the nurses station and handed them my hospital gown and my husband and I left. By the time we got home I did feel better. I apologized profusely but he said ""don't be silly, I'm just glad I won"" I looked at him with confusion. ""You threw up from pot! I told you it could make you puke!"" I laughed and then we went to bed.

When I woke up the next morning I had a really good thought session with myself. This is not who I want to be. Pot has been great and we've had some really good times together but it's turned me into someone I don't recognize. I've gained weight (a lot) and I don't really have any hobbies anymore. I guess all this really was for the best. I've tried to quit in the past but never stuck with it. Now I don't even want to look at pot, I look at my pax on it's charger and think damn what a waste of $280. 

It's day 4 and I can already tell my appetite is about half of what it was and I'm dreaming again! I can't tell you how nice it is to dream. Anyways, thanks for letting me tell my story on here. It was by far one of the scariest nights of my life but I really hope it was a learning experience and I'm looking forward to my life free from weed.

TL;DR had a scary ass panic attack, thought I was going insane, went to the ER, they didn't do anything, waited it out, survived, turning over a new leaf. (pun intended)"

I'm an entry-level 3D artist, relatively new to the Los Angeles area. I moved here 6 months ago and have been looking for work in the gaming and animation industry. 

I'm trying to focus my skills into 3D modeling and digital sculpting, however the bulk of my work experience has been in freelance storyboarding. With that said, I went to a pipeline school in the SF Bay Area that gave me fundamental skills and education in animation, rigging, texture, and pre-production. Ideally, I would like to get a job as a 3D character artist. My main programs of use are ZBrush, Maya, and Photoshop. 

I'm interested to know if there are fellow Redditors who are now in successful 3D art jobs. Did you start as an intern and move up through that opportunity? Were you able to snag a job out of college? What websites did you use? Did you get the jobs through networking?

My biggest hurdle is that a lot of the job postings on the internet are for mid-level artists who have shipped at least a few games. At this point, I still need to break into the industry. Any tips or advice would be greatly appreciated! "

They said they want a person lighter on experience on the phone, the job listing asked for 2-4 years of accounting/finance experience so I'm not sure how that will factor into the questions.

I'd really appreciate this job, and your help in my potentially getting it."

I still have 2yrs to get experience). I have a Bachelors related to IT, and I'm a CCNA(minimum) or CCNP R&amp;S. 

What positions would I be looking at? Should I just look for a very entry level help desk position, or is that selling myself short?

I don't want to undervalue, nor overvalue my education and certs. I have no idea where a Bachelors and a CCNA or CCNP puts me as far as what job I would be looking to fill ideally and realistically. 

I know that my lack of experience is not doing my any favors, so I may have to start from the bottom like everyone else(understandably)

The Sliders end up in the front line of people greeting President Williams. Someone pushes into the crowd, pushing Maggie against the President. Within hours, newspapers and TV news channels are running stories about the supposed affair between the President and Maggie. Mallory discovers a small tabloid newspaper (the Hawks Report) in a hotel desk drawer which has stories about a depression caused by the stock market and a war involving the United States and Switzerland. While the four are walking along the sidewalk, someone recognizes Maggie from the news and she decides to return to the Chandler Hotel and wait it out. Mallory goes looking for the publisher of the Hawks Report and tries to set the record straight. Maggie watches the TV and finds a reporter has tracked down her duplicate from that world, which appalls her. She answers a knock at the door and finds the President's chief-of-staff and a Secret Service agent, who convince Maggie to go along with them. When Diana and Rembrandt return to the Chandler, Remmy finds the door open and neither can find Maggie. At the Ambassador Hotel, the chief-of-staff and First Lady use Maggie to stage photos that one of the President's staff manipulates to make it look like the President and Maggie had been having an affair for years. At Diana, Remmy and Mallory's insistence, Hawks looks closer at the staged-and-faked photos and identifies a matchbook belonging to the Ambassador Hotel. The chief-of-staff then has Maggie put in another hotel room nearby and posts Secret Service agents to watch her. The chief-of-staff makes a call and arranges for Maggie to be killed. When a maid enters Maggie's room, she admits to being the President's lover and gets an idea. A woman dressed as a maid comes out of the room and leaves by the elevator just up the hall from the room. A man called Kennedy arrives at the room, excusing one of the agents, he finds a woman facing the TV and shoots her with a gun with a silencer, then leaves and says that a team will be there to clean up the mess. Both men leave just as Hawks and the other Sliders arrive. Mallory finds the door open and the dead woman on the floor, who it turns out isn't Maggie. The First Lady kisses the chief-of-staff and they end up in bed together. A phone call alerts the chief-of-staff that Maggie has escaped. The Sliders and Hawks return to the Chandler, expecting that if Maggie escaped that she'd go there. But, just after she arrives and calls out to her friends, two goons grab her and take her into a car that pulls up outside the Chandler. Diana finds the maid's hat that Maggie had been wearing. The group heads back to Hawks' office and, after initially refusing, Hawks doctors some photos and release them to the press. President Williams, his wife and the chief-of-staff watch as a TV news anchor announces the release of the photos showing Maggie dead in an alley and decide that they have to use Maggie to prove that the President wasn't responsible for her death. The Sliders see the same report, which is followed by the announcement that the President will hold a press conference. The four of them go to the Ambassador Hotel, where the President is about to appear to put the rumors to rest and has Secret Service agents bring Maggie into the press conference. Mallory questions President Williams about the faking of the affair, at which point Maggie forces her way to the podium and explains the truth of the situation, at which point, the chief-of-staff escorts the President and First Lady out of the room and the Sliders Slide out.

DISCUSSION: A political storyline, modeled somewhat upon President Bill Clinton with the affair he had with a White House intern in the mid-1990s. The world that they land on is one that is obsessed with salacious stories, where stuff that would appear in unbelievable tabloids on our world is considered normal news. Yes, even our world's media were guilty of spending too much time focusing on a minor incident between the President of the United States and a woman that wasn't his wife. But, on the world in this episode, the First Lady actually encourages the lies so that the alleged affair takes attention away from what the U.S. government (and she, herself) are doing. The episode is clearly an examination of both national politics and the national media (and, the local media, to a lesser extent). Despite the fact that Hawks gets a platform to bring to light various things that the federal government are doing while other media members are focused on an affair that isn't actually happening, the media turns to focusing on the surprising departure of the Sliders. In other words, a leopard can't change its spots ... even if it's really supposed to be a tiger. The murder certainly adds an interesting twist to the plot, but ultimately being proved to be faked, only serves to give Mallory an in to question the President about the faked affair with Maggie. Twice in this episode, hotel room doors were left cracked open, first when Rembrandt and Diana returned to their suite at the Chandler Hotel and again after Kennedy left following shooting the maid. Incidentally, was there any doubt that Maggie was the one who came out of the room with the towels/bedding before Kennedy entered the room to kill her? I thought it was pretty obvious, even though we don't see Maggie attack the maid and sit her up in front of the TV, where she was shot to death. With the First Lady having an affair with the chief-of-staff, she was clearly manipulating him for her own ends. Her marriage to Williams was clearly one of convenience and she threatens to leave the chief-of-staff if the President gets blamed for Maggie's supposed murder. A woman seeking power in a world still dominated by men.

And the most frustrating part is that they are all sophomores and I am a junior who is still struggling to find an internship, while many of them have intern in google the first year. How do I increase my CS skills in cool projects, I feel either they have invest a tremendous amount of time on personal projects, or they have some secret source to learn cool stuffs, I don't believe the former as I know quite a few of them and all they do is play LOL all the time, they produce most of their output at hackerthons (seriously I ask a guy at the beginning of hackerthon what he was going to do, and he said he didn't know, after 8 hours he wrote a compiler on his phone that can do all sorts of magic) or perhaps I am misjudging them, anyways I need some serious advice here, any advice if any would be greatly appreciated.

21640u,25,2014-03-23,[Meet Report] Jakked Hardcore Olde Time Strongman Challenge: My First SM Meet,Stinnett,Strongman,https://www.reddit.com/r/Strongman/comments/21640u/meet_report_jakked_hardcore_olde_time_strongman/,"Yesterday, I competed at the 2014 Jakked Hardcore Olde Time Strongman Challenge. I had an awesome time (srsly, I thought powerlifting was fun; nope, strongman is way awesomer) and placed 4th / 9 (or 8... not 100% sure) in the novice division. Not too bad considering before yesterday I had never done axle cleans, axle deadlifts, or touched an atlas stone or circus dumbbell.

We got to Jakked around 8:15, a few hours before the meet began. I wanted some time to play with the stones and other equipment before the meet. A few of the guys were cool enough to help me with my stone form which made a huge difference (seriously, strongmen are even more helpful than powerlifters, which is surprising considering how ridiculously helpful PLers are). I wasn't smart enough to wrap my forearms for this; I scraped up my forearms way more in the morning than I did at the actual event (with my arms wrapped).

Circus dumbbells: Press Medley, 55 to 130 lbs. I got the 110 without a problem, but the 130 wasn't going anywhere. Couldn't really keep it stabilized. I'm actually a little surprised the 110 went up so well; my overhead game is not great, and I figured this would be my worst event from the beginning.  

Axle clean: 190lb clean with an axle bar. This axle was not nearly as big around as I thought it was. I trained for this a litle by doing cleans with fat gripz. In hindsight, this was probably an AWESOME idea. I got a quick 8 reps with a double overhand grip (in about 30 seconds). I tried doing a continental; lolno. Still haven't figured out how to do that, and I have some pretty marks on my belly from trying. Waited a few seconds, got another DOH clean, and that was it. 10 reps was good enough for second (I think; scores will be posted later. Only one guy I know of got that many or more).

Axle deadlift: Ugh. There was... some confusion with this event. There were two different bars set up in the training room. One long bar loaded with big tires, one shorter bar loaded with smaller tires. Initially, they said that once the weight got to 650lbs, they would switch to the bigger bar and tires. A little odd, but okay. I think they were going to try to run two platforms at once. Warming up, I realized that 650 with the bigger tires would be a fairly easy pull; I hit an easy 600 double as a warmup. I went ahead and put 650 in as my starting attempt (which in hindsight was a little silly, but I wanted to save my grip and back as much as possible for later events). At some point, they decided to only run one platform and to use the long bar for all attempts. However, they decided that women, novice, teen, and the lightweights would all use the smaller tires, but the heavy guys would use the bigger tires. Unfortunately, I didn't understand this until they were doing 550lb pulls already. I panicked a little and jumped in at 600lbs, which saved me from bombing out. The smaller tires were a good 4-5 inches lower than the big ones, and the 600lb pull was pretty damn hard. Went for 650 and couldn't break it from the ground. One of the really short dudes in the novice got 700.

Rolling thunder static hold: a bunch of the lifters convinced the organizers to bump up the weights (good call). The novice division had 100lb holds (not counting the handle and loading pin weight), and there were 3 handles at a time on stage. I was in third place at this point (I think), and was in the last group of novices to do the holds, which was really helpful. I might have stopped earlier if I didn't know someone had already held it for 52 seconds. I actually thought I won this event until after the whole thing was over, when one of the scorekeepers told me (when I asked) that the best time was actually a few tenths of a second longer than mine. Dang.

Atlas stones: max load in 3 attempts to a 48"" platform. I used the cheap wraps recommended by u/threewhitelights, which were awesome (and would actually be reusable if I didn't cover them in tacky). Opened with a 215 stone, went up without a problem. Then a 250 stone; little hard to break from the ground, but easy for the rest. Jumped to a 285 stone; I guess my hand placement was a little different at the bottom, but it was by far the easiest. I actually laughed once I had it lapped because I knew I had it. I wish I had taken a 305 or even a 330 stone; I really underestimated how much easier it would be once I wrapped my forearms and was willing to grip it harder. In a month or so when I have access to stones regularly, besides doing a bunch of full stone loading I need to really work on lapping them. If I can break a stone from the ground, loading it to a platform is super easy (height ftw). One of the SHW's got the monstrous 470 stone; pretty awesome to watch. The same dude also pulled 1100 (or 1090 or whatever).

I think (again, we'll find out once the scores are posted) that I was in 2nd going into the stones, but dropped to 4th after that. The guy that won novice was the dude that pulled 700 and got the 130lb circus dumbbell (though I don't think he did as well in the cleans or the RT hold). There was a little extra excitement in the 231s; two dudes tied throughout the meet, and the lighter guy (who technically won) said something to the effect of ""I don't wanna win by bodyweight, that's lame"", so they did a squat-off for the hell of it. Box squats with 475 for reps. The heavier guy ended up winning (something like 14 reps to 4; I think the light guy was a lot more tired than he thought he was), but it was fun to watch.

I'm totally happy with my performance at this meet. A 285lb stone is a 285lb PR, and leaving more in the tank just means more PRs in the near future. I fully intend to compete more in strongman, probably in the novice division for a while still. I'll still do some PL meets (I'm looking at you, AAPF Summer Bash), but my focus is probably going to shift. Powerlifting meets were fun, but holy crap strongman meets are just so awesome.

Videos to come; I'll post them in the thread eventually.

**What's next for me**

For the next several months, I'm going to continue my custom /u/gzcl-style programming.  In ~ a month, a new gym will open near me that will actually give me access to stones, yokes, sleds, and all sorts of other awesome stuff.  When that happens, my programming will shift pretty dramatically.    There's a little local strongman meet happening in May (don't think it's affiliated with a fed, though could be wrong) that I'll do, and I'm going to do AAPF Summer Bash in August (a PL meet).  I'll be looking for another real strongman meet sometime around the end of the summer or in the fall.  Might also try a Tough Mudder in late summer/early fall for the hell of it.

**Training**

* Next 4-6 weeks: Heavy focus gzcl programming, no access to SM equipment. 

&gt; New gym

* 4 week cycle: Conditioning-focused gzcl

* 4 week cycle: Speed/Explosive focus

* 4 week cycle: Volume-building cycle (adapted from [this post](http://swoleateveryheight.blogspot.com/2014/02/training-review-capacity-building.html) with more overhead work)

* 4 week cycle: heavy focus

The 16-week conditioning/speed/volume/heavy programming should end around Summer Bash.  After that meet, I'll re-evaluate and go from there.

For the interested, [here's an draft of the 16 week programming](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1afxKrvwi5HgxszzCJnQWPlZqTxcXHQi5zzGlh_ivl8Y/edit?usp=sharing).  Finishing this is one of the things I'm doing today, so it may be fairly different between now and this evening.  Assuming I don't get my internship thing over the summer, this summer will be lifting, sleeping 9 hours a day, eating 4-5k kcals a day, and beginning my PhD research (most of which is on a computer and doesn't really require lab hours), so the 6-7 day high intensity schedule should be doable.  If not, I'll reduce it, but lifting 6-7 times/week has been extremely good to me in the past.

The goal is to get a 2 year degree at a community college here, hundreds of miles away from anything resembling civilization, and use it to immediately get a job somewhere that has bookstores, coffeeshops, warm weather, and a large body of salty water.

(An internship here may happen, but it probably won't be an internship here for a company in Charleston, so how much use it will be is questionable.)

I've just ended a three year relationship that didn't slowly peter out. It had bled out after the first six months were over. I can't recall why we stayed together, and neither could she. We didn't split up in anger, we didn't have a fight. We were pretty apathetic about the whole situation. As well as apathetic about each other. 

For the first few months we were pretty physical. Like in any relationship, we were pushing each others sexual boundaries to see how far we would go. Nothing too abnormal. Occasional anal and a bit of spanking was as far as we went. I was elated with that. (Sexually speaking, I'm quite plain in comparison to other confessions I've read here) But after those horny first months of sport fucking, she started getting headaches. Which lead to the barren bedroom. At first I did all the silly shit guys do to get laid: flowers, nights out, back rubs, expensive gifts, nodding to her woes and worries while stroking her hair with one hand and hiding your wood with the other, ... And every now and then I'd get a sympathy-handjob. And the oh so cliché BJ on my birthday. But it's fair to say I'd become accustomed to a bedroom meant for sleeping. I filled the void with porn, but when she found out and told me she felt violated, I quit it altogether. She was and is damn pretty, and quite the conversationalist. So I put in the effort to make it work. And if she felt bad about my sex drive, I decided to tone it down. I have no idea why.

We were living in a town where I didn't know many people outside of work at the time. I guess it was just nice to come home to my own place and having someone there to be around. Again, she's both looks and brains, so every guy I met congratulated me on catching such ""a perfect specimen"". And although I didn't feel like settling down yet, the idea of me and her getting old together had crossed my mind. The whole no-sex thing was just a minor bump in the road, I told myself. She always had something jobwise she was stressed about, and once that would be over, she'd be down for great sex once again.

Or not. In June 2013, I had a one-night stand with an intern. I hadn't come in months maybe, apart from a few wet dreams. My body reacted as if I'd been awoken from a coma by means of high-voltage electroshocks. To me, it felt like the first time I'd ejaculated all over again. A rush of blood to the head, all of my extremities slightly twitching, glowing hotter than a lightbulb, and so horny I could go again in a second. Now, this girl didn't sign up to pick the flower of a 25 year old guy. She just wanted casual sex and because I was a levelheaded guy in the office, I was a good pick. Well, I proved her wrong. Because I started crying when we were cuddled up together. I hadn't been this intimate in a year and it hit me like a cinderblock how much I'd missed it. All of it.

To make a long story short: I was so shook up I told the intern I loved her, she got scared and said no. I felt like an idiot and decided that I was one, so I went home to tell my GF I'd fallen in love again. Big fight goes here. GF convinces me with tears and pity sex that she is the one for me and that I can't leave her. I had sex twice in a night, which was something I had only dreamed of. So I was exhausted and completely confused and instead of breaking up and looking up new horizonts, I asked her to forgive me for being a two-timing asshole. She said she'd think about it. Once again: backrubs, expensive gifts, ... this time just so she'd take me back.

Which lead to barren bedroom part 2: no more cuddles, not even lying next to each other: she'd shudder when I'd try to spoon her and push me off. Intimacy level is somewhere between frosty and ice cold. From this point on, I catch myself doing stuff creepy guys tend to do. I talk to women and catch myself staring at their breasts. Sometimes to a point where they start noticing it. One time, a female colleague was noticeably uncomfortable because mid-conversation I just turned my head to follow the ass of a waitress that passed by. And again. And again. I started looking at online ads for call girls at my office, just fantasizing about cheap, meaningless sex. And then I'd wonder how I had become one of those pitiful middle-aged guys I used to laugh at. I still didn't masturbate or try to initiate sex. But this time my sex drive seemingly wouldn't go down so easily. So I'd wear tighter pants because they'd tickle the goodie bag. I'd take a train every now and then and always sit next to a girl. If there are still empty seats left, girls react very cautious to this kind of behaviour, I've learned. (Dear girls: I only became conscious of my seating pick after you start to tense up. I blame my subconscious) I'd walk next to woman and have the back of my hand slide over the back of her hand. It'd make the hairs on my arm stand. It also made me realize what a creep I am.

And so I embraced the fact that I was a two-timing asshole. And I decided I didn't want to be the person I had become. And I started dating and at the same time looking for the moment to break up for good. So I got a few dates that were successful which picked up my self-esteem. And then I decided we should break up. So I laid it all out for her, made my heart into stone and didn't croak when she told me how much hurt I had caused her. How she had had an affair as well and how she ended it after a few times because she wanted to make 'us' work. How she put 'us' before herself while I only put effort in myself. I said we'd be better off with a fresh start and without each other. We had a few days together before she moved out which made the Cold War look cozy. But in the end, we split up in an emotional void. I think we've used up all emotional cards and what was left was apathy. 

And that's how I've been single for three months now. And the cold daze of that whole sex-less relationship hasn't thawed yet. I went on two dates after we've split up. And I cancelled everything from then on. I don't know why. Maybe because I'm shit at relations? Maybe because I actually feel shit about myself? I have no idea why, but I'm putting myself in the no-sex-zone I blew  up my relationship for. And tonight I was thinking about being one of those guys that has a webcam pointed at his crotch while going on Chatroulette. And I realized that was a really creepy way to spend a Sunday night. So I came here and I ranted. I have no idea why. All I want to be right now is left alone. Yet I feel like paying one of these webcam girls money just to hear her moan my name and fake an orgasm. I'm so utterly confused with myself.

Sorry for the rant. This was pretty much a stream of consciousness thing. Don't know if it makes sense.

I owe a lot of money on my car, I'm falling behind on bills and won't be able to get more hours/money until summer. I owe my friend some money and he changed his mind on when he needs it back. Basically, what this loan will do for me is get my head out of water until I can get my whole body out. If I don't get this soon, I won't be able to survive within the next two months.

2.)Who am I?
My name is Nick, I'm 18. My parents have kicked me out and I'm living on my own with my good friend/room mate Michael. I make roughly $700 a month and will be making over $1000 or more pretty soon. I'm REALLY struggling and I need this.

I'll give you any and all information you need. All my contact information and you can call me any time. I'll give you details on what exactly I spend and when. I'll give you all the info you need.

I need this. No banks or credit unions will give me a chance because it's not that I have bad credit, I just have no credit.

PM me for my contact info.

Also, if you have any suggestions, please do comment. 

Thank you.

216o9n,5,2014-03-23,Do you know what it means to feel despair? Let me tell you.,ouupfm,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/216o9n/do_you_know_what_it_means_to_feel_despair_let_me/,"I am not sure if my story is suitable for this subreddit but I feel really bad and have to share my emotions with somebody.

I've started to learn computer science in school. It all was simple document formatting in Word at first, then I discovered Excel - spreadsheets, diagrams, formulas - you name it. It was the whole new world for me and I liked it.

Then I was told about Pascal. Hours spent playing around with so called ""text based RPG"" - tons of ""if-else"" blocks, ugly code, bad practices - you probably know that feel. At that point I felt really powerful. I believed that I could change the world, that I could build something absolutely stunning.

So I entered the university, faculty of mathematics and computer science. I can't describe how disappointed I was. No one told me what a real world programming looked like. I never was taught to build a real application. Lectures barely covered algorithms and data structures. I have started to teach myself but turned out that I couldn't do it and keep getting good grade points. I could live with that because I kept getting benefits of self-teaching and spending my time taking online courses.

Now I am at my senior year, going to get a bachelor's degree this summer.

I live in a third-world country, have no job, not sure that I will land a job after getting my diploma, because no one here needs actual programmers. I have no work experience and more than that I had only one internship. I don't even sure if I am capable to work with rock-star programmers. I always wanted to leave this country and to move to Europe or USA and I don't have money. And that stories ""I used to be a carpenter for tren years and then I read a ""Become a programmer in 21 days"" and now I'm making six figures lol"" make me feel even worse. That's life, huh?


**TL;DR:** have no work experience, lost self-belief and not sure if I will ever become a good developer. Hugs?

Edit: thank you for hearing me. I feel better now."
216p2n,1,2014-03-23,Napoleon Hill Notes I made. If anyone wants a template and to add on.,sambo_22,motivation,https://www.reddit.com/r/motivation/comments/216p2n/napoleon_hill_notes_i_made_if_anyone_wants_a/,"Definite of Purpose and PLAN
PURPOSE OF CAREER: FUND MANAGER
CFA, YFC, HARD WORK. NO SLEEP. COMPETITIONS. GOOD GRADES. 
WE HAVE CONTROL OVER OUR MIND (:

Riches we are born with: 
1.	Sound health
2.	Peace of mind
3.	Labour of love of your own choice 
4.	Freedom from Fear 
5.	Material riches of your own type and quantity
6.	Positive Mental Attitude*
QQMA = Quality + Quantity + Mental Attitude space you occupy. ALWAYS GO THE EXTRA MILE. 

WHY YOU MAY ASK?
1. Favorable attention of those who will promote you
2. Natural Law of Increasing Interns 
3. Indispensible - write your own ticket
4. Excel in your line of work
6. Benefit through laws of contract compared to others
7. Will improve your personality and liked by others
8  Help you develop keen imagination
9. Personal Confidence, not being told what to do. Greater self-reliance. 
10. Helps you manage destructive habit of procrastination
11. People respect your integrity
12. Develop a purpose - what your calling is
13. One and only excuse to asking for a greater promotion. You only deserve pay for the work you do
14. Conditions your mind to have mastermind partnership with others.
You should work in areas and market your services in areas where it pays to go the extra mile.  Have a pleasing mental attitude. 
1)	Start tomorrow to render a service that you are not expected to 
2)	Do it in a pleasing mental attitude
3)	Do it for 7 days in the most natural way possible

Don’t put Faith in Negative Way. Apply your faith in positive ways, think always of the six riches we have. Your mind attracts what you think about. Most people fail because they are negative. 

People who fail see the hole but not the donut around the hold; whereas as SUCCESSFUL PEOPLE DO.

Ex: Henry Ford believed that he could build the horseless carriage with very little capital and education. He got ridiculed by neighbors and family but changed the American way of life. He broke through the wall of fear and made use of the mastermind principle; an alliance with his wife.  To be successful need to be a person with great person of belief, complete control of your own mind.

Demand not beg; the creator never intended you to beg for anything. If your life is not what you want it to be. YOU CAN CHANGE IT. Applied Faith and think about things you want not what you don’t want.
Poverty, Fear, Illiteracy and Superstition (the four horsemen) do not feed on this. 

1)	KNOW WHAT YOU WANT
2)	EXPRESSIONS OF GRATITUDE, EVEN BEFORE YOU GET PHYSICAL POSSESSION OF IT. POSSESSIONS BEGINS WITHIN THE MIND
3)	MOVE ON YOUR PERSONAL INITIATIVE. ACTION IS IMPORTANT TO ACT UPON WHEN YOU HAVE A ‘HUNCH’. 
4)	MAN’S FAITH IS TESTED MANY TIMES. FAILURE IS CHALLENGE TO KEEP ON TRYING.
5)	BE DEFINITE. BELIEVE. AND ACT.
6)	WHEN DOUBT CREEPS IN YOUR MIND, WHATEVER A MAN BELIEVITH HE SHALL RECEIVE. 
7)	Your life is what you make it by your own mental attitude
Note: Faith is guidance only. Faith is limited only by your capacity to believe.  You
PLEASING PERSONALITY
Distinguishes you from other human beings. See your personality just as others see it. Every trait is under your control
1)	Mental Attitude:  Must be positive to attract people to you.
a.	They have telepathy
b.	You disclose it in tone of voice; pleasant or harsh, courtesy and consideration, and the look on your face
c.	Flexibility in mental attitude: Change your attitude without losing your composure  without anger or irritability. All people in higher brackets of success have this flexibility. 
d.	Direct your enthusiasm. Uncontrolled enthusiasm makes people boring or can cause people to influence you badly
e.	Sincerity of purpose: is a quality of character that cannot be faked
f.	Your posture is also important 
Common Habits that destroy personality/Repels others
1)	Talking over others
2)	Sarcasm or wisecracks* 
3)	Vanity expressed by actions or words
4)	Indifference in listening. Listening is more important than speaking
5)	Attempt to flatter, where it is not deserved, is insincere
6)	Finding fault with people or world in general is not pleasing (don’t complain)
7)	Openly and directly challenging for the sake of arguing
8)	Giving unsolicited advice
9)	Speaking of one’s ailments, problems, etc.  
10)	Superiority in topics what people don’t understand. 
11)	Envy of those who are successful. Good people know about abundance
12)	Don’t dress poorly
13)	Poor body posture means low confidence 
Manage to talk about things which interest the people you are taking to. Negotiate with people on their own terms. 
Ex. It is one of the most important things that you have a good personality, be dynamic.
PRINCIPLE OF SELF-DISCIPLINE
It is the mastery of personal qualities/flaws. You can exercise control over these things.
1)	Gain mastery over your tongue. Think first and then speak, a loose tongue is a liability
How: Speak, but not badly about others or to hurt others. Try not to joke at others expense. 

2)	Do to another, you do to yourself. If you slander another person write it down and then throw it out. 
How: No gossip or bad thinking or talking about other people. If you need to write it down and throw it away. 
3)	Exercise emotions over fear, hate, love, and sex. So important. Can make you or break you or according to the amount of discipline you exert. 
How: No infatuation, balance of everything is important. Everything should be practiced in moderation; especially emotions. 
4)	Your mental attitude needs discipline at all times. Lack of this drives away friends, brings ailments, and drives away opportunities
Always think positively and have gratitude for everything. Thank the lord and try to keep your mind on positive ideas and hard-work. 
5)	Failure over sex control is the biggest source of nature. Transmutation is a great sexual feeling to the objective of one’s purpose in life. Artist and industrialists have learned this and attained great success. ******
      No obscene material electronically, etc. For the next year try to develop a system that benefits you. Study away from school and away from such materials. LOVE &gt; LUST.
6)	Your stomach needs discipline through dieting and fasting. Need for knowledge on the subject.
No more pork or beef; chicken and fish only. No meat on Tuesday and Thursday; and fasting on Thursday. 
7)	Religion and politics: Varying beliefs on both of these subjects. Must respect these.
Try to avoid placing your personal thoughts on this subject; especially with strangers. 
8)	Taking possession of your own mind and direct it to definite ends. Need a personal system.  This system works successfully and is practical. Only need possession of one mind and a definite purpose.
Self-discipline helps people through failures, makes people sharp (improves genius). Is the top-ranking features of all religions. The major purpose on life is through struggle and self-discipline; you become wise and happiness through Strict faith in self-control.  Only means to transmute hate and sex, shut out of our minds the deadly experience of personal failure and bad memories.  Gives us freedom from death, hypochondria, live our own lives, and have no fear of superstition. The creator gave us this to give us unchallengeable control over own thoughts through self-discipline. 
“The path of least resistance turns all rivers, and some men, crooked”  (Napoleon Hill)
I can only escape through a very rigid system of self-discipline in which I have the self-confidence to carry out my plans. 
Ex. Wright Brothers, Edison, Hill (who had heartache, defeat, because of poverty), Helen Keller
Positive mental attitude heads the list of the riches in life 
How to keep your mind positive 
1)	Learn to adjust to others mental state and difficulties; refrain from emphasizing trivial relations with others and allowing them to become controversial incidents
2)	Establish a definite fixed system in the beginning of each day – always keep it positive that way
3)	Learn the art of selling yourself to others by asking leading questions, do not be drawn to arguments over unimportant subjects
4)	A good hearted laugh when you become angry or irritated. Ex. A laughing exercise. Changes the chemistry of your brain. 
5)	Expression of gratitude at the beginning of day of all adversities failures, defeats experienced in the past.  Search for a seed of the equivalent benefit that these have yielded you through the passing of time. Give thanks for benefits and blessing you expect for the rest of the day.
6)	Focus on the ‘can-do’ portion of your problem and focus on this. Find out what it is and do it all ways right away and RIGHT NOW where you stand. 
7)	Transmute unpleasant things/circumstances into immediate action and always be positive and make this a fixed habit. When you are angry keep your mind busy with your hobbies or definite purpose for five (5) minutes. 
8)	Every circumstance that influences you is your meal in life. Your strength grows out of your struggles. No such thing as an unprofitable experience. 
9)	Look upon your life as education and learning. Be alert for all the gains in wisdom that come a little at a time through pleasant and unpleasant experiences. 
10)	Begin in some-sort of your improvement to become generous in your relation with others
11)	Express gratitude for the control over your mind and ask for guidance use this gift wisely
12)	Focus on the positive qualities of those you live with and work with; not the negative one for the next seven days. People will then focus on your good qualities. 
13)	Analyze the criticism against yourself and see what is justified in honest self-examination; don’t take it personally
14)	The golden rule. Passive resistance. 
15)	Remember all there are two types of circumstances that can worry you: those which you can control, and those you can’t (do not let them worry you) 
16)	Eternally engaged in your definite purpose; your burning desire. No time left for THE THINGS YOU DON’T DESIRE. 
17)	IF you ever feel self-pity; look at someone unluckier than you and you will witness one of the great miracles. What you do for another you do for yourself. 
18)	Emulate someone you would want to be and follow them in every way possible at work, school, etc. 
19)	Cultivate your tone of voice for a pleasing voice, your voice is an open window for your soul. Record samples of your voice. 
20)	THIS SENTENCE Whatever the mind can conceive and believe, the mind can achieve. Put this on your dresser mirror. 
YOU ARE THE ONLY ONE WHO CAN GIVE YOURSELF A POSITIVE ATTITUDE. CHANGE COMES FROM WITHIN, WHAT WILL YOU ABOUT IT? This is the question only you can answer and your future relies on.

Enthusiasm: only your own state of mind 
Enthusiasm is one of the most important sources of power. Lectures can keep people spell-bound because of enthusiasm. Your brain is a broadcasting station receives and sends thoughts. They reach other people more quickly  influence others people through enthusiasm. Is very contagious.
Shaking someone’s hand can show enthusiasm. 
Read for 10 minutes in the tone of enthusiasm. Write down 10 things that you like and read about them in an enthused voice out loud. 
Enthusiasm = Burning Interest
1.	Emotion of Love
2.	Emotion of Sex
3.	Financial Gain
1.	The mixture of these three things can turn a mediocre person into a genius. 
Two types of people: those who do not do as they are told AND  those who do not do anything else. 
Acting on Personal Initiative ( in all success principles):
2 kinds of men who do not amount to much: those who don’t have personal imitative. Best men take personal imitative  act on their own terms.  Influences him/her to the end to complete something happily. A great success is a series of small circumstances. Personal initiative helps people help themselves. 
1)	That who follows the habit of personal initiative has a definite purpose; plan for attainment 
2)	Mastermind  alliance
3)	Persistence and Will to win when the going is hard
4)	Make decisions promptly on facts, and adjusts slowly them when needed
5)	Does more than what they are paid for, does it in a pleasing attitude 
6)	Accepts personal responsibility for what he undertakes. No passing the buck 
7)	Profits from personal criticism 
8)	Gives a person an adequate motive to do something for him always 
9)	Only gives an opinion when subject thought through 
10)	Listening much. Talking only in some situations
11)	Small details to large details; everything is known. 
12)	Why and how it should be done to others, when giving orders. Can do it themselves. 
13)	Concentrate full attention on everything; even one at a time. 
14)	Positive mental attitude in communication
15)	Always gives a direct answer even if it “I don’t know”
16)	Never puts of until tomorrow what should have been done last week.
Learning from Adversity
Your positive mental attitude to convert failures into assets. Everyone should experience it to learn how to control one’s mind. The values are priceless; and the lesson is to have a positive mental attitude for conversion (dividends).

216pe4,8,2014-03-23,Will I regret delaying the move to Silicon Valley for a few years after graduation?,csthrowitaway,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/216pe4/will_i_regret_delaying_the_move_to_silicon_valley/,"I worked for many months to secure a job in Silicon Valley but circumstances have conspired against moving out there, at least immediately. Things are getting serious with my girlfriend and taking the job would mean putting 2500 miles of distance between me and her for the next few years while she finishes her degree.

The job with Cisco is a big compromise for a variety of reasons: the pay isn't really that great for the higher cost of living, I don't like larger companies, and the job likely won't involve JavaScript-based web development, which is my main focus, despite an optimistic recruiter. However, I would really just be using the position as a stepping stone to something better. I figure once I'm in the bay area, it will be a lot easier to get a job at a smaller company, since they seem to hire locally for the most part.

The other option is to stay in town, a mid-sized city in Florida. I'm currently employed remotely doing web development (my division is experiencing a lot of growth but the technology is rather dated) and I have gotten calls from a few places doing work that really excites me. I'm also active in the startup scene, though I'm not holding my breath that those will take off.

The way I see it, I should have decent job prospects in a few years as long as I'm doing work that is engaging and relevant. However, I'm worried that the extra few years staying in-state might have a severe impact on my options when the time comes to leave. During the job search I faced a lot of rejection, and I guess a part of me sees the offers I did get as more luck than anything. However, I'm not a particularly distinguished student (3.5 GPA, no real internships) so maybe I'll fare better when I have some real experience under my belt?

Thanks for taking the time to read this. I'm grateful for any feedback!

**tl;dr:** Take a less-than-ideal job in SV to get my foot in the door, or do some interesting work in another location with the intention to get out to the bay area in the next few years? Is it career suicide or what?"

The idea of her parents not liking me has been something we have swept under the rug for some time almost 9 months.

They don't like me because I am not a practicing christian, or godly man, matter in fact, I'm an atheist (they don't know that). However, she is okay with it, and likens the idea of non-denominational children. that aside. Her parents have also only really met me twice.

I'm facing graduation with internships lined up. She's facing her first set of real clerk ships and internships as well. This is why it is coming up.

I'm young, I'm in my early 20s, I'm madly in love with her, but she tells me not to come between her and her parents and try to push for some interaction. Because I know how she would choose, i have respected that decision. However, we've been together so long though, that it is almost insulting to me at this point be treated like a secret. In addition to not knowing if we actually have a real shot at a future together make we wonder if I am wasting my time. I'm young once, I love her, but I'd hate to graduate and lose her and have to start all over again... I know it sounds really selfish, but with your heart, sometimes you have to be. Has anyone else faced this issue, or something alike. I have no one to ask about it and it is fairly complex. Please help, I hardly know how to proceed.

**TL;DR (I'm Sorry!!): 

girlfriends parents don't like me based on religious pretenses. Our futures are picking up, and I know her relationship with them would take precedence over mine.
I am trying to speed up the process between me and her parents to see if we could co-exist, thus eliciting a smooth future together...

anyone ever been there? anyone get married to women whose parents dont like them? Am I being selfish as a 21 year old to make sure that I am not wasting my time by settling down a girl if I don't know if we stand a real chance together?? Please help... Thanks Reddit**"

**Changes I'm considering** 

- I'd like to make room for Tollbooth somehow, though not required.

- It may be fun to throw in Red Herrings in addition to Ash for a different kind of safety for agendas, and with Encryption Protocols out there, the Red Herrings may not get trashed!

- Find room for another Hedge Fund, just in case they go after the Sundews hard and I'm not getting interns

- Something seems weird about using both Yagura AND Enigma.

- Tossing Junebug

217l0l,1,2014-03-24,The Last Two Years,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/217l0l/the_last_two_years/,"""No one should be a victim of their own biography.""
-George Kenney

I should come to terms with the fact that I possessed the means to get an average, entry level job after graduation that used my degree. Even though my BA in Chinese Language and Culture is a somewhat unconventional liberal arts degree, I learned skills that are applicable in a business setting.

However, my severe anxiety and depression impeded my search. It didn't help that I was drawn into daily readings of news articles decrying how bad things were for people of my generation. While I agree with these articles, it all fed into a narrative that I created for myself - a narrative in which I was not worthy of a ""real adult"" job, because I didn't have the opportunity (bad economy), skills (bad liberal arts degree), or will (bad self image). I now believe that this was a false narrative, perhaps created to serve as an excuse to not do things which caused me great anxiety, like searching for a job.

The roots of this anxiety go back to college. Deciding on a major last minute. Focusing on classwork instead of networking or getting an internship. Not planning on the future. I remember just the mere thought of my future would cause a sharp rising lurch in my stomach. Anxiety. I quickly learned that I could make this pain go away if I thought about something else, clicked on a new webpage, or drank, smoked or ate something comforting. This was the beginning of my procrastination problem. It didnt help with my weight, either. All I 
managed to do was decide what I didn't want to do with my life. A good first step, but not enough on its own.

""Hey, rengdiao, so what are you up to these days anyway?""

After I graduated, I created the lie that I was doing freelance translation, just something to say to all the people who wondered what I was doing with my life. I usually think honesty is the best policy, but what was I supposed to say to them? ""My anxiety and depression have caused me to lose faith in myself to the extent that I can hardly apply for more than one job a month."" [sobs internally]

I didn't want to bum people out. No one likes to hang with a guy who is constantly depressed. However, in hindsight, I believe that if they were truly my friends, then they wouldn't mind if I confided in them. 

Maybe that is a problem of mine. I just don't confide in people. I'm afraid they might judge me a loser or an overly emotional whiner. In the future, I am resolved that I will not be afraid to confide in my close friends. That's what they're there for, right?

Perhaps it would have been better to be honest, I don't know. But then again, my priority right now is my self. I know they are concerned because they care for me, but I don't think that explaining that I'm depressed and anxious every time someone asks if I'm ""keeping busy"" would be good for my mental health. 

I used to be the golden boy of the extended family, they thought I was a genius for studying Chinese. Hah. I fucking told them that if I was the family's golden boy, then the family is doomed. Self-fulfilling prophecy? These days, they just look at me with pity, silently wondering what went wrong. They don't understand that attaining fluency in a language like Chinese as an English speaker is more of a lifelong pursuit than something you can achieve after three years of study at university and one year studying abroad. And neither did I, until I was already well invested in the process. Mmm, sunken costs.

Looking back at the past two years, I see plenty of misery, anxiety, harsh, unproductive self-criticism, uncertainty, shame, guilt from living at home, crippling despair, and worse. I'm not proud to say that I even had suicidal thoughts, though thankfully I never acted upon them. Many nights I still feel like I am in a very dark place, but I'm beginning to see a light at the end of the tunnel. I know a way out. I just need to apply myself and get there.

I am fortunate in the sense that I have identified (some of) my problems and that I am aware of several steps that I can take to begin to solve those problems. Not everyone has such opportunities. I need to ask my general practitioner to prescribe me anti-depressant and anti-anxiety medication, and see a psychologist again. I need to begin applying for jobs again. I will aim to treat my job search like a full time job, and actually work from 9-5. I will apply to any job that I might be qualified for. I don't need to scrape the bottom of the barrel and return to my hated former retail job: my knowledge of Chinese language (even though its not fluent) and culture is useful. I just need to look for jobs that might be able to use my skills. However, at a certain point I'll take almost any job to support myself if I can't find something before I return to school in the Fall. 

This time, I aim to correct some of the mistakes I made during my first university run. I won't be taking out any loans this time, as I'm getting a 2 year associates from a community college. I managed to save enough from my last job to pay my own way (it turns out living at home, while annoying as fuck, is great for saving money). I'm going to either get an internship or network enough to ensure a job upon graduation. I'm going to utilize office hours to meet with my professors, even if I'm not struggling in class. I also chose a degree that is more applicable to the current job market. It has been two years since I graduated, something that, in all likelihood, makes recruiters immediately toss my resume without consideration. However, I am confident that if I return to school, and attain this (useful) degree, I can have a fresh start of sorts, and be successful in my quest for a non-shitty job.

I'm going to wait to move out until after I've found a job, but before classes start. My car is getting shittier, and it would be nice to be able to bike or walk to work. If I can find a cheap place close to wherever I end up working, I'll take it. My mom demands that I live in a non-shitty part of town. I'd sure like to, but we'll have to see where I work and how much I make.

So now I know what I have to do. I just have to execute. Crazy as it may seem, I'm actually in a better place than where I was after I graduated almost two years ago. Having a plan feels so much better than drifting aimlessly through a hell of my own creation. Who would've thought?"

I have been looking for some supplemental readings or areas where I can get some additional information on the type of tasks that may be involved in such an operation.  So if any of you have some locations that you cold share for supplemental instruction that would be greatly appreciated!

I was officially diagnosed with depression about four years ago, although I'd say I've been living with it for about eight years now.

It's been a long and arduous journey. I dropped out of school twice. Quit three separate jobs. Switched majors twice. I finally came back and now am only one semester away from graduating with a CS degree at UNC (Chapel Hill). I graduate this December.

I managed to bring my GPA up from a 2.6 to a 3.3. I have an internship this summer that pays pretty decently and is at a pretty well known company.

But even with all these great things happening. I'm still constantly depressed.

I run hard every day (average 50 miles a week). I avoid eating bad foods. I keep a journal and write down my problems so that I can rationalize them and cope better.

Yet I'm still depressed. I'm still crying.

School is so hard and stressful. Every semester feels like a slow torture until finals. I constantly am thinking ""will I be able to keep up? Or will I need to drop out again?"" My only hope at the moment is that when I graduate things will get a little better.

Feel free to respond with anything (tell me I'm full of shit if you want). I just needed to get this off my chest."
217ms2,2,2014-03-24,"[23M] with love interest [21F] of about 2 months: It went from intellectual, to sexual, to me left alone and figuring out what happened. HALP!",Professor_Rave,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/217ms2/23m_with_love_interest_21f_of_about_2_months_it/,"I've (23m) been talking to a girl (21f) since mid-January. We met online in a rave-oriented group, and ended up meeting face to face at a house party in early February. The chemistry was palpable and our first kiss was that night.


Our conversations were incredibly stimulating on an intellectual, philosophical, and sexual level. We shared our flawed pasts, our deepest thoughts, and met up 4 or 5 times (just the two of us). Meetups were difficult, as she lives in a city and I live one state over, but public transit/my car made the journey about 30-45 minutes for either of us. I've always been willing to drive in to see her. Each meetup was intimate, with some hand holding, playful flirting, kissing in public, and deep, engaging conversation. We ended up having sex right at about the first week of March, and it was incredible. 


Then, she got busy. New job, her senior year of college, new internship, and, basically, she decided that she didn't have time for me. We ended up at a few electronic shows together (because our ""rave group"" is relatively tight knit), and she barely gave me the time of day. I know I should walk away, (because I know I'm a really thoughtful and sensitive tough guy - confidence, not arrogance), but I'm finding it hard to get over how great it started off.  Her excuse has been and continues to be ""I'm busy and don't have time to maintain this."" Yet I know that she has time to see other people, sometimes men (not necessarily jealous, just confused)


Also, she's literally one of the 5 most attractive people I've ever met. I don't understand how someone can have the types of intellectually dense and thought provoking conversations AS WELL AS having a crazy physical attraction to each other (her words from early on) and decide it isn't worth putting a LITTLE effort into.


HALP ME PLZ.


(side notes: I've been with multiple women in the past, and I'm a 'generous' lover. Relatively well-endowed and impressive stamina...leads me to believe the answer isn't ""you suck in the sack."")

As you can infer from the title, this deck uses the unholy tag team of Caprice Nisei and Ash to lock down your remotes.  This isn't a shell game Replicating Perfection, this is a super server RP.  The Runner will know exactly where the agenda is:  it's in the place with a ton of upgrades.  The role of RP is to tax both the Runner's clicks and credits in order to attack a server.

Sansan is here to turn all those 4/2 agendas into 3/2 so they only need to be vulnerable for one turn without having to advance it when you install it.  Plus, it's also a large credit sink that I'd be happy if they trash -- I can just intern it back.

The economy is provided by Sundew, Celebrity Gift, Hedge Fund, and Subliminal Messaging.  Messaging is there to pressure the Runner into making sub-optimal runs as well as to pad out HQ for the Gift and for generic HQ accesses.

Having spent all the influence on Ash and Sansan, I had to make do with only Jinteki and neutral ICE.  Simply put, I chose only the taxing ones plus Himitsu-Bako which can be recalled to pad HQ when necessary.  13 ICE might be too thin.  In that case, I'd probably switch the Sansan for more toothy ICE like Ichi or Rototurret, but I'm on the fence about this."
2181bt,32,2014-03-24,Martha Jones: Underrated Companion,Supermansboxers,doctorwho,https://www.reddit.com/r/doctorwho/comments/2181bt/martha_jones_underrated_companion/,"From the beginning, she was the rebound for both The Doctor and for us, the viewers. 
For me, my heart was still healing from the departure of Rose. Seeing The Doctor traumatized from the loss made the role of the companion a truly difficult one to fill. Enter Martha Jones played by Freema Agyeman.
Martha’s character first appeared in “Smith and Jones” in season 3. I was actually impressed with her determination and innocence as she came to terms with this new man in her life. What I also liked about her character was the involvement of her family throughout, which showed a completely different family setting to “The Tylers”. 
As the series progressed, The Doctor’s walls began to break down and he began to accept that Rose was gone. However, both Whovians and viewers alike were still defensive that Rose could be replaced.
Like any true rebound, the broken hearted will never truly appreciate what they have in front of them. For some, they “regenerate” themselves from the love of their rebound. Use them like a crutch to lean on as they make their way to their destination before one day they no longer need them. Eventually Martha realized this and left before The Doctor swapped places with her and she became the truly heartbroken one.
This is why I admire Martha. She was more relatable than people realized at the time but in hind sight Martha was a force to be reckoned with. She was almost a diluted, tamer version of Donna.
“I travelled across the world. From the ruins of New York, to the fusion mills of China, right across the radiation pits of Europe. And everywhere I went I saw people just like you, living as slaves! But if Martha Jones became a legend then that’s wrong, because my name isn’t important. There’s someone else. The man who sent me out there, the man who told me to walk the Earth. And his name is The Doctor. He has saved your lives so many times and you never even knew he was there. He never stops. He never stays. He never asks to be thanked. But I’ve seen him, I know him… I love him…”
She was willing to travel the world from just a few words from The Doctor. Her strength, courage and determination grew from the wide eyed medical intern to the independent woman that stood before The Doctor in “The Last of The Time Lords” taking back her life.

Martha Jones is a very underrated character and one that should be remembered!"

I'm currently applying and hearing back for internship positions in the summer.

I have a feeling that whatever I intern for in the summer (Design or Research) will most likely be what I will end up doing as my entry job. 

I have a few questions for you:

a) If I interned as a UX Designer, can I still apply (would you still hire me) as a UX researcher?

b) If I took an entry level position as a UX Designer, would I be able to move around in the company as a UX Researcher? (If company allowed movements within company?

I understand that the positions are separate but from what I've gathered are not completely mutually exclusive.

Thank you for your responses and if anyone has any anecdotal experience I would love to hear back.

My best bud is out of control. He doesn't give a shit about his life and spends 100% of his paycheck on booze, weed, or any other drug he can get his hands on (which thankfully is not often). He didn't go to college but has a good office internship that I recommended him for. He's a very friendly and talented guy with zero motivation. He recently had to move back in with his parents because his housing situation was getting ""too expensive"" (read: competing with his substance habits).

Some relevant points:

We work together in a start-up, play-hard environment with coworkers who like to booze up quite frequently, but often times my friend is at the bar alone.

He comes to work stoned probably every day. He frequently cuts his work days in half so he can hit happy hour at 3.

The day before payday, he is absolutely broke. Not a penny to his name. On payday, he goes to the bar and buys drinks. For everyone.

He drives home drunk almost every day. He lives about half hour from our office and the road home is very windy (ton of people I know including myself have wiped out and totaled cars while stone cold sober).

When we were 18, he lost his best friend (and my boyfriend) to suicide. Not sure if this is entirely relevant but I suspect he may be depressed about this still.

His parents don't seem to notice for some reason. As far as I know, they are not intervening at all or even trying to give him advice. I feel like it's not my place to nag him about life stuff, but I'm really concerned about his future. He is on his way to addiction, death from an accident, or a DUI which would make his life so much worse.

How do I express my concern to him seriously without seeming like I'm just a nagging know-it-all?

Thanks for reading.

218rdb,5,2014-03-24,"How to decide if a CS or Stats PhD, and asking for advice",musiqua,GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/218rdb/how_to_decide_if_a_cs_or_stats_phd_and_asking_for/,"This post has a few parts to it:

1. I am trying to figure out if a PhD program is right for me
2. If so, whether I should look at doing Computer Science or Statistics
3. Whether I even have a shot at getting in
4. How to go about applying if I go for it

I know these are a lot of questions, but I don't know anyone in my life who is doing / has done a PhD, and I have no idea where to get answers for these questions. If you have any suggestions for resources for information, I will run with them!


  1.PhD program? You're thinking about what?

I got my BA from a top 10 school in economics statistics, and spent a few years in Finance before defecting to a startup as a stats analyst. Along the way I discovered computer science and how amazing I think it is--I taught myself python, MySQL, Scheme, and now I'm working on Java. I'm interested in cache optimization, low level languages, compiled vs. interpreted languages, and pretty much anything else I can get my hands on. I feel like there is a whole world of knowledge out there, especially in the intersection of statistics and computer science, that I want to contribute to. I'm trying to teach myself what I can, but there's no real rigor to my studies, and I have no one to guide me when I have questions. I want to continue my education for real, and nothing makes me more excited than the idea of spending a good chunk of years thinking about computers. I read white papers in my spare time. This seems like what a PhD is supposed to be for.

  2.CS? Stats?

Despite my enthusiasm, I don't have any ""real"" computer science experience. I've never taken a programming or theory class, and all I know right now is what I've been able to glean on my own. I feel like no Computer Science program would ever admit someone who doesn't know any C++ or hasn't written a compiler or never even took a BA class. This makes me think that maybe I should try applying to a Statistics program and then try and make my area of study heavy in the area of Computer Science, since I at least have a statistics degree and some idea of what I might be doing. Is that even an option? I don't know.

  3.Don't matter if they won't take me
The requirements that I've seen so far for PhD program admissions have been pretty daunting. My grades from undergrad were pretty good (3.8), but not 4.0 worthy. I never did any research except one summer internship with a climate science group. I took the general GRE and got a 660 on the Verbal and a 770 on the math, which I take to be average at best, and certainly not good. Are these qualifiers good enough to apply anywhere at all?

  4.How to...
The other wrinkle I have is that these scores expire on July 1 of this year. Do programs ever let you apply early for fall admission? I haven't taken a test in a while and don't think I would do well if I had to take the GRE again. This is a distressing thought for me. Does this seem like an exercise in futility? Do I need to take post-bac classes and re-take the GRE and try and find an internship in order to be able to even think about this path?


I really appreciate any advice you all might have for me, including links for me to read up on things. I feel totally out of my depth even thinking about this path, everyone I know went into finance and I've already burned my contacts having quit and gone to a startup.

We both talked to each other about our sex lives before hand. Well okay, so there was this one girl in my past she was a red head, absolutely beautiful, and had a very aesthetic vagina. I say this because she is the first girl I legit went down on, and even enjoyed going down on. My current girlfriend knows this because I told her about her.

Now comes the problem we started dating, sex has been good on both ends. I can't get her off with penetration but I can get her off with my hand pretty damn good. So here comes the problem she wants me to go down on her, and in general I can't. I find it gross and uncomfortable. I gave it a shot twice, but could only last like 30 seconds smell isn't too strong just felt dirty if that makes sense. 

Sure enough, she brings up the other girl in my past that I liked going down on. Now she knows and I know that two vaginas aren't the same. She decided to go on blow job strike which I told her that's perfectly fine. Then she starts getting mad at me for not caring enough to argue with her about it. 

I don't know what to do, I don't even understand why she would want me to go down on her even after I told her it's uncomfortable. She never made a fuss about it in her other relationships because no other guy went down on her. 

I get the whole jealousy thing, but I do a lot of other things to make her feel special. Plus the other girl it wasn't just I went down on her, she did a lot of other things for me. She and I would have threesomes, videotaped our sessions, and her dad even got me an internship, plus she gave porn star like blow jobs. Do I tell my girlfriend that she did all this for me hence why I also went down on her? or will that only make the rift worse."

I have an internship this summer in the loop and I'm looking for somewhere convenient to stay. The specific dates I'll be here are 5/15 to 8/20 with a bit of flexibility on the ends. 800 sounds reasonable to me but I'd be willing to go higher if you have something good!

A few things about me: I'm a quiet and clean computer type. Definitely not a partier, enjoy cooking, board games, and spend a lot of my time programming.  I'm not planning on bringing my car so I want somewhere with easy transport to the loop.  You can always expect me to pay rent on time (or ahead of time if you want) and I'll leave the place cleaner than I found it.

218tpd,6,2014-03-24,My Story,takingcontrol123,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/218tpd/my_story/,"I never really knew what to call my mom. After my mom decided to blame me for something that was not my fault the other night, I decided to do a google search and came across this subreddit. After reading through a bunch of posts for a few days, I knew I now had a place of people who have experienced life like me. My mother is most certainly a narcissist. I currently am 24 years old and still living with my mom and step father. This will be long but it feels good to write it down.

I don't even know where to start with explaining her and what she has done. I would say she hasn't done some of the crazy things I have heard about on hear but to me she is the worst. My brother and I were raised to believe that we were not good enough. No matter what there was always another loop to jump through. This has a hugeee impact on my self confidence. I being the youngest got the worst of it. I wouldn't say my brother was the golden child but he definitely shows narcissistic tendencies and she leans toward always helping him no matter how he treats her. When my parents got divorced when I was 9-10, she came to me to deal with her problems. I had to somehow make my mom feel better. I honestly don't remember much around that time or before. Not sure if I put a mental block up or what but I can't remember much besides what people tell me.

Luckily my dad was smart enough to get divorced which gave me a safe haven for some years. I lived with him for my last two years of high school. I lived with a friend for a summer and I had recently been living with my dad for like 6 months before I moved back. As healthy as it is to get away from her, I refuse to let her influence my life choices. My dad moved far away and my life is here so that is not an option. I am finally almost done school and even while having to survive her, I have improved my life in so many ways. I went from being an incredibly anti-social kid to people not believing I was even capable of being anti-social. I realized that I was a porn addict which was my drug of choice to deal with my issues and have been successfully fighting my addiction.

The one area that I still really struggle with even though it has drastically improved is my self-confidence. I have been told by many about how smart I am and how successful I will be. Recently the head of IT at my school came to me and offered me an internship to help her improve our school (my major is in technology so this is a great opportunity). Even with all of this and theres even more then this that has happened, I find it incredibly difficult to accept this all about myself. My mom drilled it so hard into me that no matter what I wasn't good enough, that to me all of this isn't enough. I have found ways to deal with my mom now but this is an issue that I struggle with. I do have self-confidence in myself and my abilities. I believe I can do anything and will be successful, but I struggle with believing that at this moment I am enough. It's hard to explain exactly how I feel but I am hoping you all can understand.

Even though it would of been nice to have a mother who was capable of loving me and giving me everything I needed, I do not regret anything about my life. I have learned that there are no bad experiences in life. Every experience is a chance to learn something. I wouldn't be the amazing person I have become now. It was not a fun journey at times but now that I have survived, I don't think anything can stop me from becoming the person I know I am capable of. I accept my mother for who she is and have learned to pretty much ignore her when she has her bad moments. I hope to participate in this community as it will help me when there are bad times. Now I have a place with people who experienced similar experience and I am so grateful for finding this group.

I don't know what to do, I don't even understand why she would want me to go down on her even after I told her it's uncomfortable. She never made a fuss about it in her other relationships because no other guy went down on her. 

I get the whole jealousy thing, but I do a lot of other things to make her feel special. Plus the other girl it wasn't just I went down on her, she did a lot of other things for me. She and I would have threesomes, videotaped our sessions, and her dad even got me an internship, plus she gave porn star like blow jobs. Do I tell my girlfriend that she did all this for me hence why I also went down on her? or will that only make the rift worse. I didn't go down on my previous gf because I felt obligated to or that's how I measured my love for her, it actually felt good. 

If my girlfriend wants to break up with me, I can understand her reasoning, however she tells me she doesn't want to split up and neither do I. However, we still haven't moved pass this fight yet. Exactly what do you guys suggest I do?

There's a good chance my parents will not support me when I come out. I doubt they'll disown me, but they'll probably doubt the validity of my dysphoria. So my plan was, I would start transitioning by myself and just hope they'd come around some day. I have a free dorm as part of my scholarship so I was planning on just living there.

But today I realized I don't have it for the summer. The only possible thing I could do is try to get an internship, but since the deadline for signing up is very soon, there's very little chance I'll be able to get one in time. 

I could potentially stay with some friends, but I wouldn't be able to do that for the entire summer. 

The only other option to stay off the streets would be to stay with my parents. I doubt I'll be able to hide my transition, since I rarely go out, so my parents would be suspicious of me constantly leaving the house. Also, they tend to ask lots of questions when I do, like where did I go, what did I do, etc. So they'd catch on.

And I don't know if I can survive if I put off transition for that long. I go through random suicidal phases that are increasing in both frequency and intensity. It's getting harder to live every day. I doubt I'll be able to hold on for another 6 months without transitioning. 

So I have no idea what to do. Can someone give me some advice?"

Even though it looked like we would get together, this problem is causing me to look like I'm not interested and is already destroying the relationship before it even began. Not only I seek advice, but also want to get this off my chest.


But to fully describe the problem, I have to start from the beginning and include a short summary of my past. Please understand that I do not wish to recieve sympathy in any way from it; I include the story of my past merely for the reason that it is detrimental for the explanation of my problem.


As a small kid, I was very extroverted and loved hanging out with friends. My early childhood was great and did not go without a ""childhood love"". It stopped going well come fourth grade of elementary school. My mind matured much faster than the other kids', I realised I was different from them, and started closing in on myself, becoming an introvert.


They did too soon realise that I was different from them, and the bullying came not long afterwards. Verbal and physical, both increasing in severity relentlessly. Hell, even some of the teachers had me for a weirdo. This continued until the end of elementary school and drained all my confidence away, stalled my personal development, and encased me in depressions.


Then came high school. Completely wrecked from elementary, I once again became the target of bullies, and quit the basically all-boys high school in half a year.


After that I signed up for another highschool, this time it was a grammar school with 50/50 gender ratio, and my life finally took a brighter turn. Sure, I still was the odd one out, but this time, I managed to find people I liked, as everyone was much nicer and smarter than in my previous schools. As a result, I started slowly breaking the shell I had built for myself.


Though while I was regaining overall confidence over the four years of high school, I did not manage to regain it in one area. As you might have guessed, It was talking to girls that I liked. With the few girls I liked, my mind would become a static fuzz when trying to talk to them, unable to take any action. Which is not the problem I have now, but bear with me.


With new gained confidence, I graduated at the top of the class from high school, and prepared for university to come. But, unbeknownst to many of my classmates, I also led a second life. From the times of elementary school, I was addicted to online gaming. I do not see a bad thing in it; the artificial world helped keep me sane by providing a place I could run to from the bullies, so it did save me in a way.


I was still unable to talk to women I liked at that time, but extremely desperate for someone that would love me. ""I can not talk to women, but I can chat with them online"", I thought. So instead, I started searching for someone on my online game, and surely enough, I found someone that was just perfect for me.


She was much older than I was; 30 years old at the time, 10 years older than me. Nevertheless, I loved everything about her and would soon confess. My feelings were returned and what came afterwards would be some of the happiest days of my life.


During that time, I found myself so overjoyed with finally having someone, that my love - which had originally stemmed from reason, turned into one that was unconditional and absolute. Which finally brings us to the point where I first identified my problem.


I became irrationally, mindlessly obsessed with the woman and put her above everything else. Complying with anything she would ask me to do, I completely threw away my reasoning.


Which turned out to be quite the bad idea, because after some time in the relationship, she threw away the mask she had put on and worn very vell, and revealed her true nature, which was that of a manipulative, abusive sociopath. By the time I realized it, it was already late - she had wrapped me around her finger.


Even though I did have some reasoning left, my love did not. Even though it would hurt me greatly mentally and stressed me out so much I could die. I would comply with any of her requests, I would let her shout at me for causing her problems that I had never caused - sometimes for 10 hours straight. I did also lose a drastic majority of my online friends, and my place to seek haven in; thanks to her manipulative online escapades.


This had caused me so much stress that after three months of this I finally broke down and forced myself to break up with her. I was unable to function normally as a human being for six months afterwards. I spent all of my time shut in my room depressed, and naturally failed university because of that.


It took me almost a full year to gather my thoughts and recover. Sometime in the proccess I had decided that with the start of my second attempt to pass university I would become a completely new human being, that I would be born anew.


It worked. I decided to throw away all irrational thinking and gave up on the prospect of ever having a significant other. I practiced analytical and critical thinking and distanced myself from the concepts and rules of society - I became an emotionless machine only functioning on reason with my own set of rules.


To this day, probably the best decision in my life I ever made. I lost interest in 99,99% of women, gained immense confidence and stopped caring about anything bad being said about me. 


I was once again at the top of my class and passed all university courses with ease. As my academic life progressed, I gained an opportunity to intern at extremely technologically advanced and lucrative workplace and could not be doing better. These good times went on for a while and finally bring us to 7 weeks before the current day.


There was this woman in my class I took interest in. I was being extremely careful about rationally justifying everything about my interest in her. After carefully examining her personality, I decided that she was someone that I could love healthily and rationally.


With my newfound confidence, I had no problem holding long conversations with her and suggesting how I felt. She started returning the suggestions, and it became obvious that the feelings were mutual.


But, then it happened again. Once she started making moves on me, I started to feel that my love was once again taking on an irrational form. Which suddenly brought my past back to me. It all started flashing through my head again : the outcome of my previous irrational love, my unability to talk to women, my depression, the static fuzz, everything.


As a result of this, I become reluctant and unresponsive every time she makes a move. This makes me look like I have lost interest in her. I sometimes manage to get it togeter and swiftly get rid of the unhealthy obsessive love, again improving our relationship. But once it improves, my love irrationalizes again. It is like a rollercoaster, a vicious cycle. On top of this, I have started doing bad in classes again.


I am running out of time, and will soon lose my chance to ask her out. However, I won't do so until I can make 100% sure that my love for her will stay rational. I became extremely picky about women because of my previous relationship, so it may be several years before another woman I like comes by. I do not want to miss this chance.  What should I do?


---   
**tl;dr**:  My love, based on rational facts keeps transforming into obsessive, unconditional, unhealthy love. What can I do to stop it from becoming like this and being healthy? What can I do to stop that one person from meaning the world to me?"

I'm in the Navy and she is finishing her degree in Occupational Therapy this year.  The plan had always been that when she finished she would come live with me and that would be our end date but now suddenly shes having doubts about weather she can continue to do long distance and if she will be able to do the moves that the military life requires.  She thinks we should break up because she doesn't want to sacrifice her career and doesn't see how we can ever be together, and the amount of commitment required for it is just not what she is willing to make at this point in her life.  I am her first serious boyfriend and she just finished the academic part of her degree and is moving into a graded internship to finish and I think just the amount of stuff changing in her life may have scared her. We are both still crazy in love with each other and distance is hard but these issues really are a bit of a surprise as we've talked about them and she seemed okay before.  We are currently taking a week long no talk break to get our heads straight but I don't want to lose her, what can I do to ease her fears.  What can I say?  I am crazy about this girl and can't stand the thought of losing her."

I absolutely love comp sci. I spend a lot of my free time programming, doing web design/development for a start up and on top of that I'm taking a pretty ambitious course load. This year I've taken both Java classes that my CC offers on top of the usual physics, calculus ect. I have good grades (3.8 gpa) and I'm out pacing most of my class mates in Java. Granted these are intro classes at a community college but I really do feel that I've got a knack for CS.

That being said, come summer I'd really love to advance my skill set but I'm afraid that the fact that I go to a community college will make me a less desirable candidate for internships. I live in the San Diego area and I'm sure most of the big companies look for UCSD students to fill their internships.

What can I do to find an internship that I can learn from? I could take on web development projects this summer but I don't find it as interesting as coding in say Java or C++ and I'd be willing to do it for free if it meant a better learn opportunity. Where should I be looking? What should I be doing to set my self apart from the students going to a big name university?

Due to working while going to school combined with being a single parent going through a custody battle through my junior year, I am going to have a 2.8 GPA with a similar major GPA (might be 3.0 major, but it's not certain yet.) 
I went to one job fair last year at school and received one job interview from it with a company that was very interested in me, but I did not meet their 3.5 GPA requirement. Honestly I don't know anyone in my major at this university who does. Past year graduates have a 100% job offer rate for my major according to the career office. We will have another job fair I think next month but not sure about that.

I am getting nervous that I dont have a job yet but I havent had the time to pursue one outside of the job fair and I dont know where to start. I need to update my resume from last year.

Here are the basics:
I had an internship with the IT dept at the university but I literally did nothing for them. I was supposed to do some network support and scripting but their priorities changed and between the 3 people working with me I never received any work. Nothing. This wasted my opportunity for a junior internship. The IT dept is willing to say that I did this networking work, but I dont think thats a good idea.

I won first place in a statewide video game programming competition last year and will be competing again this year. The games are programmed from scratch in Java, no engine. I have my projects for last year and this year on Git but no other projects of note.

I am working with a senior team to create an ipad application from scratch for a local school for disabled children and have done a large part of the gaming contributions for the app. This app is not and will not be on the App Store as it is the curriculum for the school. I cannot post the code on my git but have a copy of the app on my personal devices for development. Not sure how to include this on my resume.

I am interested in getting an averages to well paying programming job and think I have the ability. My gpa doesn't show that. My internship was bunk. I may be being an alarmist but I am beginning to worry whether I will get a job at all in the next few months. What should I do? I updated my LinkedIn but that website strikes me a backpatting worthlessness."

I never cut off Neil Young for anything less than an emergency but I think this qualifies. I turned off the car and opened the wood paneled door. As I gazed out over the lake, where I had spent most of my childhood, a breeze drifted over the water.  The smell of the pine trees and the old wood cabin brought about a sudden rush of memories. I stood for a moment and began to walk, past the canoe in which I used to paddle across to the local store, past the fire pit in which had burned a thousand happy memories. I took off my shoes and walked down to the lake’s edge.   I felt the sand between my toes and in that moment the rush of childlike wonder, innocence, and freedom came to me as if through a haze.    I turned and took in the entirety of the camp, the old swings we used to jump off, the mounds of dirt we used to shoot our BB guns at, the rocks we would play on, the table where we would eat cold cuts and the occasional moose meat stew, and the dock we would sit on when we got older and smoke cigarettes lifted out of our mothers purse. I remember the way this place used to make me feel, as if the birds in the trees where flying with me through a sky of infinite possibility. Now it just feels numb, like a photograph of a younger brother I had lost.  I can recall the memories and know  the way I once felt but I cannot feel it in my soul.   I just feel empty. The lake rippled as I looked across to the old house once owned by my friend Dan.  The windowpanes broken, roof losing shingles, a derelict skeleton of a once beautiful home. I remember swimming over there every morning to visit my childhood friend.  But that property had not been properly kept up, after Dans mother passed the property was bought by a rich stock broker.  To my knowledge he hadn’t been there even once. I found myself full of resentment for time, taking away the person I used to be, the places I  loved.  Stealing all the fun I once had and replacing it with a cold hollow feeling as I slowly worked myself to death.  I used to think I would never sell out.  `I would work outside, breath fresh air, see mountains. It was a slippery slope from there.   I told myself that an internship was just something I needed to pay the rent while I worked towards my real goal.  Then I told myself the full time position was just more money for the same amount of work and of course I would still work towards communing with nature and finding my true calling and regaining that happiness that I once knew. Eventually a full time position turned into a promotion and then another.   Before I knew it I was 15 years down the road.   I wasn’t in contact with any of my old friends but I told myself people grow apart and it was normal. Somewhere along the line Dan had got himself a wife and we had been growing apart ever since, she didn’t like me. Slowly I found myself alone.   Parents claimed by age.   Fiancé taken by cancer.   I realized I was without ties to the  human world.   I  had no friends at work and my old Aussie Shephard mix, Bear, was getting sicker and sicker. Then one day he couldn’t make it up the stairs anymore.  He could hardly make it outside to pee, he was in pain but I couldn’t bare to let go.  He was my only tie to life, the only thing that made me feel real. Eventually I knew I had to do it.   I brought him to a veterinary hospital and he died with his head in my lap.  I could hardly contain my grief. I thought of his ashes in my car. I went and got them brought them to the cabin and tried the door. It was unlocked, nobody had been here in years.  I walked over to the bed in which I slept every summer back when I was happy.   I  reached into my pocket and  pulled out a piece of paper with only one sentence on it.   I laid it on the bedside table and laid down on the bed.  The springs creaked and sagged.  I rested Bears ashes on my chest and reached for into the  waistband of my pants.  Don’t be afraid, this is the answer.  I can be happy again, together with my dog and my memories forever.  My fingers fumbled in nervousness and then as my hand found the cold metal handle.  It was a source of inner calm. The note reads ‘John O’Malley a sinking ship on the turbulent ocean of the mind.’

21alew,2,2014-03-24,Moving to Ottawa,adeandrade,ottawa,https://www.reddit.com/r/ottawa/comments/21alew/moving_to_ottawa/,"Hey reddit,

I took an internship offer from a tech company in Ottawa. The company is located in North Kanata. I'm currently looking for a place to live and have problems setting my priorities straight.

Now, I'm male, 28 and single. I don't go out for no good reason but do enjoy going to movie theaters, pubs, concerts and dining out.

I heard Kanata is not the place for a single guy but my family overseas does visit me for extended periods of time (2-4 months  a year). One of my family members uses a wheelchair and I'm concerned about Ottawa's accesibility. I want to avoid getting a car unless necessary.

Other threads suggest Westboro or Hintonburg and facing the 1 hour commute but these are somewhat outdated. A city can change a lot in 3 years.

Which neighborhood would you recommend me? How would getting a car affect your recommendation?

I should say thay my budget is around ~$1,300.

Thank you.

EDIT: Seems like having a car is a must. Assuming I get a car now, how bad would it be to live in Kanata? What would you rather reduce? Work or entertainment commute time?"

Started NoFap just after the new year, simultaneously started habit of rock climbing. Increased time for other activities, handstand practice, stamp carving, friends, INTERNSHIP APPLICATIONS etc. As a Junior year Engineering Major, I have found that all of the small snippets of time I used to spend fapping can come together to create quite numerous amounts of void space in the day. This journey has given use and meaning to those (now productive) times.


I have just today been offered (and I have accepted) a summer internship position at a company out of state! I had a phone interview before this and since my conscience was clean from my new lifestyle, everything just flowed... I talked with the interviewer about my hobbies (some new because of NoFap) and my passions, and what value I believe I could give him and his company, and I guess it turns out that all of the hard work I have put into school and extra activities and clubs and resume building has paid off! I have been flooded with joy all day from the support and love coming from my friends and family over this news! This will really set my career in a good direction as well as hopefully sculpt what type of work I would like to do in the future. Also, I will be living on my own for the first time ever, and will hopefully be able to afford a motorcycle (already licensed!) - so there are grand adventures in my near future!


Today was a big step forward. Every day without the vice of PMO controlling my life is another step forward. Keep your goals in sight, work hard, improve always - we win together."

I'm just going to get it all off my chest, so I apologize fir any rambling.

I have never had a real job before, except a one-month internship at an art studio where I coached young children.  I'm very shy, and I didn't have confidence in my ability as an art teacher, because I wasn't really trained at all.  I also felt uncomfortable caring for young children, and I had to be very careful to make sure they didn't run off or leave with the wrong person.  It was really really stressful, so I'd rather not be a camp counselor or anything like that.

I don't have any savings for college, and I want to burden my parents as little as possible.  My dad has been telling me how he started working at 13 in the 50's, why didn't I have a job already, etc.  I agree with him.  I can't just laze about now, because real life will hit me next year and I want to be as prepared as I possibly can.

So I'm on my second week of Spring Break now, and I vowed to try and find a job for the summer during these to weeks.  But I'm totally out of my depth and have no idea what I'm doing.  

I timidly asked some clerks at chains like Michael's, CVS, etc., if there were any job openings for the summer.  It took me forever to work up the nerve to ask, and they all said no, but to send in an application online anyway.  I've been putting this off and I honestly don't know why.  

I'm in a town that has a lot of stores, but I have no real experience, I've never been a waitress or a clerk and feel so embarrassed to ask.  I'm terrified of seeming presumptuous.  I don't want them to think, ""Why is she sauntering in here and asking for a full-time summer job, she has no work experience, she's not even 18 (I turn 18 in mid-August)""

I'm just stuck and tearing my hair out because I NEED to get a summer job and it's already late and the positions will be filled.  

Please, can someone just tell me what to do.  I'm in the US, in New Jersey.

I am looking for support from people who want to see others get saved.  Also, tips on fundraising would be cool.

Hi, friends!

I'm going to be spending the next year as a missionary in a graduate-level internship in ministry (through Campus Christian Fellowship and the Assembly of God Church) and was hoping you guys (and gals) could help me out. 

This is my first time going on a mission and attempting any sort of fundraising.  I've been given a limited amount of training on how to do so, but I know I'm going to need some more help.

Within the next week, I will need to come up with about 100 names/addresses/phone numbers from every person I've ever made eye contact with on the face of the planet.  I thought I'd try something different and see if anyone on this sub-reddit would be as philanthropic as members from other sub-reddits.  It's a shot in the dark, but I guess it couldn't hurt, right?  

So, here's what you can do to help me act as a servant for the Lord the next year:

1) Provide any fundraising tips/experience you may have in regards to gaining support from individuals, churches, etc.

2) PM me with your personal information and I will send you a support letter.

Note:  You'll notice this is my first post with this account.  You caught me!  I'm a lurker haha.  I'm stepping out in faith.  If God wants this to happen, it will :)  Also, I'll answer any questions you might have as truthfully as possible without giving out too much personal information.  This is the internet after all.

I'm torn between going to grad school for something I'm passionate about vs. taking a fat check at a job where I'm indifferent to the work.

Long story short, my ultimate career goal is to end up at NASA (though I'd settle for any aerospace company/organization, to be honest).  I've always had a passion for space systems, equipment, and missions.  I've applied to tons of jobs and internships in the industry but to no avail.  I have good grades (~3.7 GPA) and decent internship and work experience.  I've gotten job offers outside of the aerospace industry (mostly in the oil industry) and have also been accepted to an ME masters program at a top engineering school.  I never saw myself going to grad school and honestly want to be done with school so I can start working and living (and paying off debt...).

However, the jobs I've been offered hardly interest me aside from a nice paycheck (which would help with the huge student loans, i.e. my main motivation for going straight to work out of undergrad), and I feel that they wouldn't really give me nearly as much experience that could be put towards the aerospace industry as grad school would.  Conversely, I'm just really not in the mood or mindset for grad school (more loans, more stress, etc.), but I feel that I would be so much closer to an aerospace position with the masters.

Does anybody have any insight into my situation that they're willing to share?  Been through a similar decision?  I'll take any advice I can get. 

Thanks in advance.

The institution is a one of its kind initiative that addresses the dearth of talent in the geoinformatics domain in India. When it comes to geoinformatics, the applications are widespread. After all, everything from the simple GPRS system on your phone to the complicated agriculture operations, a lot is dependent on the applications of Remote sensing and GIS. Given this scenario, geoinformatics is bound to offer plenty of opportunities to build a flourishing career. However, the only way to lay the foundations of a strong career is to be armed with the right qualification and SIG helps you in this pursuit. 
Every year, there are thousands of students who aspire to make it big by getting a degree from Symbiosis college Pune especially if you want to pursue a niche program like the MSC in Geoinformatics. In fact, there are students who end up choosing mediocre options and ruining their careers. The programs being offered at SIG come as a respite for several such students. Being a part of the premier league Symbiosis Institutes, SIG allows you to realize your MBA in Symbiosis dream. What’s more is that the students get to pursue a niche program dealing purely with Geospatial sciences. This is guaranteed to improve their career options and therefore promises a better future. 
Also, you don’t have to settle for a diploma program or a part time course. Instead, you get to pursue a full time Masters program in Symbiosis and that from one of the best GIS institutes in India. The two year program covers all the basics of geoinformatics and therefore helps students develop the much sought after professional expertise in the domain. Unlike the others, SIG does not compromise on the training process employed to teach the participants. Everything from the industry interface programs to the mandatory internship modules, is taught to the students in an organized manner in order to have the relevant impact. 
Even during the curriculum, the students are encouraged to take up research projects where they get a chance to test their learning and make amendments wherever needed. In fact, SIG is amongst the premier GIS institutes in India that also offers placement assistance to the students. The placement season sees some of the big names of the industry come down to the SIG campus in search of genuine talent. Also, SIG takes regular feedback from these industry recruiters and accordingly modifies its curriculum to ensure that the students are always updated with the latest. It is a unique opportunity where participants can realize their MBA in Symbiosis dream and lay the foundations of a great career.

I posted some code and the details to my question on the Unity forums but I figured that reddit has been more help, as a browser, to me, than the forums ever have been.

If you don't mind taking a look at the post and possibly helping me out, that would be fantastic. As the post states, I'm fairly new to Unity and have issues applying my theory to the code. Don't hesitate to jump into C# programming, as I'm an intern at a software engineering company.

The issue, I suppose, that I have is that I've never programmed in 2D or 3D.

21buhf,6,2014-03-25,My GF [18F] and I [19M] love each other but don’t want to get in the way of each other’s futures.,Frenchi115,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/21buhf/my_gf_18f_and_i_19m_love_each_other_but_dont_want/,"My girlfriend and I met in high school, I am one year ahead of her, and have been together for 2.5 years.  Neither of us had any experience dating before being together.  She is the definition of first love, and someone I am sure I will never forget.  We now go to school at different colleges about 10 minutes apart, and 2 hours from our hometown, and see each other between 1 and 3 times a week. 


A few months ago we were driving back to school together for spring semester, and she said that she would like to no longer be together, because she doesn’t want me to shape her future, and she wants to be a strong independent individual.  While terribly heartbroken, I asked her to give me a few months to make changes to our relationship and try to fix things.  I want her to be a strong individual, and although I have a major effect on her ability to be independent I think one way or another it’s a change she will have to make, and my presence won’t make a huge difference. We made a few simple rules in an attempt to address her major grievances: 

-No more goodnights (for 2 years we had said goodnight to one another for all but 3 nights)

-No talking to each other about problems outside of our relationship (we have done pretty well, but soso on this rule)

-Fewer nights spent together (or time in general)

-No more talking or planning for the future (Last semester I had wanted to talk a lot about when in the next few years we might be able to live together, which stressed her out.  To me living together was a response to my wanting to spend more time with her, but she took the commitment far more seriously than I did, almost as a precursor to marriage or betrothal which was not my intention whatsoever)

-Try to have activities when we are together

-Try to spend more time in her dorm, rather than my more private apartment

-I also made a commitment to myself to try to start fewer conversations with her, so as not to be a nuisance. 
  

I love her, and although I can’t explain it, I know that I never want to love anyone else, and although I know it sounds like teen angsty crap which it probably is, but it’s the reality I live in. Although she tells me every time we speak that she loves me, it gets harder to believe when sometimes she doesn’t want to hang out for days, and it feels like the conversations we do have she doesn’t want to be in.  


I am looking for 6 month internships across the country, and she wants to study abroad in Europe next spring.  If all goes as planned we wont be together for a year, and neither of us wants to get in the way of the other’s plans. 


When she tried to break up with me a few months ago I thought I could give her until the summertime to find reasons to stay in our relationship, but I can’t be in a relationship much longer that might be going nowhere.  It has displaced me emotionally, and between this and other parts of my life I have found myself in a bit of an emotional crisis.  I have gotten to a point where I don’t know how to tell her I love her (although I still do very much) when I have no idea if she has any interest in an emotional future with me. We agreed last night that we had to confront the issue once and for all. I hope she will commit to trying to make the relationship work for the next few years, but admittedly it’s a big leap of faith to take with me, and I’m afraid she won’t.
 

Things aren’t perfect but they don’t have to be.  No matter how we face this problem there will be a long path or turmoil for both of us.  


Having read this you might think that our problems are very one sided, but I had similar doubts about our relationship a year ago, and never really planned on letting my love for her get in the way of my career goals (although I’m realizing now that that was unrealistic). 


 I also want to make it clear that we have a great relationship, enjoy each other's company, have spoken every day for almost 3 years and still have things to say to one another, and there have been endless emotional and physical benefits to our relationship for both of us from the very beginning.  The real problem is that we are both smart people, she a little more driven than I who don't want to sacrifice our futures for a comfortable relationship now. 


It is very hard for me to write her side of the story, because while I know she has been struggling with very real issues about our relationship, they are nothing like my own. 


Has anyone faced a similar situation?  Did you ever have to end things with someone you love and why did/didn’t you? If so do you have any regrets?  What sacrifices have you made for someone you love, and would you do it again?  
---   
**tl;dr**: My first love of 2.5 years are on the verge of breaking up over concerns about our futures despite agreeing that the loving committed relationship we are currently in is great. "
21buo0,1,2014-03-25,I want to be a web developer and parents hate it.,mintymintmint,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/21buo0/i_want_to_be_a_web_developer_and_parents_hate_it/,"I'm a 23 year old female living at home and preparing for a career in web development. I've been teaching myself for the past year, and I LOVE it, I get such fulfillment out of everything I learn and I'm pushing hard to get into the industry (tweaking my portfolio, applying for internships/entry level jobs). I graduated with a BS in Bio this past spring, but I can't get a job in it and I only finished it for the sake of having the paper.
My parents on the other hand, can't understand my passion at all, and seem pretty opposed to it. If I mention that I applied for a webdev internship, their response is usually a single line like ""Oh.... ok?"". They don't give a shit about any of the projects I show them. If I'm on my laptop in the kitchen watching a tutorial or coding, I can notice my mother getting agitated, like she tenses up and starts sighing heavily. My parents begged and pleaded with me to apply for this vineyard laborer position (pruning, weeding, putting up bird nets), and I gave in and applied because I want to support myself and move out of this house so badly. They were so happy when I applied for that, and they ask me every single day if they called me back yet. 
I can't convince them that this is where I see my future. They think that because I worked 4 years in a greenhouse that I'm destined to be in horticulture the rest of my life. My mother says things like ""This is just a phase, you've been interested in lots of other things before and then you stop."" She suggests I apply for town jobs like county bus driver, recycle center scale operator, or town permit clerk. She tells me she hates seeing me sitting at the computer. I do spend hours on the computer but that's because I'm furiously trying to learn faster and constantly checking job sites. I also audit comp sci classes at my University, and go to the gym 5 days/week so it's not like I don't get out. My dad is mostly silent, which is totally weird considering he was a computer science college dropout and is the one who put me in front of a laptop before I could write sentences.  

I just feel so utterly sore and full of hurt. I can't understand why they seem so disappointed in me. You would think that they would be so happy for me, that I'd found something I excel at, and that happens to be lucrative as well. I guess I should just not care, but it really sucks living in this house feeling the passive-aggressive atmosphere all the time. They've always been extremely supportive of everything else I did, why is this so different? Please please help me understand if there's something I'm missing here. 

**TLDR; Learning web development and trying to get a career in it, parents don't approve and it's making me depressed. Is there something I'm missing? Help me understand why they might feel this way.**"
21bzu9,1,2014-03-25,Seeking advice about future careers. (Math &amp; Finance),[deleted],business,https://www.reddit.com/r/business/comments/21bzu9/seeking_advice_about_future_careers_math_finance/,"Hello,

I am currently finishing my freshman year in college. I have decided to double major. First I am wanting to major in mathematics. Second I want to major in finance, or maybe business management. I do not have to decide yet because they share similar courses, but I think I'm leaning towards finance.

I see myself working with a business finding strategic direction, kind of like managing business decisions like mergers, CEO succession, and other situations. I would also like using math to see trends in a company.

I would like to know what are possible careers paths with these degrees. I really have no idea what is out there for me.

I would like to know which direction I should be headed down to hopefully get an internship early in my career so I can get a better idea what it is I would like to pursue.

I'm open to any advice, tips, suggestions in which would be greatly appreciative! 

I'm eager to learn!

Thanks for you time

21c1wy,0,2014-03-25,My father has disappointed me my whole life and I hate that I don't have the courage to speak up to him about it.,oohathrowaway,confession,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/21c1wy/my_father_has_disappointed_me_my_whole_life_and_i/,"This is going to be a long one.  Lots of old feelings, and tons of current ones.

My dad has made a really good salary for my entire life.  He's in a profession that pays really well, I won't say which to help with anonymity.  My parents divorced when I was in high school, and he quickly married a woman who works in the same field.  I have two siblings and his wife has three kids.  Every single kid is now over 18; only two our of six were under 18 when they got married.

Somehow, despite my dad's comfortable salary and 401k account, there has never been enough money.  Ever.  To the point where if I threw away a plastic spoon at lunch in elementary school, I would get yelled at.  To the point where yogurt and applesauce were ""school snacks"" that we weren't allowed to eat on the weekends.  To the point that I was wearing hand-me-down training bras until I was a B-cup, and to the point that I wore mostly hand-me-down clothes from my cousin who was much skinnier than I was.  To the point where my parents went bankrupt when I was in 8th grade.  To the point where now, the man is 53 years old, and he can't afford anything.  I recently needed repairs on my car, $1500, and he could only send me $600.  I asked if he could send me anything extra, even like $50/month for a while, and he said that that $600 had cleared out his reserves and that there is nothing he can do for me.

The whole thing makes me want to scream.  My mom's friends, my friends, and my boyfriend are all positive that my dad must have some secret ""other family"" or offshore account or something that he dumps all of his money into.  Maybe he has a gambling addiction.  Maybe he secretly has thousands in savings, but he doesn't want to help out his family, so he pretends to be broke.  I don't know.  All I know is that I wish I could stand up to him and break off ties with him once and for all. 

The problem is that he does still *kind of* help me.  He's paying for my phone plan, my car insurance, my car loan payment, and most importantly, I'm still on his health insurance.  I don't have a job right now - I am working on an internship, but it barely pays over minimum wage and I don't know how much longer I'll stick with it.  So if I were to tell my dad right now, ""Your lack of help is pathetic, I think it's disgusting that on your salary combined with your wife's salary you still can't help me out, and I don't want to talk to you anymore,"" I would definitely be in a pretty bad place.  I do have an amazing boyfriend who can afford to pay for my rent, food, and gas when I need it, but I can't get on his insurance since we're not married and I don't want to just say ""Sorry, you're responsible for my car payments now, too.""

I saw a psychologist for a while back in high school, and she was always encouraging me to talk to my dad about my issues with him.  When I graduated high school, my dad conveniently couldn't afford to give me a present, but he promised that he'd give me one when he could.  One year later, and we're having dinner together and I had to spend a while working up the courage and keeping my hands from shaking just to ask him for my graduation present.  It's like parting with his money is literally painful to him.

When he got remarried, I had only met the woman twice.  And one of those times she asked me how my uterus was doing (because she wants grandkids).  I was only 16 at this time, mind you.  He told the whole family that they were engaged via e-mail, but said that there was no date set yet.  Three weeks later, he announces that they're getting married in two weeks and they're just having a court ceremony in a bordering state (because in that state, you don't have to wait 3 days for a marriage license) and ""you can all come if you want.""  Nobody went.  I hadn't even met my ""stepsiblings"" yet.  It's been almost five years and I can't bring myself to call her my Stepmom, and her kids are certainly not my stepsisters or stepbrother.

I really wish I could just break ties with him.  Just tell him that he has never acted the way I would think a father should act, and that every time I tell him ""I love you"" I cringe a little inside.  That I think he's a pathetic excuse for a human being for not being able to help out his own children when they need it.  But like I said, I'm too chicken.  He's incredibly passive-aggressive, and I can be too; sometimes I imagine passive-aggressively saying certain things in an e-mail to him, but I always stop myself because I don't want to sink to his level.  I want to sarcastically apologize for asking him for help, but I feel like he won't get the sarcasm and that he'll actually think I feel bad for him.

Well, if you read this far, thanks.  I mostly just wanted to get this out of my system and out there.  I think I shared enough detail that anyone who knows me will be able to figure me out, but the main reason I used a throwaway was so that this post wouldn't be associated with my usual username.

Part of me kind of hopes that my dad is a redditor, that he'll see this, and that the weight of my feelings will crush him, maybe drive him into therapy.  Because as much as I hate him for lack of emotion, I recognize that he's a broken person and that he needs help."

I haven't gotten a callback from any internships I've applied to, even help desk jobs haven't considered me.  I've been actively trying to work on personal projects of my own [pace is a issue, a bit afraid to roll with the big boys if i'm honest].

I had an interview today for a customer service position and they ended up calling me a few hours later and offered me the job. The problem is the pay isn't very good, starting at $10.50/hr and going up to 12.50 after three to six months.  At my old job doing similar work I was getting paid $16/hr. They want me to start tomorrow.  Either way I'll probably have to continue looking for better paying work. 

Now I also had an interview yesterday for a paid IT internship that would pay $12-$15/hr and I think the interview went very well. They said they would be deciding by the end of the week and I think my chances are good. I've been wanting to get into IT and this is a unique chance to get into the field in a learning environment and still be able to make ends meat.

Is there anything specific I should be doing in this situation if I end up getting the internship? I took the first job offer and just planned on telling them I got a better offer if I get the internship, which would have to start next week so I couldn't give notice. Also, incase I don't get the internship, how do I handle looking for a better paying job after just getting this new one? Do I fudge my resume to make it seem like I've been there longer? I'm really not sure how to handle that scenario."

Hey Baltimore,

I'm a 24-year-old (female) student in Philadelphia and will be spending a few months in Baltimore for an internship.

I'm looking for a studio, 1-bedroom situation, but would consider roommates if it seemed to fit.  Would also be fine with a basement apartment/room.  I'd prefer a private bathroom if it's a roommate situation.

I'll be in Baltimore Early/Mid May to the end of August. Both dates are a little flexible so I can work with whatever is on your lease as long as it's roughly in that area.  I'd prefer something furnished since I'll be returning to my apartment in Philly in August most likely.  Can work it out if it's not.

I have a chinchilla, so it'd have to be mildly pet friendly. He's caged, quiet, and incredibly adorable.

Open to a bunch of areas, looking mainly in Canton, Brewer's Hill, Butcher's Hill, Fells/Upper Fells, Washington Hill, Bolton Hill, Hampden, Midtown, Wyman Park area... I'll entertain anything, really, up to Towson area as well.

Show me what you've got!  My budget is up to about $650/700, including utilities.  A little flexible, but not much.

Feel free to PM and I can give you my email address as well.

Thanks!!"
21d6jp,54,2014-03-25,[Brand Spotlight] Tender Co.,ZoidbergTheThird,rawdenim,https://www.reddit.com/r/rawdenim/comments/21d6jp/brand_spotlight_tender_co/,"The brand:

&gt;Tender Co. was created by William Kroll in the summer of 2009, although its first run of clothing was not until autumn/winter of 2010. Kroll’s designs tend to revolve around the Great British Steam age, but there are certainly vintage American workwear influences in many of his pieces. Tender’s name is derived from the tender of a steam-train, which was the fuel-carrying car directly behind the engine.

The man behind the brand:

&gt;Kroll began making his own clothing when he was fourteen. He attended an art college where he got a degree in menswear before apprenticing with a bespoke tailor for eighteen months. He worked for a “pretty big jeans brand” before leaving to learn about indigo dying in Kojima in 2009. It was this trip to japan that spurred the start of Tender. [Source.](http://supertalk.superfuture.com/index.php/topic/98577-tender-co-denim/page-6#entry2124686)

How it works/one-man-brand analysis:

&gt;Tender is a one-man-brand, but he doesn’t do all the work himself. Rather, he is a brilliant designer who works with artisans to create the best product possible. Some may say that he isn’t a true “one-man-brand” because he doesn’t make everything himself, but this is only half true. No brand does everything. Whether it is buying rivets or buying denim, at some point every brand has outside help. What matters is who the outside help is. Kroll works with only the best, and it shows in his final products.

The Details:

1. [The Tender Cuff,](http://i.imgur.com/cogz3SM.jpg) [“not to be taken seriously.”](http://supertalk.superfuture.com/index.php/topic/98577-tender-co-denim/page-18#entry2657759)

1. Rivets: Tender uses domed copper rivets produced by UNIVERSAL Japan®. Domed rivets were chosen for a few reasons: bar tacks are less strong, donut rivets scratch furniture, and Kroll believes that hidden rivets go against the true workwear aesthetic. [Source.](http://supertalk.superfuture.com/index.php/topic/98577-tender-co-denim/page-6#entry2140092)

1. Reversed inseam inlay: you may have noticed that your jean’s inseam is stacked, with one half of the leg folded and sewn over the other. Tender jeans have reversed the direction of this inlay. This has several structural benefits, such as the inseam not getting caught on bicycle saddles as easily.

1. The fly uses only two buttons, which are vintage Levi reproduction fly buttons. This two-button design was often seen on overalls and can be easily undone while wearing gloves. [Source.](http://vimeo.com/27771897)

1. The pockets and belt loops are lined with selvedge calico from Lancashire. Most of the pocket bags are made of denim.

1. [Snob’s thumb pocket](http://i.imgur.com/xh2o6Ga.jpg): this pocket is about the size of a coin pocket but is placed on the inside of the waistband. The idea was taken from late 18th/early 19th century trousers, where a snob’s pocket was present to keep a watch or place one’s thumb. It also allows the “coin” pocket to be easily accessed when wearing a thick belt or sitting down. [Source.](http://supertalk.superfuture.com/index.php/topic/98577-tender-co-denim/page-12#entry2345642) 

1. Continuous stitching: the idea of continuous stitching is present in many areas of Tender product’s construction. Part of this came from a book on penmanship that Kroll inherited, which talked about the importance of flow and not removing the pen from the page. This concept was translated into stitching; for instance the back snob’s thumb pocket is sewn on with a single continuous stitch, as are the back pockets. [Source.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5on_tb9ETmU&amp;feature=youtu.be)

1. [The logo](http://i.imgur.com/W8AN8H2.jpg): The Tender elephant logo comes from a vintage source book of advertising designs, which was an old way of distributing editable images. The text on the logo could be edited to match any company’s needs. [Source.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5on_tb9ETmU&amp;feature=youtu.be)

1. [The button](http://i.imgur.com/VIMMEu6.jpg): Tender uses [removable buttons](http://i.imgur.com/7Q66fwV.jpg) on their jackets and the waistbands of their jeans. The idea for this came from railway worker’s jackets, which had removable buttons supplied by their employers. The design on this button is known as [Platus](http://i.imgur.com/p6JmVmb.jpg) and comes from the same source image as the Tender elephant. The buttons are created in Devon, using the “lost-wax” method, which is slow and destroys the mold with each casting. This same “lost-wax” method is used to create Tender belt buckles and various other metal pieces used in their products. [Source.](http://supertalk.superfuture.com/index.php/topic/98577-tender-co-denim/page-7#entry2146581)

1. [Selvedge Inseam, no outseam:](http://i.imgur.com/OFMypvP.jpg) These are from a pair of trousers made in collaboration with For Holding Up the Trousers. Morten V. Kristensen, the man behind For Holding Up the Trousers, used to be an intern for Kroll.

1. Tender also produces [loopwheeled in England tshirts.](http://supertalk.superfuture.com/index.php/topic/98577-tender-co-denim/page-4#entry2094105) The neck and cuffs on these shirts do not contain any stretchy material, but rather the cuff material is pulled to match the body when sewn. This increases longevity, but is difficult to sew properly. [Source.](http://supertalk.superfuture.com/index.php/topic/98577-tender-co-denim/page-12#entry2368518)

The Denim:

&gt;The majority of Tender ‘s jeans are made from an unsanfornized, Japanese selvedge denim. It is a 17oz right hand twill denim, and shrinks considerably more than many other unsanfornized denims (15-20%). [Source.](http://supertalk.superfuture.com/index.php/topic/98577-tender-co-denim/page-16#entry2633533)

Sizing:

&gt;Jeans and jackets are sized as 1 – 5. This was deliberately done to prevent vanity-sizing confusion. Some sizes are regional, such as size 1 being only available in Japan. 

Jean cuts:

&gt;Note: Many different overdyes are available. The pictures are only to show off the various cuts.

138: Unreleased at this point. Preliminary information states it is like the 130 but with no waistband and calico/canvas belting instead.

&gt;Note: Many of these jackets are available in various materials. Only one example is shown to show off the various cuts.

[920: N/A](http://i.imgur.com/jqqo7k5.jpg)

Overdying:

&gt;Various overdyeing methods have been used by tender.

1. [Woad](http://i.imgur.com/YcCHQWy.jpg) produces a light-indigo hue.

2. [Wattle](http://i.imgur.com/i3OdyR5.jpg) produces a brownish tone.

3. [Weld (right)](http://i.imgur.com/C6XyMOF.jpg) is a natural yellow dye.

4. [Chlorophyll](http://media2.hickorees.com/image/TenderCoChlorophyllPyjamaTrousers_L1.jpg) produces a green color.

5. Logwood produces both [purple](http://i.imgur.com/mhElJZl.jpg) and [black](http://i.imgur.com/YM3PM4L.jpg)  tones.

Leather products:

&gt;Their belt leather is sourced from a local British tannery that has been running since the Roman ages. The tannery sources their hides from Devonshire beef cattle and tans with oak bark form Somerset. This oak tanning takes longer than many other forms of tanning, but the resulting leather is magnificent. All the stitching on their belts is done with Tiger thread, which is a “tubular knitted and heavily waxed.” [Source.](http://supertalk.superfuture.com/index.php/topic/98577-tender-co-denim/page-3#entry2063416)

I'm going to write this vaguely to keep confidentiality. ^Also, ^sorry ^for ^wall ^of ^text

After working as a pediatric dental assistant in high school [uncertified, took x-rays], I moved into retail and entertainment at a major amusement park near where I live. I studied abroad from 2010 to 2011 in Europe right out of high school. 2013 I went off and did the College Program Internship with Disney World in Entertainment. I came home last summer to finish my degree. Now I just recently got ""promoted"" to be a full-time teller in the 5 months I have been working with the bank and I now have my Associate's in Arts. I also recently did an amazing internship with a major TV station with an NFL team and have quite a few references.

I understand my experiences are across the board, however I am open to office work I have been on computers most of my life and can work them very well [banking, reception, etc.], social media, but I would really enjoy entertainment/theatrical work. Would like to say that I am very open-minded and open to new experiences! :)

I would like to clarify that my job search in Orlando is not acting as a catalyst. I have been planning on moving since I came home and am now focusing on this major goal in my life.

I understand the distance is sort of a put-off, however I will be in Florida for a week at the end of April. If the time I'm in Florida is not convenient,  if you are open to Skyping, phone calls, or even FaceTime I am 100% dedicated to making sure it is worth your efforts.

*Again, if you have any questions, would like to see my full resume, etc. please feel free to PM me. Thanks!*"
21d899,20,2014-03-25,"My abusive ex-bf [37M] got a job wherein he uses my (30F) company's software. I'm one of three people in technical support - we support phone, live chat and web cases.",throwawaytechhelp12,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/21d899/my_abusive_exbf_37m_got_a_job_wherein_he_uses_my/,"When we were together he became a very violent alcoholic towards the end - he stole my money, he embarrassed me in front of my friends and family, he constantly yelled at me, played mind games with me, he would punch himself, he would throw glass bottles at the wall every other day - sometimes he would throw them at me (sometimes I would have to block my face from shards of glass that went flying), he would punch walls or other objects to the point where his knuckles would bleed, he would shake or shove me, and sexually grab me when I didn't want it, most of the time I was able to deny his sexual advances. (Read between the lines: *most of the time*)


That trend went on for over year before I was brave enough/felt like I was worth saving before I escaped that relationship. 


After I left him, I was mentally and emotionally wounded. But, I maintained a good life for the next 6 years - went to grad school, took on a few awesome internships, landed a sweet contract job and then finally ended up at my current company. I've been here for almost 3 years, and I love it. I'm on my way to be hired on to the engineering team where I'll be making a significant amount more than my current position. I also work at a company where we get over 100 resumes for each open position, so I feel really lucky to be here. I do not want to leave because of him. 


Recently I noticed a very familiar name coming into the chat queues, my ex has a very unusual last name so it didn't take much internet sleuthing to realize it was him. Fortunately, he has not gotten me on the phone yet - but I can see from past logs he has called in. He mostly uses the live chat and the web cases to communicate with us, and I don't include my last name whenever I engage any type of correspondence with him. I know my luck will run out. There is a picture of me on the company website, and I have a linkedin profile (something he does not have). 


I know from his past that he'll likely lose his job because he's an irresponsible asshat that can't keep a job for more than a few months. But, there is a big risk here that he may find out where I work, and that thought scares me. I still have nightmares about the times we were together, there are still things that I hear or see that trigger a violent memory of being with him. Just seeing his name come in makes me feel sick to my stomach. 

I don't know what to do. As it stands he doesn't know it's me, at least I don't think he does. He'll know it's me if he calls and get me on the phone, which is a 33% chance. Or he could create a linkedin profile or browse our website. Is this worth mentioning to my manager? I don't know if he's still as crazy or fucked up as he use to be, who knows...maybe he's gotten worse. I'm just terrified that something bad is going to happen. 

Note: For those of you curious as to why we only have 3 support people right now - one was fired two weeks ago, and the other is out on paternity, we'll be back up to 4 this Friday. We're currently looking to hire more people as it stands. We're low on people and it sucks. 

---   

**tl;dr**: My sociopathic, violent, alcoholic ex boyfriend has gotten a job where he uses my company's software. I'm one of three people in technical support, there's only a matter of time before he realizes who I am. His company is a new customer of ours, so he will probably be contacting support a lot. We are contacted by phone, live chat and web cases. I'm terrified that something horrible is going to happen if he finds out it's me... stalking, harassment, all that fun stuff. What should I do? "

reviews of how I perform in and out of an office.

I would say that you can call me, if you would like, but you cannot. I am

Since being laid off, I've wanted to pursue a dream of getting a job in the gaming industry. Even if means moving myself out to wherever an opportunity presents itself. I have the money set aside to afford the time to search and I have the will to get there, however I face the issue everyone out of school faces: no on the job experience in game development or job experience in C++.

I haven't really had a chance to look for junior positions in the gaming field and have not put myself out there yet. However, I very quickly ended up with a job offer from a tiny company willing to teach me and work with me to write C drivers.

I'm worried about taking up the job and having it not really helping me towards a career in C++ or the gaming field. I know I am green, and this could be a great opportunity for me, but it could also send me down a path I do not want before I have given myself a chance to get out there.

I was hoping to get some advice from others who have been in my shoes before. Will it be a huge mistake to push this aside for something more towards my goals? Or is it just a risk worth taking?"

21dmo8,6,2014-03-25,Trying to figure out where I see this relationship going,[deleted],TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/21dmo8/trying_to_figure_out_where_i_see_this/,"I'm confused about this situation that my relationship is in right now, and sort of looking to get a few opinions on whether I am overreacting.

I (23f) met my boyfriend (29) during an internship abroad last January. It started out as a fuck buddy thing, and then we both kinda fell for each other. We initially said it would just be temporary, until I finish my internship (last June), but as time went by we just started getting closer. In a spur of the moment on my last weekend there we finally addressed the elephant in the room and decided we wanted to make it official and do the long distance thing, the plan being that I finish my undergrad in the States and then return to Europe for grad school (This was already my plan anyway, I did not make this plan because of him), where I will at least be a little closer to him and then we can see how things pan out.

Now we are in that long distance relationship and I don't like the way it is going. It is not so much the long distance that bothers me, it's the general dynamics of the relationship. I am a full-time undergraduate student and work two part-time jobs on the side (one as a waitress for money and the other as research assistant for experience). My classes are work intensive and my free time is spent at my jobs (which I actually really enjoy, both of them, so I don't mind). I also take summer classes so that I can graduate sooner. Basically, I have a lot going on in my life. We call and text through viber and whenever we can get a time where both of us are at home and awake, we skype. I love it every time we talk, and I really try to set aside enough time to call him before/after work, but I also have a lot of other stuff going on. 

I get the impression that he, on the other hand, is just constantly waiting by the phone. I feel like his whole life right now is centered around Skype and saving money to come visit me. Since I finished my internship in June he has come to visit me 3 times. He has already booked his flight for the 4th visit. And I do love having him here, but it is just extremely stressful to have to work my schedule around him for weeks at a time, and he has the tendency to really overstay his welcome (e.g. says he's coming for 2 weeks and then SURPRISE it's actually 3!). It would be different if we lived in the same city, because he would also be working and doing things. But when he comes he is just here and then kind of expects me to miraculously have time for him. He always says it's okay at first, but then after a week he gets upset that he came all the way over here, and then barely gets to see me cause I'm always working. 

How does a 29 year old have time to take that much vacation you ask? He is taking a year off from his job as a teacher to finish his masters degree. In the first semester he only had one course with optional attendance, and this semester he is just working on his thesis, which he can sort of do at his own pace. Now I guess he is having some issues with his mentor and he just wants to quit the whole thing again. And I just don't want that because I want him to have something else in his life that is not me.

We were just skyping and I told him that I want him to have a goal in his life that is not me. He said he would love to open a bar/café and run it, but he doesn't want to invest in something and then have to leave it to be close to me if I wind up somewhere else. I want him to be working towards something else. I love seeing him when he is visiting me, and sleeping next to him. I wish I could come to visit him more often myself. I tried to make him understand that I'm not saying that he has to have insane goals and wind up earning 6 digits. That's not what I want. I just want him to have something he is working towards that is not me. So that if this doesn't work out (and at the moment it kind of looks to me like it won't) I'm not going to feel like it's my fault he gave up everything just to chase after me. 

I guess the age difference is starting to play a role here. All of his friends are getting married and having kids and careers. And even though we talked about this and we both agreed that we are just going to see where this goes while we are doing the long distance thing, I feel like he is kind of putting all of his money on ""this is for life, let's focus on this and only this now because you have to make sacrifices in relationships"". I just don't feel comfortable with him making all of the sacrifices, because at this moment right now, I am NOT willing to give up my career plans for anyone. It just so happens that as it stand right now, they will be taking me closer to him after I finish my undergrad.

I don't even know if anything I just wrote made sense. I'm still trying to make sense out of it myself. I guess I am just in that awful beginning phase where you start to realize a relationship isn't going anywhere and you can no longer deny it. I fucking hate this. I don't know if I am looking for advice or just for a rant. Sometimes it helps to just write something out. Sorry for bothering you, carry on with your day.

**Edit:** I just read through that after posting this and it really just sounds like I am a bitch who is not willing to work for a relationship. I don't really think that's the case, I think it's just the contrast between us that is making it difficult. Although, this is the 3rd time I have found myself in this kind of dynamic. So maybe it is really me. 

**Edit2:** After further reflection I think it boils down to these 2 things:

1. He is making sacrifices for me that make me uncomfortable because I cannot/don't want to do the same

2. He is only ambitious about us, not about himself"

Started as a co-op intern, worked myself up to a software developer with no real developmental focus. Left and became a C# developer for awhile, and recently got laid off.

Since being laid off, I've wanted to pursue a dream of getting a job in the gaming industry. Even if means moving myself out to wherever an opportunity presents itself. I have the money set aside to afford the time to search and I have the will to get there, however I face the issue everyone out of school faces: no on the job experience in game development or job experience in C++.

I haven't really had a chance to look for junior positions in the gaming field and have not put myself out there yet. However, I very quickly ended up with a job offer from a tiny company willing to teach me and work with me to write C drivers.

I'm worried about taking up the job and having it not really helping me towards a career in C++ or the gaming field. I know I am green, and this could be a great opportunity for me, but it could also send me down a path I do not want before I have given myself a chance to get out there.

I was hoping to get some advice from others who have been in my shoes before. Will it be a huge mistake to push this aside for something more towards my goals? Or is it just a risk worth taking?

Whenever I talk to my classmates about CS, it seems that everyone's lives revolve around programming. When they're not working on school assignments, they're working on side projects, apps, answering questions on Stack Overflow, or talking about coding and technology with their friends. 

As for myself, I really do enjoy programming. I find it satisfying and engaging and something I could do for a long time (given that I'm being paid for it). That being said, I don't really see myself programming outside of school/work. I pretty much consume my spare time with art and want to get into tattooing in the near future. I also lift regularly and try to keep up a social life. I can't imagine sitting down to work on a side project after I've been working on school coding assignments all day. 

I feel like this makes me get looked down upon a lot by my peers. Am I going about developing the wrong way? Do I need to drop everything else and code more? I'm not dumb - I got myself an internship with a Big 4 company for the summer. But am I setting myself up for a failed career in CS?"
21dsu4,4,2014-03-25,Need advice/opinions,[deleted],Parenting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/21dsu4/need_adviceopinions/,"So, here’s the deal. My husband and I rarely fight, but there’s this one issue that we can’t seem to get past.

He has a 17 year old son, who for the most part, is no trouble. He spends a lot of time at our house and some days with his mother. He’s pretty easy to get along with as far as teenagers go, but the problem is that he’s a very picky eater. 

My husband and I are vegetarians, and try to eat a mostly plant based diet. We are not perfect by any stretch, but we try. I cook a lot, it’s actually part of my job as well, but I like healthy foods. Fruits, vegetables, grains, nuts and seeds, with some odd foods thrown in once in awhile. I don’t eat junk food if I can help it. 

The problem is that the kid likes pretty much the opposite of what we like, which can be expected; he’s a 17 year old boy after all. I don’t mind making him foods that he likes, and I’ll cook him meat or whatever if he’s home. This is where part of the problem comes in. He has a car, a job, a girlfriend and such and comes and goes as he pleases. Some nights he stays here, some nights he stays as his mothers. I cook dinner almost every night, and 9 times out of 10 it’s something he doesn’t like. I’ve told him repeatedly that I will make him foods he likes for dinners if he gives me advance notice of when he’s going to be here. I plan a weekly menu on Sunday and go to the grocery store on Monday. I’ve told him that I need to know on Sunday which days he will be here. He rarely gives me notice, and will show up at dinner time, ask me what’s for dinner, and then get upset when it’s something he doesn’t like. 

There’s also the issue of lunches/snacks. I make my grocery list on my iPhone, on an app that allows shared lists. He was adding items to the list every week, and while he wouldn’t get everything he wanted, I bought him foods that he liked. He got a job, and started spending his money on fast food and deleted the app. Well, now he has an unpaid internship and no money, so he wants to eat at home, but doesn’t want to make a list and doesn’t want to give me advance notice of when he’s going to be here. He goes to his mothers and tells her that we don’t feed him, which is where the problem comes in. 

My husband thinks that I should solve this problem on my own. We both agree that his son should learn how to fix healthy foods, and neither of us is interested in buying a bunch of junk food. I have told him repeatedly that I will help him figure this out, but apparently the idea of asking a 17 year old what he likes to eat is too much pressure, according to my husband. My husband (who will eat anything I make) thinks that healthy eating is hard and doesn’t understand how I can expect a “kid” to know what to eat.  He believes I should make a list of easy to prepare healthy meals, stock the fridge and hope for the best, I suppose. I say, he’s 17, not 10, and if he’s not willing to take time out of his busy schedule to help himself, I don’t want to bother.  I’m willing to help him, and will teach him how to cook, but I feel he’s old enough to be part of the process. My husband feels guilty because he thinks we don’t feed our son, even though I spend a fortune on groceries, and the kid will come in after I walk in from the store and claim there is no food if there’s no sugary cereal, boxes of macaroni and cheese and other junk. I, on the other hand, am simply tired of dealing with the whole thing (this has been going on for years.) Am I wrong to think it’s too much to ask for a 17 year old kid to at least partake somewhat in what is essentially his problem? "

21dwe7,3,2014-03-25,"I (21/M) feel torn between schadenfreude and guilt when hearing about my (21/F) ex being depressed and failing college. How do I move past this, and treat her with respect?",schadendirge,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/21dwe7/i_21m_feel_torn_between_schadenfreude_and_guilt/,"My ex and I dated for about 3 years she finally brought up ending things. I was unable to deal with a variety of issues in my life, and was emotionally abusive and pushed her away. She showed me love, but let me walk all over her until the last few months before we split.




Pt 1: **The Background**

When we split, I took it as a wake-up call to get my shit sorted and my life back in check. I went to therapy to work out my feelings which had stemmed from an abusive past and years of emotional abuse, primarily at the hands of my older brother. 

He is 21 years older than me, and took over the responsibility of raising me when my father passed away. He took out his own problems on me, and it showed in my relationship. I had a hard time believing I could be loved, and the fact that my oldest brother told me my girlfriend was nothing more than a ""test"" sent by God had a long lasting effect on my relationship. 

Initially, things were rocky between my ex and I. She had just gotten out of multiple relationships, and had been dating a friend of mine at the time. Since then, my friend and I no longer speak, as he hates me. Profoundly. I am the reason they broke up within two months of dating, and while it wasn't long, I know it was his first girlfriend. As we progressed, things went well up until we went long distance. Once this happened, things went downhill slowly over the course of years, until the break-up.

 It definitely hurts thinking about it now, but I've tried to accept that the only thing I can do now is try to treat others the way I'd wanted to be treated, and accept my mistakes as well as I can to move past them. 

 It's been roughly 6 months now, and since then I've worked hard at opening up to my family about my issues, and pushing forwards in maturing. I got a competitive internship, hit the gym and lost 30lbs, pulled of a better than usual GPA (3.7!) and reached out to old friends and many of the people I'd pushed away.  I'd finally felt like I'd really progressed in becoming a decent human being, and moving *past* my past. 




Pt 2: **How My Ex Is Doing**

But... I got in contact with my ex. I wanted to check in and see how she was doing, to be honest. I missed our friendship, and regretted the way things had ended. 

Turns out she's been doing far worse than me. She's been suffering from migraines, skipping weeks worth of classes, dropping classes altogether, and is barely able to function on a day-to-day basis. She's been gaining weight, and is unsure of whether or not she is going to continue college. She's suffering from depression from the migraine medication she's taking, and constantly gets sick.

Now, here's where I get a little prideful. I took the time to take a bad situation and make it into something good. I feel proud of the fact that I'm trying my hardest to no longer be the asshole that my older brother was to me. More specifically, I don't want to be the asshole I was to my girlfriend ever again.

But seeing her in such a shitty situation makes me feel sort of... good. In my head, I think, ""Well, that's what you get for ignoring me when I needed you. That's what you get for leaving me. That's what happens when you decide you're too good for me now. See what I've done with my life? Hah! I hope you keep failing."" 

I don't want to feel this way, but I do. When we broke up, she unblocked all of her exes, and within a few weeks my former friend re-friended her and she accepted. The other guy she was with has moved on, and does not like her very much (lol). A part of me interpreted this as a sign that all she wanted in her life was more drama, bringing in people in her life that she knows she'll have a negative effect on. Likewise, seeing her as friends again on Facebook with someone that hates me brings up feelings of guilt. The other part of me realizes that I'm making a big deal out of a Facebook friendship, but it's hard ignoring my feelings of guilt and resentment. 

So, relationships, what do I do? How can I move past these feelings of schadenfreude and guilt and treat my ex with respect? I don't want these feelings to manifest into a recurring negative thought, and I'd rather be supportive of her and hope she's doing better than wish her the worst in life. Though it kinda helps to do so. 





**TL;DR:** Ex left me six months ago - I got my life together, she didn't. Seeing her fail makes me feel really good, but it also brings up guilt and resentment. How can I change these feelings?

21dwis,6,2014-03-25,Possibly going back to school for a second bachelor's degree in CS - suggestions on how to prepare?,adambomb5060,AskComputerScience,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskComputerScience/comments/21dwis/possibly_going_back_to_school_for_a_second/,"My background is, of course, important. I'll be going to the same school from which I received my first BS (civil engineering). I've been unemployed since I graduated last May, so as I was talking to my parents earlier today, we sort of hit upon this idea. I called up the admissions office and will be starting the application process shortly. I also have 3 years of education in web/interactive development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, SQL, a bit of Java and ActionScript, and graphic design).

So, clearly I have *some* programming skill. I also have all the math requirements save for linear algebra, though I could probably stand to brush up on my discrete math as well. My interest in CS is threefold. One: I think the job opportunities might be a bit better. Two: I want to finally learn how to build an entire, complex, OOP application because I've got some ideas. Third is probably the most involved, and the one that will hopefully make you established computer scientists sigh in relief and say, ""at least he gets it."" This is that as a civil engineer I was drawn to traffic engineering, and more specifically, microscopic traffic simulation, travel demand modeling, etc. I got a bit of computational methods in one grad-level class, but I want to get the theory so that I can work on these sorts of simulations, myself.

So guys, talk me up or down, your choice. I'm too old to screw around and I want to kick this degree's ass if I end up going for it. What should I read? What topics should I have some familiarity with in advance? What kind of work am I looking at in terms of academics and internship experience? How should I approach getting an internship? Feel free to add anything you want.

Thanks in advance!"

I think i can graduate by May 2015, but i was thinking of dragging it out until Fall 2015 and doing another internship in the summer of 2015. I feel like having a second internship before i apply to full time jobs will give me leverage and maybe increase my salary. 

Does your salary usually increase with 1 more internship? Is it worth it to miss a semester of full time pay? I am worried that i won't get a full time job straight away and that 2 internships would be so much easier to get a full time job. Also I don't think that many companies allow internships the summer after you graduate? 

So, all in all, is it worth it to get another internship in and graduate a semester later, or should i take the risk and finish school in May 2015 and try to get a full time job?"

I'd just like to take this time to warn you all not to sit on the jellyfish couches! We were trying to combine the soft bouncy tops of the jellyfish and the sittable sittyness of the couches. Somewhere along the way, the intern in charge of combining the jellyfish DNA and the couch DNA seriously screwed up, putting the jellyfish DNA in the science thing *upside down*! This caused the stingers of the jellyfish to be where the seat of the couch should be, rather than the bouncy tops taking the place of the cushions.


Now we in couch breeding take our jobs very seriously, and would like you to know that the intern has been sent to Hell. Remember, ""a soft couch is a soft customer, which makes it much easier to remove the flesh from their screaming, mortal, shells"". Once again, we apologise for the inconvenience this has caused anybody. Below are some complimentary tips on what to do if you are stung by a jellyfish:

1. Suck it up.


Have a great day!

21e0lu,3,2014-03-26,My [21F] boyfriend [27M] of 1 year said something weird over nothing(?) - I don't understand.,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/21e0lu/my_21f_boyfriend_27m_of_1_year_said_something/,"A throwaway in case he checks this out: he knows I go on Reddit occasionally, but god knows what he'd say if he knew I had an account I suppose, so best to keep it vague! I love this subreddit - I hope you can help me out with a little advice, or at least a little understanding. I'm trying to keep it quite vague (probably will ramble a fuckload, it's late), but if you want any more information please don't hesitate to ask. I'm sorry about how long this is. Feel free to skip the first paragraph, it just talks a little more about us. I'm aware this comes across as a bit of a silly post over nothing.. that's exactly my problem.

So, a little background on us as it can get a bit confusing (feel free to skip): at the moment, we're *very* long distance. When I was studying abroad for six months, we had a chance meet and fell for each other. We quickly became quite serious - complicated, as when we met he told me he was heading to the UK for six months himself.. in six weeks. Our timing is incredible, as you can see. He went to the UK, we made it through the rest of my time abroad long distance and when I came home in July we met up again and it was even better. October comes, he goes home and besides a week in January where he flew here for my birthday, we've been long distance ever since until I graduate and we figure out the best plan. Our relationship is generally great. He is my best friend, he says I am the love of his life, we have amazing sex (and the best sexts/Skype sex, I'll say it), and we chat all day everyday, Skype once a week. He does a lot to keep things alive and plan for the future, as do I to the best of my ability (student, you know). But lately things have been a bit rocky as the distance has been getting us down.

So, the past weekend was a bit of a rough patch for us. We had a pretty cold fight over something he'd said on Friday (and my response) and weren't really talking, which is really unusual for us - eventually we had it out on Sunday and I think we'd just kind of misunderstood what each other was saying. Okay, no problem! We make things up and go back to being sickeningly loved up and chatty. 

Tonight starts much the same as that, until I send him a screenshot of an MTV news tweet of Gwyneth Paltrow and Chris Martin's split. We have a long running joke about this couple, so we have a little banter about that until he suddenly asks me if I use Twitter. I say 'yeah, I have to' and mention offhand that I've been trying to get back onto it in the past couple of days. He waits a bit, asks me why, and I'm feeling that the tone is off but I have no idea why. I explain I have it to try and get my articles out there when I have them (journalism student), keep up to date with celebs/magazines etc., and I've been trying to use it more as most of the post-grad internships I've been applying for are keen on a social media presence. (Over the weekend I applied for an amazing internship that asks for your Twitter handle, but I haven't told anyone about it as I don't want to get hopes up. So obviously, I want to look active on there now in case they check it.) He doesn't say anything. Over half an hour later and no reply still, I'm a bit on edge and confused so I say, 'Are you alright? You've gone very quiet?' and he replies that he was 'doing some work stuff' which, although it didn't stop him from replying before, is entirely reasonable. I crack a joke back about our earlier topic and he first ignores it to reply, 'I don't even know how to use twitter. I didn't even know you used it. **Sometimes I think I know nothing about you.**' then changes topic back to my joke. ..What? The last line was so out of nowhere and weird to read. I was kind of hurt by it (is that ridiculous of me?). I mean, he thinks he knows nothing about me after a year because he's found out that I have a Twitter account? It's not something I thought I had to announce. I said all that to him, and that I thought after a year he might know some things about me at least. He said what he meant was he had no idea I used Twitter and Instagram etc., to which I only replied 'But you said sometimes you think you know nothing about me. That seems a bit extreme just because you didn't know I had those.' He changed it to say that he 'thinks he meant that he didn't think I'd be one of those people who sit on their phone constantly on it.' I told him I wasn't, and that was the point - before the last few days during which I've been updating it like mad, the last time I updated it was November. It was just a weird conversation and I had no idea what the point of it was. It was like he was clutching at reasons and not giving me the real one behind what he said. I felt like I was justifying having an account and guilty for not telling him, and I didn't really know why and didn't like it. He just left it so I changed the topic.

His replies got really stilted, so mine did too. You can only work with what you're given. So I said goodnight, and he did too, and it was all a bit of an off end to things and really weird. I don't want more bad feeling so soon after what we've just got through - but I don't understand why there would be! During the chat about why I had a Twitter account, I even gave him my handle to check out in case he thought it was a secret account for me to chat to guys or something (only reason I can think of why he'd feel weird about it?). He found my Instagram a little while ago (again, wasn't hiding that one, just barely use it), and had a bad reaction to that as one of my guy friends who he hates (no sexual history or comments between me and friend, but he thinks we're too close and there's a hint of mistrust there no matter what I do - for the record, I have always been faithful) had commented on a picture. I don't know if this is linked to that, although I don't have the guy on Twitter. What is this about? Is what he said a little hurtful or am I being way too sensitive? I just am hoping for a little insight. The distance doesn't help but why should I be on edge over this?

I know this is silly (not something I'm going to tell him to kick rocks over), but still.

TL;DR: Boyfriend finds out I use Twitter, has a weird reaction and says he 'sometimes thinks he knows nothing about me.' Because I use Twitter. Yes, I am serious. Any insight??"

So I'm a freshman at University and I've been trying to combat some of my people problems recently. Back when I was a little kid I used to have no problem just being chill and making people laugh without feeling shy or anything. As time went on, however, I started to be more shy and scared of activities that involved interaction with people. I have tried multiple times to step out of my comfort zone with sports and other outings but no matter what I do it does not seem to get any easier to talk to people.

I've been told I just need to work on my confidence, but honestly, I am pretty damn confident in my abilities and talents. I feel like if I became any more confident I would pretty much border on the boundary of arrogance if I'm not there already. I'm making pretty excellent progress on my degree in engineering with an internship lined up and I'm rolling in the dough, I have a pretty aesthetic form and have gotten comments from girls about it (don't know how to handle them though...), and things just seem to work out for me in general when I put my mind to them.

These things said, I'm pretty confident in my abilities. But when faced with social encounters, it seems like every notable positive feature that I have as a person flies out the window and I am the lamest person alive just trying to hold my own in the conversation. This is especially true when talking to the honeys, ha. I also tend to talk kind of quietly and mumble when I'm talking with someone I'm not comfortable with. When I AM comfortable with someone I talk in a completely different fashion, pretty loudly and clearly.

So what gives? What should I do to solve my social problems?"

We have both been interns for the same position (but at different companies) for the past month.


We both live with our parents, but I have more work experience than she does. When I turned 18, my parents expected me to support myself financially, and I have had several long-term jobs since then.

My girlfriend has recently begun to pay for more of her own expenses, but her parents still support her a lot. Over the course of our relationship, she has had one job which lasted 9 months. Before we were together she had other short-term jobs.

In my opinion, she has not learned yet how to deal with the stress of working a full-time job, and she hasn't developed confidence in her ability to overcome challenges at work. She is very anxious about jobs in general - about getting in trouble from her boss, completing work wrong, etc.

Both of our jobs require us to bring projects home with us at night. She worries so much about getting all of her work done that she can't sleep at night. She goes over every tiny detail to the point where it takes her 5 hours to write one page (unnecessary for this type of work). She has been having breakdowns and saying she's useless and will never be able to hold down a job. She threatens to quit the internship (and there are only 3 weeks left to complete), and says that finding a better job is hopeless because everyone works 24/7 anyway.

I am getting frustrated because when I try to calm her down, it's like she doesn't even hear me. Sometimes she does calm down, but the next day, it's like she forgot our entire conversation. I am finding myself losing patience and I just don't know if I can deal with someone who constantly needs my reassurance and support. It is causing us to fight because I have snapped at her a few times. I feel like once she has more work experience it will get easier, but it could take years for that to happen. I love her and she is perfect for me in every other way, I am just not strong enough to deal with her breakdowns. Advice?

TL;DR: Not sure how to deal with an anxious girlfriend. I want to stay and help her, but it's such a slow process that I'm not sure I can do it anymore. "

First off I’ll give some rambling/background information before posing the question.
I have not yet found a job, though I have been working on improving things that I’ve read in /r/cscareerquestions as recommendations for getting hired. I have been interviewed and rejected a few times, and I have another interview at the end of the week. The job prospects seem to improve as my situation improves (having a personal website, blog, projects and experience that employers are actually looking for). 

I think that I can find a job within the next few months, but I am becoming worried for multiple reasons. I am not sure if it is simply cold feet/anxiety, but I am wondering if this industry is really what I have been looking forward to. I started off looking to get into the game development industry, but found late into my degree that I enjoyed playing games more than making them. Since I was already about to be in my senior year, I decided to power through and finish the degree.

I’ve always been intrigued by other topics, most notably electrical engineering and robotics kinds of things. I also breezed by my first degree, not taking internships or worrying about my GPA. I did very well in courses I enjoyed, and mediocre in others, leaving me with a 2.8 GPA. This hasn’t really been a barrier to getting an interview, so I am not worried about that. Another thing that I always wanted to do was the whole study abroad/traveling thing. I would have liked to have done all of these things, but for some stupid reason (many actually, and these three months have been enlightening as far as foresight goes) I didn’t do any of them.

I also graduated with very little debt, around $3K.

I am wondering, how feasible/recommendable would it be to get a second bachelor’s in Electrical Engineering, one where I work harder and do all of the things that I say above? My State University where I am considering applying is very cheap, the program is very good, and even with taking loans out to pay for this new degree, I would end up with $15-$20K more in debt.

As you can probably see, my mind is scattered and I am full of doubt still. I would like any advice and perspective that you guys can offer. On the one hand I feel I should just join the work force for a while and figure things out while earning money. On the other hand, I feel that I am in the position where I could easily go back to school and enjoy my time a little longer, get the previous out of my system, and THEN go into the workforce in 2-3 years.

I've been so confused the past couple weeks and can't get a clear answer from anyone. Half the people I ask in my office (from Jersey)  don't pay MD, the other half do. Then my tax guy assumes it's okay because my MD says I'm a non-resident.

Can anyone tell me what the proper way to do things are? I know every situation is different, but this one feels like it shouldn't be. And I have a gut feeling I owe money to MD.

She came to visit me before I moved to her city and stayed for a month, it was a great month, I had a good feeling about us.

I'd been seeing her on weekends for about 7 months, and it was still going good, although I felt that my feelings for her were slightly fading and the little things about her that didn't annoy me much at first were showing.

Because of her internship ending, I decided it was time that she moved in with me, as she wrote her thesis. And after just a week of being with me we started arguing and I said I needed time to contemplate this relationship, she wants to take it to the next level, and whenever I try and express my problems with the relationship she ends up in tears and won't be rational.

However, the main issue is that I'm starting to find her less and less attractive, I'm not as interested in sex with her as I used to be, and some of her personality traits are starting to annoy me, I think she's a great person, though, and It's my first serious relationship. I've confronted her about the problems I'm having (apart from the telling her I'm not finding her attractive) but her bad habits aren't changing. One of the things she does is that she messages my (male) friends behind my back a lot, like constantly. Almost as if she needs to be best friends with them. She tends to ignore me when her girl friends are around, as in walking arm in arm with them whilst I walk behind and they ignore my existence. 

I'm not sure what to do, I feel terrible right now.

tl;dr: Girlfriend of one year wants to take it to the next level, whereas I'm still unsure if we're right for each other."

Back story: We (29M 24F) lived together for 2 years (dated for 3) was planning on proposing within the next year. She broke it off about a year ago. I was in a bad place working long hours at a wall street job I hated and I basically imploded on myself, turned inward and did not go to her for support. I understand now and forgive her for why she made that choice (asking for help is not a sign of weakness etc...)

She left for another city that summer for an internship and started dating someone there right away. I followed and highly recommend the [KSK Definitive Post-Breakup Guide](http://kissingsuzykolber.uproxx.com/2013/06/definitive-post-breakup-guide-ksk-mailbag.html) and was doing very well. I made some major life changes including ditching the job, traveling the world and learning how to be happy on my own.

Flash forward to the end of the summer internship and she is back in the same city. She had broken it off with the other guy. We talked and went to the park/dinner together several times. I did my best to show her that I had made big changes in my life and that she would never have to be the sole source of happiness in our lives. I apologized and told her I understood why she broke it off.

By Thanksgiving she told me she wanted to give us another chance. I agreed that I still had unrealized huge feelings towards her and subsequently broke things off with another girl I had been casually seeing. But she wanted to wait until after the holidays because of her exams and she had huge anxiety about reintroducing us as a couple to our friends and family (we are both from the same hometown as well). 

Mid-January rolls around and she pulls a complete 180 with no explanation or discussion. She no longer wants to give it another shot. I was basically devastated all over again and broke off contact ala the KSK advice until I foolishly asked her out to lunch on Valentines day. She said it would be inappropriate and I jokingly replied ""what are you seeing someone?"" She was, cue fork in the heart. She is seeinging one of her professors who is 37 and fat. She has refused to talk with me or offer me any explanations. The lack of closure here and false hope is killing me.

General advice is welcome as well as any insight as to what the hell happened here.

TL;DR GF of 3 years broke it off took some time away from us decided to give it another try and flaked. HALP!

EDIT: Thanks for the thoughts and advice guys. I'll probably delete this in my purge of all things her.

""If you care about this house, we can fix this for you.  But it’ll involve sacrifices.""

I nodded.

The blood started  oozing from the walls a couple of weeks ago.  At first just a little, then gallons every day.

""I will say I admire your dedication to this house.  It's shameful; people don't usually care or consider its needs.""

""Oh, I agree.  I've lived here my whole life,"" I said.  ""I spend my waking hours here.   Can't stand for it to have a problem.""

""It’ll be a lengthy process, and I can't promise the operation won't hurt,"" he said.  

""Anything.”   I loved this house.  

After the blood had come the weeping and groaning.  Horrible sounds.  The whole building in agony.  

""It’s quite sick,"" he said.  He shook his head, disappointed in my ability to take care of it.  As though dirty rooms caused the ceiling to weep, the floors to scream.

They arrived wearing surgical whites and masks.  They assembled some bizarre rig that pumped gas.  A crane arm with giant probes came inside, grasping and manipulating.

“Sedation!” he cried.  “Careful!”

I sat in my chair as always.  Their equipment cleaned the blood, probed the walls. 

“We’ll have to extract the tumor in pieces.” 

A needle and saw came through.  

“It’ll probably fight; that’s what they do,” the man explained to an intern.  “Survival instinct.”

The needle jabbed me and I grew weary, heard the saw starting up.  But I knew my house would be better soon.

21f63r,5,2014-03-26,This is why you should stop drinking,throwawayformicrowav,stopdrinking,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/21f63r/this_is_why_you_should_stop_drinking/,"Hi,
I personally don't have a drinking problem. I never drank much, but I stopped drinking now completely. I actually want to tell you about a man, that happened to be my biological father. 
For him it began just after my birth, about 26 years ago. He was investing money in buildings, he would later rent to the city for them to use as social housing. His plans failed and I think that's what caused him to start drinking.

Growing up I don't have much memories of him at all. We were living in the 3rd level of our house 1st being our store, 2nd is storage. However you could look at the entrance/exit of our house from the kitchen window. So one day my father was leaving for work and my mother wanted to wave at him as he was leaving the house. She was curious what was taking him so long to leave and decided to look after him.
She found him in the basement drinking in the early morning.
It went on this way for a bit. He changed radically. He never played with me (3 years old at the time) but once. The only memory of him playing with me, was when he preferred to play with me instead of taking a walk on a sunny day.

So when I was 6 I had plenty of memories of him not wanting to have dinner with our family, because he wasn't satisfied with my moms cooking. One particular thing that comes to mind was him slamming knife and fork at the table and storming off. My mom made homemade pizza, and I really like her cooking. He left the house and supposedly went drinking.

My mom divorced when I was 7. She agreed of letting him see me and my brother every 2nd weekend. We did this quite regularly every 2nd weekend. My father had high mood swings. When we were around he seemed to be doing fine. My mother found someone else and moved on. She didn't talk to him anymore and I doubt that she cared for him anymore as well. Over the years our 2nd weekend arrangement ended up with me and my brother standing in front of locked doors. For the times where he actually was there and we'd spent the day with him, we would do a lot of fun things. We were going to the cinema, watching telly, or went to play billiards. Over the time it changed to only billiards and always in weird pubs. I remember that we used to go there by car. Once we found empty vodka bottles in his car. He'd always have 2-3 Guinness while being in that bar, but I didn't care for that at the time, and I thought it would be normal.
Anyway, years go by and we kinda lost contact with him. We actually went to meet him twice a year. He lost his driving license so we went to take the bus to get to the pub.
When my brother went to study, he needed a copy of his paycheck to check if he'd be able to get government funding. He refused to send one. We actually had to go to court to get him to give us that information.

Seeing that he didn't want to support us anymore (he never payed alimony anyway) we broke contact with him.
When I was 18, he somehow managed to contact me again, asking if I wanted to do something with him. I agreed to it. He was a former shadow of himself. I mean I never really got to know him anyway. I knew that he was working for the state government but that was it.
I actually got to enjoy that day. There wasn't a lot of talking, but we went to the cinema and had dinner afterwards. However I was about to move for an internship and I didn't know, that that would be the last time I actually see him. He was a stranger for me. A stranger I had talked to but never knew. There were more stories like that, but it would take too long to write them all down.

So after my Internship I went to study. I received a call from my mother one day, and she told me that he died. I stood there on my balcony and I though: Your ""dad"" is dead, you should probably cry. But I didn't. I just thought, a man, that was supposed to be important to me died. I didn't care about it at all.
However when I heard about the details, I actually was sad: He died alone in a rented apartment. Police had to open the door after someone was suspicious about either rent, mail or smell (never got to know that). He died 2 weeks before they found him. They said there was a lot of bottles and packages in that apartment. He was about 53 years old.

So after he died, my brother and I were his heir. We didn't receive anything (didn't want to have anything either), but the task to set up his burial. His brother/my uncle has been always weird and didn't want to have anything to do with it. So after paying for cleaning his apartment, selling all the stuff that might actually be worth something, receiving a special payment from the government (where he didn't work anymore and they retired him under special circumstances) we received just enough money to pay for an anonymous burial.
I am glad that I didn't have anything to do with it. I was far away and my brother handled it with the help of my mother. My mother actually remarried, so that her boyfriend I grew up with became my step dad. I actually consider him my real dad, as dad is a title to me that has to be earned and my biological father never did anything serious to earn it. There was a time where I thought that I might had the power to change something. That if I had invested more time into our ""relationship"" or rather tried to build one, I might have been able to save him. But I didn't and it doesn't matter anymore. He had his chance caring for me and he blew it, he blew his whole life away just to be drunk.

TL;DR: Alcohol changes you, lets you lose everything you love and then when you're at rock bottom, you die alone."
21f77x,4,2014-03-26,Me [20 F] with my BF[21 M] of 3 years: Which to plan my future around: my career or my relationship? Breaking my own heart.,achinglyambitious,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/21f77x/me_20_f_with_my_bf21_m_of_3_years_which_to_plan/,"I'm currently in China for another two months; I've been here since Christmas.


We've been together since high school. I've been studying French for years, and it's always been my plan to move there for at least a while. I've studied abroad there before for 2 months and during the separation we didn't have any problems. 


For the past month I've been thinking more and more about the future. I want to travel, learn languages, and adventure. I want to internship in France after graduation, and then attend grad school (though I haven't decided which one [or even which country]). 


My boyfriend is amazing and all I could ever ask for. He is a much better person than me in almost every way (ok, I admit it, I'm the funny one). He's my first real relationship and I still love him. We don't fight, maybe once or twice a year, and I like just being with him. He's my best friend.


I wish we'd met in a few years. 


It's time for me to start preparing for the GRE in the fall, and apply for the internships I want. I need to start looking at grad schools and where I want to end up. 


He also wants to go to grad school as a history major. I don't really want to do long distance again (our first year was long distance while I went to a different college, my time in France was long distance, and my time here in China is long distance- it's wearing me down), so he said he'd put off grad school and move to France with me for a year. 


This is kind of a big thing to me. The thing is, if he asked me to do that, I would 100% say no.


I'm not sure I want to plan my life around staying with someone at 20 years old and I'm not sure he should either. 


I'm not sure the best things for us are necessarily the things we want.


Thinking about this is stressing me out. I've been thinking about this for 3 weeks straight and talked to him about it multiple times. It's affecting my sleep and my appetite. I've sought advice from my sister, my best friends, my roommate, and people here at my school. Thinking about being without him, or thinking about giving up on opportunities is killing me. 


Should I just find a grad school with a good foreign exchange program to stay with him? Should we break up? Should I let him come with me and put off grad school?


I need some advice from people outside the situation with more experience. I just don't know what to do at all.

21fpl2,80,2014-03-26,I recently decided to start living my own life and it's absolutely terrifying,ansterthemonster,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/21fpl2/i_recently_decided_to_start_living_my_own_life/,"I didn't realize that I might have been raised by narcissists until a few months ago. I apologize in advance for the length of this post.

My parents did a lot of things that aren't really ""normal"". I am the youngest and after my older siblings moved out/went to college, I was left being their ""only child"". 

From the age of 16, I became my parent's marriage counselor. I would stay up until the wee hours of the night to stand between then in our kitchen and mediate their fights. Things could get heated, and I never left feeling like I made a difference as they tend to have the same arguments over and over. After going into therapy, I found out that a teenager acting as their parent's counselor is highly inappropriate. I have told my parents over and over that I will not be involved in their marriage troubles, yet they continue to ignore this. Whenever I am alone with the two of them, they start arguments and then speak for me - *""ansterthemonster would agree with me on this""*, which I, of course, respond to with my own opinion and BAM I'm involved again and they are trying to get me to pick sides. 

They have never been very involved in my life...


Examples:

- They have always had a hard time remembering important facts about my life like my medical history, my allergies, the names of my friends, my major, my interests, and my age. 

- When I was a pre-teen/teenager and was sad, I remember my mother taking one look at my face and saying things to me like *""people don't want to look at you if you look like that""* or *""stop being so mopey""*. As a result of this, I was trained to not express the emotions I am experiencing and instead smile regardless. This has proven to be very unhealthy. 

- I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety when I was 18 and my parents have repeatedly ""forgotten"" about or disregarded my mental health problems. 

- I confided in my father that I self harm and he forgot... twice. He asks me often to remind him with questions like - *""so why are you still depressed?""* 


... and at the same time, they are VERY invested in my life. 

Examples: 

- When I was looking into getting into college, my dad requested I show him my college essay. He re-wrote it entirely describing not me, but himself. When I told him I couldn't use it because I didn't think it represented me at all, he wouldn't listen and lectured me on the fact that he knows more than I do. 

- My mother is an artist and always pressured me into art. When I told her I didn't want to be an artist, she convinced me to go to art school anyway saying that I was so talented and I could always choose to do something else later. I ended up going to art school and was miserable. 

- When I transferred from art school, I told my parents I wasn't sure what I wanted to do but I wanted to focus on something more academic. That's when my father, who is a doctor, decided I ""would make a great doctor"". Immediately, he found me internships that were way above my capabilities and that I only got as a result of favors that my father was owed by his colleges.  He *told* me it was my decision, but every time I tried to back out, it was like talking to a wall - *""You don't know, I do. This is the best thing for you, etc.""* I had a job already (one in which I was getting paid unlike the internship) and ended up spending a summer working so much I couldn't see my friends and I was getting an average of 5 hours of sleep a night. 

- I have struggled immensely in my pre-medical/pre-vet classes. I have had to retake classes because I haven't been able to get over a C and in some cases I have had to drop due to my grades. There was one semester I managed a B in a Chemistry class. I called my dad when I found out and proudly told him about my grade. His response included no praise only *""so what do you think you could have done to get an A?""*

- My parents know that I am having trouble in school as they request that I tell them my grades (and tell me I have to because it is their money they are investing in me), but they still tell everyone they know that I am doing exceptionally well. They tell their friends and my grandparents and extended family (often in front of me) that I am getting good grades and I am well on my way to being a doctor or veterinarian or whatever they want. 

- A few months ago (while I was 21 years old), my father went into my room, opened a drawer and read my personal diary. He then ""confessed"" to me that he did this and tried to talk to me about the things I had written. I repeatedly told him how inappropriate this was and how he completely disregarded my personal space as an adult woman. He still, months later, has not fully accepted that he acted inappropriately. 


Now, I'm 22 years old. My transcript is riddled with poor grades and my future is limited because of it. Yesterday, I came to the terrible realization that if I had done what I wanted to do from the beginning, I would be in great standing for getting into graduate school. Instead, I was so concerned about disappointing my parents that I now have a terrible GPA and I am so stressed out I consider suicide on a regular basis just to avoid my inevitable failure. 

Today, I have decided to stop. Without telling my parents, I am no longer going to complete any required classes for applying to medical school or veterinary school and I am going to focus on applying to graduate school for my major. I know my parents won't be proud of me for this decision, but I realized that I can't be happy when I am living my life in fear of their disappointment. 

I want to create as much distance from my parents as possible, but as they are currently paying for my undergraduate education, I still feel tied to them. 

While I know this is the best decision for me and that I should become financially/emotionally independent from my parents as soon as possible, I've lived my life to please them for so long just the thought of it is... paralyzing. 

Again, I'm sorry that this is so long. I just felt like I had to get it out of my head and I feel like a lot of you might understand. "
21fqml,12,2014-03-26,My close friend told me today that she's decided she wants to commit suicide and asked me to respect and understand her wishes.,throwawaytoday9119,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/21fqml/my_close_friend_told_me_today_that_shes_decided/,"We'll call her A for this post. She has had an extremely troubled life - an abusive mother, a distant father who has started a new family a couple of hours away and nothing but emotional distress for all of her 22 years. Her and I were on the verge of entering a relationship before I left the country (Canada) for Greece on a three-month internship which concludes next week - I'll be home on April 6th. Things were proceeding well here until a few weeks ago when her and her ex-boyfriend had a massive falling-out and she was noticeably upset with herself and her life. I've done my best to support her from over here despite her telling me she no longer believes she can get into a relationship - we were close friends for years before this, and even if things didn't proceed romantically I would care a lot about her emotional well-being. She started seeing a counsellor on a weekly basis, but was put on a waiting list for a real treatment program (she basically keeps all of her counselling records and hopes to be able to meet with the same counsellor each time she goes to the clinic). 

Today she told me that she is done with all of the pain in her life and has decided she wants to end it. She doesn't seem to be in a stereotypically suicidal situation - she has an active and successful work life and many friends who love and respect her. She told me she simply cannot continue to bear the pain that her troubled upbringing (and all of the things that have happened to her as a result) have caused. I made a point of telling her that there are a lot of people who would be devastated if she took her own life, but she angrily asked why she should have to continue bearing her pain for the sake of preserving the feelings of others. Fearing that she would do something drastic immediately, I told my roommate (her best friend) that she was talking about committing suicide and that he needed to get over to her place right away, which he did. She was angry that I did this and it didn't seem to help - she asked him to be left alone, which he did, but we continued to talk after, with it being clear that nothing had changed.

I did my best to tell her I understood that she felt hopeless and like her situation could never improve, but that if she committed to professional help she could not only find a way to get past the pain but find happiness in life as well. Long story short, no matter what I said she would not agree to see it that way... I got her to promise that she wouldn't kill herself today, that we would talk tomorrow, and that she would tell her counsellor about these feelings tomorrow when they met. I'm hoping that suicidal thoughts are a major red flag with her counsellor and that this leads to immediate action.

I also asked her to promise me that she would talk to me before actually doing anything, but she said that after I called her friend today, she couldn't do that - basically that some day I will simply get the news that she's killed herself. She said she does not want my help, she only wants me to understand and respect her wish to no longer be alive... from my perspective, she has asked me to just let her die. She insists that this isn't the case - she only wants me to respect that she wants to kill herself even if I can't accept that and want it for her as well, to which I answered that I can respect that, but I cannot just sit back and let it happen.

I don't know what to do about this situation from here. I looked into changing my flight to go home early and it will cost thousands of dollars which I simply don't have - not that I can't spare it, but that I simply do not have the money required to jump on a plane tomorrow and fly home. My flight is booked for April 6th, but I don't know if she'll still be alive by then.

One of our friends (my roommate) now knows about this and I feel obligated to tell another one of my roommates who is also extremely close with her. I don't know what else I can do, especially being so far away with no way of getting home any time soon. It frightens me that she was not simply saying she's been considering it - but that she actually said that she hopes that when the day comes, that I will understand why she had to do what she did. Please, any advice will be greatly appreciated.

21fsbd,3,2014-03-26,[CC] You are at an interview and you are asked for a time when you disobeyed a superior,jimmywus_throwaway,WritingPrompts,https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/21fsbd/cc_you_are_at_an_interview_and_you_are_asked_for/,"On most days I was grateful. With seven people all trying to sell and rent Manhattan flats and offices, as the resident graphic designer, I could’ve easily been buried. But because the majority our team’s clients were flippers and more importantly, they flipped the same set of properties month to month, I’d managed to recycle most of my work. So as a general rule the work was repetitive and uneventful. But like all rules, there are a few exceptions. This is one of those exceptions.

At the time, it’d seemed to me that calling it a conflict was akin to calling the Titanic a leaky boat (I have since toned down my dramatic flair). I was an intern and she was an associate, or a junior associate. Her title eludes me now but there was no doubt she was one chain link above me on the office food chain. Working in a real estate office will teach you that food chains are important. Food chain are the back bone of all order and reason; food chains are the only thing keeping the new comers from pouncing on every lead they see and any property they deem unclaimed. Commission is king. 

But I wasn’t a realtor. I was the realtors’ graphics designer and the only thing I wanted to pounce on was my bed. But insubordination was insubordination and she wasn’t having any of it. “Send Mike the templates or don’t. This is your job.” I hadn’t missed the implied threat. It might be more accurate to say the threat had hit me like a hammer. If my first sentence didn’t tip you off, I love this job. I love this job but I also love my team. It was a tough ultimatum. Sally had wanted Mike to recreate my team’s (emphasis on my) brochures. Having recently been promoted to junior or something associate and assigned to a new team, this is no doubt her house warming gift for her new teammates. This is what she is bringing to the table. Well not if I can help it.

Before you mark me down as a selfish prick, this is why our brochures are, and exceedingly so, ours. The money for the professional photography was paid out of pocket by our team leader Paul and the typefaces paid out of mine. It’d taken months to put together the fifty plus pages template and each brochure costs upwards of a hundred dollars to print. Not only are the photos of the property exclusively our property, the entire brochure was a point of pride for us. Each team member had put a little bit of themselves into it, whether it was paying for the rights to use the photos, the fonts or writing a neighborhood description or leaving a personal story. Now I can’t say it had made a significant impact on our team commission but it warms my heart to think it did.

The problem was how I tell Sally no? She’d known full well how much work and money had gone into this since the first day we’d brought it up at the cross team meeting. Until know, there’d been a quiet agreement that what’s ours is ours and theirs is theirs -- keeping your hand in your own pockets so to speak.

There is no doubt now that Sally’s hand is deeply entrenched in my pocket and it’s quickly getting uncomfortable. It’s important to keep in mind that as aggressive as the different teams are towards each other, it is a passive aggression. Nobody forgets to maintain the façade that we are still working for the same firm with the same boss under the same name. I wish I could’ve conveyed this to Sally with tact but Sally was determined and tact won’t save me now. 

“Sally, let me ask Paul about this, I think he…”



“No! There’s no time. Paul’s out showing properties all day and Mike needs the template in the next 20 minutes or he won’t have it ready for the meeting.”

Of course Paul is out showing properties -- and William and Jenna and Steve. The only team members that are actually in the office today are two other interns and James. James is balding senior associate in his forties. James is on his famous hour long daily lunch break. She’s got me in a corner.

It is at this point where I tell you I’m not proud of what I’ve done. 

“Okay fine, send me his email.”

“Thank you.”

I open my laptop, sure to let her see my dejected slump and downcast eyes. She won; she’s trapped the lone intern against the wall and the moment she shows the executives her team’s new brochure that brochure becomes fair game. Fair game doesn’t last long in this office. She turns around to talk to the other interns. Probably too excited to wait to flaunt her victory, two seconds after her win she is already displaying my carcass. Her mistake.

This is a trick I picked up in high school. I rename a word document as .PDF. This shows the file with a .PDF icon and you can do everything you can to it as you would a PDF file except open it. Unless you knew which type of document it was originally, this file is eternally corrupted.

Hopefully she won’t notice until the meeting starts but I’m realistic. Chances are she’ll realize when Mike calls her up and tells her the file won’t open. But a few minutes is all I need. I can still remember how she gave me a smirk before she left and went back to her cubicle. In the few minutes it takes Mike to realize the problem is the file I’ll be down stairs on a train home.

[Thanks for doing this. Do you think we will ever (in the foreseeable future\) ""escape"" from the giant bulky bubble spacesuits that have been the norm since the Apollo missions? A slimmer, more form-fitting one, like the ones the Mercury and Gemini astronauts wore, would certainly be easier to operate in, but is not technologically feasible for working in exposed space. Are there any designs that are aimed towards a thinner aesthetic?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/21fjrf/we_are_nasa_engineers_building_nextgen_spacesuits/cgcj3yx?context=5)|Great question! This is a question we get a lot, and there are a couple answers.
 |First, the Mercury suits were not designed to be pressurized except in a contingency - they were ""get me down"" suits similar to the orange ACES suits we used for Shuttle.  The Gemini suits were used for EVA, but were sorely lacking in mobility. In comparison, the Apollo suit built just a few years later, which still has somewhat limited EVA mobility, appears much ""bulkier"".  As a general rule, the more mobile a pressurized suit, the bulkier it appears due to the use of more hard mobility elements such as bearings. The more hard components, the less change in volume of the suit through the range of motion, and the higher the mobility.
 |Also, an ""alternative"" to full pressure suits is mechanical counter pressure suits which have been theorized and worked on since the 1960s. Some of us think that this type of suit architecture has a place in the distant future once material technology enables it.  For now, we do actively fund material development in this area.  In the meantime, we are designing suits for the next 10-20 years, and those will likely be full pressure suits like you see with the EMU, Mark III, Z-1 and the upcoming Z-2! -SM.
[In case you've somehow missed my question specifically about MCP suits.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/21fjrf/we_are_nasa_engineers_building_nextgen_spacesuits/cgcld5w?context=5)|Mechanical counterpressure (or MCP) suits are a concept that have been around for many decades. The concept carries with it many potential advantages to full pressure suits.  However, there are many technical limitations that need to be overcome before we see an MCP suit performing a spacewalk on Mars.  Advances in materials and construction techniques must be made and we view these as long-term issues.  We are very glad to see progress being made on MCP and in addition, we ourselves are actively funding development of these materials.  Many of us view MCP as having a place in the future of spacesuit design, although when advances in technology allow that future to occur is a big unknown. In the meantime, we are looking at developing flight capability to support missions in the next 5-15 years. - SM 
[Can one of these suits withstand a micrometeorite hit, say, in a moon or Mars atmo scenario? Or is that pretty much instant death for the wearer?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/21fjrf/we_are_nasa_engineers_building_nextgen_spacesuits/cgcjhu0?context=5)|The risk of impact is higher on the Moon because there's no atmosphere to slow bits down or destroy them, and once they hit on the Moon, smaller secondary chunks can be ejected too.  However, at the end of the day, the damage done depends on the size of the particle.  The suits are designed to maintain pressure for at least 30min after getting a 0.25in diameter hole.  We try to mitigate the risk by designing multiple layers in the suit that reduce the size and energy of particles that hit to prevent them from actually penetrating the bladder layer.  We also use statistical models in EVA planning to pick times and locations for space walks that are lower risk for micrometeoroid impacts.

[A\) Are you developing/interested in exploring some sensing system - active or passive (thinking interferometric colour change, due to disruption in a diffraction grating like structure... a la iridescent butterfly wings\) - which informs the astronaut about a tear?

The engineers pay attention to peeling of the silicon outer layers and are looking for colors other than grey or white on the glove, which are signs of damage that goes beyond the thermal micrometeoroid garment (TMG).  Small tears and cuts may not be obvious to the crew on orbit, but the engineers on the ground tracking the oxygen usage in the suit can detect small leaks early and terminate the EVA for safety reasons.  Any hole that's big enough to activate the secondary oxygen system will be obvious to both the crew and ground teams.

Not realistic for the forseeable future. Form fitting suits (MPC) are decades away and there is a certain amount of pre-breathe time required before going EVA to allow your body to be purged of N2 because the suits operate at lower than earth atmospheric pressures.

 |Edit: I will add that in almost all science fiction films, the dead give away, even if the suits are not form-fitting, is that they don't move like a pressurized suit moves.  They move like normal clothes.  A suit at 8.3psid is as hard as a basketball. When they move, it is very characteristic and as a spacesuit engineer, that is always the thing for me that sticks out. -SM.

[Do you plan on distributing any suits to SpaceX or other privatized companies?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/21fjrf/we_are_nasa_engineers_building_nextgen_spacesuits/cgcnj55?context=5)|NASA’s commercial crew partners are solely contracted to develop a vehicle as a way to transport crew to the International Space Station.  As such, the suits they use will be “launch and entry” suits of the simplest kind.   Each company is responsible for their own suit, whether they build it in house, or subcontract it out. Launch and entry suits are designed for unpressurized comfort and mobility – they are only pressurized in an emergency and therefore, pressurized mobility is not a significant design driver.  The Z-series of suits and other suits in our Advanced Suit Laboratory are specifically EVA suits – that is, optimized for pressurized mobility. Therefore, while there are always lessons learned in any suit design and some technical overlap, we view these suits of limited applicability to the Z-series. That being said, there are others within our branch (Spacesuit and Crew Survival Systems Branch) as well as within NASA that are working closely on commercial crew partners and spacesuits are an important component of this.  And lastly, we just want to add that we are all super excited about the prospect of commercial access to space! -SM.
[With some clever implementation of the Peltier effect, I wouldn't think there would be any problems with thermal regulation. No need for an LCVG; or its weighty, and Luca-threatening extractor fans, pumps and pipes. (Yes, you could use simple Joule heating to increase the temperature, but I was thinking about active cooling as well. In fact, if this was weaved into the fabric, it could arguably provide more spatially uniform temperatures - if wires can be manufactured in smaller sizes than pipes which have to transport a fluid\)  Another advantage to all this is that the astronauts can breathe air at regular habitat pressure (since they don't need to reduce suit pressure as much as possible to avoid impeding mechanical motion\). This means no overnight airlock campout, or even ISLE for a blood Nitrogen purge prior to EVA. They may still choose to breathe air at lower pressure than the habitat pressure, if that facilitates longer EVAs with the same mass of Nitrox/O2 in a tank (Does it?\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/21fjrf/we_are_nasa_engineers_building_nextgen_spacesuits/cgcjygl?context=5)|1) You need to pressurize the breathing cavity to at least 3psia.  That means either some kind of breathing mask, which is not really ideal for regular full day EVAs, or some kind of neck seal that maintains a delta pressure of 3psid with minimal leakage.  I'm actually not familiar with much work done on this yet, and maybe it's doable, but it certainly sounds uncomfortable to me given how much motive force is behind 3psid in my experience working around suits.  3) It is very difficult to apply the required pressure to all parts of the body and to verify you are applying the pressures you need through test - including the crotch, armpit, etc.  It's not an unsolvable problem, mind you, and there are very smart people, some of which directly funded by NASA, working on it right now.  So, I would not agree that NASA and/or our team pay lip service to MCP.  We all *love* the idea and continue to support it. Our primary job is flight capable designs in the next 5-15 years.

We have over 62 different sizes of gloves with fine adjustments of finger lengths in each of those sizes, but we still see injury.  As part of our High Performance EVA Glove project we're developing sensor systems that can be worn inside of the gloves during suited events to help us understand what aspects of the design are creating the biggest problems.

 |Dude, how much time do you have? Seriously there are quite a few and this is one of my favorite topics. One because I'm stubborn and always need to correct people when they're wrong (ask my wife, and I'm working on that). But also because I find it interesting how science fiction plays such an influential role in how people view space suits versus other technologies. For cars, flying vehicles, weapons, architecture, these things are all common in science fiction and while futuristic, they usually take on a similar form to existing and functional versions thereof. For spacesuits in science fiction, there is a draw to eschew the realities that confine real spacesuit design for a much more appealing aesthetic. On top of that, the most attractive spacesuits in science fiction are conformal, sleek and sexy, usually mimicking the human form approaching that of a supermodel or athletic superhero. So, in general I find this topic to be of particular interest because it ties into what people find attractive in other people *as well as* technology. In any case...to your specific question. I'll pick my top three.
 |People are always surprised when they see the restraint layer of EVA suits. They are so used to seeing the outer layer only, whether in photos or movies or whatever that when they see the suits without the cover layer on, they are amazed by the level of detailed construction and engineering that goes into them. See my recent example above showing photos of the Apollo suit with and without the cover layer. And that is 50 year old suit technology!
 |By extension most people are of the impression that to design a less bulky, sleeker suit is a trivial exercise and real EVA suits look the way they do because of some predetermined design solution. The truth is that we would love smaller, lighter, more comfortable suits. But to make them mobile to do real work in space or on Mars, we use heavily-engineered mobility elements at the joints that allow for sufficient range of motion. Imagine taking a tubular balloon the size of your leg and inflated as hard as a basketball. Now imagine bending it. That's what we are dealing with. It's a solvable solution but with today's technology it leads us down the road to components that are considerably larger than the human joint.
 |One of the biggest is the simple reality that some spacesuits are designed to be pressurized only in a SHTF scenario. They afford very little pressurized mobility and instead are designed for unpressurized comfort, mobility and low thermal burden. Not unlike normal clothing except this clothing also saves you if your vehicle depressurizes. Suits we work on in our lab are designed to be worn and used only when pressurized. They allow things that are very difficult or impossible in launch and entry suits. The penalty you're paying for this mobility as I mentioned is mass and cost. It's an engineering trade and there are areas in between. The Apollo suit did both functions well enough and that was a great engineering feat. That works for a couple days but for our suits, and NASA's vision over the coming decades, we are talking about months or years on Mars. Very different.

[Do the new suits weigh any more or any less than the current suits? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/21fjrf/we_are_nasa_engineers_building_nextgen_spacesuits/cgckhg2?context=5)|The short answer is Yes, the Z-2 suit will weigh less than the current space suits.
 |The Z-2 suit will weigh about 135lbs compared to the current EMU, which weighs over 300 lbs.  Keep in mind though that the Z-2 suit won’t include a thermal micrometeriod garment (TMG) or a portable life support system (PLSS), which adds significant weight to the EMU.  The weight of the EMU without the PLSS weighs ~195lbs, which is still much heavier than the Z-2. - AK.
 |The biggest factor that plays into the weight of the suit is the metal components such as bearings. Z-2 will have more bearings (like hip and leg bearings) than the EMU but we’re currently testing the compatibility of titanium in oxygen systems which provides significant weight reduction compared to stainless steel bearings used in the EMU. We’ve also tested composite bearings in the past but additional development is needed. DJV

I am currently an MSc student at Goldsmiths University, and am currently looking for an internship or junior role in a games company as a programmer.

Part of my course is that we all go off for internships at the end of the year, but this tends to be full time jobs that just continue after the supposed internship period ends, I was just wondering if anyone knows anywhere that are taking these types of people as the majority of things I find require a years experience!

I have had a couple of interviews with a few companies and waiting for responses but thought you guys might know something I don't!

I tend to enjoy well thought out roleplays with defined characters who have personality and desires that might even stretch beyond what goes on in the bedroom. But primarily I enjoy the reversal of control, the manipulation that can go into taboo relationships, or power dynamics that are inverted, tied up, made to beg to be gagged, and firmly punished for pretending to have the final say in any relationship. 

Of course, these types of power dynamics can take any number of forms, several of which have been knocking around in my head for the better part of my time on DPP. So. With the requisite cheesy, difficult-to-develop title factor.

### Just a Ride Away
 (*based in part on a true series of encounters*)

&gt; The commute my school takes fifty seven minutes, door to door. I get out of my apartment at 7:03, swipe my metrocard through the turnstile at 7:10. The M train arrives between 7:11 and 7:14, never earlier, never later. I make the transfer to the six at 7:32, and you get on and sit next to me at 7:34, one stop later. I know the reason why, I've seen the leers that women get on the morning commute. The way that you like to dress, the hordes of sexually and emotionally stunted middle aged men in suits that ride on the train through midtown? I'm surprised you haven't given up on the subway completely with all the overt staring and the 'accidental' pressing against you when one of them inevitably sits next to you. At least this way one side of you is always protected from them by me. 

&gt; At school, of course, it's a different story. The same reasons I'm worth something to you on the Lexington Line are why I'm invisible to you once we get to school, relatively harmless, relatively nondescript. Safe. Nice. *Boring.* You've fallen asleep on my shoulder more times than words that you've ever addressed to me. Do you know how frustrated you make me? I don't think it's unreasonable for me to get something out of whatever safety I grant you every single day we go to school. And so one day, as we're getting off, I slip you a note.

### Therapy
 (*based in part on a prompt from a month or two ago, taken with permission and gratitude*)

&gt; &gt;*Hi, Michael. I hope you're doing well. I am, if you hadn't heard, I've recently followed in your footsteps and have started my own private practice here in the city. I hope you don't mind that I haven't contacted you in so long. My gratitude cannot be overstated, but I have a husband now, and the power that you had over me... Well, I think that it's enough to write that I still think of you often, more often than I have any right to. Anyway, I know that you've moved on in your professional career. Teaching, now, isn't it? Your lucky little undergraduates...*

&gt; &gt;*Anyway, I've been having some trouble with one of my oldest clients. I tend to specialize in adolescent young women now, and, well, one of them reminds me of myself ten or fifteen years ago. I've worked with her for two years now, and have hardly made any headway, despite my best efforts. Anyway, please find enclosed the files I have on her. If you think it possible, perhaps a treatment like the one you provided me would be appropriate. I know it's a hassle, I know that you don't do this anymore. But if you could make this one exception, for me, I would greatly appreciate it.*

&gt; &gt;*Thank you. If you agree with me, please get in contact with my secretary regarding an official referral.*

&gt; It had been two weeks since I had received that letter. Right in the middle of midterms, as I've been buried under my coursework. And yet I've made the arrangements, even going so far as to avoid talking to my former client on the phone, going through all the silly little loopholes to make this work. And I've put aside my grading for the evening, rearranged my home office to accommodate a private patient again. And now it's twenty minutes after the agreed upon start of our first session and yet you're no where to be found.

### Heat

&gt; The mirepoix's sweating. Mise en place done. Station spotless. Towels doubled up. Knives sharpened, apron clean, cutting boards sanitized, pans ready to go, stove ready to fire. I've been here three weeks so far, and there hasn't been a single day you haven't barked at me before service even started. And there hasn't been a single day I haven't found myself struggling in the weeds. I need this job, or I'm going to have to move, yet again. I'm new to this city and my resume got me a gig here, with you, and I thought having a female boss would be nice, for once. Nurturing, maybe. A little more easy going than the psychotic hardasses that make up most of this industry. And I'm good looking, too, I take better care of my body than the usual line cook and the way my tattooed, ripped forearms look when I'm working the saute station has convinced many a waitress to let me fuck them. Charming you shouldn't have been any trouble at all. 

&gt; And yet, here I am, terrified that you might be paying attention to me at all. All your presence does is distract me, I'm making mistakes that I haven't made since I was fresh out of high school slaving away at an Applebees. If I lose this job I'm *fucked*, you're the only chef in this goddamn city who knows my name, and if I can't get a reference out of you I'm going to have to get in on dishwork and pray I get enough hours to cover my rent. And it's not like I have any secondary skills to fall back on, unless waitresses here are pulling in enough tips to want to hire male prostitutes... Expo is calling out our first order of the shift. I hope I still have a job tomorrow. 

***

I have a few other ideas bouncing around too - I love a good old-fashioned intern roleplay, and incestuous relationships seem to be easy to have fun with as well. In terms of short term scenes, I love cheating/taboo characters, especially if I'm a close friend or sibling of the person being cheated upon. I'm extremely open to other creative ideas, so please don't *too* feel bound and restricted by what I've written, as much fun as it may be. I do like writing sexy things of all sorts.

I don't have any particular preference for duration or frequency of responses; I care a lot more about quality than about quantity. In terms of specific kinks, I'm a firm believer in exploration and a lack of inhibition. 

If you have a character you think fits in with any of my scenes, or would just like to chat to gauge possible common interests, please let me know. If you've made it this far: thanks for reading!

### SPECIAL BONUS FUN

For any interested party, particularly those who are interested in playing a submissive character. I would love to extend the offer of tying into my posts a series of directions - controlling your pleasure or pain as I see fit. I have a fair amount of experience with being a Dominant partner both in person and online, and would love to find roleplayers who can play into that a certain extent. If you are interested, I would love to hear about your hard limits and push you right to the point where you break... Or just give you a little guidance regarding exactly when and how you'll orgasm."
21g0f3,0,2014-03-26,Complicated driver licensing question from BC to AB,[deleted],Calgary,https://www.reddit.com/r/Calgary/comments/21g0f3/complicated_driver_licensing_question_from_bc_to/,"This is probably best to be answered by an AB Driver Licensing Office, but before I fork over the long-distance charges I'm attempting to see if anyone here can shed some light on my situation.

I'm currently a BC student who will be going to AB for a summer internship. If the internship works out, I could be hired full-time and call AB my permanent home.

As of this moment, I don't have a valid drivers license because I have fines that need to be paid off before I can drive and insure a vehicle. I am an ""N"" (new driver) license under the graduated licensing program in BC through ICBC. Right now I owe about $2000 in fines which need to be paid before I can get my BC DL. I also have an appeal pending which may impact my ability to get my drivers license back because of a DUI that happened last year. This is a story in itself, but essentially I was sitting in a permanently parked, uninsured vehicle outside of my family's house with no intention of driving, but was busted for a DUI because I had the keys in the ignition with the heater on. The result of the appeal is basically a 50/50 chance of success and a decision could be made in the next 2 months. An unsuccessful appeal means I will need to enroll in the RPD program to keep my BC Drivers License (another $2000 expense).

So my situation is basically this, do I pay the fines and drive to Alberta? But I'd be risking paying off $2000 in fines only to get my license suspended pending my enrollment in the RPD program which will cost a further $2000 - OR - Do I fly to Alberta, sell my car, and don't worry about driving at all - OR - Do I attempt to get licensed in Alberta and keep my car? Any other stuff I should know about that would help me reach a decision?"

i was also late to contacting the school i am interning at. i dont know what i was thinking contacting them today when i was supposed to arrive there today. why would that be taken care of? that's my job. i cried for the first time in a public bathroom after the bus left.

i feel like they already disapprove of me. the reply to my last minute email sounded rather irate. i don't blame her. i feel like a failure. i know this is not true and feel worse because i am so weak, crack at these mistakes, mistakes i would've avoided if i weren't such a lazy dumbass. i want to say its not my fault but it is!!! i realize it is so minute in the grand scheme of things and i know it won't matter but knowning it doesn't change the fact that i feel like the biggest screw-up.

i already feel anxious because this internship's objective is literally to connect with the students. as a socially retarded person i've been wondering what i've gotten myself into. during the orientation i was beginning to feel a mix of hopefulness and fluttering nervousness yesterday, thinking maybe this will be the turning point in my life. maybe i can finally become a fully functioning human again. maybe i'll learn to connect with people. yes. i can do this.

but just like that with the stupidest mess-up in my plans my hopeful attitude evaporated to be replaced by the all too familiar feelings of worthlessness and inadequacy. what was i thinking? thinking that i could get people to like me.

i act so strong, think myself so gritty when really i'm like glass. the littlest impact shattering me to pieces and it takes so long to pick up all the shards.

i feel like shit and i dont want to and i want to cry but i can't. i want to stop hating myself. i want to stop being so fucking emotional, irrational.

i just want to curl up in a corner and put a blanket over my head and stay there for the rest of my life."

The 2nd round is pending, but B told me that they would like me to come back to the second (technical) round. B pays a little higher and develops a product that I am more interested in.

I don't want to reject the offer I have in hopes of getting the other one, but I would like to know if it is okay to back out from an accepted offer before the internship starts for another offer that I am waiting for. I would prefer not to hurt my relations with A because I have had a good experience with them. All of my interview rounds with A have lasted longer than any of my friend's for the same position which, I believe, means they like what I have to offer. 

P.S. I am aware that this is a general question, but since it involves CS/IT positions I decided to post it here."

Then that girl, a young college intern, started at my office and I fell victim to her flirtation and my own male urges. One night I lied to you, a first, and said I was staying late to work. Ever my devoted wife, you came to bring me dinner. A full sirloin steak and baked potato. Arriving at the office you catch me redhanded nailing that slut on the conference room table. 

She tearfully retreated and I stopped the encounter, realizing I'd made a colossal mistake. You pack me a bag and told me to stay at my brother's house until further instructed. Knowing it's my only chance, I agree.

A week later you send me a message for me to return home where you'll give me one chance to make amends.

(Without giving away the whole plot: this would involve my being shamed by my family of women, then being ""forced"" to have sex with our daughters as you prove that I was a fool for seeking Sex outside of our family)

I really don't know what to look for after college. I sent my name out to a few places for an internship this summer and really haven't gotten anything back.

I know a bit of java, C++, and really don't know what I want to do. My advisors in school are horrible for computer science and the head of my dept. is like 89 years old and still talks about COBOL. 

I like programming but as a junior with a year left of school and not very good at programming I might not be looking in that direction, unless I put a lot of work into it.

I'm unionized, great benefits, better pay than anywhere else I've ever worked, I even have a pension, I have job security for christ's sake! However, despite all this I am just miserable, and I realize I have been miserable for years. I'm proud of my work, I enjoy the challenge, I can actually do the, job and do it well, I'm just not happy.

Part of it is I hate my boss and I'm exhausted all the time. I love the dynamic but hate the atmosphere, I hate the egos, I hate the neglect for self care. I hate politics and I hate having to be ""on"" all the time in public. Besides my close friends and semi anonymous online forums like reddit, I feel I just can't be myself.

I feel that I have such a good deal, I'd be a fool to give it up. I went to jschool, freelanced and did internships for most of my 20s before getting this job and now that I have it I think about quitting every single day. It's hard for me to admit to myself this is actually what I need to do. I'll probably go a few more months to save up some money, I'm thinking of going into documentary film, I have lots of contacts in the industry and in my network. I have the skill set to write, film, edit, and get the job done.

Does anyone else feel this way? Am I crazy for wanting to give up such certainty to freelance in the film industry (hoping to be a doc producer some day), is anyone else beginning to hate the journalist life? I feel so alone in the industry because everyone else has such passion for it, and I feel my passion is fading now that I've proven to myself I can do this, I just don't see a future in it for me. 

TL;DNR  5 years into a tv news career, nearly 10 as a journalist, and I hate it. I'm thinking of switching to documentary production. Feel really alone, like I have no colleagues to talk to about this, anyone else ever feel this way?"

My boyfriend is amazing. We both feel so incredibly lucky to have found each other and easily see ourselves together for the long haul except for... come fall, I'll be going to grad school. We'll have been together 2 years.

It's a field where, arguably, the huge cost is worth it only for the top 10 programs in the country. Well, those programs are difficult to get into, and I did gain acceptance at 1 of them (woo!). Unfortunately, this is pretty game-changing problem for our relationship: 

1. It's a solid 2 years apart. You do internships over summer/winter holidays that directly affect your career success. At best I'd hope to land the summer internship near him.
2. This particular program is located in a small town, over 15 hours drive away and also 3 hours from the nearest airport. Seeing each other would be extremely difficult and infrequent.
3. I can't ask my SO to come with me, there are no real opportunities there for his line of work (small town). It'd kill his career. 

Romantically speaking, I'd hold on to this man forever. Logically speaking, I don't think it's realistic to survive the 2 years apart if we can barely see each other in person. We currently see each other every day, sleep together every night (informally living together) so it'd be a huge change. While I'd be busy and engaged with school and meeting new friends, I'm afraid he'd feel it acutely and be unhappy. 

To complicate matters, I have acceptance at my ""safety"" school, in the same city that we live in... but it's ranked much lower, around 30th. I've always been raised to put school/ambition first, it would also be hard for my family to understand. I do feel pressure to do right by them. Before I met him, I know I'd feel silly making such a huge sacrifice for a boyfriend.

We have held off on discussing this until I knew which schools I gained acceptance at. I guess it's time :/

There will be regret no matter what I do. I'd like to hear:
1) What would YOU do and why?
2) When I talk to my boyfriend about what to do, ideas on how to include and support him? I love him very much, and even if, in the end, I have to do what's right for me -- I want him to feel involved in my decision (because he is!). This is my first serious relationship and I'd ''' any tips from veterans of tough decisions/discussions.


---   
**tl;dr**: He's my big love. Go to the career-changing school or stay local at at a much less competitive school? Can't take him with me, don't think we can survive 2 years apart like this. What would you do in my position, and how should I include him when we discuss the decision?"

21h4go,1,2014-03-26,"I took a chance at letting my voice be heard regarding the recent freakout over Electronic Cigarettes: I called the office of a Senator, and I'm expecting a callback tomorrow. Now, I NEED YOUR HELP!! (Details inside)",[deleted],electronic_cigarette,https://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/21h4go/i_took_a_chance_at_letting_my_voice_be_heard/,"**TL; DR at the end**

[Yesterday's Senate press release](http://goo.gl/T2xIvt) made me mad. Like, really mad. Many false facts were shared, and much fear was spread. As if the [NY Times article](http://goo.gl/UMgwZ5) wasn't bad enough on its own, **the press release cited the NY Times article as a source**.

Uhh, wut? 

Yeah, there's a lot of stupidity to be seen here, we all get that. However, the lack of thorough source citing (I'm assuming because it actually came out of someone's butt) irked me about one sentence in particular: 

&gt;Despite claims from some e-cigarette makers that they do not market their products to children, e-cigarette manufacturers have adopted marketing practices similar to those long used by the tobacco industry to market regular cigarettes to youth – including flavoring their products in candy or fruit flavors that appeal to children, and sponsoring youth-oriented concerts and sporting events in order to market their products to teens.

Yeah, I'm 26 and I like fruit and candy. A lot. So do a lot of other adults. We get it, little kids can be attracted to the yummy smells. But **no responsible adult** is going to leave their juices laying around where kids can get to them, because A) that's just a dumb thing to do, because nicotine obviously = **instant and painful death** (heavy on the sarcasm); and B) being part of the e-cig lifestyle isn't cheap, and we grown-ups want to keep that hard-earned, well-deserved yummy stuff to ourselves. But, that's not the part of the ignorance that bothers me.

My issue lies here: What company, be it big-name tobacco or local B&amp;M shop, would knowingly, willingly, and publicly ""sponsor youth-oriented concerts and sporting events in order to market their products to teens,"" without worrying about the inevitable backlash?

If anyone can cite reliable source(s) to which this quote is referring, please enlighten me. 

So began my quest for the source of that idiotic excerpt. I searched the Senate site for the author(s) of the press release, and that led me absolutely nowhere. Then, I got brave and called the office of the US Senate HELP (Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions) Committee. I got bounced around to a couple of different people before one of them took my name and email and told me he would ""forward my concern to the proper channels"" and [hopefully] get an answer that was met by my satisfaction. 

I figured I'd never get an email response. Surprise surprise, it was an automated response and completely wrong in so many ways, but hey, at least I got an actual name and phone number from it. 

[Here's the ridiculous auto-response.](http://imgur.com/SJmaHOZ)

The wrongdoings:

A) My name is NOT Sarah. Yeah, my name starts with an S, but my name isn't Sarah. Not even close. What a way to look professional, y'all: getting my name incorrect fresh out of the gate. So, strike one. 

B) I'm not exactly sure, because I fail to grasp the ""brilliance"" that is Obamacare, but my Google-fu has led me to believe that ICD-10 has something (if not everything) to do with Obamacare. MY CONCERN HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH OBAMACARE. Strike two. 

C) Joke's on them...I don't work. I have longstanding mental and physical health issues which have temporarily rendered me unable to work. No, I'm not on **any** kind of government assistance program. My boyfriend's non-government job provides a blissfully comfortable lifestyle for him, myself, and our three precious dogs. Strike three.

I called the desk of Emily Schlichting, the ""author"" (ha!) of the obviously-automated response email, and left her a voicemail which lightly addressed the outlines of my concern, and left my callback number. Yeah, she's probably an intern, but IDGAF. I just want *someone* to hear me.

And now we play the waiting game. 

In the meantime, /r/Electronic_Cigarette, I need **YOUR** help. I need sources. Good, legitimate, trustworthy, and factual sources that can be used in my (hopefully) upcoming conversation with Ms. Schlichting regarding the impending regulation of e-cigs and all that they entail. If you think it would be relevant (and beneficial to the cause, because duh) please don't hesitate to share. Any and all are welcome. 

Thank you for your help, and I'm genuinely sorry this post got so long. I tend to be long-winded when I'm passionate about something (and angry at the same time). Obviously, if there are any updates, I'll post the dirty details here.

**TL; DR:** The NY Times and the Senate HELP Committee pissed me off, I made a phone call to their offices and got the runaround, I got a stupid email, I made another phone call, and now I'm nervous as all get-out about the actual conversation to be had. And now I need your help. 

**Funny TL; DR:** A fire-breathing dragon taught my dogs how to do the Macarena, and then we all went roller skating.

Have you, or someone you know, at any point felt like a failure in your job? I'm still in school right now, and during my internship, I felt like I just wasn't able to churn out any useful work, and now that I'm back studying, I feel like I'm having a much harder time with the material.

21h9mh,5,2014-03-27,Former accountant going back to school for CS full-time. Turning 27 in less than 2 weeks. Excited... but also freaking out a bit. Advice?,mfunktastic,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/21h9mh/former_accountant_going_back_to_school_for_cs/,"Hey all,

So I started taking CS courses at a local community college last year (I took an intro to CS course and a Programming Tools course) and I'm currently enrolled in a Comp Sci 1 class. After this semester is over, I'm hoping that I will be admitted to my local university's CS program as a transfer student, pursuing a second bachelor's full-time. Coincidentally, I lost my job about two months ago, so I guess this decision couldn't come at a better/worse time, depending on how I look at it. I will be taking all the major core courses, but no gen. ed. courses since I already have a bachelor's. If everything works out right and I get good grades, I'd like to pursue a Master's, but I'm open to re-entering the workforce immediately upon graduation as well.

So I guess I'm looking for some advice on how to plan out the next two years, since I haven't set anything in stone yet. I would like to lay a good foundation for myself so that I can make better, more informed choices in two years, when I finish my CS degree.

If I pursue a Master's, what is the best way to go about preparing for it (beyond just good grades) so that I can be competitive at, say, a top 20 program? Research with professors? Academic publishing? How can I pursue / find these kinds of research opportunities with professors?

Or should I focus a lot more on gaining summer internships with local firms and join the workforce after finishing my degree? What would employers say when I apply to internships intended for undergrads, and they see on my resume that I have almost 6 years of professional experience (albeit in accounting, not CS)? Would focusing on internships hurt my chances at getting into a good Master's program if I don't focus as much on research?

For what it's worth, I am very interested in breaking into development for prop trading / high-frequency trading firms, or pentesting / network security. As you can see, these are two completely different areas, and it's basically because I don't know much about what I may like or may not like about them.

Sorry for blasting all these questions. I guess being almost 27 and virtually resetting my career is freaking me out a bit. I studied something I disliked as my first degree (accounting), and I want to get my career change right.

Thanks in advance for your much appreciated help!"
21hbpz,9,2014-03-27,How can I get back into my field after suffering some personal issues and basically being unemployed for 5 years?,[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/21hbpz/how_can_i_get_back_into_my_field_after_suffering/,"The good: I went to a decent college and got a bachelors degree in computer engineering.  I graduated in 2007 and worked for about 2 years afterwards in an entry-level job.  

The bad: In the past I had a lot of personal issues, depression, anxiety, etc.  I started hating going to work and got to the point where I just couldn't do it anymore, and I ended up quitting with nothing lined up.  I had a lot of savings, so I basically just took the next year off being immature, drinking a lot and playing video games.  

After that I had to move back in with my parents because I was running out of money, which made me even more depressed and I fell into a really bad stretch.  After a while I started doing some part-time work in unrelated jobs.. bar-tending, construction, etc... but nothing like an office job.  

I have come a long way since my dark days of the past and now feel like I'm ready to get back into a real job.  The only thing is it has been so long since I have worked in that field and I really don't even remember much from it.  I don't have any relevant experience in the last 5 years I can put on my resume and I'm pretty sure they'll just throw it out immediately.  And I think it's too late to try to do an internship or anything like that.  

Any advice on how I can get back into a real job starting basically from square one?   Thanks.

21hgoh,2,2014-03-27,"Good things are happening - accepted to dream school, working a great job, being a better person!",[deleted],happy,https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/21hgoh/good_things_are_happening_accepted_to_dream/,"So to start, I didn't do so well in high school; I never really put much effort into it, and when college application time came, I began to recognize how fucked I was. I was pretty disheartened when other kids were making the schools I really wanted to go to their safety schools, but I still had hope. Decisions came around, and I didn't get into any of the schools I wanted. There was one school that people said was okay, and it was out of the area so I could maybe get out and see some different sights. Freshman year had only gone by a week or two when I started feeling really bad about myself, like going to this school was a reflection of how stupid I was and how little I tried and how my life was ruined. I stopped talking to the friends I made, and stopped trying to make new ones altogether, and just was in a dark place in my life all around. I felt bad too because other students were talking about how tough this school is and how good it is for learning but I couldn't shake the thought that I had ended up here because I messed up. I didn't seem to fit in with the people here, I hated the area, and I would just stay in my room and look down wherever I went.

Sophomore year came, which meant I didn't have to live with a roommate in the same room anymore, which was great. I had a way of getting around, I had the privacy of my own room, and I started taking more interesting classes especially more geared towards my major. My mom said I should think about applying to transfer, and I laughed at her because my GPA wasn't that great, I wasn't doing much with my life (no internships, work, etc), and I just had a defeatist attitude. Even so, I typed up some application essays and sent off applications to a few schools. 

In the meanwhile, I started wanting to work again in coffee, which is a passion of mine. I'm obsessed with coffee, from brewing at home to different coffee varieties to what kind of water should be used to properly extract a coffee. Again, I was disheartened by the area because I had only found one coffee shop that I felt served decent coffee, and I didn't even like this place that much. But by a stroke of luck, I found another coffee shop a few miles in the other direction that does coffee right in my book, so after visiting for the first time I filled out an application that night. The next morning after class I checked my phone and noticed a missed call and a voicemail, saying this was the shop and they'd like to set up an interview. I met them for two rounds of interviews in the same day, and after a day or two got another call back, saying they were interested in hiring me, they'd pay a little more than I was expecting, and if I could start training immediately.

I've been going through training for the past few days now and I'm loving it, the people are really friendly and share my love for coffee. Even though I'm really introverted and find it hard to connect with people, I feel like I'm getting better as I get to know my fellow workers and leaders and all that. I was in the shop today for a tasting and the manager who hired me said in front of the trainer and the other trainees that they had had really high hopes when they interviewed me, which made me smile. Having worked in coffee before really helps as well, so I'm learning quickly and building a stronger foundation in all the basics and different aspects of the job.

I was lying in bed an hour or two ago trying to plan out my day tomorrow, if I could do anything fun before my shift when I checked my email and saw an email from my dream school saying to check out a Facebook app or something. I clicked it and it said ""congratulations on your acceptance, check out this app"" or something. This sounded weird to me, but I couldn't deny the words ""congratulations"" and ""acceptance"", so after logging into my applicant portal I confirmed that yes, I had been accepted. 

I really haven't had anything to be happy about like this, but thinking about getting into the school I wanted makes me so excited for the future. It makes me reflect on what I've learned the past year and a half about myself, and working somewhere I enjoy makes me think that I'm not just a lazy useless kid. All of this is pretty personal so I don't know if anyone will read it, but yeah I'm too excited to sleep now!"

You know how you said all the cardss I wrote to you were always clustered so it was hard to read. Here let me make it cleaner

Dear Diane

I'm glad things are the way they are

I've never exploded at you. Not once.

But I know the few times I did hurt you deeply.

I apologized, and we made up.

But the last time we saw each other, I had no bad thoughts at all

I only had good intentions for us to get closure

You came, and you were emotionless and unaware how much you hurt me

You didn't apologize

You didn't even talk much. Possibly only muttered 8 sentences at most

You said you came to listen to me

I hope you read that letter I gave you at the end of the closure you said you haven't read one day, and get a real good kick out of yourself

I put my raw thoughts and emotions into that card with a photo of our first date at Knott's Berry Farm 2011 Halloween

I wrote all that I had to pour out at the time with words saying I will always have a soft spot for you, and that in the future if you want, we can start over slowly. I wrote my raw thoughts and emotions

Nothing negative

But I now I no longer want that or you

I've never exploded at you. Not once

And you said you lost respect and love for me?

You say this new guy you met is respectable, and that you're in awe of his authority?

You found someone new

You made love to this someone

And it took you a month to tell me

And I had to take the initiative to call you, because you always texted you were too busy with schoolwork or internship

I told myself I could wait, but I knew you could make the time if you wanted to

At the closure, you said you came to only listen to me, and within the few lines you mustered out

You said ""I'm sorry for being a hypocrite""

That's it?

You dirty human being

You broke up with me, because you said you weren't ready for a commitment, and yet months after we broke. We still talked, made love, and everything felt as if we were still together...but unofficially

And my extended family came to visit America.

Within those 10 days, you created feelings for this someone

You truly are a dirty human being

You couldn't wait 10 days for me?

Or better you, you took this opportunity for a rebound

You held me on your string till you did

And after everything, you still wanted to keep in touch and hang out time to time?

You dirty dirty being

Not going to lie, I was happy during the time, and I thought that's what life's all about

I'm glad things are the way they are, because in the long run this is helping me

Thanks for the wake up call

I'm finally beginning to love and respect myself for once in my continuing life time

I was insecure, but now I am bettering myself

And you know what

If you have the decency to hurt gentle and kind hearted David that everyone knows

You truly don't deserve me

I am David

David the kindest person you knew

David the most understanding person you knew

David the person who would listen to all that you had to say with no judgement

You truly don't deserve me you dirty being

I am glad things are the way they are.

I said that I never once exploded at you

Well here's just this once

You said you can no longer respect, love, and want me?

Well fuck that, because I don't want you either

At first I lusted for you

Then I missed the small things we had

Then I reminisced of the big things you had done to make me feel truly loved

And those were the only times I ever felt loved by you

You unaffectionate bitch

I hope you can make this new guy happy, because if not he sure is going to explode.

Word is that he has anger issues

The thing you think I have

Nasty surprise for you bitch

If you have the decency to hurt me out of all the people you know

You don't deserve me

You know the person I am

Not to be conceited, but let me remind you

I'm the kindest, most understanding person you've ever met

I would always listen to you without judgement, and embrace you for who you were

I made you feel loved

I invested so much time and money into you on driving alone. 

Remember how I would have to drive to Biola University from the valley through the 5 Interstate?

How long did I do that for?

1+ year?

Yeah thought so

You have any idea how tiring that shit is?

No matter what time, there is fucking traffic

And I would spend as much time with you, and start to drive back home at 1 AM

You truly don't deserve me

It's time for me to be bitter and salty

I'm not being resentful, because you found someone new

In reality, I'm actually happy for you

You found someone else who has interest for the person YOU are

I don't ever regret being with you

I definitely learned a lot during and much more after the relationship

You hurt me

You hurt literally the kindest being you know

Enough so to where I was willing to lose my best friend, the person I came emotionally closest through my continuing life

You wanted to hang out and talk time to time

Fuck that

I don't need your shit anymore

I'm beginning to love and respect myself

And if you hurt me, David, out of all the people YOU KNOW

YOU REALLY DON'T DESERVE ME

I don't want you anymore

And you know what

I'm glad you have that toxin, Jessica, in your life

You always did look up to her

That bitch is crazy

I'll admit, she's book smart

Life wise, she's fucking crazy

Trying to fuck her way up the Banana Republic corporate ladder?

What kind of dirty 20 year old girl would sit on a 39 year old?

Oh lord... and if she still has such an influence on you to where I'm sure she talked smack about me, and then you began to resent me...

Well fuck it. You know the person I am

And if you thought differently of me

You really don't deserve me

It's time for you to listen to me

It's time for me to explode this once, because now I love myself so much that I'm defending myself

At the closure all I had was good words, with the only bad being I was disgusted you hooked up with someone new and something else I forgot

You had the decency to reply ""Well, I was disgusted when you slept with that girl""

Wake the fuck up you dirty cunt

You were the one that broke up with me at the time

I was heart broken and lonely

Someone walked into my time for a short time and yeah we had sex

and you know what

I don't regret whatsoever 

You said you were kidding when you made me feel bad for it

Turns out you meant it you dirty skank

I'M GLAD SOMEONE ELSE CAN HAVE INTEREST IN YOU

I'M GLAD YOUR WITH THE TOXIN, JESSICA

I'M GLAD YOU'RE NO LONGER IN MY LIFE, BECAUSE I CAN DO MUCH BETTER 

I sincerely do hope you have a merry life though

I hope you can make perfect love with this new guy

I hope he can appreciate your crooked ass crack

You hurt me so deeply.

I felt defeated

And in the meeting we had

You didn't apologize at all or make yourself aware as to much you did

You selfish little bitch

It's time for me to be bitter and salty now

You don't deserve to interact with the kind and understanding David anymore

You know why?

Because who would want to hurt me?

Like seriously?

You know the person I am

Literally the nicest person with a backbone you know

And you again, have the decency to hurt me?

Well fuck you cunt

Glad you got Jessica still in your life. I hope the toxins of words mist into your head and hopefully one day... you will realize what a shit-storm she truly is.

If not. Boo-hoo. You're not my problem anymore

You said you don't love and respect any longer

I don't need your appreciation you dirty being

However

I do wish you the best

I hope you don't miss me too much

I could care less if you appreciate me or not

I'm sure you do, but it doesn't mean much jack to me anymore

I don't want to talk to you again

I want you to see the direction I'm taking

I'm bettering myself in many aspects

And you know what makes me grin on the inside?

You're taking the short road with your rebound

I took the short road with you

But with that, I had a goal in a way..

I thought to myself, I would rather learn than regret

What I mean is that, I knew I would've regretted that I stopped talking to you for the 3rd time.

First time we didn't talk, then we hooked up at Jessica's failure of a celebration for her promotion fucking her manager for a new position

Second time, I knew this wasn't right so I said we should stop and we did

We started talking again, and for the third time I was thinking of stopping

That is when I had that goal, I would rather learn than regret

And in the end I did learn. I don't regret what we had at all

I was genuinely happy for the time being as were you.

We did all the same things we did as if we were still together

And in that Christmas card you gave me, one line stood out.

You said you would love me no matter what

I don't believe your words you dirty dirty being

I'm beginning to love and respect myself. And I'm lovin it

I don't want you anymore. I don't need you anymore

I don't want anything to do with you anymore

21i19i,9,2014-03-27,[NY Metropolitan area] 25 Y/O starting to invest?,throwinitawayl8er,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/21i19i/ny_metropolitan_area_25_yo_starting_to_invest/,"Hi PF,

I've made a throwaway to give as much information as possible. I am 25 years old and graduated from a private university (no loans) with a degree in Biology. I do not use this degree in my current job.

Job History:
I worked in politics for two years out of college - one year on a senator's campaign staff and another year on a retired airforce general's congressional campaign in a swing state of the 2012 election cycle. After, I became a private investigator for 8 months resulting in the job I have now as a paralegal.

I have a decent skill set. I am handy and good with computers. I can troubleshoot/diagnose, etc. Parents are both computer engineers so I knew how to type a URL at 5 years old. I can proof read and review documents well. Other skills include: public speaking, diagnosing and fixing business inefficiencies, e.g: law firms, political campaigns; messaging and speech writing (akin to propaganda but now known as ""Public Relations"") and the art of persuasion. Point being I am not dumb but I lack direction in individually profiting off of my skills.

Career Objectives: 
Ideally, I wish to do as much good on a society level while making money. I am not materialistic, rather I enjoy experiences and interactions. I plan enrolling in law school in the next 2.

Financial History and Breakdown:
I come from a well off family but I am unsure what investments they have for me, if any. They very kindly pay for my car insurance and cellphone bill. They are always available to help out but seldom do I ask. 

I left home 6 months ago. I lived at my aunts for 5 months rent free and have now moved into a studio with my girlfriend. I pay $650 a month for rent, utilities and cable. 

Breakdown: 
Salary: $409 per week after taxes=$1636 per month.

 I am getting a salary increase April 1st of $400 additional per month and the same on May 1st. 

Current salary: $500 before taxes, $409 after taxes
Expected salary come May 1st: $730 before taxes, $XXX (I don't know calculations exactly).

Expenses:
$650 a month for rent, utilities, cable/internet

$200 a month for food (Estimated) groceries

$160 a month for gas - I bought a used car last year. 2007 honda accord, 70k mi

$400 a month for I have no idea. I waste a lot of money on small stupid things that pile up. It's horrible.

Total: $1410. 


Current Bank Balances:
A citibank regular checking: $440
Maspeth Federal Savings Bank checking: $100

Bad credit history of allowing a secured credit card get maxed and incur $160 in fees. The bank closed the card and subtracted the fees after taking the secured money I deposited (rightly so) - so I'm unsure what to do about that if the balance shows $0. I maxed this card during my three month unpaid paralegal internship that eventually landed me my current job. 

I need to catalog my expenses and expenditures in an effort to curb stupid spending and promote fiscal responsibility. 

My questions are:
1) I get paid weekly and am left with $288 after setting aside bill money. I use $150 as weekly operating money, cigarettes, gas, lunch at work, etc. What should I do with $130 a week or $520 a month? I am interested in investing Vanguards small cap growth ETF I think it is called? I have a friend who invests heavily and he recommended I start with that fund. What are some investments that are short term (2-3 years) but high yield? Is peer to peer lending a viable option for this short desired term?

2) What do I do with that closed secured credit card? It has a $0 balance on it and I have dodged every single phone call. How do I build my credit back up? Do I do another secured credit card?

3) I need some more work clothes which require a suit or at least a dress shirt, tie and dress pants. I want to get high quality long lasting shirts/ties/pants - It is how I roll in this regard. How do I factor purchases like this into my budget?

Please help.",lacyreader,dpdr,https://www.reddit.com/r/dpdr/comments/21i5el/possible_dpdr_possible_virus_please_help/,"I have been feeling very out of it, and foggy brained for about ten days. I know those are unclear symptoms, but it is very hard to describe. I have not noticed much mental decline, but I am semi-working on a paper for an internship, so to be honest I am not required to do too much. But it is as if I cannot see myself clearly in the mirror, or look at anything an truly perceive it. Everything is a little fuzzy and off. I am astounded after I accomplish things.

In addition, I have been getting over a virus that has been going around that makes one feel disoriented and tired - I pushed the limits on recovery for this by going out and going to work. Bad idea, I know, but I got sick of sitting home just because I felt ""a little out of it.""

I am wondering if I could still have the virus, or if dpdr is something that I should look into - and possibly fixing that. 
The symptoms of what I have now feel very much like mono...

Sorry for the scrambled nature of this, I am really not feeling on top of my game - any advice etc. would be appreciated."

My focus through electives is going to be on health, fitness, and sales. I am looking to spend my summer with a company that I can learn the ropes with and spend time understanding the behind the scenes of the supplement industry.

This is without a doubt what I am hoping to do with my career so if anyone knows of something I greatly appreciate it. I am willing to start and do whatever the company needs in order to have this internship. I have extremely proficient computer skills and am a quick learner especially when it comes to anything technology related. 

I know there are many many supplement companies based out of Florida and I am willing to travel or temporarily relocate over the summer if I have to."

When I was a kid, my dad took me to several different places in the world (mostly Western Europe and South-East Asia, but we did venture into Bulgaria and Poland, but not Romania). Now, at 21, I've decided I do not want to live in America anymore, after having seen the rest of the world, I just know I don't belong here. So, I've been thinking and researching places in the world where I want to go, and obviously besides visiting to know for sure, I figured reddit would be a good place to start. 

So, first, I do not know Romanian, but I do speak German and some French, so I'm sure learning another language would be simple enough for me. But, could I expect to get by on English until I'm fully accustomed to the language? Is it really as difficult as everyone says to learn Romanian?

Second, I would plan to finish my education in Romania at the University of Bucharest; I can't seem to find a swath of information about ubi, would it be better to finish my degree in the US, would I need to start off as a freshman (year one)? I'm a computer science student, and I already do freelancing work in my field, would it be possible to get a job in the industry (for example an internship) that pays before I get my degree? 

Third, for an American coming to Romania, how would I obtain the right to work/study(and possibly live permanently) in Romania, and is it difficult to do so?

Fourth, how much could I expect to pay for the basics (living, eating, utilities, etc)? Are there options for student living, and how might those work?

I think that's a good start, and I don't want to laundry list questions; I'm sure you might wonder ""why Romania and why Bucharest"" .. to which I would say, honestly I just had a gut feeling that felt good about Bucharest and wanted to look into it. Pretty much everything I have found is great, the people seem very nice and very much different than Americans... which I am happy about, as I'm not your 'typical' American.

Thanks for the time to read this and answering my questions; I really appreciate it, and really hope this can be possible in my near future :)

P.S. Sorry if this belongs in r/Bucharest... it seems very dead."
21il9b,0,2014-03-27,My (28 f) girlfriend (24 f) of one year just told me that she used to be a stripper.,yeahimightbe,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/21il9b/my_28_f_girlfriend_24_f_of_one_year_just_told_me/,"Like the title says, my girlfriend just admitted to me that she used to be a stripper. It's not so much the fact that she used to strip that bothers me, it's that she kept it from me and lied about it. 

My girlfriend and I are long distance. We met online, met in person a few times, and I asked her to be my girlfriend. I didn't even mean to meet a girl online, it just happened, and we're perfect for each other. I have never met someone I communicate so well with, and communication is a problem I've had in past relationships. I also have never been so compatible with someone. Pretty much everything she is and does is what I love about a person that I want to be in a relationship with. We get along extremely well and never fight, save a few disagreements that we always talk calmly about instead of fighting. We are going to move in together once she is done with grad school and gets a job in her field. 

Anyway. For the past couple months, she's been asking me this question: ""Is there anything I could ever do to make you stop loving me or break up with me?""

I thought she was just being insecure because she (as well as myself) is getting anxious and tired of being so far away from me. She's so loyal and loving, the thought never crossed my mind that she could have been ""fishing"" for something or was suggesting something other than what I thought it was. I would always just laugh and say ""no way!"" She would ask if I was sure, and I always said yes. 

A couple months ago, my girlfriend said she was going to go to her friends' house because they (also a lesbian couple) needed to tell her something. She didn't text me for about an hour, then she texted me explaining that what they needed to tell her was that one of the girls was a stripper. She would tell people that she was a bartender but she was actually stripping. My girlfriend acted really surprised and shocked that they divulged this information to her. She said that she asked her tons of questions and she just couldn't believe it. I was equally as surprised and asked my girlfriend a bunch of questions about her friend. I ended up saying that she can do what she wants but if I was her girlfriend I wouldn't like it. 

Ever since then my girlfriend has been bringing up her stripper friend, talking about things that she learned from her about stripping, the clubs, managers, people she works with, etc. I would always listen with an open mind and I wasn't ever really judgmental of her friend.

So fast forward to yesterday. I was at a coffee shop doing some work and my girlfriend called me. She was sniffling and said she needed to tell me something. She just blurted it out, ""I used to strip"". I was silent for a second and asked her, ""What?!"" She reiterated that she used to strip, before we met. It just happened that we met at the end of the summer and she stopped because her semester had started. She said she hasn't done it since because we became serious because she knew that I wouldn't like it. 

Then I asked about her friend. She told me she lied. She's known, for as long as she's known her friend, that she has stripped. She was the one that got her into it. She's the one that took her to her first audition and told her which clubs were good to work. They worked together sometimes. They even would go to ""amateur nights"" at bars, acting like they'd never pole danced before, and win the contests. 

She told me she had to strip to make money. She had just moved to a new city for school and was on the outs with her family. She wasn't making enough at her part time job and she was taking 15 credits a semester. She was able to strip just on the weekends and make enough money to pay her bills and buy food, etc. without having to ask her family, who she wasn't speaking to at the time. 

She was really upset and scared to tell me. She admitted that's why she has been asking me what she could do to make me break up with her. 

I told her I wasn't going to break up with her, but that I needed to think about what she had just told me. We got off the phone, I packed up my stuff, and I started walking home. 

So many thoughts were running through my head. My girlfriend has been naked in front of strangers. My girlfriend has given private dances to men (and I'm sure women?). My girlfriend has flirted and teased men in strip clubs for money. My girlfriend has pole danced, removed her clothes, and received money for it. My girlfriend has sat on men's laps at their tables with them, getting tips for flirting and acting like she wants them. It was hard to think about and process. 

If you knew my girlfriend in ""real life"", you would never know she has stripped. She's a strong, independent woman, defines herself as a feminist, she's a lesbian, she's extremely intelligent, played collegiate sports in undergrad, has had many professional internships, is kind, gentle, and loving, has great relationships with her friends and family. (Not saying that any of these traits couldn't be had by a stripper though). 

It's difficult to wrap my head around. On one hand, I'm insecure that she's given that attention to so many men/women, even if it was just fake and for money. But I'm more upset that she kept it from me, and lied about it. I hate that she created a false scenario with her friend just to see how I would act.

She told me last night that she did that because she loves me so much, that she wanted to make sure I wouldn't want to leave her when she told me. She wanted to be honest with me but she didn't want me to judge her for what she had to do to make money. She said this is the only lie she has ever told me, the only truth she has omitted. I believe her, but I'm really upset about this whole thing. 

Maybe I just need time to think about it, but I also just don't like the whole idea of it. What should I do? I don't want to break up with her. I'm trying not to judge her for what she did to make money in hard times, but there's a stigma attached to stripping that I'm having a hard time getting over. I don't know what to do. 

tldr; girlfriend of a year kept a secret from me that she used to be a stripper. Don't want to break up with her but don't like it, don't like that she lied. Don't know what to do. "
21ioi9,2,2014-03-27,"I have a horrible tendency to not know what I want. Reddit is the last thing I can think of to ask for comments, opinions, or advice...",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/21ioi9/i_have_a_horrible_tendency_to_not_know_what_i/,"I want to start off by saying that I am always going to do what I think is the right choice by my own decisions. I've been dealing with a lot in my life lately and I haven't known where to turn or who to talk to. I also want to mention that this story involves me being completely unfair to two individuals I care very deeply about. I am a 22 year old male in college right now. 

So starting about a year ago now I met a girl (Girl A) who I thought was the greatest human being I had ever met. She cares about everyone, shares the same values I do, and more importantly embodied everything I could see myself with in the future. She was unattainable, a complete firecracker and so independent. I loved that. She is very involved in her career and is very passionate about everything. I at the very least wanted to be friends with the person, as she radiated happiness and confidence wherever she went. She was abroad for most of the year overseas and I only got to speak with her minimally, a chat here and there over the computer. During this time one of my closest friends (Girl B), and I had started getting much closer than that. I still chatted with Girl A here and there and built up a solid friendship. But back home Girl B and I were spending a lot of time together. I eventually ended up telling Girl B that I didn't want more than friendship, all because in the back of my mind I still thought about Girl A. 

When Girl A returned from abroad that summer I got to see her a couple of times and we became fairly close too. Girl A was back home for about 3 weeks before leaving abroad to participate in a kick-ass internship she earned (far away). Girl B was still pretty ticked at me for wanting to be friends and while Girl A was away she and I talked a ton. I always told her not to consider me as it was her time to have fun and be free (later found out she didn't listen to that advice). But nonetheless we talked all the time. I couldn't believe how close I had gotten after such a short amount of time. It was amazing. Anyway while Girl A was abroad, Girl B and I started being friends again and hanging out a lot. It was all innocent and a great friendship until a faithful drunken night out that resulted in us taking it back to the past again. Girl A knows Girl B and they have similar friends so she would find out about the shenanigans that took place here and there between me and Girl B. It was hard on everyone and I eventually had to decide after a long period ot time who I would want to be with. I eventually chose Girl B and thought everything was good. Wrong, Girl B had also been talking to someone else (which I wasn't mad about as I was doing the same thing), until I had said what I wanted. She continued on with this other guy anyway and I eventually wasn't having any of that so I ended it. 

I still talked to Girl A sometimes and confided in her that I had broken off with Girl B. After a very long time and many conversations Girl A and I started talking again. Eventually after several months we had started dating. I was never happier. I couldn't believe I was with her and it was everything I had expected it to be. The only problem was I lost one of by best and closest friends (Girl B) in the process. I love Girl A so much and we definitely had our struggles here and there as any couple would've. Eventually after a few bigger tiffs we both kind of shut off for about a week. We didn't talk, did't open up, didn't acknowledge the relationship at all. It was extremely frustrating for both sides. This was very frustrating, as in all our relationship was about 6 months (longest for her, second longest for me). I had confided in Girl B about our issues and it was nice to have someone to talk to about it. Even though I know I should've taken my issues straight to my SO at the time. Eventually Girl A and I decided together to break it off as we both were stressing each other out. We left the door open to maybe future endeavors together, because I still love her. 

Only about 4 days (yes ik days..) after our official breakup I was out again with my friends having a good night and got a little too drunk. Girl B and I saw each other and started to talk again and it was a good night. I went home with Girl B and stayed at her place, although nothing happened. Woke up the next morning to all of her roommates and the whole house (Girl A's friends too). They told me they were going to tell her, which my hungover-AF ass already knew and instantly was aware bad things were coming. She stayed with me another night about 2 days later (again nothing occurred) but that looked really bad too obviously.

As predicted Girl A was pissed, mostly that it was with Girl B. And said she never wanted to talk to me again. I dealt with some fire over social media from close friends and I still continued to talk to Girl B. I dug this hole for myself and knew it. It was nice to be friends with Girl B again and all of these old feelings started to come up again. Currently I am talking to Girl B and I can never stop thinking about Girl A (its been about a month). I completely demolished everything I had worked so hard for in such a short period of time. I find myself saying I care deeply about Girl B, which is very true. But I don't think i can move past Girl A. I am strongly considering ending it with Girl B (again). I know that to ask for forgiveness from Girl A is wayyyy too much. But I guess my question for Redditors is:

How can I move past to person I loved and hit it off with so well?
What can I do now?
I strongly think I need to just get out of the situation entirely but form experience can anyone tell me what they might've done?

SideNote: There are A LOT of missing details in here....this is the shortest version of the story without leaving too much out.
Any advice or comments are appreciated, I'm really struggling with how to handle my life right now.

TL;DR - I have been going back and forth between two women that I care deeply for. I don't know how to handle the situation as I am currently with one of them but can't seem to forget about the other. Any advice or comments appreciated."

I'm a 15 year old guy in my third year of highschool. My first two years i was on a really bad school and got bullied a lot and they made my life a hell. In the same time my drunk dad and mother were going to through a really bad divorce. 

After that year i switched highschool but i still didn't feel great. I went to a theraphist and she comfirmd that i have trauma's from my previus school. Then the theraphy session ended and nothing happened next.

I lost touch with my best friend that i have for 10 years and we almost never talk or hang out together and when we do it is really boring. I don't really have other friends. 

I get good enough grades to pass but nothing amazing. I spend all my time behind my computer and i have learned myself how to program (I now can read/write HTML-CSS-Javascript-PHP-Python) and i game.. a lot! I used to do it to exape the horrible reallity i lived in but now i do it even when i don't enjoy the game i just keep going or i go on Reddit.

So here i am, feeling like shit, don't know what to do in life, hating almost every single person in my genaration, hating school, and hating life.. I don't really see a point and i'm pretty lost.

My mom and dad are fighting now for 2 years and it really sucks and they can't even be in one room together.

I go to school and hate every single second. I have a friend (a girl) and she's really awesome and nice and i can always talk to her and i think i'm falling in love but we kinda jokingly talked about that and she said that i'm not her type yada yada. What made me feel like shit. Almost all the girls go for the really asshole guys! 

I have to walk as a intern in a company on friday and i'm skipping tomorow because i feel like total shit. 

I'm really lost and don't have joy in anything. I don't have oppertunities to have really 'intensive' hobby's because i don't have the time. 

Oh yeah, how could i forget.. I was the link between my dad and mom for 6 years, they used me to talk to each other and my dad would tell the most horrible shit about my mother to me and my brother and sister left me and just gone away.

I don't know what to do, i can't talk about how i feel to my mother or dad because they will just be like ""Oh it isn't that serieus""..


I want to give live a try but i don't know how much more of this shit i can take..

I have worked in firm A, small-moderate firm the past summer and loved it. I got to know several team members and co-workers and feel very in-place. The workloads there are challenging and fun. Furthermore I feel that I get the perfect balance of guidance and feedback. I feel that I have a presence here. I can easily have a conversation even with the executives! It takes around an hour to commute each way. Over an hour when there is traffic.

However, there is one offer I need to decide on going or not. Firm B is in the same industry firm A is in, but it's way larger. The pay is 33% higher and have a shorter commute. I will also be collaborating with other co-workers + 2 interns, but I don't feel that I would get the same 'fit' I had from firm A.

[Hi Jason. I'm a huge fan of your writing.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/21j9hp/im_jason_m_lemkin_aka_saastr_ceo_and_cofounder_of/cgdl4qx?context=5)|I look at the Lead Velocity Rate, which I've written about (a while ago). How many people are signing up, coming by, clicking on Contact Me, etc. Even if not many are closing. That's OK.  I can help you close.  But I can't make them come to you out of nowhere.  That's your magic ;)
[Your answers on Quora should be required reading for anyone involved with enterprise software and SaaS startups.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/21j9hp/im_jason_m_lemkin_aka_saastr_ceo_and_cofounder_of/cgdl4qx?context=5)| 
[Now that you're investing, what positive signs do you like to see when talking to the founders of an early-stage SaaS or enterprise software startup? (We're somewhere between ""10 Unaffiliated Customers"" and ""Initial Traction"" of the SaaS company lifecycle.\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/21j9hp/im_jason_m_lemkin_aka_saastr_ceo_and_cofounder_of/cgdl4qx?context=5)| 
[Hi. What impact are the revelations about American Intelligence, PRISM, warrantless (?\) data access, and other spying activities having on American-based SaaS/IaaS/PaaS companies?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/21j9hp/im_jason_m_lemkin_aka_saastr_ceo_and_cofounder_of/cgdkm5x?context=5)|Every SaaS company ends up with 15-20% EU revenues (mainly UK).  Post-PRISM, it's time to serve their data from the UK too.
[What do you think the government needs to do to counteract that damage?  I work for a company in this space and I can say from my seat... it is causing some issues.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/21j9hp/im_jason_m_lemkin_aka_saastr_ceo_and_cofounder_of/cgdkm5x?context=5)|One thing I can say, is everyone probably needs to have a data center or instance or something in the EU now.  Being 100% US based, once you get past say $5m or so in revenues, isn't good enough anymore.
[Hi Jason.  23 year old tech professional here, and huge fan of Saastr.  I'm starting a new job on Monday as a business development rep at a 15 person startup.  Any advice?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/21j9hp/im_jason_m_lemkin_aka_saastr_ceo_and_cofounder_of/cgdk8l9?context=5)|I think this is an amazing opportunity.  Biz Dev is where you will learn how sales actually works.  Just set up the calls, do the qualificaiton, whatever it takes.  But beyond that, learn.  Get to know the reps, try to get to know the VP Sales, and even better, since it's 15 people ... the CEO.
 |Our top rep ever, now VP Sales at a very hot SaaS company, started as our most junior BDR.  He just learned, then got into SMB sales, then Enterprise sales, then managed a team, then several teams.
 |Learn.  :)  
[Jason, love your blog. Thanks for sharing your experiences.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/21j9hp/im_jason_m_lemkin_aka_saastr_ceo_and_cofounder_of/cgdlnb6?context=5)|That's by design.  I'm not THAT smart.  I can't magically tell you if your pre-revenue product is going to rock.  And even if it's great, maybe you'll still never get anyone to use it.
[You don't write much about the very early stage - testing ideas and trying to get to product/market fit. Do you have any advice to share about that? What are some good problems/ideas you'd go after today?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/21j9hp/im_jason_m_lemkin_aka_saastr_ceo_and_cofounder_of/cgdlnb6?context=5)|So I try to stay out of it until you have 10 customers.  At least then, I can help ;)
[Hi Jason How important was Product leadership at EchoSign? Any thoughts on Product being part of Engineering/CTO or the other way around? Any advice how to structure that when you're around $3-4m ARR?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/21j9hp/im_jason_m_lemkin_aka_saastr_ceo_and_cofounder_of/cgdnfpr?context=5)|Oy.  I don't think there is any perfect answer, except one.  If your VP Product hasn't managed engineers, pass.  Maybe your VPE and CTO don't report to the VP Product.  Maybe they do.   Or maybe your VP Product reports to your VPE, sometimes. It's complicated.  What I do know is the model where the VP Product has never managed engineers, at least a small group, or at least indirectly, is a Fail.
[You've written a lot about sales and marketing. Are you planning to write about product management in SaaS companies, how to hire great product leadership? Any learning from your experience at EchoSign on the topic?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/21j9hp/im_jason_m_lemkin_aka_saastr_ceo_and_cofounder_of/cgdqkoo?context=5)|Yes.  Not done with all the revenues stuff yet ;)  But thanks for the nudge and reminder.
[Biggest problem is churn -- we're at 5%+ monthly, average customer check size monthly is $25, so we're talking small businesses / startups mostly.  Customer feedback isn't too helpful--it's generally that people didn't find the product useful or couldn't get the team on board.  Some customers love us and have used us since 2012, others try us and churn pretty quickly.  Product development has never been fast or felt right--we built a simple tool that people liked, but we've perpetually had the problem of not knowing what to build next.  And we build stuff on top of what we have, people are typically lukewarm about it.  I know you can't tell me what to do, but what are the things that you think we should look at to decide whether to keep going, to give up, or where to double down?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/21j9hp/im_jason_m_lemkin_aka_saastr_ceo_and_cofounder_of/cgdlx40?context=5)|First, Churn Is What It Is.  Don't worry about the absolute number.  Ignore the blogs and press here.  Instead, just try to drive it down.  That's the key.  Driving it down.  All web services have a natural churn rate.  Some have a far higher churn than you'd expect.  Especially, when they sell to individuals or very small businesses.  Many are at 5% at the lowest customer sizes.  Not just you.
[Why are so many SaaS companies (like Box, Salesforce, Workday, etc.\) not be profitable? Are the valuations real? Are they not too dependent on ""debt"" and VC's? And does that make it a bubble? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/21j9hp/im_jason_m_lemkin_aka_saastr_ceo_and_cofounder_of/cgdlmkd?context=5)|Look at cash flow, not profits.  If you close a 3 year deal and get the cash flow upfront, in SaaS, you still have to spread the revenue out over 3 years ;)
 |Salesforce went cash-flow positive far earlier than it went GAAP ""profitable"".
 |Same will happen with Box, etc.  (even though Box is hardly cash flow positive now!)
 |Box is spending now to grow &gt; 100% at $200m ARR which is Epic.  And exactly what I would do.
[Hi Jason, huge Saastr fan. We're just starting out, have 6 customers with 200k ACV, so doing ok, but we worry that our product might be too high end and our market limited. Generically speaking, would you suggest hitting it out of the park with our early customers and others like them, or testing the broader waters as soon as possible to see if we need to 'dumb down' the offering/price/etc?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/21j9hp/im_jason_m_lemkin_aka_saastr_ceo_and_cofounder_of/cgdlfhf?context=5)|I recommend NOT dumbing down the product for at least 1-2 years.
 |Here's the thing.  No one has heard of you.  You only have 6 customers.  You have no mini-brand, no nothing.
 |And yet ... you already have 200k ACV.  Awesome!
 |Just get another 6, and another 6.  Just get to 60, or 10x.  Then you'll really have something.  A $2m business and true Initial Traction.
 |Your market is almost always larger than it looks.  It has to be.  Because no one has ever heard of you at this stage.  There are always more customers.
[I'm building a SaaS platform for a female segment. I struggle with finding people of note, i.e. investors, that can relate to a platform that is targeted to females that ""get it"". How can I change my delivery to show them the opportunity and paint an accurate picture? Lead with the numbers? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/21j9hp/im_jason_m_lemkin_aka_saastr_ceo_and_cofounder_of/cgdl4zg?context=5)|Hmmm ...
 |Well, first let's ignore sexism and all that.  It's there, and it's real.  But I'm not sure that's really the issue (although it may be).
 |I think numbers are all that really matter.  SaaS is about recurring revenue.  If you don't have recurring revenue yet, then any revenue.  If no revenue, then any signs of traction in users, etc.
 |Most SaaS investors these days are NOT investing in concepts, or slides, or beta products with no users UNLESS the team is already proven.
 |I think the real answer is you may need to show more progress.
 |Personally, I don't care what anyone's product does .. not really ...as long as it's in an interesting space (with good multiples) and a great team.
[How do you explain huge sales &amp; marketing expenses of most SaaS companies? In particular, why Box has to spend so much on sales&amp;marketing?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/21j9hp/im_jason_m_lemkin_aka_saastr_ceo_and_cofounder_of/cgdkveh?context=5)|Box is spending about $1.25 or $1.50 or so in sales and marketing expense to acquire a customer worth $1.00 per year.  And to grow even faster (&gt; 100% at $200m+ ARR), that ends up consuming a fair amount of capital, because while you get that cash over 5 years, the expense is incurred up front.
[How do you smooth things over with an important customer when the champion is being unreasonable and disrespectful to your staff? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/21j9hp/im_jason_m_lemkin_aka_saastr_ceo_and_cofounder_of/cgdkp7w?context=5)|It's happened to me.  In fact, I almost let one of out 5 most important customers go right before we EchoSigned the deal because I felt they were being so rude and disrespectful.
 |What did I do?  I handed it over to my VP Sales to close.  He closed it.
 |They were happy.  They are still a $500k+ a year customer today.  And they love EchoSign, and EchoSign loves them.
 |So ... don't take it personally.  And once you do, hand it off to someone that doesn't take it personally ;)
[Thanks for all the awesome content on SaaStr!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/21j9hp/im_jason_m_lemkin_aka_saastr_ceo_and_cofounder_of/cgdkoos?context=5)|Boy that's a broad question. My broad answer is that today -- we are blessed.  There is a probably a tool to do almost anything. Back in the day, we had to build our own billing services, our own email delivery services, our own imaging services, our own hosting, etc. etc.  Today everything is available as a service. But I would basically do anything that improves productivity.  Something to automate your lead funnel (Marketo, Hubspot, Eloqua, ACT On etc.)  For 100% sure, something like Intercom and Zendesk and others to automate interactions with your customers.  Tools like ToutApp so that you can see how your prospects interact with your team, and to manage the communications.  Use it all. And use something like EchoSign to get the deal signed on the spot! ;)
[Aside from Salesforce, what software (SaaS, maybe\) should SaaS companies leverage to help scale their business? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/21j9hp/im_jason_m_lemkin_aka_saastr_ceo_and_cofounder_of/cgdkoos?context=5)| 
[Hi Jason, big fan of SaaStr. Your advice has been instrumental to my SaaS Thinking. Thank you!  I launched my company (single founder/1 man band\) just before Christmas. ACV per customer - $1,200. 37 customers. 0 churn. Practically all customers have been acquired through hustle, outbound email and referrals.  The thing is, it's kind of exhausting. It takes about 30 mins of webinar and 1hr of prep &amp; follow up to acquire a customer. I do about 3 webinars a day.  Question - How do you scale up with such a low ACV. I can't hand hold everyone who walks through the door. How have your companies like Pipedrive managed to do it? I feel like I am on a death march to 100+ customers. It's working but very inefficient. Do you even care about CAC at this stage?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/21j9hp/im_jason_m_lemkin_aka_saastr_ceo_and_cofounder_of/cgdni21?context=5)|Uh ... you have $40,000 in ACV already?  Dude, raise another $500k in seed money (maybe I can invest), and hire 2 sales reps with at least 18 months of experience.  They know what to do.  And your CAC is zero, if I understand right.  Don't sweat it.
[What are your thoughts on ""per seat"" software licensing model? Is there a chance that it will ever go mainstream? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/21j9hp/im_jason_m_lemkin_aka_saastr_ceo_and_cofounder_of/cgdocmb?context=5)|I think it's pretty mainstream.  Salesforce, Workday, and pretty much most SaaS players charge that way.  Adobe has moved primarily to per-seat pricing now, as has Intuit.  Etc. etc.
[In regards to customer acquisition, what do you find are the most successful mechanisms for driving customers and sales in SaaS? Looking back at your initial launches which things have you replicated for future launches and which have you said let's not waste time on that tool?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/21j9hp/im_jason_m_lemkin_aka_saastr_ceo_and_cofounder_of/cgdlgge?context=5)|The best thing you can do is make your Existing Customers Successful.  Over invest in Customer Success.  Even if you only have 10, 20, 100 customers.  Word-of-mouth and brand ultimately are the source of all great cos. new customers.  It does take time though.  A long time.  But start today.
 |Always investing in sales reps as soon as there 30-50 leads a day, always works.  Always investing in customer success as soon as you have say $10k in MRR always works.  Always investing in your funnel, in demand management (if not generation) always works as soon as you are at $20k-$30k in MRR.
[What was the first company you invested in? How well did your investment pay off?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/21j9hp/im_jason_m_lemkin_aka_saastr_ceo_and_cofounder_of/cgdk9an?context=5)|So far, I have made absolutely no money as an investor -- except  investing in my own companies.  Everything I have done as an entrepreneur has made money.  My personal $$$ into EchoSign returned about 10x.  Also two companies I personally invested in, in the past 24 months, will soon have nice exits.  It's not at all clear how good I will be ;)
[Excellent blog, read all of it. It's nearing end of calendar Q1 and I just had a six figure ACV deal put on hold by the owners at a mid-sized co. because they ""can't afford it right now"" even though we'd arranged for funding. My champion was as disappointed to find out as I was and they sprung it on him. He's on contract to implement something but they've put the project on hold so he may not stick around. Any suggestions for the right way to potentially approach ownership (who do for the record have active roles\) and try to save the deal? More broadly the question is, what's the right way to go above the champions head?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/21j9hp/im_jason_m_lemkin_aka_saastr_ceo_and_cofounder_of/cgdl85v?context=5)|Beyond that, all I can tell you is sales cycles are what they are.  Not too long ago, Adobe closed a customer I had brought in as a prospect -- 7 years ago!  Obviously an extreme case.  But if you're going big, and going long ... try to chill.  If it closes next quarter, it doesn't really matter.  And you don't want to break it.  Really, I am not 100% sure this deal was as solid as you thought it was ...
[Can you elaborate more on your background in Nanotech? Seems like you were way ahead of the field at the time. What made you decide to get into SaaS? Do you do anything in Nanotech/invest or follow the field anymore at all?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/21j9hp/im_jason_m_lemkin_aka_saastr_ceo_and_cofounder_of/cgdlhxp?context=5)|I've often been way ahead.  That gives you a headstart when you aren't THAT smart.  E.g., SaaS entrepreneurs today are about 10x better than I was back in '05/'05 when starting EchoSign ;) The quick background is a prior company I was working at was going bankrupt.  I couldn't accept that or quit.  So I grabbed the lead engineer on this nanobattery project which was just a tiny lab experiment ... we bought the rights to that technology ... and built a company around it.  And sold it for $50 million 12.5 months later.  She knew the tech.  I just saw where the market was growing, got the customers on board, and built the rest of the team.
[Any advice for someone trying to do something in nanotech today?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/21j9hp/im_jason_m_lemkin_aka_saastr_ceo_and_cofounder_of/cgdmcrq?context=5)|That there's no such thing as nanotech per se.  It's a description of materials/science/technology used in various spaces, but not really a space itself.
[Hello!  What is the hardest part of scaling a SaaS? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/21j9hp/im_jason_m_lemkin_aka_saastr_ceo_and_cofounder_of/cgdk9yq?context=5)|There are two hardest parts ;)
 |The hardest part, compared to All the People That Try to Do Start-Ups, is to Get 10 Unaffiliated Customers.  10 that aren't your friends, family, ex-boss, ex-coworker, etc.
 |Because if you think about it, no one of us need any more paid web services for business.  More games are fun.  But do any of us really need another accounting system? ;)
 |Assuming you get 10 though, then the hard put is being strong enough, committed enough, to get to about $1.5m-$2m in revenue.  Because 10 is never enough to pay the rent.  That's the hardest time in the end, once you've done the Impossible.
[Being a start-up founder is all consuming, what are your tips for keeping a happy home life and/or living with a founder deep in the throes of start-up land?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/21j9hp/im_jason_m_lemkin_aka_saastr_ceo_and_cofounder_of/cgdlm5t?context=5)|Give up looking for balance per se. I mean, if you want to build Something Big, Something That Matters, it will be all consuming. So what can you do? The key here is Great Co-Founders.  They take the load off. If you don't have a great co-founder, go find one.  It's the only answer.  And you can find one now.  It's not too late.  It doesn't have to be on Day 0.
[Who is the meanest person you have ever met?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/21j9hp/im_jason_m_lemkin_aka_saastr_ceo_and_cofounder_of/cgdkgbc?context=5)|One thing I can say, is that so, so many people told me how stupid, or at least, Very Small, EchoSign was for so many years.
 |I'd like to think I have a thick skin.  But it did weigh on me a bit.
 |Only now, after 9+ years, is the space large enough that people realize it's Obviously Large and important.  And not some tiny little thing that doesn't matter.
[I am sure you are away of the money that DocuSign just raised. Thoughts? Do you think they are burning through cash too quickly?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/21j9hp/im_jason_m_lemkin_aka_saastr_ceo_and_cofounder_of/cgdmzm9?context=5)|Honestly, I think they are basically doing all the right things from a structural perspective.  If I were Keith Krach (who I am friends with and have only positive things to say about), I'd do just what he is doing.  I ran a more capital-efficient ship back in the day, that's for sure.  We were cash-flow positive once we hit $4m ARR.  But if I were running either EchoSign stand-alone today, or DocuSign today, given all the capital available for late-stage SaaS companies ... I'd be spending all that money to Grow Even Faster, to Get the Incremental Customer.  My thoughts in general here: [Link to saastr.com](http://saastr.com/2013/04/11/why-youll-want-to-raise-1000-for-your-saas-start-up-the-incremental-customer/)
[Hi Jason, I am a huge fan, we met briefly at the Pulse conference.  A. You wrote about vertical CRMs recently, we built one at Link to keyb.co with a kernel model, so that it can be rapidly customized and extended for a given vertical.  What are the most attractive vertical CRM segments for the future?  We are starting with international schools and SaaS companies, since there is nothing that combines CRM + Zuora + SaaS Optics + Quickbooks in one solution.  B. Using the SaaS universe as a market, what would you say is the addressable market size in terms of companies? And what pricing model would you recommend (% of ARR like Zuora or a flat subscription fee\)?  C. Do you expect SaaS growth in Europe and Asia to accelerate in the future? And do you believe that local incumbents that move early can build a sustainable business (i.e. the Rocket Internet model but for SaaS\)?  For example, in Asia e-signatures have not taken off because in many markets (HK, Taiwan, Mainland China\), there is a huge reliance on chops, which are not supported in any commercial SaaS e-signature product.  D. As you described in many prior answers, SaaS companies at-scale have become incredibly capital intensive in order to fund growth, but in the longer-term do you think there's a better way, where you would have just owned Echosign forever using the cashflows to fund future businesses and new products?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/21j9hp/im_jason_m_lemkin_aka_saastr_ceo_and_cofounder_of/cgdnyvv?context=5)|SaaS doesn't HAVE to be capital intensive.  We got cash-flow positive at EchoSign at $4m ARR and I could have grown the company stand-alone to day to say $40m-$50m ARR without any more venture capital.  But with more VC we could have gotten to $70-$80m in ARR today.  Compare and contrast ...
[We have a SaaS startup with 15 customers and an ASP of $10k ARR. Our customers include some of the most notable mid market ""growth"" companies in the world.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/21j9hp/im_jason_m_lemkin_aka_saastr_ceo_and_cofounder_of/cgdlkog?context=5)|Your product is a lot more valuable than you think.  Probably.  Or you wouldn't have those customers. It's OK if right now you aren't 100% sure it's mission critical.  Your product will get better, year after year, release after release. You may not have cured cancer.  But I think you've added real value to the enterprise. Get to 100 customers.  Whatever it takes.  You'll see. It's worth it. EchoSign was a pretty crappy (albeit cool) product in '06.  Today it's an an amazing Enterprise-grade product. Double down on what works and don't sweat the existential stuff today.
[Our main problem is that our solution is seen as a nice to have or low priority app to our customers. They love us and they love our product but they aren't able to prioritize our piece or capture the right amount of budget for it.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/21j9hp/im_jason_m_lemkin_aka_saastr_ceo_and_cofounder_of/cgdlkog?context=5)| 
[We believe in our teams ability to build, market and sell great software, but are worried that we haven't built for a meaningful business problem. We have some other ideas on where to pivot the solution and even some early customers who are willing to ""co-innovate"" with us... If you were us would you pivot to a completely new space with much bigger market potential?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/21j9hp/im_jason_m_lemkin_aka_saastr_ceo_and_cofounder_of/cgdlkog?context=5)| 
[Hi Jason Was there a time you considered pivoting your product and your business? Also, how important was Product to EchoSign's success?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/21j9hp/im_jason_m_lemkin_aka_saastr_ceo_and_cofounder_of/cgdmfbs?context=5)|Everyone pivots, at least soft pivots.  Buffer just wrote about how they soft-pivoted to businesses (over consumers) around $1m in ARR.  We basically did the same.  We started off as a freemium business (like Box).  It became clear that wasn't big enough, so we tilted upmarket.  We ended up with 40% of revenues enterprise, 40% medium sized businesses and groups in enterprises, and 20% freemium and very small businesses.  A lot of web services end up with somewhat similar ratios, e.g. WebEx and others. In terms of product, that was always our saving grace.  Our customers loved the product, even if it was feature poor for a long time.
[Hi Jason- What do you think of the companies that are selling to SaaS vendors to help them manage the unique business challenges that their subscription business' have?  Companies like Gainsight, Intercom, Zuora, etc. ARE ALL doing great and are on the bleeding edge of offering services for the subscription economy. Do you think there is room for more?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/21j9hp/im_jason_m_lemkin_aka_saastr_ceo_and_cofounder_of/cgdopge?context=5)|In general, I think there are room for a ton more vendors.  Yes, there are  only so many products SaaS vendors can buy from other SaaS vendors.  But overall, we are just in The Second Inning of the shift of CIO budgets to SaaS.  Every market is 5-10x bigger than it was just a few years ago. Salesforce is now doing $5 billion in revenue, on way to $10 billion.  Just a few years ago, they were convinced CRM was only a $1 billion market.  So there is room for far more vendors.  But -- the bar is much higher today.  The products are much better, the teams are much stronger.  So the days of cr*p SaaS products are kind of over.
[Would you say these are much more like solution sales where the ACV is $100k+ since Gainsight and others have gotten significant ARR with very few customers? And lastly do you think there is a path towards more integrated solutions vs. patching together Zuora + Salesforce + QB?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/21j9hp/im_jason_m_lemkin_aka_saastr_ceo_and_cofounder_of/cgdp0vv?context=5)|Well, it is easier to build an enterprise business with $50k and $100k customers than $5k ones.  Just plain math.  It's what I'd probably do if I did another SaaS start-up (because I can sell at this price point, I know how).  More integration?  hmmm ... I don't think so.  Because the individual vendors are getting richer and richer and stronger and stronger.  I think we will see less integration. Salesforce isn't adding much to CRM, instead it's adding to Marketing Cloud.  It's ""too late"" for Salesforce to build a Zuora.  Soon, it will be too late to build a Gainsight ... the products just get too feature rich and sophisticated ... 
[Why did you leave Adobe?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/21j9hp/im_jason_m_lemkin_aka_saastr_ceo_and_cofounder_of/cgdmpa8?context=5)|I needed to put EchoSign on the post-acquisition track it is on today, so it could thrive after the acquisition.  And not die like most acquisitions do.  If you compare EchoSign to most acquisitions like it, most died, at most SaaS acquirers.
 |I accomplished that, and feel good about it, and that that was my mission and job.  I stayed until EchoSign would clearly be the success inside of Adobe that it has become, as the fastest growing property in Adobe, and one of the 4 growth areas outlined for '14.  That was enough for me, and then I transitioned out. Of course, if they'd really wanted to keep me after that ... maybe a somewhat more logical retention plan would have helped ... 
[Do you recommend young business professionals in SaaS get their MBA?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/21j9hp/im_jason_m_lemkin_aka_saastr_ceo_and_cofounder_of/cgdnd9c?context=5)|No.  I only hired one MBA, and that was because she was an intern getting her MBA.  I see no positives for an MBA, except much later ($50-$100M+ ARR) when there's a lot of quant analysis going on.
 |I say get the MBA of life and go get a job at a SaaS company, learn more, get promoted, figure it out, and do you own ;)

There are many I am impressed by, but the thing is, I'm not sure I'm good enough or the proper fit to have founded them.  E.g., OpenDNS or New Relic are amazing companies.  But I don't have the skills there.
 |What I do wish is that I hadn't sold.  It's not because EchoSign hasn't thrived under Adobe.  It has.  Adobe has done an amazing job and the business has grown over 4x.
 |It's just I wish I was still running my own company.  Maybe today we'd be doing say $60m ARR standalone (we wouldn't have had the Adobe boost). Still pretty awesome.
 |That would be great.
[Occasionally, when looking at an existing market, you'll see products with abysmal user experiences.  Do you think improving upon UX is enough to take market share from an older/larger incumbent?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/21j9hp/im_jason_m_lemkin_aka_saastr_ceo_and_cofounder_of/cgdo2lt?context=5)|I think it's the wrong way to think about, which is why the question is confusing ;)  To take market share, you have to be 10x better than the incumbent ... because no one has ever heard of you ... and b/c they trust the incumbent.  You and I can build something 3% better than DropBox, maybe ... but no one will use it.
 |So what is 10x better?  10x cheaper, maybe.  Maybe the paradigm changes, and a Mobile CRM becomes 10x better than Salesforce.  But just making a slicker user experience usually -- usually -- isn't 10x better.  Unless the old UX is Siebel ...

That's natural.  See, e.g., the PayPal guys.  You either feel like Hugo, or a Used Car Salesman ...

I am a big fan of Apttus and the co-founders (we got started at the same time, and launched basically at the same time) -- they are on the IPO path on top of Force.  Also, ServiceMax is on the IPO path on top of Force.  (Marketo is not built on Force, it just connects to Salesforce).  Beyond that, broadly defined, the Force.com platform is a $1 billion business for Salesforce now. Having said all that, if your app doesn't look and act like Salesforce, more or less, and there's no business reason to align with Salesforce the company ... it's not likely Force.com will be your #1 technology platform choice today.  It's pretty expensive as a % of revenue if it doesn't drive you leads (as it has for Apttus, ServiceMax, etc.)

The larger the deals, the lower the % (and the higher the quota).  The real key here is to not pay too much to folks that don't close.

 |But, ultimately -- It Doesn't Matter.  If you delight your customers and keep them happy, they will all renew.  Also, they will have no choice if they are dependent on you.
 |Once we were past $4m in ARR or so, I stopped worrying about this stuff.  We had such a high renewal rate, and 120% net renewals from an ARR perspective (negative net churn) ... just let the customers do what they want. A bigger discount if you pay for 3 years for sure.  But Whatever Works.

I've tried to figure out what to expect in terms of base salary, but there isn't any salary information online for this particular company and I think general numbers for a software engineer are being inflated by the larger companies in the area. (IBM, Raytheon, Microsoft, etc.) This company is on the smaller side. (maybe 50-60 employees internationally?) 

I'm just graduating and my GPA isn't great, but I have two years of employment as a programmer, two internships (including one with this company), and all of my supervisors have given great reviews of my work.

Been struggling a lot with finding out with education I should go for and time is running out for university applications. Maybe you have some tips for me?



About me:




19 years old (turning 20 this year). Born in Sweden, studied natural science (physics, chemistry, biology - didn't enjoy any of them, general subjects like languages, some history, some economics, some social science, a lot of programming - which I like but not want to focus full-time on) in high school with decent grades, was good in math before and played chess for 10 years but grades started to decrease in the last years. Got an interest in what's happening in the society and how things are moving. Very interested in the IT industry (reading daily about start-ups and had thoughts about starting up my own, would need some more confidence though). Also very into gaming (and esports), but don't want to get stuck just working with games. After doing high school in Sweden I went to Ireland working as a games quality assurance tester for 4 months. After that I got an internship at the games department of Red Bull HQ in Austria where I'm staying since November and probably till August. I think I have figured out I wanna go for a project manager/product manager kind of role in the IT industry, but there is so many ways to get there. I also dream about going for an even higher role, above all of these mid-manager people. (Co-)Founding my own company. Traits I think would be interesting to have professionally:


* a technical understanding (be able to work with and understand programmers etc, I think I have a bit of this but could maybe increase it)
* branding/marketing understanding (the Red Bull brand is very inspiring here)
* handle budget/understanding of economics
leadership skills (guess this is something that I don't have to learn theoretically but more practically)
* thinking and working on a global scale
* work somewhat creative (not just number cruncher for example)




Till now I've been looking at something like Industrial engineering or International Business.




I speak Swedish, English and semi-OK German. I'm not so interesting in studying in Sweden, been looking abroad. A bit on The Netherlands, but I'm very open-minded.




Got any ideas? Programmes, schools or other sites/subreddits where I can find out more are appreciated."

I've sent e-mail inquiries about my applications to several companies, and still no responses. This along with my several attempts at starting projects that end in utter failure has led me to realize I'm actually very bad at programming.

I did an unpaid internship last summer, and it turned out to be a rather bad internship with a manager who didn't know anything, and other frustrated co-workers. I felt I learned very little.

I don't want to entirely blame my professors because there are great programmers among my peers, and I know I really just lack self-discipline when it comes to self-learning and solo projects.

EDIT: Forgot to mention. A friend of mine is who has a paid internship doing Software QA wants to recommend me for a similar position in that company. Still waiting on news from him, but how do you guys feel about Software QA Internships? I know anything is good at this point, but I'm curious.

21kgos,316,2014-03-28,First web development internship.. one week in and I'm feeling like a fraud.,LalienX,webdev,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/21kgos/first_web_development_internship_one_week_in_and/,"Back in August, I made the decision to pursue the web development field and it has been one helluva ride. I've learned very basic PHP and MySQL (enough to put info in a database and pull it out) and intermediate HTML, CSS and JavaScript / jQuery. I have always tried to balance out my skills so I never really became good at anything. 

I put together a resume and a very lightweight flash card php application and I started applying to jobs while going to school and working my day job at a hotel. I finally got an interview, so I brought my laptop to the interview... The interviewer didn't even look at it and gave me a piece of paper. 

It was 6 small squares placed around a very large square on one half and there was a JSON call on the other half that I had to complete. 
I had to add jquery functionality to where if I clicked on a square, then the big square would change to the color of that square.

I passed the test, but I coded that thing so horribly that it wasn't even funny. The code was all over the place, but I still got the internship. The man who gave me the test said that I had a lot to learn and I was given an offer right on the spot. I agreed to a 3-month, full-time, $15 an hour internship with a possibility of becoming permanent. And I must say, I want that permanent spot almost as much as I want to breathe. 

They wanted me to be a HTML, CSS and JavaScript/JQuery developer.

I came into the workplace excited and ready to learn a lot. It took 3 days to get me in the system and get my computer. I looked at the project that they are working on and the first thing that came out of my mouth was, ""You think I can actually help you guys with this?"". The code was insane. Everything was so abstracted to the point that it wasn't even jQuery anymore. The lead developer has made several libraries and whenever he describes something to me, he uses so many words that I cannot understand. 

I have never felt so stupid and inexperienced and I know that this is what an internship is all about--- learning from the best. But I run into the office everyday acting like fish food because I am frantically studying and trying to get up to their level thinking that I can close the gap between my 8 months of coding to their 10+. 

Do you guys have any resources for me to get better? Which blogs should I follow? What books should I read? How can I keep up with the trends? How can I get a better understanding of HTML5, CSS3 &amp; JavaScript/jQuery. I know that I need to master these, but I'm not sure what I should master about it. I'm hungry for this job.

21kiud,1,2014-03-28,"If you'd indulge me for a moment, here is a list of clarifications about the finale (Because I saw quite a bit of confusion in the comments.)",[deleted],KillLaKill,https://www.reddit.com/r/KillLaKill/comments/21kiud/if_youd_indulge_me_for_a_moment_here_is_a_list_of/,"1. No, Junketsu has no will or personality of its own. It has no voice, personal opinions, or independent impact on the story whatsoever. If you really need a background for it, let's assume that Ragyo made it as a prototype for Shinra Koketsu, and Soichiro and Satsuki later just adapted to it as a baseline for Senketsu and the Goku Uniforms.

2. Rei is Ragyo's stoical secretary and bodyguard. She has nothing going on beyond that. If you need a background for her, here's what I got: She was a rich girl college student doing internship work while studying for her Fashion Management and Marketing Master's Degree, and one day Ragyo decided her ass looked good enough in booty shorts to be allowed to be seen walking next to her. When she snooped on the boss lady's folders and found out about the OLF, she was immediately cool with it due to a childhood spent playing violent sci-fi games that gave her the option to play as the evil aliens, which she always without fail took (I can guarantee this is more thought than anyone else has ever put into her character, especially the Trigger staff) She's unaccounted for after the battle though, so maybe they'll do something substantial with her later , but I doubt it. (On that note, no other character is given any last minute backstory twists or sudden depth either, nor are any previously unknown blood relations revealed, nor is anyone really Isshin in disguised, the characters are all just the same as who they were last week.)

3. Yes, everyone besides Ryuuko was basically useless in this fight. Satsuki was disarmed literally as soon as she made a move to attack, and when Ryuuko loaned her a blade, the much anticipated ""Sister Scissor Combo"" was shown to have no effect a good seven seconds after they pulled it off, on a depowered target no less. The Elite Four still can't fully fight off fucking clones, and Nudist Beach was only effective in disabling the transmitter, for all the good that did anyone. Then we go into low orbit , and it becomes full-on DBZ, and Matoi is Goku and Gohan combined.

4. Yes, Senketsu ingesting Life Fibers actually had an concrete effect. Specifically, it improved his ability to control more Life Fibers down the line, and after he ate enough of them mixed with human blood, he could communicate with humans besides Ryuuko (episode 5 staring match with Tsumugu is implicitly confirmed to be a premature manifestation of this ability that he temporarily tapped into out of desperation)

5. No, Gamako is not official. The last we see of them together, Gamagoori is spying on Mako's girls' night out with the Kiryuuin sisters from a back alley like a SO. It's been telegraphed from ep 19 at the latest that Ira is hot for Mankanshoku, but love is a two-way street, and Mako is walking on the other side of the road if her begging Ryuuko for a date (very emphatically might I add) is any indication, and would you look at that, Ryuuko actually indulges her. Yes, Mako mourned when Ira appeared to die for her, and was happy when she saw he was okay, but that's basic fucking human empathy, not romantic tension. (Please excuse me if I sound like I'm bashing this ship, I actually do really like it, but I just can't take all the people tooting their horns and shouting ""confirmed as canon!"" based on the actions of just one half of the pair, it's kind of Triggering my Zutara PTSD, and I do not need a remission like that after all these years)

6. For the last time, Yes, Nui is Ragyo's daughter. I genuinely don't understand how anyone could not get this after ep 20, but apparently there are some ijits still not a hundred percent comprehending this detail. Nui calls Ragyo ""mommy"" in French, and Ragyo calls Nui her ""dutiful daughter"" when they rebuild Koketsu together., that's that.

It's late, I'm having trouble thinking of other stuff, and likely no one's really gonna turn to this for meaningful answers anyway, so I'll sign off for now. Let me know below if there are other details you want straightened out."
21kjrw,1,2014-03-28,Stuck between two Schools for ChemE undergrad. Help please!,[deleted],ChemicalEngineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChemicalEngineering/comments/21kjrw/stuck_between_two_schools_for_cheme_undergrad/,"Hello, so I have the choice of 
A: attending the large state university with a very nice engineering program and plenty of money coming in for renovations, etc. Also nice ties to Exxon and BP

B: attending a small-medium college known for engineering, but not very reputable when it comes to chemE specifically. Although, nice engineering companies like 3M and BASF are located in the city.

I'm having trouble committing mainly because of two concerns:
1) Will going to College B hurt my chances of getting a job elsewhere other than the city it is in since its not very reputable compared to college A? 
2)I  have the chance to play college soccer at College B, but I'm really worried playing soccer and majoring in chemE will be way too much to handle. Would it be possible to have a good chance at finding a job right after graduating if I did not have time to gather experience from internships because of soccer?

Any help would be appreciated, thank you!"
21kkbu,2,2014-03-28,Will be facing a hair and urine test in the near future--need some advice.,[deleted],trees,https://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/21kkbu/will_be_facing_a_hair_and_urine_test_in_the_near/,"Hey everyone! 

I just accepted an internship offer that requires both a hair and urine drug screening. I have already done my fair share of research regarding hair testing, and plan to clean myself up using the Jerry G method as much as possible up until the test.

Because this internship is not in the state I am currently in, I'm not sure if they are going to wait until I am there to test me or send me to a lab at my location. I'm still not 100% sure when this test will be, but once they give me the location, I have four days to report.

Within the past month, I have smoked probably between ten and fifteen times, and only once did I smoke more than a bowl or two to myself. I have not smoked at all in the past two weeks, since receiving the internship offer. In the past, I was a much more active smoker, but have lost all my smoke buddies to distance (semester abroad), so I haven't been up to much.

I'm reaching out to you all for any bits of advice that you're willing to share. I've never had a drug test before, so I have no idea what the procedure is like. I'd like to know what my options are as far as making sure I pass this upcoming test. So if anyone with experience could give me more information about:

* detoxing (natural methods, detox drinks, detox pills, how I should modify my eating/drinking habits, saunas, working out, etc.)
* using another person's or synthetic urine? Is this actually easy to get away with?
* the actual testing procedure 

I'm looking for options that have high success rates but also don't burn a hole in my pocket. But honestly, I'd rather be down a hundred dollars and get the job than lose this opportunity. 

In case it's relevant: I am a female and would say that my body fat content is about average or a little bit higher (yay boobs...).

Please be as detailed as possible--I'd like to hear about your personal experiences! Specific brands of products and links to where I can buy them would be greatly appreciated!

Thanks!"

I went into engineering because I had some interested in it and they said I would have a job by the end of it. I did an year-long internship and joined a few clubs because they said it would guarantee me a job afterwards. I studied hard and maintained an A- average despite my discipline (chemical) being considered one of the hardest but with the best prospects. The last 4 years have been hell and back with the courseload juggled with life and extracurriculars. I've applied everywhere and apart from a few interviews that didn't end up in anything I have nothing to show for it.

Now, I'm panicking everyday and stressing out all the time. I have over 40k in student loans pay back that my internship barely made a dent in. I can't just move back home because my parents gave up on the American Dream and moved back to Taiwan. April is looming and I have nowhere to go, limited funds and no discernible job prospects.


I have no one to talk to because:

- The ones who have jobs lined up stopped giving two fucks about school and are now barely getting by, partners in projects included.
- The ones who don't have jobs either are aiming for grad school to hide, moving back in with parents and/or don't have any loans to payback (I go to a college where a lot of the students are fairly well off).
- Any time I talk to someone about my difficulties, it's always ""Maybe you're not looking hard enough!"" or some fucking spiel about not working hard enough to find one.


I've started to lose motivation to do anything. Schoolwork, capstone projects and studying are taking a hit. I get physically ill whenever I try to do another job application. Networking events have caused me to go into depression lulls immediately afterwards because the students reek of desperation and schmoozing is downright degrading. Seeing people who coasted the degree suddenly get employed because mom and dad are engineers or have connections have made me introverted and deeply envious. I feel so utterly lost, angry, burnt out, depressed, and I see no light at the end of my tunnel.


No matter how hard I try, nothing ever works out. "

21l3td,40,2014-03-28,I have an interview for a position I'll say no to. How best to approach this?,studyingmuch,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/21l3td/i_have_an_interview_for_a_position_ill_say_no_to/,"Hello reddit. 

This is my first time posting here, hopefully someone can shed some light. 

I've been working in a big company for a few years now as an outsourced resource. I'm also attending the university and will be graduating in two years. I got a little tired of my work situation and decided to look around for internships and trainee programs, and sent my CV to a couple.
I was contacted by a local bank regarding the internship and asked to do a skype interview. That happened and after that the manager responsible for the team contacted me and scheduled an interview on-site for next monday morning, which I accepted. 
The thing is that in the meantime (actually yesterday) I was offered a promotion at my current work and will be going through an insourcing process, along with a raise in pay. I was also asked to participate on the next round of the trainee program I applied for.
Therefore, I'm no longer considering the internship.
However, I would like to go to the interview for the experience of going through that in a large bank, especially since I do intend to go into that area in the future, and also due to the trainee processes I'll be going to participate in shortly.
Since they have laid out all the cards already (working hours, salary, etc) and I think the interview with the manager is the last step, I don't think they are expecting me to have to think about it in case they offer me the internship. 
How do I go about this without burning any bridges?
Should I mention something at the interview or just if someone actually contacts me to offer me the position? How should I put it?
Should I try to cancel the interview in such short notice?

Thank you very much!

Tl;dr: I have an interview for an internship I'll decline because I was offered a promotion in the meantime, but would like to go to gain experience and to know this company's hiring process. How should I go about saying no without burning any bridges?

**Edit:** Thank you everyone who took the time to comment and read this! I got some mixed responses about whether they thought I should cancel or not, and I was very torn, but then I got the news that my medical exam for my new position will be at the same time on monday, so that was that. I decided to call the manager and let him know I was very grateful but I had just been offered a new position at my current job and would be taking it. I said that I was still very interested in working at the bank in the future and would love to be considered for another position if they thought I had the right profile. He was very nice, congratulated me and asked me to send him my CV for him to keep for upcoming openings. :-)"

21lemq,353,2014-03-28,[Update] How do I [26F] Confront my room mate about keeping her vomit in a trash can in her room?,bucketoslop,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/21lemq/update_how_do_i_26f_confront_my_room_mate_about/,"I previously posted about this here http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/21i8c5/how_do_i_26_f_confront_my_roommate_f22_about/.
So, I confronted her. I went for a long walk after I came home yesterday and came home to find her room ajar and her in the shower. I went in and the trash can and throw up were still there. That's three days now (from what I know). I went into my room and cried and then mustered up all of my courage. 

I sat her down and told her what I saw. I talked to her about the dangers of what she is doing, and how much of a problem it is that she is doing it after this surgery. 


I spent almost all day at my internship on reddit and advice boards (never going to do that again though) so I was ready for her deflecting. She told me I was overreacting and lied to me and told me that it was from a drinking sesh last night and that she was late for class this morning and couldn't throw it out before she left. (Still not ok, I don’t know why she thought that sounded better.) I let her lie and continued on with my speech about how much I admire her, and understand the difficulty she is going through. When she told me I was overreacting. I had to show her why I was not. 


""Listen, you want to tell me that you threw up last night after you got a little drunk and you didn't have time to throw it away this morning and I am overreacting. Meanwhile there are half-eaten pieces of pizza all over your room and more take out boxes from other places. I used to party in undergrad, and I've thrown up in my trash can after a night out. I maybe filled up 1/12 of my trash can. Your trash can, which could easily hold 4 gallons of liquid is filled 3/4 of the way full. That's about 3 gallons. So, that means you are telling me that all night last night you drank, threw up, then drank more, threw up, and drank more, and threw up. 3 gallons. And your stomach has been cut to half the size of a normal stomach? And I am overreacting?"" She then lied again and told me that maybe she did it two nights in a row. I again said, ""In no way is that ok. Whether it is binging and purging or drinking to the point that you throw up. None of it is ok."" 

  I then gave her an action plan, telling her that I thought at first that I would tell her parents but she is an adult and I need to allow her to at least try to fix this on her own. I also told her that, unfortunately I will be looking into her room because she has honestly disrespected my home.


 Another reason why I decided to not tell her parents is that I don't understand the family dynamic and have never met them. I know I am taking on a major responsibility, and I am still very scared, but I told her that I would rather tell her parents about what is going on then have to call them and tell them that she has binged and purged herself to death and I knew it was going on. So, I said if I don’t see proactive and ongoing actions of maintaining good health I will not hesitate to pick up the phone. I also told her that this last for the duration of us living together. Even if it is six months from now.

So, I gave her an action plan:
 1. Go to a referral service especially for lawyers

2. Find a specialist who deals with gastric bypass patients who develop eating disorders and start to see them on a regular basis.

3. Be proactive and clean her damn room.

I just wanted to update you all and thank you for your advice. It may come to telling her parents. It may not. I also told my parents in case I need help with a transition at some point. Thanks again everyone. Your help is much appreciated.

Edit/Update: Tonight she forwarded me her confirmation email to her first appointment. I told her that I was very proud of her for taking such a big first step. We are planning to go to the library tomorrow because she has a paper to work on and I have to work. ( I also don't want her to sit at home all day by herself) We are also going to go food shopping this Sunday. I plan to try to help her on the nutrition front as well. I wanted to thank you all again, as I will not be making an update unless there is an immediate pressing issue. I have read everyone of your responses and I have taken them all to heart. Thank you.

I'm currently a graduate student starting his PhD work at ORNL, so I've semi-recently moved Knoxville. While I am very fortunate to have my work funded, my take home pay is pretty shitty. I would try to get a part-time job to supplement my income, but I already work around 40 hr/week at the lab; further, due to the agreement for funding I have with my school, I am not allowed to work more than 8 hr/week at another job. As you can imagine, I've had no success trying to find a part-time job with those hour limits. In addition to my woeful income, I have Type-1 diabetes, so even with insurance I end up spending a substantial part of my paycheck on medical supplies.

All that being said, I'm trying to find ways to reduce my monthly expenses and possibly make money ""under the table"" (I've done private tutoring in the past, and would love to start doing this again).
I'm not sure how far UT students typically live from campus, but I live in West Knox at Avalon West apartments and would be open to having a roommate. (I had already planned on trying to house an ORNL intern this summer).

Seriously, getting this job could mean setting the foundation for my entire career.

Apologies! 

**I attended Boston Reed College in 2011-12 and dropped before the course was completed. Was told via a monitored phone call that I would not be responsible for the remaining balance for my tuition. 2 years later get an email saying I have 5 days to begin payments on my remaining balance or it goes to third party collector and screws up my credit. Wasn't notified a single time in 2 years that I had been missing payments on an active account. Help?**

~~~~~~~

So, I'm not sure if this is the right subreddit (I'm really sorry if it isn't, a point in the right direction will be helpful if this is the case), but I have a problem involving a past due amount that I would love any and all advice on.

Ok. So. In November 2011 I enrolled in Boston Reed College's Pharmacy Technician program offered through an adult education center in Lathrop, California. I ended up dropping the course right before the final as I had started my internship and basically just realized I wanted nothing to do with the pharmaceutical industry.

I had been making payments of$249.16 to my tuition up until this point. I believe I made 6 payments, out of a total of 10. I called Boston Reed (I sooo regret attending this ""school"" sigh) and spoke with a woman whose name I do not remember, and she told me three things, that my mother was able to verify as she has it written down in her calendar from 2012 on the day that I called. My mother was helping me with my payments which is why she has the info. 

The three things this woman told me that my mother was able to confirm were:

1. I would not be penalized for dropping the course

2. I was not eligible for a prorated refund for the remainder of the course as I had completed over 60% of the course, and 

3. I would not be responsible for the remainder of the payments. 

So, I considered it a closed case and moved on with my life. I don't have any documentation from this school, I have moved since then and I have literally zero anything from Boston Reed College, I'm currently digging in my digital files to see if I have anything at all from my time attending the school. 

2 days ago, I was contacted by a resolutions specialist and informed that I owe a past due balance of $979.22, and I am expected to begin payments by April 1st, a whopping 5 days after I received this email, otherwise it would be escalated to a third party collections company, damaging my credit. 

I was totally stunned. What? No, I was under the impression that I didn't owe any money. I wracked my brain for any recollection of information and all I could remember were those vague details from that phone call 2 years ago, and thankfully my mom was able to inform me that yes, I in fact did make that phone call (on May 21, 2012) and confirmed what was told to me.

I asked my ""resolutions specialist"" who is literally the least helpful person ever, if she could look into my account to see if maybe there was a mistake, and she informed me that no, she would not be doing that. I had 5 days to begin payments or it goes to collections. Fuck you, good day. I spoke to another, much more polite gentleman and he confirmed that it was very strange that I was told I wouldn't be responsible for the remainder of the payments, and it was even stranger that I was never notified once I stopped payments. He had no explanation, only an apology and a confirmation that yes, I do in fact have this giant remaining balance to pay off before September 1st (when the school closes, as it was a bullshit institution and likely went under).

So I'm pissed.

Even if I assume that the woman on the phone misspoke that day, and I was in fact responsible for the remainder of the tuition payments (which honestly makes sense), why then, wasn't I notified when I missed 7th payment (as I'd already made 6 payments, stated above)?

Why not immediately notify me upon me being late for the first payment that I'd missed. How is it possible that no one called or emailed me for **two years**, however now I'm expected to jump and throw my money at this ""school"" because someone screwed up and I was never notified about it?

I've emailed my old instructor to see if she can shine any light on the situation, and so far all I have is the notes my mom has in her calendar and the possibility that the call was recorded. I spoke with my resolution specialist's supervisor and was told that she'd put in a request for the call recordings from the day I called, and the 1-2 days afterward.

Can any of you kind souls think of anything I can do to cover my arse here? I am going to try and see if I can get my own phone records from that day 2 years ago, and maybe I can find the time that I called, so I can give them that info and help them narrow their search down. 

In California, does this constitute a verbal contract? Even if I was still responsible, would the fact that this woman told me this negate that, and get me off the hook? The only proof of that would be the recording that they may never find. 

I'm currently back in school working on getting a degree so I can move up in the job world and I work very part time. I only bring home about 180 a paycheck, and I get paid weekly. Payments are $163, basically one full check each month. It's not a lot to someone who's better off but for me, this is a significant amount. I'd like to confirm whether I actually have to or not before I just lube up my behind and let them ream me for this crap **two years after it happened**. 

Any information or advice would be extremely appreciated, I'm at a total loss as to what to do. I have until the end of next month to make my first payment, or it goes to collections, so I at least have some time to investigate this.

This would be my first internship and I don't have a lot of people I can ask. I'm going to use my supervisor for a former research position for one of them. The only other person I can think of to ask is my manager for a retail position I had a few months ago. I know that's not ideal, but I really can't think of anyone else. Is this person okay to use as a reference?"

Apologies! 

**I attended Boston Reed College in 2011-12 and dropped before the course was completed. Was told via a monitored phone call that I would not be responsible for the remaining balance for my tuition. 2 years later get an email saying I have 5 days to begin payments on my remaining balance or it goes to third party collector and screws up my credit. Wasn't notified a single time in 2 years that I had been missing payments on an active account. Help?**

~~~~~~~

So, I'm not sure if this is the right subreddit (I'm really sorry if it isn't, a point in the right direction will be helpful if this is the case), but I have a problem involving a past due amount that I would love any and all advice on.

Ok. So. In November 2011 I enrolled in Boston Reed College's Pharmacy Technician program offered through an adult education center in Lathrop, California. I ended up dropping the course right before the final as I had started my internship and basically just realized I wanted nothing to do with the pharmaceutical industry.

I had been making payments of$249.16 to my tuition up until this point. I believe I made 6 payments, out of a total of 10. I called Boston Reed (I sooo regret attending this ""school"" sigh) and spoke with a woman whose name I do not remember, and she told me three things, that my mother was able to verify as she has it written down in her calendar from 2012 on the day that I called. My mother was helping me with my payments which is why she has the info. 

The three things this woman told me that my mother was able to confirm were:

1. I would not be penalized for dropping the course

2. I was not eligible for a prorated refund for the remainder of the course as I had completed over 60% of the course, and 

3. I would not be responsible for the remainder of the payments. 

So, I considered it a closed case and moved on with my life. I don't have any documentation from this school, I have moved since then and I have literally zero anything from Boston Reed College, I'm currently digging in my digital files to see if I have anything at all from my time attending the school. 

2 days ago, I was contacted by a resolutions specialist and informed that I owe a past due balance of $979.22, and I am expected to begin payments by April 1st, a whopping 5 days after I received this email, otherwise it would be escalated to a third party collections company, damaging my credit. 

I was totally stunned. What? No, I was under the impression that I didn't owe any money. I wracked my brain for any recollection of information and all I could remember were those vague details from that phone call 2 years ago, and thankfully my mom was able to inform me that yes, I in fact did make that phone call (on May 21, 2012) and confirmed what was told to me.

I asked my ""resolutions specialist"" who is literally the least helpful person ever, if she could look into my account to see if maybe there was a mistake, and she informed me that no, she would not be doing that. I had 5 days to begin payments or it goes to collections. Fuck you, good day. I spoke to another, much more polite gentleman and he confirmed that it was very strange that I was told I wouldn't be responsible for the remainder of the payments, and it was even stranger that I was never notified once I stopped payments. He had no explanation, only an apology and a confirmation that yes, I do in fact have this giant remaining balance to pay off before September 1st (when the school closes, as it was a bullshit institution and likely went under).

So I'm pissed.

Even if I assume that the woman on the phone misspoke that day, and I was in fact responsible for the remainder of the tuition payments (which honestly makes sense), why then, wasn't I notified when I missed 7th payment (as I'd already made 6 payments, stated above)?

Why not immediately notify me upon me being late for the first payment that I'd missed. How is it possible that no one called or emailed me for **two years**, however now I'm expected to jump and throw my money at this ""school"" because someone screwed up and I was never notified about it?

I've emailed my old instructor to see if she can shine any light on the situation, and so far all I have is the notes my mom has in her calendar and the possibility that the call was recorded. I spoke with my resolution specialist's supervisor and was told that she'd put in a request for the call recordings from the day I called, and the 1-2 days afterward.

Can any of you kind souls think of anything I can do to cover my arse here? I am going to try and see if I can get my own phone records from that day 2 years ago, and maybe I can find the time that I called, so I can give them that info and help them narrow their search down. 

In California, does this constitute a verbal contract? Even if I was still responsible, would the fact that this woman told me this negate that, and get me off the hook? The only proof of that would be the recording that they may never find. 

I'm currently back in school working on getting a degree so I can move up in the job world and I work very part time. I only bring home about 180 a paycheck, and I get paid weekly. Payments are $163, basically one full check each month. It's not a lot to someone who's better off but for me, this is a significant amount. I'd like to confirm whether I actually have to or not before I just lube up my behind and let them ream me for this crap **two years after it happened**. 

Any information or advice would be extremely appreciated, I'm at a total loss as to what to do. I have until the end of next month to make my first payment, or it goes to collections, so I at least have some time to investigate this.

21m76u,3,2014-03-28,"[WANTED][HOUSING] - Room with private bathroom and preferably a private entrance, or a Studio",[deleted],LAlist,https://www.reddit.com/r/LAlist/comments/21m76u/wantedhousing_room_with_private_bathroom_and/,"Hi! I'm looking for a cheap place in south/west LA. Here's more info.

**Who I am**: I'm a quiet 28-year old computer science grad who recently landed a Monday to Thursday, 3-month internship that will most likely lead to a full time position. This position is in the field I've wanted to break into for a while, Software QA, so I plant to stick with it. I also occasionally work event security on weekends, and recently worked at events including the Oscars and the Rose Parade. I currently live in a family house in orange county. I basically never bring friends over, but I'm looking for a place where if a friend or my brother wanted to spend a night, I could let them.

I'm basically cool with drinking/smoking/whatever (as long as it's done sensibly), but don't really do it much myself. I'm also a bit of a musician, but I always use headphones with everything so you'd probably never notice. The family I live with didn't until they saw me heading in with a guitar/amp one time and I told them!

**What**: A cheap room with a private bathroom and preferably a private entrance. Kitchen not needed, I can bring my own microwave/fridge. A studio would be awesome. The biggest factor, given it's in one of these areas for me is price.


**Where**: Less than 13 miles from LAX. I'm trying to look at a 30 minutes or less commute to my job in rush hour. Areas that should be in this range onclude include Beverly Hills, Santa Monica, Miracle Mile, Redondo Beach, Torrance, Carson, Gardena, Hawthorn, parts of South Los Angeles, El Segundo, Culver City.

**When**: Hopefully by April 6th. I'm looking for a month-to-month lease just in case, but plan to stay indefinitely.


**How to reach me**: PM or comment with any details and I'll get back to you.

Thanks!

I'm the devoted family man with a hot, loyal wife and 4 gorgeous daughters aged 19 to 13. I've never dreamed of hurting you or the girls. I've done everything in my power to please you, to dote on our bright, vivacious girls But men are weak.

Then that girl, a young college intern, started at my office and I fell victim to her flirtation and my own male urges. One night I lied to you, a first, and said I was staying late to work. Ever my devoted wife, you came to bring me dinner. A full sirloin steak and baked potato. Arriving at the office you catch me redhanded nailing that slut on the conference room table. 

She tearfully retreated and I stopped the encounter, realizing I'd made a colossal mistake. You pack me a bag and told me to stay at my brother's house until further instructed. Knowing it's my only chance, I agree.

A week later you send me a message for me to return home where you'll give me one chance to make amends.

(Without giving away the whole plot: this would involve my being shamed by my family of women, then being ""forced"" to have sex with our daughters as you prove that I was a fool for seeking Sex outside of our family)

I am of college age. I am interning in a not very glamorous department of a not very glamorous company. But it's work experience in a business field so I am relatively happy to be there.

I work with about two dozen people, but the woman who sat next to me when I first started (let's call her Karen) is kind of my minder. I have been there for six months, she has been there for 13. She is pretty good at what she does so they hired her as a full time employee. I consider her as my superior but I do not report to her. She has a bit of an attitude and has no qualms about speaking down to people, particularly me if she is aggravated.

I am not working today but they are doing some significant renovation over the weekend. My old cube is an area that was being demolished and Facilities asked that we leave our keys, unlock docking stations, etc. I always carry my key on a chain but neglected to leave them; anyway, all of the drawers that I normally use are left unlocked anyway.

Karen calls me asking where my keys are. I tell her that I have them but the drawer is unlocked. She bluntly tells me that I need to go to the office and leave them before 5pm. Mind you, it's 4pm and I live about an hour away in current traffic conditions. It's a 2 hour roundtrip and I tell her that, she simply says the exact same thing to me again: ""You need to bring your keys here before 5pm."" Granted, it's my fault. I should have left my keys there but didn't, and I was prepared to bring them if it was going to impede them from doing work. It just didn't make sense to me why it mattered if they had the key to an unlocked drawer - I just wanted to make sure they needed it before I spent 2 hours driving and $15 on gas on a day that I wasn't working. If they did need it, I would certainly bring it.

She was very rude in talking me and kept repeating the same thing to be verbatim. I asked her if she was sure that they needed it if the drawer was already unlocked. She didn't want to get clarification, she wanted me to drive there immediately to leave the keys.

I took this as her telling me what Facilities wanted. Facilities put out a blanket request and I wanted clarification before I went there. So I called Facilities and explained that I was out of the office but had the keys to an unlocked drawer. The guy there, who I know, told me, ""Oh yeah, no problem. Just drop it off whenever next week.""

I texted the girl that I spoke to *Jack* in Facilities, and that I could drop it off either tonight or on Monday. This apparently upset her. She texted me, *Who do you report to? Facilities or our department? We're having a meeting tomorrow at 9am so be in the office by then.* I text back, ""Ok."" An hour later she texts me, ""*Boss* asked that you come in at 8:30am."" I text her, ""Ok I'll be there.""

My boss is very nice and I honestly can't imagine him getting that outraged if he fully understood the situation. He is very laidback and I've never seen him yell or discipline anyone. Knowing her I think she is attempting to scare me, but I'm not scared. I feel like I acted professionally and politely despite the tone she was taking with me. 

For those of you who lasted this long into the story, am I in the wrong here? We have an employee who is also out of the office that lives an hour away. If I were to ask her to come in from her vacation to drop of keys, I just believe it would be common courtesy to make damn certain that she needed to be there. This woman would not extend the same courtesy to me, and I went through the appropriate channels to get clarification.

Anyway, I am looking forward to this meeting on Monday. I feel like I did nothing wrong but I realize that I am only an intern and she is a full time employee; obviously her words hold a little more weight than my own. "

21mwdu,3,2014-03-28,Double Major with Math? How about Computer Engineering? How does it affect getting a job? Weird Master's VS getting a job question also.,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/21mwdu/double_major_with_math_how_about_computer/,"This is my first question here so I will attempt to be thorough. I am usually considered a weird case when talking to other people because I came into college as a ""junior"" (60 hours). Basically I went to college during my Junior and Senior year in High School taking STEM related classes, and this has put me ahead of schedule in my CS degree. I got a full ride to my big state school, therefore I have four years to take classes (with each semester bringing money into me also). I am currently doing research, which has lead to bigger things, as I accepted an internship downtown which could potentially last until I graduate, if all goes well this summer. 

I found out recently that after starting in Fall '13, (meaning I get to tke classes until Spring '17) that I could easily finish a BS in CS after Fall '15 graduating then also. This is strictly just CS. CS and a Math major I could graduate in just one semester more, Spring '16. What I am trying to decide, is how useful/good looking a Math major is, and whether it is worth the trouble. I am decent at math, but I really love CS only. 

I have looked a little into Computer Engineering, and I could most likely make it fit easily along side CS, and was curious about how it would look and how useful it would be to me in the future. Currently, I don't really enjoy the hardware side, and I am afraid that the more advanced stuff may just completely turn me away from it.

Lastly, my school offers a program where you can take 12 extra hours and add then to grad school for CS. There are also two options for CS grad school, one being a Masters that takes 24 total hours, but a thesis is required, the other is 30 hours, but a project is required. Theoretically I could get a Master's by Fall '16 doing only CS and Spring '17 doing CS and Math, and it has been hinted that it could be paid for via fellowship, other funds, but there is no guarantee. So...

Would it be best to just get a BS in CS and try to find a job straight away? Perhaps a BS in CS and Math/CompEng then the job. Should I stay for as long as possible just to wring out the amount of money and experience I could earn (getting paid by the internship, research if I do it, various scholarships a semester, and gaining the internship experience along with research)?

At a minimum I will major in CS and minor in Math, but other than that I have lost passion for Math, and Computer Engineering does not interest me. However, I could push through the pains and do one or the other, especially if it will be helpful later on in life, whether it is in doing work or getting a job. I can't really think of much else to ask or say, but I will answer questions asked if I need to. Thanks for any help!

**TLDR:**

Came in with 60 hours, have til **Spring '17 to graduate**. Potentially could graduate with/when:

* BS in CS Major, Math Minor / Fall '15
* BS in CS Major, Math Major / Spring '16
* MS CS along with point 1 / Fall '16
* MS CS along with point 2 / Spring '17

Get the MS? Get a job? Double Major and take the pain?

21mxo8,316,2014-03-28,"My petty revenge - Serves you right, asshole",[deleted],pettyrevenge,https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/21mxo8/my_petty_revenge_serves_you_right_asshole/,"So, here is my story. Many years ago when I was still in college, I decided to intern at a private firm. The firm was not hiring at the time, but the internship provided an excellent opportunity for me to learn more about the work that I wanted a career in, and I was very excited to be there! Everyone who I met was super nice, went out of their way to assist me wherever possible, and simply made the experience an enjoyable one. Except as I soon discovered..for one employee: Asshole Bitch (referred to as AB from here out).  She was young, fresh out of college, and as I later found out from other employees—was a relatively new hire to the firm.  My first encounter with AB was rather benign at first, wanted to know my name, simple chitchat. About 5 minutes into our conversation, when no one else was nearby my cubicle who could overhear the conversation, she randomly tosses out:  “are you a moron or something?”. I was completely caught off guard by this unexpected change in conversation, and could only muster a response along the lines of … “excuse me?”. She proceeds to inform me that I am a moron for wasting my own personal time in an internship, literally laughs in my face saying that the firm would NEVER hire college students as stupid as me who waste and don’t value their personal time (WTF?). She leaves my cubicle, and continues about her business, leaving me discouraged and hurt. 

But…I tread on. I continue my internship with the firm over the next few months, and received surprise visits by AB to my cubicle every so often for additional personal insult sessions. She would routinely hurl snarky and mean comments if I passed her in the halls, but was always careful to do this when no one else was around. I never told any of the other employees about it, because I didn’t want to create any issues, and I was certain anyways that the firm would side with AB (an actual employee) over some lowly intern. To this day, I have no idea what possessed this asshole to be so mean to someone who was there on their own time, just trying to get some semester hours of academic credit.

Anyways…time goes by and the internship is drawing to a close. Despite what I endured during the months I was there (AB was a relentless bully), I really enjoyed the work and wanted to be hired by the firm. I got my wish. Two weeks before my internship ends, I get good news from the hiring manager: A position has opened up, and they want me to apply. So, I apply, and I get the job. Fucking awesome. About a month into my new position, it dawns on me that I haven’t seen AB around the office for quite some time. I inquire about it with my co-workers, who inform me that AB was fired a month earlier—and her position was filled by me—and AB is now working at a fast food joint down the street. My revenge? Every couple of months for a few years, I walked my happy ass into the fast food joint (when she was working) and had her take my order and serve me. Each time this happened, I played dumb and pretended as though I'd never seen her before, and I would bring up and force casual conversation about my job. “Oh today’s been a great day, I just completed another year with X company!” or “oh I just got another raise at X company” or “I just got another promotion, there’s excellent opportunity at X company, you should apply!”. Though I haven't done it again in quite some time, this went on for years.    

Tldr: Asshole bitch employee systematically harassed me for months at a company I was interning at, gets fired, I got hired in her place &amp; proceeded to occasionally drop by her dead-end job to remind her of my continuing success/happiness with the company. "

I'm a fourth year graduating in June with a B.A. in Psychology and minor in computer science from a top university. I started the minor sequence last year. Right now, I'm having difficulties finding any internships / job prospects after graduation. I live in Chicago if that helps. 


Skills:
1. Pretty good with C : bit manipulation, memory management, creating data structures, networking  
 
2. Worked with MIPs / x86 assembly for classes: translating to/from C, and small optimizations for architecture  

3. Learning some full stack web dev for my current job: Really light javascript / html / css front end and python backend  

4. Learning python / java for personal projects I plan on starting soon.    



Questions:
How *difficult* is it to find a job in my position?  
 
What should I be doing to increase my job prospects in the short term?  

Could I do anything now that will greatly increase my chances of finding a job in ~6 months?

21n1z3,0,2014-03-28,Is it worth negotiating compensation as an intern?,andham95,engineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/21n1z3/is_it_worth_negotiating_compensation_as_an_intern/,"Update: It worked! Here is the full email interaction:  

Me:
&gt;Hello,
&gt;
&gt;I am writing to inquire about any possible internship positions available this summer. I'm currently studying Electrical Engineering at [redacted] in [redacted], but it looks like I'll be home in [redacted] this summer.
&gt;
&gt;I'm currently a first time in college freshman, though I have over 80 semester hours thanks to accelerated credit. For particular details on my academic history as well as relevant skills, you can find my resume attached and also at http://[redacted]/resume.pdf.
&gt;
&gt;I appreciate your time and hope to hear back soon!
  
  

Him:
&gt;Hi Andrew – if you have a clean driving record, no criminal record and can pass a pre-employment drug screen you are welcome to work with us for the summer.  We are a geotechnical engineering, environmental consulting, materials testing and inspection firm, so not much that we do may interest you as it relates to your current studies and life goals. But working with an engineering firm will certainly look better on your resume than the typical student summer jobs.  So in summary, if you are hardworking, don’t mind getting dirty, working on construction sites and being in general a “helper” to my current staff we can certainly accommodate your request.  Compensation is on the order of $8/hour for as many hours as you are willing to work (when we need you, but we stay pretty darn busy all the time).
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Thanks for your interest in our company.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;William ""Will"" [redacted]
&gt;
&gt;Principal
  
  

Me:
&gt;That sounds great!
&gt;
&gt;I noticed in your signature you list locations besides [redacted], and after following up I see that indeed you are a listed contact for multiple locations on the [redacted] website. Just to clarify, I am seeking work in [redacted]. I noticed you copied in a few other people, and some googleing around seems to indicate they are based in [redacted], so I'm pretty sure I was understood correctly. Still, it can't hurt to double check.
&gt;
&gt;You are certainly right about the discrepancies between my field of study and the work that your firm does, but I'm generally interested in anything and everything technical. In fact I'm currently a candidate for a short term research gig here at [redacted] involving materials testing in conjunction with the Air Force! Plus, I'm not sure my duties as a first year student would be much different for your firm than at an electrical engineering firm, and it seems as if all the EE work in the [redacted] area is defense contracting with little interest in a first year student with no security clearance. In any case, I'd much rather work with technical professionals outside my prospective field than work another summer in food or retail.
&gt;
&gt;All this is to say I would be more than happy to work for [redacted] this summer, and the job description you provided is more or less what I envisioned it being (I have no fear of sweat, dirt, or fetching coffee).
&gt;
&gt;Should I continue to correspond with you about the specifics (such as start date) or should I contact someone at the [redacted] branch directly?
&gt;
&gt;Best regards,  
&gt;Andrew [redacted]
  
  
Him:
&gt;Good evening Andrew,
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;The fact that you did the research you did tells me all I need to know.  Please work with Ashlee [redacted] (copied herein) to get through your pre-employment process.  Once all that is done (usually takes about a week) get back with me and provide the date you’re available to start.  I imagine we’ll assign you to split time between Kevin [redacted] &amp; Richard [redacted] for the summer so as to expose you to a little bit of everything we do locally.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Ashlee – Please get with Andrew directly and let me know when he has the background process complete.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Thanks,
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;William ""Will"" [redacted]
  
  
Me:
&gt;One last question before you go, Will, and I'm not entirely sure if it should be directed at you or at Ashlee: would my compensation ""on the order of $8/hr"" be at all negotiable? Based on my compensation at my last summer job, the substantial college credit I have accumulated, and my current skill set I think something closer to $10/hr would be commensurate. I truly hope this doesn't come off as rude or inappropriate, but one thing I know for certain is if I don't ask I'll never know.
&gt;
&gt;Best regards,
&gt;Andrew [redacted]
  
  
Him:
&gt;No doubt about it…If you don’t ask, it is a for certain NO, right?  I’ll do $9/hour, but not a penny more.  I don’t really NEED the help, because I like my folks to work hard and take care of their business.  You are going to be a luxury item for them.  I’m sure you are capable of being worth much more than that, but that is what I will do.  I usually allow for one summertime utility helper/staff assistant/intern and you have impressed me the most by far with your approach and diligence so it is your slot if you want it.  If not, I have a 50 others bugging the crap out of me wanting to do the same thing.  Just let me know what you want to do so I can get with Ashlee and stop the pre-employment process before it begins.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Thanks,
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;William ""Will"" [redacted]
  
  
Me:
&gt;$9/hr is great, and yes, I absolutely want the slot. Thank you so much, and I'll make sure to get in touch again once the pre-employment process is complete. I'm glad to have impressed you, and I wont let you down.
&gt;
&gt;Have a great weekend!"

21nier,2,2014-03-29,I [17 F] had a huge fight about college with my dad [56 M]. Am I being unreasonable?,bigbum24,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/21nier/i_17_f_had_a_huge_fight_about_college_with_my_dad/,"I've felt this storm brewing for awhile, but it finally came to a head today, along with copious amounts of tears and snot. 

So here's the background: I'm a senior in HS who's been doing biology related things (science fair, research at local univ., etc.) for roughly 4 years. More recently, beginning with an internship in the summer of 2013, I began to develop an interest in computer science and engineering. I'm planning to do an internship in a computer science related field this summer, have won a few awards for a CS related project, and in general am very excited about what I've been learning. 

Naturally, I would like to attend a college that is strong in my intended major (CS). I've been accepted to three schools, all of which are well regarded. You'd think at this point my dad would step back to me make my own decision, but every time I express my interest in a school other than his preference (School #1 is a tech school, and School #2 is very strong in CS but also well rounded in other fields, including biology) he immediately starts ranting about how I'm ignoring my ""track record"" in biology and how I should choose School #3 because of its top medical school and general prestige. 

Note that the med school of School #2 is just one rank below School #3, the school of his preference, and that it is equally ranked for its biological sciences program. School #3, while well known, is notoriously lacking in its engineering and CS departments. 

Today, we had a terrible fight about it, culminating with him saying things like ""The kids who will really excel in CS have been hacking for 10 years, unlike you"" and  ""You haven't done anything of significance in this field"" and ""Python is for noobs"" (I've primarily been programming in Python, though I'm also proficient in Java and learning C++). Frankly, it really hurt my feelings, although I kind of knew he felt this way. Even during my childhood, he always encouraged my brother to learn programming, and never me, as he wanted me to do medicine. 

So am I unreasonable in wanting to at least partially base my college decision on a relatively new interest of mine? My dad keeps saying that he just wants the best for me. However, I can already feel myself being driven away from School #3 just because of his insistence that I go there. What should I do to convince him that it's my decision, not his?

---   
**tl;dr**: I want to go to a school that's very strong in technology/CS. My dad wants me to pick a different school because he thinks I won't ultimately pursue CS as a career, as it's a more recent interest of mine. He also insulted me deeply in the process of trying to convince me of this. How do I convince him that this decision is mine, not his?"
21niwc,3,2014-03-29,How can I get exposure as a high school sophomore?,squidwardtentickles,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/21niwc/how_can_i_get_exposure_as_a_high_school_sophomore/,"I am an aspiring software engineer, and I would like to show my interest in the field somehow.

What general opportunities for things like internships and research are available to someone my age that I may not know about? How can I make connections with professionals at camp?

I'm a current Pharm.D. student in the United States, and I want to live in Australia long term after graduation (I may work a few years here after graduation if I go this route because pharmacists here are paid about double, and I'm going to have about ~150,000 in debt after graduation).  I have also applied and been accepted into the University of Queensland Ochsner program in Brisbane for medical school.  To be honest I can see myself being either a primary care physician or pharmacist, as long as I can live comfortably in Australia.

Normally going to UQ-Ochsner would be an obvious choice, but the program is only open to Americans, and does not allow students to do their internships in Australia.  Australia has a very big shortage of intern spots, and foreign students are last in the pecking order regardless of merit for those spots, and with the intern shortage as volatile as it is I have been severely cautioned about applying to Aussie medical schools because there is simply nothing out there for foreign graduates of those schools within Australia.  So If I ended up choosing that program I would move down there for 2 years, do residency in the States and have to get licensed in the United States afterwards, then after registration here I'd have to get licensed in Australia.  Either way I'd have to get licensed in Australia as either a pharmacist or physician.

To get licensed as a pharmacist I'd have to sit for a short test and then do 1000 hours of supervised practice.  This is easily doable, but the only problem is ""pharmacist"" has just this year been removed from Australia's ""skilled occupation list"" which is easier to get a visa for.  So my options as a pharmacist would require an employer sponsor.  A quick search online doesn't seem like it would be a HUGE issue to do that, but it's still a risk.

Licensing as a physician would require me to jump more hurdles (I won't get into the specifics but it would require both national and state licenses, as well as a written test followed by an internship which isn't easy to get for foreign people...see above).  But pretty much every kind of physician IS on the list of needed skilled occupations for Australia.  So that's the pro for that route.

Another issue with going the medical school route is that the debt would be MUCH higher.  If I stuck with pharmacy I would graduate with ~150,000 in debt, maybe up to about 10,000 less.  If I went to UQ I would graduate with between 400 and 500,000 dollars in debt.  The only saving grace to that would be that doctors make roughly 50,000 to 75000 more in the States, an a LOT more (90,000 or so AUD) per year more in Australia.

By my conservative calculations I would be realistically able to pay off my loans and save up to buy a new apartment in Australia about 7 years after graduation from the Pharm D program (apartments can go for as low as 300,000) if I lived extremely scantily, so I feel like that would get me there in a more expedited fashion, and it's more feasible in the long run.  I'd still need an employee sponsor, and with one I could get a pre-owned house for a little cheaper (Australia doesn't let foreigners buy pre-owned apartments or houses).

My question is essentially what would more realistically lead me to living in Australia long term, and hopefully lead to permanent residency?

How to approach discussing relationship?,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/21nzew/me_17f_with_my_boyfriend_18m_of_1_year_going_to/,"My boyfriend and I have already decided what colleges we're attending. We made these decisions without any consideration of our relationship, choosing what's best for ourselves for our individual futures as we had previously agreed upon. When we go to college, we are going to be ~4 hrs apart. We have talked previously and agreed that we will talk about our options once we know where we're going. We're both logical people and when previously discussed, we both acknowledged that even if we want to, there's a chance we can't stay together, but left it at that, to discuss later, which is probably going to be some time really soon.

We talked about this months ago, probably closer to when school started and haven't given it much thought if at all since then, but now that the reality of the situation is beginning to set in, I'm now beginning to lose sleep over it.

Background for me: my family is abusive (physically/verbally) and until this relationship, I never really knew what a loving relationship is. He, on the other hand, has a loving relationship with him family. Since then, emotionally, I've been much more stable and I've never been happier. I have a tendency to rant, so I'll try to condense it: I love him more than anything in the world and he said that he feels the same way, that he loves me more than anything, always and forever. I don't want to break up, I really want to try a LDR. I'm absolutely terrified of losing him and that I'll never find anyone that will love me, care for me, put up with me as much as he does. We've never argued, there's nothing to argue about - people joke that we're the same person, interchangeable, and when we're not, we complement each other perfectly. We're great at communication and we've made it through some rough patches, always saying ""we'll work it out. we always do"" and obviously breaking up has never been brought up between us, it's just never been an option, even when his parents suggested it once when it was extremely rough. We support each other in whatever decisions we make and....

Sorry, I'm ranting again. I know that people always say that we're just teenagers &lt;insert all relevant hormone driven, naive teenagers statements here&gt;. We're in a lot more happy and stable relationship than many married couples I know and our relationship is definitely not like the stereotypical hormone driven relationships. We've discussed our goals for the future, often wished that we lived together and could spend more time together, even extremely loosely joke about how our kids would turn out if we ever had kids.

My biggest issue is that I care for him so much and the last thing I want to do is hold him back if he wants to do anything else. I would understand if he would want to separate. I don't want to become a burden for him and pursuing his goals/interests. I don't want to take anything away from him - including the whole ""college experience.""

I know we're going to have the discussion soon and I'm going to tell him everything I wrote here. I've read all the relevant threads I found on here, but they were only partially applicable at best. I know that there's a lot of people that insist that this isn't possible and that we'd be missing out on college experiences. However, I really can't see myself being the whole ""curious because I missed out on being with other people"" because he's all I could ever ask for and I constantly wonder how he's with me when I think that he could do better even when he insists that I'm perfect and has no idea what I'm talking about when I say that. 

We were apart 4 weeks during the summer because I had an internship in another country and had ridiculous time zone differences, but we made it work (getting up really early/staying up really late), knowing that we'll be back together in 4 weeks. From that experience, I found out that I don't do well in a relationship if physically separated for an extended period of time. We go to the same school, but we live ~1 hr away from each other and we're used to long car drives and I feel like if the ~4 hrs is split 2/2, it wouldn't be too bad once a week or every 2 weeks and I think we could make it work. I know the key is balance and not letting the relationship take over college. I would accept it if he wants to separate, but I don't know how I would cope with it.

I've read stories on successful and failed LDRs in college and know that the majority fail. I know that it will require a lot of effort on both people. I just do not know how to approach the discussion without putting any pressure on him because I want LDR, but I want him to be happy and do not want to hold him back from anything.

---   
**tl;dr**: Boyfriend and I going to separate colleges. I love him more than anything. We are going to discuss situation soon, but I am worried. How to approach discussion without putting any pressure on him (I want LDR, but do not, under any circumstances, want to hold him back in anything)? Is it better to discuss this sooner or put it off as late as possible? Also, if we decide to separate on good terms, how will this affect our relationship for the remaining time we have until we go to college? (We've already made plans to stay together and travel during summer) Does a successful LDR even sound plausible in this situation?

This will probably get buried, but if you see this, babe, I love you. We both knew this was coming. Let me know if/when you see this. Guess not my preferred method for you to find out, but I do want to discuss this."
21o2oc,1,2014-03-29,Should I attend Berklee College of Music or Drexel University? (more important info inside),Seven_CantStandYa,makemychoice,https://www.reddit.com/r/makemychoice/comments/21o2oc/should_i_attend_berklee_college_of_music_or/,"I can't decide which school to attend for various reasons and I wanted to here some other opinions. Obviously Reddit isn't going to be my deciding factor, but maybe some people here know more about the schools or have personal experience. 

So basically I LOVE MUSIC. I've been doing it all my life, everything from production to performance.  I believe what I would like to study is Music Production and Music Business (for a business safety background). I would like to go to Berklee to study but I have to keep in mind that if I decide I don't enjoy studying music while I'm there then no credits will transfer from Berklee because it is STRICTLY music. Not to mention it almost be a waste of a year and like $40,000. The only reason I'm still considering Berklee is because of the connections I will make there and if I want to study music 100% that would be the place to go. What I'm really worried is after college in the job search.

Drexel on the other hand has a wonderful music production program and if I decide I would not like to do music while I'm there, I would not have to transfer. In addition to that, Drexel has the Co-op internship program where I am able to have an internship during school and get paid as well. Drexel also has a great Architecture which I'm very interested in.

Overall I think that they are weighed pretty evenly. There may be some things I'm forgetting so I'll be sure to add stuff if I remember more. I think I may just be nervous about moving on."

The other day I get an email from a company I applied for that I didn't realize was a full time Java position. After speaking with the employer he agreed he liked my resume and wanted to give me a technical interview. If I get the position we'd work out a work/class schedule in the fall. 

Getting to the point, I feel way over my head. I could easily pass fizz buzz, I feel fairly confident I could whiteboard a linked list and BST, and I'm fairly competent in big O notation. However, doing anything besides the basics without a computer is way out of my grasp. I don't like coding on paper at all, I've used a CVS before but certainly couldn't answer any questions on it, and I don't have the intricacies of the language memorized.

21odlr,1,2014-03-29,Need input on internship situation for this summer.,ArrestedDeveloper14,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/21odlr/need_input_on_internship_situation_for_this_summer/,"To start, I am a computer science major at a small private liberal arts school in the Midwest. I applied to quite a few software development internships and made it to the technical interview with IBM Extreme Blue, Garmin, the Computer Science Intern Program with NSA, and a larger company in Omaha, NE called Farm Credit Services of America. I was turned down by IBM and Garmin and was offered the job in Omaha, and received a conditional offer from the NSA (if I am approved for security clearance). However, at the time I was offered the job in Omaha back in January I had nothing else on the table and didn't think I would get any other offers at that point so I accepted the position. The NSA then sent me the conditional offer at the beginning of February and flew me out to D.C. to do security clearance processing last week. I decided to go just for the experience and see if I would even make it past that stage. It however did not go very well and I failed two polygraph tests. All of the other interviews went well, but as I'm sure you know the polygraph is essential to working there and is the only thing holding me back from this position. They want to fly me out again in 2 weeks to do one last re-test however the day they have available doesn't work with my schedule at all. At this point I don't even know if I should keep going back for Polygraph tests if I can't figure out why I was so nervous on the first two, in addition to the fact that the only reason I'd intern with the NSA is for name recognition. I would also feel somewhat dishonorable if I reneged on the offer in Omaha. After looking at my options I was then thinking of reasons for Omaha and the NSA.

Reasons for Omaha: More friends interning in Omaha over summer with me and I really enjoyed living there last summer, more software engineering/agile development oriented working with a team of devs, C#, cheaper cost of living, and I think I would be happier there. 

Reasons for NSA: New experience in D.C. and name recognition of NSA

Along with that, based on what the NSA told me, their internship is a more a solo research oriented internship and I would rather get more experience with software engineering and agile and would like to work with a team of devs as well.

Obviously, there appears to be more pros to Omaha and most of my friends and family are telling me I would be happier there (a few friends want me to go to the NSA cause they think it would be good on my resume), but I wanted to get the opinion of Computer Science professionals who have more insight in this area. 

So, do you think it would be more beneficial to simply stick with the internship I have already accepted in Omaha or try and get the NSA internship? Is the NSA reputable in the CS world and worth it to renege on this other position? Will this drastically affect my job search after I graduate? Am I over thinking all of this?  

I apologize for the wall of text."
21og8o,9,2014-03-29,Need help evaluating whether my dad is a narcissist or not. I'm really confused.,xWalrusJuicex,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/21og8o/need_help_evaluating_whether_my_dad_is_a/,"(Note: This is a throwaway since a couple of my friends have accounts here)

Hi, I’m a male, 21 years old and currently a college student. I have never had the best relationship with my dad and it wasn’t until I randomly stumbled upon this subreddit that it dawned on me that my dad could be a narcissist. I have always struggled with low self esteem and anxiety issues but I did not realize this until two years ago. Though I have improved in some ways since I left home for university and I have always had quite a few friends who I can count on and I’m very grateful that I have them. I can be quite social if I want to but it is not easy for me.

I have lurked on r/raisedbynarcissists for quite a while but now I’ve finally decided to post something. I have read all the articles on the sidebar and browsed the links but I’m still not quite sure if my father is really a full blown narcissist or I’m just exaggerating. The thing is that my father fits some of the criteria but then again doesn’t fit others. So I’d be glad if you could help me with this because I’m really confused. I’m sorry but this could be a long post.

Maybe I just tell you about his behavior first. Here are some of the things he does on a regular basis:

- He would provoke arguments for the most ridiculous reasons. For example a couple of years ago we wanted to watch a movie together. He couldn’t figure out how to start our new Blu Ray-player so I took the remote because I wanted to show him how. He yanks the remote out of my hand and screams at me “give me the damn remote you have no idea what you’re doing!”
- In addition to that sometimes I feel that he always tries to prove me wrong “just because”. That’s why I don’t even bother discussing politics or things from the news with him anymore. He will also often pretend to know about a topic he clearly has no idea about and simply always believes he is right and anyone disagreeing with him is just stupid. Or: when I have a different opinion on him it’s just because I “want to be rebellious” (which is ridiculous considering my age).
- When we talk I often have the feeling he is not really listening, sometimes he does not even answer to things I say or changes the topic. He often forgets things I (or other people) tell him.
- He is kind of unpredictable in the sense that being around him is like walking on eggshells. For example we would be in the car talking and someone cuts him off or something he would get mad and yell at the other driver and when I try to pick up conversation again he’ll be like “be quiet, I need to concentrate on the road!” Or we’re watching the news and he would see something that pisses him off and when I’ll say something he’ll be like “shut up, I want to hear this!”
- He gets very defensive when you criticize him, even if you’re doing it in a polite &amp; civil way. He will belittle you and will exaggerate anything you say to make your arguments seem ridiculous. He also often uses strawman arguments.
- He expects you to do whatever he says immediately. If you tell him you’ll do it in like 20 minutes because you are doing something else he will play the victim role as in “Oh, I know. I’m just here to bring home the money. If it was up to you I should just lay the cash on the kitchen table and fuck off!”
- He’s also very inconsistent with his opinions on something. In some ways he has a very black/white view of the world. If he has made up his mind on a particular person he won’t change his opinion on them despite them having changed over the years.
- I don’t think I have ever witnessed him mentioning a personal weakness or him being *unable* to do something. Whenever he tells anecdotes from his life it’s usually about his successes or how great he handled a certain situation.

And those are just a few examples, there are a lot more.

Until two years ago he used to be a relatively high ranking employee in a company and one day my mom told me that apparently every single one of his subordinates hated him and the only person he was on good terms with was the owner of the company.

Speaking of my mom, unfortunately my parents often argued in front of me and he would get really mad and would tell my mom to shut the fuck up right in front of me and things like that. But he often apologized to my mom afterwards. Never to me though – at least not that I remember. He’s always been very verbally abusive to me (never physically though) and screamed at me when he got mad and when I was younger I was definitely scared of him.
 
Therefore I’ve often felt like it was my responsibility to keep a happy atmosphere (= keep him from getting mad) but now that I’m older I just don’t care anymore.

I’m also very bad at handling feedback, whether positive or negative and I’m scared of being judged. I had very good grades in high school but I was nervous as hell every time I received the result of an exam. 

Another example: Last year I did an internship during the semester break which I really liked. During that internship I worked in two separate departments of that company and met one of the company’s executives a couple of times and even though I didn’t show it, I was always a little nervous around him because he would often look over things I did. On one of the last days of that internship he came to me and said he would like to talk to me privately. I was terrified. I sat there thinking “I fucked up! I don’t know what I did but I must have fucked up somehow!” Later that day I go to his office, thinking that he will berate me. But he didn’t. He asked how I liked it so far, I told him it was great and that everybody is really cool and supportive. He looks at me and says: “I’m glad you like it here. All your superiors have told me how satisfied they are with your work and that you have great work ethic. Give me a call when you have your degree because I might have a job for you!” I was sitting there flabbergasted. I did not expect that at all.

It’s also not easy for me to ask for something or to mention my needs to other people because deep down I’m afraid that I’m asking too much despite the request being completely reasonable.
 
The more I think about it the more I suspect that my father’s behavior may stem from his relationship with his dad (he died when my dad was 19 so I never got to know him). The reason why I’m thinking this is that one of my aunts (as in his sister) exhibits very similar behavior. From what I’ve heard she is very choleric and can be really aggressive towards her husband and kids. I suspect that’s probably the reason why my younger cousin (her daughter) has a slight developmental delay. But then again my other aunt (his other sister) is completely different. I’ve been meaning to talk about that with her but unfortunately she lives across the country and I’d rather talk about it personally with her instead of on the phone.

In general I often think that my dad is just not very good at showing his feelings. I used to be the same but as I got older I became a little better at it and I’m still trying to improve myself. 

But is he really a narcissist though? I mean all the things I’ve written here have happened exactly like I described them but I still feel weird. Because he also has quite a few positive characteristics: he is very generous when it comes to money; when he is not stressed from work (which rarely happens) he can be really friendly and calm, when he is relaxed he can also be really easy-going.  

I’m also not completely innocent. I used to be a very obnoxious kid and would demand a lot from my parents (I never did any (hard) drugs or had trouble with the police though). Also I have suspected for a while that I probably have ADD despite my mom telling me that I got tested for that when I was like 8 years old and the psychologist said I didn’t have it. And sometimes when my dad would really piss me off I would say things just to provoke him.

To sum it up, judging from this: would you say my dad has narcissistic traits, or if not what else is wrong with him? Because I’m pretty sure his behavior cannot be normal. 

I'm sorry if it seems a little unfocused because I'm writing all of this down from the top of my head and English is not my first language. So if some things I said did not really make sense, please feel free to ask. But anyway, thank you for taking your time to read this! I mean that! It’s great that this subreddit exists and from what I can tell you guys are doing a great job of supporting each other!

I'll have an interview for an IT internship with a large tech company in a few weeks.

But according to the posts on Glassdoor, the interview questions seem to be pretty in-depth. Questions were on DHCP, DNS, IP stack, boot processes, BIOS, and the like.

Most of the courses I've taken in school have revolved around nuts-and-bolts programming, and not networking and such. I might not be qualified for the internship after all. What are some good resources for me to use for studying up on this kind of stuff? Do you have any other tips? Thanks."

Earlier this week he texted me asking when I was free, and I told him Thursday night or any day after, I could do whatever worked for him. So he said Saturday afternoon was good and so that was the plan.

Well I've been looking forward to seeing him the rest of the week, as usual. When I woke up this morning and found that I got a text from him at 5 in the morning right before he went to bed saying he's going to be busy today. I text him back asking if we're still hanging out later and he says ""sure, next week when we're both free, but I'm way to jammed up now.""

Now I texted him back saying it's okay, but that I'm a little bummed out and he needs to give me more notice next time he has to cancel.  The more I think about it the more upset I get. Saturday afternoon was when HE chose because he said it worked for him, but then he bails at 5am the day of because he's busy now, and he couldn't tell me before? He did not elaborate on why he is busy, nor did he apologize. Even after I texted him saying it's okay but tell me sooner next time, I haven't gotten a response. 

This is pretty out of character for him, he usually lets me know ahead of time when something comes up and he'll say he's sorry. To make matters worse, I got a rejection letter yesterday for an internship I was really hoping to get, so I'm already in a foul mood and in need of cheering up, hence why I was really hoping to see him today :(

I've already made plans to go out with another friend tonight who has an extra ticket for a play our friends worked on (yay!) but I'm still just feeling really blown off. I'm not wrong for being upset am I? Should I ask him to apologize or just let him know he really hurt my feelings? Have I made that clear enough and just need to see how he responds?

TL;DR my best friend made plans and suddenly cancelled them without notice or apology. Should I ask him to apologize or just tell him that I'm hurt and let him apologize if he wants to, try to let it go if he doesn't?"
21oxn9,2,2014-03-29,Masters Information Security,serefemme,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/21oxn9/masters_information_security/,"I had a very unsatisfactory undergraduate career performance. I struggled with substance abuse and pretty severe depression through and ended up with a 2.2. I worked my tail off to get it to that from a 1.3. That final year of school I got a job working as a student for the school help desk. That was for a solid year until graduation the next May. Ended up with a BA English, thinking that I might be able to get a desk job. After graduation with that degree, I was unable to find any sort of work except for slinging pizzas at Papa Johns, so I returned to school. I started out at a local private school with a special discount for adult students, but didn't do so awesome there. I had an experience outside my control happen that year and the PTSD from that (as well as substance abuse) led to me ""checking out,"" so to speak. I left that school, moved home to my parents', and I transferred to a local community college and earned a degree in Web Technologies, earning Honor/Dean/President lists almost every semester I was there. Mostly 3.5-4.0 semesters. I took full-loads (20+ hours), too, focusing in the programming aspect of web design. This was where I got my first taste of information security (required class).  

After that degree, I tried to take some classes at my original school, thinking that I would get my GPA up some. The primary reason for returning to this university was to take a full-time student job with the IT department at my university. Getting past the tuition, I was still getting more pay, hours and experience there than I was at my job at Papa Johns. I also gained some pretty awesome experience helping with campus computer migrations working for the department overseeing that process. Consider that job Project Management 101.  

First semester back, I bit off more than I could chew, taking calculus during a 5-week summer session. While I was earning a steady B average all semester in homework, I completely failed the final (I choked. Test anxiety, mind completely empty), so I turned in a very empty test and dropped that class immediately after that, getting a WF. This was very depressing for me, but I reasoned that WF would look less horrible than an F. The next year and a half I took an assortment of classes, including the first course in computer science (Java), and Information Systems classes (including information security). Any ISOM class I've taken I've earned an A. There are a couple of accounting and economics classes in there with C/B averages. The last semester there I earned a B in my international business class.  

Also during this time, I was working full-time for both the Command Center. Eventually, I transferred to the help desk after the project ended, eventually taking on a 2nd student gig at the university the final semester. That job involved helping the web design group with migrating departmental websites to the new look and feel, while maintaining the integrity of their original designs.  

Left school/student jobs, took a jr. developer job that turned out to be a sham (he stopped paying his employees, other shady things). Unemployed for 2 months. Job at a famous cable company doing tech support, until finally offered a full-time position with the help desk I'd worked at as a student. Been there ever since.  

Through my job, I get some free classes. Last summer, I made another attempt to take calculus, online through a harder engineering school in state, while sitting tests with a proctor at my school. That class ended in failure, too. Did fine on homework, studied my butt off, but couldn't get past my test anxiety on tests. I'm really disappointed about that and unsure if I should try to take one last time, through there or through my local university, but something needs to change with my test anxiety before even considering that waste of time/money again.  

Last semester, I took two graduate level courses at my local university in information technology. I currently have a graduate GPA of a 4.0.  

----  
So for the TL;DR crowd, I have a decent amount of work experience in IT, including experience in support, web applications, and migrations. For the most part, my undergraduate experience was somehow achieved, but barely. I was extremely immature to go to school when I did, all emotionally, psychologically. I drowned and didn't ask for help. It shows.  

Community college degree with 3.3 overall, 3.8 in major. I had gone to that CC before transferring to university 1 long ago, naturally not doing great as a kid. The last 2 years there were pretty solid though, including B's in math and programming courses.  

While my school experience hasn't been perfect since that degree, I feel that I've done pretty well maintaining some level of achievement despite working full-time as well. In the last 3-4 years, I've done a LOT of growing up and really just want to make things better enough to maybe stand a chance of pursuing information security as a career. I'm a teetotaler now and have a strong track-record in my workplace. I've expressed interest (several times over the last 4 years) in this field to a peer in the security group at my university, but I feel that I need some sort of formal education. My head is in a much better place. I figure a higher education experience might provide more delights than simply getting certifications, as college provides the opportunities for research and maybe even internships, to translate into the much coveted experience needed to get security jobs these days. I have shown a strong track-record that I can succeed in Information Systems, as well as at the graduate level.  

Assuming I can get a slam-dunk on the GRE, do you all think I stand a chance at getting into a reputable program anywhere, or is this just a pipe dream at this point? Any pointers, tips, things I should try to make myself look more pleasing on paper? I consider myself very intelligent, I've just kind of failed at life for a while, which unfortunately affected my academic career, too. "
21pcvt,10,2014-03-29,Oh shit...,[deleted],buildapc,https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/21pcvt/oh_shit/,"After years of shitty computers, I've been oogling and dreaming using PCParts picker, Mythlogic, and many other computer websites to dream up wacky builds. And for years I've resisted.

I don't know why but today I just splurged. A 420 dollar splurge. I randomly was looking at my PCParts picker build like usual; just dreaming. But this time, I bought it. I don't know if it's a good think or bad since I'm sort of excited and think it's a long time coming but when I think of the money I just spend I get nervous. I just wanted to share with you this moment since it's partly your fault. All these darn posts! Anyways, thank you. I probably wouldn't have done it without you. Also Linus from Linustechtips who I've been a long time fan.

I think part of the reason I bough it is I'm in college and have an interview for an internship; I guess I'm rewarding myself. Normal people would reward themselves once they got the internship which is what I planned on. I'm justifying the early buy because I never ever ever saw myself in a position where I would be interviewed by a VP of tax at a multi-billion dollar company; I nearly flunked out of high school and never believed in myself. So after years of saving, I think I deserve a little something.

21ph4s,7,2014-03-29,How should I spearhead a movement to enforce formatting and style in an existing project?,[deleted],java,https://www.reddit.com/r/java/comments/21ph4s/how_should_i_spearhead_a_movement_to_enforce/,"tl;dr - Does anyone have experience adding formatting and checkstyles to an existing code base, and is this a change that's worthwhile? In a broader sense, what are good strategies for starting large changes to current practices?

I'm currently a software engineer in a quality assurance position, and in my current project I love that every java file looks like it has been styled consistently. I can jump into any file and have it looks familiar, so I can touch everything with confidence and fewer ambiguities. Also the fact that a Jr. programmer or intern can be forced to write legible, clean code allows for mistakes to be more easily noticed and rectified.

I'm moving into the development side of this project and have been tasked with introducing a quality/testing focused mindset to the team. As I've been making small changes to this new code base I've noticed is that there is zero consistency, which makes every file looks like it was written by three+ different people. Basic changes require me to think harder and look deeper, which generally means more defects (for example the [recent apple bug](https://www.imperialviolet.org/2014/02/22/applebug.html) that forcing brackets on single line if's could have solved)

I'd like to spearhead a movement to use a formatter, and eventually a checkstyle and static analysis tool that would mark builds unstable if not adhered to. There are obvious practical problems like making diffs before and after the formatting unreadable, but there are also social problems, and there will be resistance to upheaving the current standard, as well as frustration towards me during the initial learning curve. I'd like to mitigate these to the best of my abilities, and I have a few strategies on how to possibly approach this:

1. The immediate hammer down approach of just saying this is the way things will be, and then having a discussion on the appropriate styles we want to enforce. I believe I'll have a brief time period where I can do anything within reason to set the ship in a quality-focused direction. This has the huge drawback of unreadable diffs that I mentioned above, and potentially having developers upset with me, at least initially.
1. The long term collaborative push, trying to get the other developers on the project to realize the importance of consistent code. I've heard this described as a pinwheel approach, where instead of changing everything at once, start mentioning your frustrations and find people who share them, until this seems like a very important change to everyone (small gusts on a pinwheel until it moves by itself). This requires social engineering which I'm horrible at, but this would be ideal if I could be sure there were no staunch dissenters. Failing this way would make revisiting this in any other method impossible, since the divide would already be cemented.
1. The long term solo push, where I change only the files I touch. After a year or so of this, enough of the files should have been changed that implementing the style will be painless in terms of the diffs. This has the drawback of taking a long time and having other developers unknowingly mess up a cleaned file. This is also a poor way to showcase the benefits of these changes, as everyone else won't realize or care that there is a certain style being pushed.
1. Or, I could just drop it. I may be comparing a process I'm used to to a process that I'm not, and assuming my way is better. As long as their style is readable, passes code review (which is another change I'm implementing) and is 'good enough', there may be no reason to go through with this. However, the benefits of cleanly written code I don't believe can be understated.

My current idea is to do 'the hammer down' for the formatter, since after the import of the formatter, the IDE can auto-format on save. For checkstyle, the 'long term solo push' will not have significant effort on anyone's part but mine to get the current checkstyle errors fixed.

So to sum up, my main question put generically is, what's the best way to get a technical team on board with new practices that they may not appreciate, from within the team itself?

More specifically, are there any useful technical resources for easing this change (i.e. a maven plugin that only runs checkstyle on modified files would be ideal), processes that experience has shown to be effective here, or opinions on whether these changes are worth it or just a hassle?"
21pkv1,3,2014-03-29,Shanghai or Shenzhen?,jaffaq,China,https://www.reddit.com/r/China/comments/21pkv1/shanghai_or_shenzhen/,"Hi all,

I've just been offered an internship in China for 2 months (so excited) and I think that I have a choice of location between Shanghai and Shenzhen.

**So where do you recommend I go and why?**

Some of the points for each I've taken into consideration so far: 

**Shanghai**

+It's is closer to Beijing which I would love to visit

+It seems to have a great nightlife, and there is probably more to see/do overall

+I have always been attracted to Shanghai as it is such a huge city.

-There seems to be a lot of air pollution (smog) in Shanghai

**Shenzhen**

+Shenzhen is closer to Hong Kong which I would also love to visit (I couldn't afford to visit both Beijing and Hong Kong).

+Shenzhen seems to have lovely beaches which would be great to relax at over the weekend

-Doesn't seem to be as much to do as Shanghai

-Possibly worse weather (Typhoons)


Edit: Thanks for all of the replies everyone! Keep 'em coming. Also another factor is the cost of living, it's an unpaid internship so the most I can possibly save and take with me is about 8000 Yuan/month (excluding accommodation). Is this enough to live comfortably in Shanghai with travel at the weekends? I've heard cost of living is quite high."
21plux,11,2014-03-29,I'm a college senior who doesn't know what he's going to do when he graduates and is feeling kind of depressed.,ofom,needadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/21plux/im_a_college_senior_who_doesnt_know_what_hes/,"So basically, I'm making this post because I feel like I am in an odd place right now and I really want some people to hear me out.  

I'm a senior in college and a biology major.

**1)** I don't know what I'm doing in a month when this semester ends.  I can't graduate because I need two more classes but I don't know whether to take classes over the summer or apply for another semester.  If I did apply for another semester, I don't know what I would do over the summer.  Last summer, I applied to ten places in my hometown and I literally *could not* find work.

**2)** Also, I'm worried about finding a job.  I have a 3.0 GPA and I have had an internship but I don't know if that is good enough.

**3)**  I'm having trouble with work ethic.  When I was a freshman, I once studied 40+ hours in one week for a test in freshman biology, which I aced.  But between then and now, a lot of things happened.  I had this huge extential crisis with religion which really shook me up.  I don't want to go into details but let's just say I thought a lot about suicide sophmore year.  I've never really been the same since then.  

For example, I spend at least a few hours procrastinating every day, mostly on reddit.  But even when I'm not on reddit or the internet, I just can't seem to sit down and focus.  Last week, I had a test in a class, I basically had to set aside a week for it.  I probably studied about 10 hours for it but spent 2x-3x as much time procrastinating.  I got an 82, which seems OK but given the amount of time I set aside to study for it and actual difficulty of the test, I think this is inexcusable.

**4)** I've also been procrastinating in applying for internships, which, as ridiculous as it sounds, is one reason why I don't know what I'm doing in a month.

**5)**  I have a horrible sleep schedule, I literally stay up till 3 or 4 every night.  I'll be on the computer or doing homework.  I can't seem to go to sleep at normal hours anymore.  As you can imagine, I'm tired during the day.

**6)**  All of this was far worse Sophmore and Junior year.  I got Ds in multiple classes.  I still feel so haunted by that.  I was a conscientious student when I went to college, I felt like I had a future and my life had meaning.  Looking back, I feel like I turned my back on everything I believed in and valued.  I think about my grades, all the opportunities I missed, the money my parents spent on college.  I'll never get it back and I know it and I just feel so disappointed and disgusted in myself.

**7)**  I'm not even sure I want to be in the sciences any more.  I wanted to get into research which is why I majored in biology.  Since then, I've had an internship and more lab classes and I have realized that I suck at lab work.  I'm careless, conceptually I have a difficult time understanding the experiments and nothing I do in lab seems to work.  I'm bad compared to my classmates and I know it.  

Really, the only reason I have a 3.0 is because I took a ton of poli sci and philosophy courses each year and I did very well in those.  In biology, I have a few B minuses, Cs, and Ds.  My major GPA is certaintly much lower than a 3.0.  And this is cause for more guilt, my resume looks OK on paper but none of my supposed achievements are as great as they look and I can't help but think about that every time I think about applying for a job.  

I don't know where I'm going, I'm undermotivated, and I feel overwhelmed and defeated.  And I feel like I have no time to figure myself out.  I could use some advice, perspective, encouragement, something thrown at me, ect.  

Any takers?"
21psin,1,2014-03-29,Bias against non-cs backgrounds,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/21psin/bias_against_noncs_backgrounds/,"How strong is the bias against applicants with a non-cs background? 

I am a master's student in applied math who is interested in getting a job that involves programming after graduation. I love both math and programming but because I don't have a cs background I am having trouble getting internships (I think). I have taken a class in data structures and will plan to take classes in algorithms, databases, and machine learning. 

In order to maximize my chance of getting an internship/job after graduation, what other classes should I take and what else can I do to bolster my resume?

We became those friends who only had small talk in class and honestly I never considered anything more than that. After that class I never saw him around campus anymore. 

Then all of a sudden last semester we happen to have the same class and we sat in the same table without even realizing till later on. We gradually began to have our usual small talk and it was nice catching up with an old acquaintance. I got the feeling he had a crush on me but I wasn't too interested in him because he wasn't my type. When the semester was over he asked me out and I agreed to it because I figured maybe I should try dating someone out of my norm, considering my previous relationships haven't worked out. 

We started going out on dates mid December and I made the choice to takes things really slow because he seemed like a guy worth getting to know and I didn't want to mess things up by rushing in too quickly. He was very understanding and agreed to let me take my time. Everything was going great. We went out on dates and always had something to talk about. He really became to grow on me because he knew how to make me laugh and he was a really sweet guy who always liked to call and text just to see how I was doing. We live about 45min apart from each other and even though I had a bit of a problem with that we were trying to make it work, he in the other hand didn't mind the drive and was always happy to drive out. Like I said everything was going great and so earlier this month we decided to make it official, boyfriend and girlfriend. 

Everything was pretty much the same from there on and then the other day when we were meeting up to go study at the library he calls me up and tells me he's not ready for us, he's not ready to be in a relationship with me. I suggested we meet up and talk about it because that came out of nowhere. He ends up telling me he can't be in a relationship because he's not ready, he still can't find a job and has bills to pay and needs time for himself because he hasn't had that single life I guess since his last serious relationship that ended a year ago. He tells me he's dated a lot since then and now feels he can't be in a relationship because he hasn't given himself that time alone. He also tells me he's mad that he doesn't have a career yet because he's 26 going on 27 and is still living at home. I'm 23 with only a temporary job about to graduate with my bachelor's and I'm still living at home as well so I kind of understood but a lot of 26year olds college students are still living at home, like a few of my friends even my brother. So after he tells me all that I really didn't know what to say.

I mean I knew he's been looking for a job, since he only has a part time job now and his internship that he had hasn't been giving him any work for a while now so he can't rely on that anymore. What caught me off guard was that we have such a great time together and I'm not a demanding person where I expect him to pay for everything when we go out. We were becoming comfortable with each other because we always joke around and we would tell each other how we felt about each other. So this break up came from out of the blue and I know I did nothing wrong to make it end abruptly but I just don't know why it did. 

I don't necessarily believe his reasons to end it because we just made it official and he's been dealing with all that he says now is a problem. I really didn't tell him much when he broke up with me besides that I can't force him to be with me, I hope that he gets through his frustration and that it was fun while it lasted. I was mainly speechless because he caught me off guard and I was sad to hear he wanted to break up. He told we can still be friends if I wanted to but I haven't heard from him since we broke up on Thursday. I know the phone works both ways but he broke up with me because he didn't want anything more from me and by not hearing from him makes me believe he didn't like me as much as I did or as much as I thought he did. Can anyone figure out why he really broke up with me or is it really what he says it is!

I've been lurking this subreddit for quite a while now, but haven't posted before. I don't really know much about how job market works, so forgive me if my question seems to trivial or not very focused.

I'm a second year highschool student from Estonia and I have a few questions about summer internships. I consider myself a fairly good programmer (at least for my age), for example I was placed 5th in a national programming competition for highschool students. I've also had a chance to attend a algorithms and data structures lecture at my local university, which gave me a big boost in confidence, as I already know most of what was told in the lecture.

Now, I'm looking for an internship for summer. I'm mainly interested in writing Java. I'm mostly interested in gaining experience, but I'd also like the chance to make some money doing that.

I've selected a few companies I have in mind (some of which are very well known, like Skype or ZeroTurnAround). My current idea is basicly send each of the companies an email, which would go something like  ""Hey, I'm this-and-that, can you offer me an internship"" and include my resume. I also have the problem of not having much to include in my resume (a few webdev jobs for relatives and one with trying to understand unknown binary format).

What would be the best course of action which would give me the best chance of landing an internship for summer?"

I am 22(F), and a junior in college. My bf ( of a year and a bit) (24 M) has graduated and is working in a town 45 min from my apartment and college. Bf moved out of his parents house and into an apartment with his buddy this past fall. They get along beautifully, and I spend most weekends and some weeknights at their place.

I just got a summer internship at a hospital really close to bf's apartment. Bf wants me to just move in for the summer. It will keep me from having to make the drive daily, and in all reality, I'll probably just end up staying with him anyway. 

Now I HATE to be a mooch. This is very important to me. Bf is on salary now, and I am a broke college student on a strict budget. So it can be very hard for
me when he wants to do fun (expensive) things and I can't pay my share. I would ideally like to find someone who wanted to stay in my apartment for the summer ( I'll definitely be back in the fall) who could pay the rent on the place. And then pay for a third of the rent at my bf's place. If I can't find someone to stay at my place, I won't be able to afford rent for two rooms, but I will definitely be pitching in as best I can. Bf says he doesn't care, and he'd be happy to foot in a little extra for me so his roommate doesn't feel cheated. 

What also really worries me is being a girl and being in their 'territory'. What are some things I should know about moving in with 2 guys. How do I handle things like cleaning and not becoming their new mom? How do I handle giving bf his space but still being a couple? I get anxious about every new change, and I want to be sure I'm mentally prepared for this well In advance. Thank you so much!

Tl;dr: I'm moving in with my bf and his roommate for the summer, advice and help?"

2. Regnia Richgirl: You'll have amazing fun screwing in her bedroom and having her parents feed you Whole Foods after. Bonus: her parents will buy the condoms.

3. Francesca Fling: This is the hot girl you meet at a nightclub who will be your ""friends with benefits"" for a while. Bonus: you'll probably get a threesome out of it.

4. Cathy Cougar: Every guy needs to bed an older woman. She'll teach you a few tricks, wear you out on a regular basis, and pay for dinner. Bonus: You'll do it at her place, which is way nicer than yours.

5. Jenna Jailbait: The day she becomes legal. Bonus: she just became legal.

6. Edie Eurochick: She's only in New York for a summer internship, and she wants to bang a geniune American guy. Bonus: your accent will work in your favor for once.

7. Samantha Sporty: She's the athletic type, full of energy and an amazingly toned body. Bonus: you'll probably get to do her in her team uniform.

8. Chelsea Crazychick: Hot and crazy, amazing sex, lots of drama. Bonus: you'll know why they say ""never stick your dick in crazy.""

9. Fannie Feminist: Zzzzzz. Boring. She won't even make you a sandwich. Every interaction will be problematized to make sure it doesn't reinforce The Patriarchy. Bonus: she likes it rough, dirty and humiliating.

My total: 9/9 - not too shabby! 

OK. I showed mine now you show yours. How many on the list have you crossed off and do you think my criteria are too rigid?

21r53b,5,2014-03-30,CompTIA A+ questions?,[deleted],CompTIA,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompTIA/comments/21r53b/comptia_a_questions/,"Hello all,

I am currently looking through material for this CompTIA A+ and was curious on your thoughts of the difficulty of it. I have been working in IT for several years now hired as an interns for private tech companies and worked my way up without proper education or certifications. I have a buddy who is on the same level of technical know how as me who said he just went and took it and it is a simple basic knowledge tech test.

I get rather nervous when it comes to tests so I was curious what your thoughts on the difficulty was and good material to do a slight cram of it? I really want to have a legitimate certification as it is hit and miss with companies when submitting my resume since I do not have the education only the experience. 

tl;dr: what do you feel the difficulty level is set at and good recommendations for cram material? Looking to take the test in a week or 2. "
21rd3r,3,2014-03-30,Does wanting to switch to a Program Manager role show badly on my profile?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/21rd3r/does_wanting_to_switch_to_a_program_manager_role/,"I'm graduating from grad school this May. I have a couple of years of full time work experience and a couple of internships.
I currently have an offer for a Software Engineer position from a pretty decent company in Si Valley. I have a real passion for building stuff and would really like to see myself as a product manager in the not so distant future. However, would this  be perceived as a lack of my coding skills(I love to write code). 

Also, does switching to PM restrict my ability to switch companies later?"
21rfnd,7,2014-03-30,"I think I'm being severely underpaid, what should I do?",mind_blowwer,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/21rfnd/i_think_im_being_severely_underpaid_what_should_i/,"About 6 months ago I internally switched from a QE position (non-software) to a SW engineer position. When I switched positions my salary did not increase. I had been self-teaching myself (taking data structures, algorithms, and various other online courses) and just wanted to make the transition to SW asap so I didn't complain. When I accepted the transfer I assumed my salary would increase by a few thousand at least, but the director of my group said ""I can't do that right now"".

Now that I've been at the position awhile and got up to speed very quickly, I'm starting to get very unhappy with low salary I'm making. I make in the low 50s. 

I have received many compliments from my fellow engineers. A few weeks ago, one of the senior sw engineers said to me ""You are going to be a director one day.""

I'm currently working with C# for Windows CE on a project that is pushing boundaries at the company. It's an exciting project and I kind want to see it to the ""end"" which will be the end of 2014, but I don't know if I can 'make' it that long making such a horrible salary. I graduated with a 3.8 gpa in electrical engineering and thought I'd be making at least $70k my first year out.... And no I'm not socially inept, I didn't have any internship experience.

I have been with the company for almost 2 years BTW.

My question is what should I do?

1. Wait till the yearly review, and ask for a much higher salary. I will not be happy with less than $65k, and I have a feeling they will try give me the typical 3-4% they usually give...

2. Start applying for a new job now

3. Ask for a raise now

4. Stop being a bitch and be happy I have a job. Keep in mind, I actually enjoy going to work."
21rkh7,1,2014-03-30,I don't understand why you won't leave me alone.,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/21rkh7/i_dont_understand_why_you_wont_leave_me_alone/,"TLDR:  A kid who decided to label me as her mentor and role model called me so much I eventually had to stop answering the phone. She refused to take any of my advice. Now she's moving to a city near me and I have to make sure she understands that we are not going to hang out and be friends. 

  
---
You claimed I'm your role model and you used to call me every day even though I asked you not to. I even had to call your mother and ask her to please stop you from calling me all the time.  I told her and I told you it was because I couldn't afford the minutes it was costing me on my phone.  Really it's because I don't want to hear from you. I thought you were wasting my time.

When you first started calling me I was excited to have somebody who looked up to me, but I quickly realized that this was a completely one-way relationship. You didn't care about anything I said to you. It seems like every conversation consisted mainly of you talking for hours about things that I either didn't care about or had no interest in hearing about you. Lots of TMI, lots of telling me about terrible things your boyfriend did or said. Anytime I try to offer a suggestion or piece of advice you came up with so many reasons why it wasn't possible. Eventually I figured out that you were just calling me to torment me.  Edit: okay maybe not to torment me, but that's what it felt like.

I haven't thought about you in so long that I can't even remember how much of an age difference there is, but I remember you said you looked up to me. You would call me and tell me about all the bad decisions you make. I would tell you they were bad decisions and you shouldn't do them. You told me you didn't have a choice and you were so casual when you accidentally got pregnant.  You come from a place where whoops I'm pregnant is just a way of life, and I come from a place whoops I got pregnant means you were shamefully irresponsible.  Where you come from that is expected, but I thought that since I was supposedly a role model, that I had a right to expect more out of you.

You describe to me the 16 different reasons why you couldn't use birth control, and all I ever Heard was excuses to be irresponsible. You felt it was easier to just be pregnant and raise a child. I did not and could not and will not understand that.  Now I know part of the reason why you're okay with having kids is that you really wanted somebody who would have to automatically love you. I'm sure your child does now.  That's fantastic.  I just hope none of the men you were with were physically violent to either of you. You were always so casual when describing how sketchy they were.

You told me how you really wanted to be a veterinarian when you grew up, and then you told me what stopped you. You couldn't understand the concept of an unpaid internship and that stop you from following your dreams.  I tried to explain to you that you can't be a vet just by working yourself up from cleaning kennels. You decided you'd rather just work at Taco Bell and barely make ends meet, totally disregarding the future.

When you found out I was engaged you told me you would get to my wedding no matter what happened. I never told you were invited, and had specifically planned not to invite you. I invited other people from the place where we met and I'm sure you were upset when wedding photos were leaked onto the Internet. For the record, I at least tried to keep it private. A little bit because I didn't want to hurt your feelings, but mostly because I didn't want to have to explain myself to you. I don't owe you anything.  It has now been two years since my wedding. We have barely spoken. Sometimes you try to comment on my Facebook posts. I never responded to anything you say.

You just told me that you're moving to the state I live in and you want to see me tomorrow on your way down to the city you're going to live in.  You obviously haven't checked my Facebook in a while because I don't live in the city that you say you're stopping in.

I cannot possibly describe how thankful I am that there's no way on earth I could actually meet you, so I don't have to make up an excuse.

I go out of my way not to talk to you, we haven't spoken in ages, and yet you're still trying to contact me. You didn't exactly do anything to me, I just don't like you and I don't like that you've attached yourself to me. It's not even that I don't want the responsibility of having somebody call me a role model, but you haven't acted like i'm your role model at all and that really pisses me off. I have come to feel like the person that you used to dump all of your problems on other than pay a Therapist. I guess the only difference is you never ever took any of my advice. All you ever wanted to do was tell me your troubles.

I met you when you were just a kid and had so much potential. You were so smart even though you had some issues. When we first met I was sure I was going to watch you grow up to be an incredible genius and have a very bright future. Instead I watched you grow up to be stubborn white trash and you insisted on telling me about every single bad decision you ever made, casually and completely disregarding how much it hurts me to have to hear you say that I was your role model what you were doing all of these ridiculously stupid things.  

I suppose I should return your call and tell you I can't and won't meet up with you tomorrow, but after all of this I don't even feel like I owe you that.

All you ever done is make me feel irritated and trapped.  I do not want to be attached to somebody like you.  I don't understand why you keep trying to get in contact with me. I have nothing to give you. You've made it very clear that you have no intention of ever listening to anything I have to say, but you seem to find some sick pleasure in telling me all of the ridiculous things that you do that I do not and will never approve of.  

When I call you back I'm going to try and be as clear and concise as possible. I have very valid reasons why we cannot meet tomorrow.  However, I do not know of a nice way to tell you not to contact me again.  As far as you can tell, you have done no wrong and I'm the person who has been ignoring you and telling you to do things you don't want to do.  

Please lose my phone number.


Edit:  i'm sure this makes me sound like a horrible person, but I never asked for this and I have never gotten any magical heartwarming Disney moments in return.  She should have picked somebody else.

CAW welcome.   At first I just wanted to get this off my chest but I really don't know what to do with her.  There is nothing I can do or say to help her. She talked to me for hours when she was younger and still made all the wrong decisions. It's not like I was even trying to tell her what to do, just give her standard advice like using birth control, getting a job, not mouthing off to her bosses. She did the same thing over and over and never ""learned"" anything from it, except that everything that goes wrong in her life was somebody else's fault.  "
21rnu1,5,2014-03-30,Returning to lifeguarding!,Laurasaur28,Lifeguards,https://www.reddit.com/r/Lifeguards/comments/21rnu1/returning_to_lifeguarding/,"Hi guys! I was so excited to find this subreddit because I want to ask for some advice. I started lifeguarding my senior year of high school and did it for nearly two years (working when I came home for breaks). Then my family moved and I had no ability to go back for work. Well, I got an internship in my home state this summer and I've been re-hired at my old pool! I'm so excited! It's certified by Ellis and I always thought it was pretty well-run.

My questions are: how would you recommend I get back into the lifeguarding mindset? Have any changes been made to Ellis regulations in the last couple of years that I should know about? And how do I explain to the new guards that I've already worked at that pool and I know my way around? Any other advice is appreciated! Never thought I'd say it, but I can't wait to get back on the deck!"

[Now, that's interesting.  However, when you summarize the results, you don't say ""now we know that people who describe themselves as creative are more willing to cheat and lie"".  Instead, you say ""now we know that people who are creative are more willing to cheat and lie"".](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/21ri9r/im_social_scientist_and_author_dan_ariely_i_study/cgft93j?context=5)|Best.
[I guess none of that was a question, so I guess my question is: What do you have to say about this?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/21ri9r/im_social_scientist_and_author_dan_ariely_i_study/cgft93j?context=5)|This is my first day in Reddit -- so I am not sure how this works, so ia m sorry if I am posting this twice.
[Anyway, once again, I enjoyed the book, generally speaking.  Thanks for writing it.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/21ri9r/im_social_scientist_and_author_dan_ariely_i_study/cgft93j?context=5)|Sorry if this was not clear. In one experiment we measured creativity with the standard scales for creativity. In another experiment we mandated creativity -- which means that we primed people in a way that make them more creative for a few min and we measured their dishonesty during that time. In yet another experiment we measured the type of job that people had and the creativity requirements of that job. So -- non of these experiments is perfect, and it is hard to measure dishonesty, but across all the experiments the pattern is the same and I feel confidence in the results. I hope this is more clear now. Best Dan.
[What is the most common irrational human act that you come across? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/21ri9r/im_social_scientist_and_author_dan_ariely_i_study/cgfud1z?context=5)|Having kids.
[If you had the opportunity to ask the government to change or institute a public policy based on your research, and they had to comply, what would you ask for?  What would do the most for social welfare?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/21ri9r/im_social_scientist_and_author_dan_ariely_i_study/cgft9wl?context=5)|I would make taxes simple and more equitable. I also think that the complexity of the tax system makes it hard for people to remember what taxes are for, and not just see taxes as an adversarial relationship with the government.
[You have the most painfully awkward jokes in your coursera lecture videos.  What's your comedic inspiration?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/21ri9r/im_social_scientist_and_author_dan_ariely_i_study/cgfu0k4?context=5)|I'm terribly hurt by this. My kids think I'm hilarious.
[What was the one thing that surprised you the most in your studies? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/21ri9r/im_social_scientist_and_author_dan_ariely_i_study/cgft25w?context=5)|The ability of people to rationalize. In one study, we gave people a chance to cheat -- which they took, and very quickly afterwards, they believed their own lies. 
[What has been your favorite social experiment to try on a college campus and which experiment has changed your opinion on a certain topic the most?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/21ri9r/im_social_scientist_and_author_dan_ariely_i_study/cgftg76?context=5)|Probably the vaccination experiment -- they took a group of students and gave half of them information about the importance of vaccination, but also gave the other half directions to the health center and asked them to indicate a time in their calendars that they would show up. Amazingly, the information did very little but the map and schedule was very effective at getting people to show up and get vaccinated. For me, this is an important building block -- providing people with information is not very useful, and we need to change the environment to facilitate better decision-making.
[I am a professional at procrastinating. Any tips on how to make sure I'm productive when I'm studying? Is procrastination in any way good?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/21ri9r/im_social_scientist_and_author_dan_ariely_i_study/cgft9h8?context=5)|Yes, I have written an article on this topic: [Link to www.linkedin.com](http://www.linkedin.com/today/post/article/20140121115438-23667182-productivity-hacks-setting-priorities-straight)

[Knowing what you know about irrational behavior, do you still find yourself behaving irrationally (in some context\) despite your better instincts/judgement?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/21ri9r/im_social_scientist_and_author_dan_ariely_i_study/cgftf1p?context=5)|Often.
[Do your studies about dishonesty make it hard for you to trust people?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/21ri9r/im_social_scientist_and_author_dan_ariely_i_study/cgft2e6?context=5)|More generally, my studies on irrational behavior make me worry about people. In terms of dishonesty, I don't think I worry more than others. But now that you've pointed this out, maybe I should be concerned that people think I am more dishonest because I study dishonesty!
[Hey Dan, do you believe people are selfish rather than altruistic? (not sure how to ask this as not to suggest an answer\).  Is it meaningful to ask this question and to what extent do you believe this has to do with the threat of punishment rather than trying to act in accordance with moral principle?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/21ri9r/im_social_scientist_and_author_dan_ariely_i_study/cgftneb?context=5)|I believe that people are deeply altruistic, and selfishness comes later. One piece of evidence for this is that we have some data showing that when people are drunk, they react more extremely to injustice -- even at a cost to themselves.
[What is the best marketing strategy you ever seen? The cleverest one.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/21ri9r/im_social_scientist_and_author_dan_ariely_i_study/cgfu07b?context=5)|There's a company that sends a very large letter. Not just kind of big, but HUGE. It's so out of the ordinary that people are much more likely to open it rather than toss it into their pile of spam letters.
[Hey Dan, what other topics are you interested in studying beyond of dishonesty and irrationality?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/21ri9r/im_social_scientist_and_author_dan_ariely_i_study/cgftbn5?context=5)|Right now we have a new study on bribery, we are also looking at how physicians break bad news to patients, we are trying to get poor people in Kenya to save a bit of money for rainy days, and if I tell you the rest I might have to kill you.
[Are you going to lie in this thread?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/21ri9r/im_social_scientist_and_author_dan_ariely_i_study/cgft72t?context=5)|Not sure yet. I'm new to reddit.
[What would happen if the whole world behaved rationally? What would have existed that we dont have today?  Please, please, please answer and make my day.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/21ri9r/im_social_scientist_and_author_dan_ariely_i_study/cgfthyl?context=5)|I would hate to live in this world. A world without irrationality would have no help, altruism, caring, love. Count me out.
[Not to any public personalities on the spot, but there is a slew of self-help books/speakers/retreats - in other words, a multi-billion dollar industry out there that operates on making people believe that they can profoundly change themselves. In my own case, personal shortcomings like procrastination for example, how likely is it that someone in her 50s can still successfully tackle these types of personal problems? In other words, is the self-help industry a hoax? Is is irrational to expect change on a deep level?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/21ri9r/im_social_scientist_and_author_dan_ariely_i_study/cgftwin?context=5)|There is clearly a demand for self-help, and it is a very interesting industry. To look into this, I went to a 3-day event with Tony Robbins and one with the Landmark Forum. In each, there was some grain of scientific evidence but they were building giant castles from these grains of sand. I also saw lots of pain in these meetings, and people who were dealing with very complex problems. And it upsets me that these organizations are selling them the ""answers"" at such a high cost.
[Some people tend to have an imaginary world where they escape that sometimes makes them completely uninterested in their own lives (see how popular TV &amp; movies world is\). Is this behavior considered socially acceptable or have there been some studies regarding the general profile of an individual that has this sort of inner fantasy world? Is this how humans lie to their conscience to cope better with day to day life or is it just a form of the Peter Pan syndrome?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/21ri9r/im_social_scientist_and_author_dan_ariely_i_study/cgft82i?context=5)|I would not give up my own fantasy world.

This is the place where behavioral interventions are most likely to have the highest impact.

 |As a parent to two young kids, I'm also debating whether to tell them that after 12 years of elementary education, there's also four more years of college and even more years of grad school. So far I've avoided pointing this out to them.
[Hi Dan, big fan of your books and courses.  Here are my questions: 1\) Do you know that in the gaming industry your book is the handbook regarding microtransaction (""free to play""\) monetization models?  2\) ... and how do you feel about that?  Edit: I am speaking about Predictably Irrational!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/21ri9r/im_social_scientist_and_author_dan_ariely_i_study/cgftsiu?context=5)|I did not know about this, and because I am not familiar with the handbook, I'm also not sure how I feel about it.
[Which conclusion(s\) from your studies do you find people have the most difficult time accepting?  (also thanks so much for your books – they've literally changed my life\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/21ri9r/im_social_scientist_and_author_dan_ariely_i_study/cgftyql?context=5)|That they too might be irrational. I think that people have an easy time seeing others as irrational, but have a very hard time accepting that they would make the same mistakes.
[Dan, have you heard about the phrase ""Don't ask what you dont want to know the answer to"", how can we explain the sudden urge we feel about knowing everything and then feeling bad because of having ""asked""?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/21ri9r/im_social_scientist_and_author_dan_ariely_i_study/cgftdjq?context=5)|Some time ago I had a friend who smelled very badly. And every time we were together, I promised myself not to breathe from my nose. But every time I failed. I was so tempted that I would take a small whiff and it was awful every time, no surprise. What am I trying to say? Sometimes curiosity is too strong and we do things to calm our curiosity that are not necessarily in our long-term interest.
[Hey Dan, on your experiment on sexual arousal and decision making, you gave your test subjects laptops in order to get sexually aroused. So my questions are, naturally- in what condition did you get the laptops back What did you do with them? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/21ri9r/im_social_scientist_and_author_dan_ariely_i_study/cgft9fj?context=5)|We thought about this in advance and covered them in saran wrap before giving them to participants. I should point out that it was still a bit difficult to work on these laptops knowing their history..
[Can animals or other living creatures lie too?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/21ri9r/im_social_scientist_and_author_dan_ariely_i_study/cgfuc7u?context=5)|Yes they can and they do -- only in different ways from us.  They are actually more rational, and they don't feel any guilt.  
[Hi Dan, Im wondering what you think of a lot of these referral based programs online.  Since they reward people monetarily for sharing/referring friends, do you think the monetary incentive takes away from the the intrinsic motivation to share/refer someone to a product or service?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/21ri9r/im_social_scientist_and_author_dan_ariely_i_study/cgftrng?context=5)|For sure these programs are anti-social and I think they are likely to hurt relationships.

And I happily took them! So I'm looking forward to examining the chaos firsthand. I've been to Brazil many times, and I mostly worry about the transportation -- but given that nothing will probably start on time and the relaxed approach that Brazilians have to schedules, it will certainly be an interesting experience.

Are we then moral creatures who have occasional lapses or immoral creatures with an occasional shimmer of brilliance? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/21ri9r/im_social_scientist_and_author_dan_ariely_i_study/cgftljb?context=5)|We are often moral. And in fact we lie much less than economic theory would predict.
[Hi Dan, I'm currently taking your Beginner's Guide to Irrational Behavior MOOC on Coursera. I have a couple of questions about it. 1. What has been your biggest surprise based on your MOOC experiences? 2. Have you used any of the data you collect from the MOOC in any of your papers or articles?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/21ri9r/im_social_scientist_and_author_dan_ariely_i_study/cgft7k0?context=5)|We haven't used the data in any papers yet, but we are doing a few studies and we will see. In terms of what has surprised me the most, I'd say it has been the incredible feeling of an international community with the students. 
[Does the irrationality of the human mind undermine the argument for democracy?

I'm hopeful that people could make reasonable decisions from time to time when given the right structure. On top of that, if we have people who are experts they might (sometimes) be in a better position to make better decisions for the rest of us. So I believe in representative democracy that is based on professional and scientific examination of evidence, and using this evidence to make policy decisions.

[Also, do you think MOOCs will disrupt higher education? If so, what are the implications for higher ed administrators to either embrace or evolve to accommodate MOOCs - or put simply, what should universities be doing now that MOOCs are becoming more mainstream (and seem to be on a path to continue to do so\)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/21ri9r/im_social_scientist_and_author_dan_ariely_i_study/cgftqp9?context=5)|I think there will always be a place for higher education. It will evolve, of course, and universities and professors have to figure out how to deal with the complexities that MOOCs bring. I do worry that for the sake of cheaper education we will get more homogenous, less nuanced, less thoughtful education.

21rw8x,232,2014-03-30,[American Dad] Roger is everyone(x-post from /r/shittyfantheories),spartacus_ama,FanTheories,https://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/21rw8x/american_dad_roger_is_everyonexpost_from/,"Original: Think about it, he can move really fast, and likes to play pretend. This also explains the similar voices of characters: He can't keep up too many voices!

Also, he says that everyone has at least one persona they don't recognize, so what if there's more? Also, it's been shown that his personas can develop their own lives(Sidney) that he's not aware of.

Oh, and he's been shown to move and change outfits to talk with himself before.

More evidence: In the episode where Haley starts working as his intern, she shows his same ability to choose outfits quickly and come up with a decent backstory in a few seconds, as well as changing in less than five seconds.

He never gets into serious trouble, and when he does he finds an exploitable way to get out of it. Like in the episode where he gets sent to prison, he's finally in trouble, so he gives his bus driver persona a bad habit of laughing, so he uses it to crash the bus and make it out relatively unscathed. Also, when he wrecks the first police car, a convenient cop pulls up and falls for the same trick.

It's also why some of the voices change to better match the character, when the show first started he didn't know exactly how to portray them, and since he was just beginning his acting career, he didn't get the voices or the personalities exactly how he wanted them; but as he got more experience he felt better at characterizing them, so he gave them more depth and slowly introduced more characters, like Reggie, when he was first introduced he had a dramatically different personality and voice, even though Roger had gotten comfortable with all the other characters.

It also explains why he feels no remorse when fucking over someone else, he knows on some level that it's just a character. Do you think George R.R. Martin feels bad about ruining a characters life?"

I helped her through a lot of terrible things in the last two years but she has always been different. 

Let me explain, roughly a year ago she made out with a friend of mine at a party and lied to me about it. I ended up forgiving her but ever since trust has always been an issue between the me and her. we ended up breaking up about 4 months ago because she always acted like I didn't exist at parties and would blackout then expect me to take her home or take care of her. 

We spent about a month apart and got back together because I had assumed she had changed. It was great for awhile until about 2 weeks ago when she lied to me about going to dinner with this guy who has some pretty extreme feelings for her. 

Whenever I would see him he would glare and then ignore both us when we were out and saw him. She's even mistaken called him as a fake boyfriend before. She ended up being out with this guy for about 6 hours at a restaurant and told me she had fallen asleep early. Now, the only reason I even found out was because I was sure she was lying and checked her phone (I hate this but had to know). 

She told me nothing has happened between the two but given our past history and how flirty she is with this guy makes me doubt that. Now, I'm considering breaking up with her for good because of it. 

We are supposed to both leave for an internship (which her sister does and I used as a referenced) in May where we will be working together and I'm not sure what to do. She blames her behavior on an ex she had that was terrible and incredibly possessive over her. I need some help reddit give me your input and past experience. 

tl:dr girlfriend has lied to me about being out with a guy and I don't know whether to try and make it work or not.

Last summer I had an internship with the company ranked as the highest paying internship in the country. I was one of the few interns to not receive a return offer because my internship position no longer existed as a full time position due to a restructuring in hiring. I go to one of the top schools in the country and I've been rigorously applying to jobs since September. I've had many interviews but have not received a single job offer. All of my friends now have offers and I'm going to be graduating in 4 weeks- possibly without a job lined up. 

I'm still waiting to hear from one company where I thought I did very well interviewing but since it's been a week since my final interview and I haven't heard anything I'm afraid they are going to reject me too. I'm not sure if I'll be able to pick myself back up again after this rejection. I've been fighting for the past few months to keep trying but looking at the deadline for graduation fast approaching I don't know if I can get anywhere with any other company in that time. 

I'm quickly losing faith in my ability to do things and am struggling to finish up my last month of school. I can't even be excited for graduation because all I see waiting for me afterward is failure and I honestly don't think I could live with myself if I reached that point. The only feeling I have felt in the past 3 months is stress and the anxiety and depression that it brings. I have fought my whole life coming from one of the poorest counties in the country to get to this point and now I feel like I've worked so hard for nothing. I'm so tired. I just can't fight anymore..."
21s7m0,1,2014-03-30,I feel like things are crumbling down around me,[deleted],venting,https://www.reddit.com/r/venting/comments/21s7m0/i_feel_like_things_are_crumbling_down_around_me/,"The last few weeks, a series of unfortunate events have occurred that have caused anger and frustration to build up inside me.  I'm in an awkward and undefined relationship with a girl who I have decided I am not interested in romantically, but care about as a friend.  I know she likes me and I have been very stressed thinking about how to salvage our friendship while still breaking things off romantically.  

A second girl, who I am interested in romantically, has been leading me on for a few days now.  On top of this, this girl has had a previous relationship with my best friend where things ended badly.  So I have had to keep my interest in her a secret, and I don't want to hurt my friend but can't help how I feel about her.

I've also been stressed about work.  I put in 100% effort every minute of every day, working 10-12 hour days 6 days a week.  Despite my efforts, i feel unappreciated and unnoticed at work.  My hours have caused me to miss class, which has made my grades fall.  I was hoping for an internship offer for the summer from the company i currently work for, but those hopes are looking more grim with each passing day (Even though i've overheard my bosses talk about how they think im doing a great job).

Finally, I have run for 2 positions in a club I am a member of at my university, and lost both times in very close elections.  Those who vote for the positions are some of my closest friends, and i feel discouraged and annoyed that nobody seems to have confidence in me to take a leadership role.  

Between my falling grades, lack of opportunity at work, and stressing about my social life, I don't know who to talk to or how to fix any of it.  My parents put a lot of pressure on me to succeed, and I feel like I am disappointing them with this constant failure.  I recognize that thinking negatively all the time doesn't help my situation, but I can't help but feel bad.  For now I guess all I can do is put my head down and keep moving forward, but it's getting tougher and tougher to persevere when it feels as though everyone wants me to fail.

I am currently a Junior Software Engineer (very similar to Computer Science) student at UW Platteville.

My Japanese level is conversational but not even close to N2 yet, so I am severely limiting myself to internships and classes in English.

Does anybody know of any summer courses or study abroad schools or even a school I could transfer school that has Computer Science courses in English?

Also, are there any resources outside of my school that I could use to find an internship in Computer Science in Japan?

Thanks!"

21smbh,9,2014-03-30,Home Automation,Sappin,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/21smbh/home_automation/,"Hey guys, so I've been desperately applying for co-ops for a while now and I found out my school has a program for students who have a difficult time finding their first internship.  The basic idea behind the program is a team of 3 students get together, come up with an idea for a start-up and start working on it.  This program isn't limited to just engineers.  I'm finishing my third year of classes and I'm considering trying this program out.  I enjoy working with embedded systems and feel confident in my basic EE skills (circuit analysis, math, all that jazz).

The purpose of this post is to ask if anyone here could provide me with some more insight into the home automation ""industry"" (quotes because I'm not sure if industry is the right word here).  I'm very interested in this for two reasons: 

1) being able to control various things in your home in an easy and convienent way just seems like it would be fun to develop because it gives me a little creative flexibility (as opposed to getting a co-op somewhere and not being in control of what I am making or testing or whatever).

2) As I said, I enjoy working with embedded systems.  I like getting different electronics to work together and home automation seems like it would be a lot of that.

Would proposing a start-up in this area be a smart idea? Would doing this as opposed to finding a co-op be a bad idea?  What companies should I look at for guidance?  Any advice or insight is greatly appreciated :)"

(Some background)

I went to school that has a semi bad reputation (Tech School) and got a degree in Networking even through I wanted one in Software Development. It was okay, graduated with good grades and a big debt. I even worked part time in tech service while I went there to build up some job experience.


Well, fast forward 6 months after graduation, in eternal limbo with a online school and no luck, student debt dues needing to be collected by money or blood.


I've searched around locally for jobs involving 'Junior' or hell, even unpaid Internships and they all require Bachelors in CS or Software. I'm starting to get why no one wants to go to college any more since so many problems plague around it.


(My question)

What am I supposed to do at this point? I've always been tech savy, just with a few problems (Anxiety with driving), and by all means, I can do tech support its just not something I have my heart in. I've always loved computer programming, I do it out of entertainment and almost daily at this point.





My goal is to get a career in Software Engineering. 

My degree is limited to an Associates in Networking.

I have a few laughable projects on Github that shrivel in the mere presence of other's projects.

Is advance schooling really my only hope? Whether by earning a bachelors in Computer Science or Software Development (Along with student debt)


Greatly appreciate any advice,

On a side note: I've read a lot of the of [f.a.q](http://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/wiki/index), found some help there.

(tl;dr) Debt, lack of experience, depression, just wanna code for someone.

Edit: I've gotten a private message they helped me greatly, but I will still continue to respond to anyone else. I really do appreciate any and all advice."

It has been almost a week and they are unavailable and my new hiring manager though has been very patient with me is visibly irritated. I have presented another set of reference however, their refusal or rather avoidance is making me look bad more so, because they are my most recent employer.

I have no idea how to handle this and how to salvage the situation in front of my new company.What is the right course of action in this situation? How can I still get a reference from them? And if possible how to manage the situation from getting any worse?"

ChemE is the bees knees and I really like it but I am not the best ""out-of-classroom"" student. I am fine in the classroom (3.25 gpa but expect it to go down to 3.2 after this semester) but I am terrible at being active. I work ~12 hours a week (coupled with school) I barely have free time for myself let alone extracurricular stuff. I also didn't get any type of internship/coop either (I applied to a ton of places, had a few interviews but no offers.) I am getting anxious. I see my fellow classmates passing me by and I am getting anxiety problems because I feel like I'm getting left behind. It also leaves me with an uncomfortable sense of embarrassment..  Is there anyone out there that can give me some non-generic advice about the next step? I am applying for a research job over the summer that I think I can get at my university and I also want to volunteer my time outside the school during summer. I heard those two things look good on a resume but will it help me get full-time employment? I feel like it is to late to try and save it. I was also thinking about using a semester to retake a couple classes to boost my gpa a bit more and to extend my time at school to hopefully get an extra chance for an internship next year. are these good ideas? am i on the right track now? Sorry if this sounds whinny but I am really clueless where I stand. I am the first kid in my family to go to college so my family isn't much help besides being supportive. I also am the only engineer i know. No uncles or aunts, friends or co-workers that I know to help me network. 

TL;DR: going to be a senior with moderate gpa for industry and no work experience. Want to try to do research and volunteer this summer but dont know if its the right decision. any type of input good, bad, constructive, or comedic will be much appreciated!

p.s. my advisor is not helpful and your guys always leave great advice on other threads so I figured you guys could help"
21t1yh,6,2014-03-31,CS majors: 400 levels dilemma.,mhero18,UMD,https://www.reddit.com/r/UMD/comments/21t1yh/cs_majors_400_levels_dilemma/,"So, I'm currently a rising senior and got two more semesters left since I'm trying to graduate in the four years. I think a few people are/have been in this situation. So for CS majors, we have to take a total of 7 400-level CS courses. I'm currently taking 2, and I need to take 5 more to complete my major requirements. This means I have to take 3 one semester, and 2 another semester. We are only allowed a maximum of 3 400-levels per semester anyway.

My dilemma is whether or not I should just take 1 this summer, and then 2 for my remaining two semesters. So far, these 400 levels have taken quite a bit of time and effort, so it's not a breeze in the park for me. I know for sure I will struggle if I take 3, but not necessarily fail. I would just have to put in a lot of effort. This is also assuming I can even get all the 400-levels that I actually want to take. I'm considering the summer option, but I'm not sure if paying $1300 is worth it. It's a pretty big chunk of money. I don't have a job or internship right now, and my parents have already been paying so much for both me and brother's college, so I would feel bad asking them.

So, should I just go ahead and pay $1300 for the summer, or should I suck it up and attempt to do 3 400-levels? Or other options/advice?
Thanks!

Side Question: Is ENGL393 beneficial/worth it to me as a CS major, or should I take another one of the 39X classes that I may find more interesting? Thanks!"

21t604,2,2014-03-31,"To start a record company, sole proprietorship or corporation?",[deleted],Music,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/21t604/to_start_a_record_company_sole_proprietorship_or/,"What are the odds that a sole proprietor will be sued by nuiscance lawsuit jerks, for someone simply attempting to sell music and CDs?

To anyone who has officially started their own vanity ""record label"" (Manufacturing company),

* ***did you do it as a sole proprietor or as a corporation?***

=== === 

**Step 2: Create a Company**

""It's not as glamorous as a lot of people imagine - it's a lot of paperwork and filing forms with the government,"" said Chris Williams, who recently started the label *Desiccant Records: Do Not Eat!* According to Heraty, the best thing to do is create a separate legal entity: your company. She recommends a limited liability company(also known as an LLC), which is both more flexible and less formal than a corporation. LLCs are easier to form than corporations and are not subject to the same formal requirements, such as annual reports and board of director meetings.

The ""limited liability"" part of the name means that company members are protected against personal liability for the liabilities of the company (except in instances of fraud or blatant illegality). Essentially, the members of an LLC are only responsible for what they put into the company and they aren't personally responsible for business debts. Sole proprietorships and partnerships, other kinds of companies, do not provide company owners with limited liability.

Decide if you want to be the boss on your own or if you want a partner. There are advantages and disadvantages to both. Williams feels having complete ownership over his label allows him total artistic freedom. Heraty, though, suggested working with a partner because ""it is easier to spread the responsibilities out and it broadens the range of any new business.""

**Step 3: Think of a Cool Name**

PinkStripes Records

Jumping Bean Records

Island Rock Records

My Record Company...

Whatever you come up with, make sure it hasn't already been trademarked, especially if you plan on expanding the label in the future.

It can be expensive (around $300 for the base trademark fee) to trademark your name, but it's better than making all the CD covers and discovering that someone not only has already registered your name, but that you're being issued a cease and desist letter and are involved in a lawsuit.

You can look at the Federal Trademark Register or online to see if someone's already taken your brilliant idea.

**Step 4: Review and Fill Out the Paperwork**

Limited liability companies and corporations are, according to Heraty, ""creatures of the state, not the federal government."" As such, to start the limited liability company or a corporation, there is a state fee involved. Illinois, one of the most expensive in the country, charges $400 for Limited Liability Companies, but that will go up to $500 in December 2003, according to the Illinois Secretary of State's Office. Depending on the state you live in it could cost anywhere from $100 to $1,500, since there can also be a fee in some states for publishing requirements.

The paperwork to register your company with the state of Illinois isn't that extensive. The forms are offered on the secretary of state's Web site, along with a listing of the charges. It's a two-page form and the information, although fairly basic, should be looked at by a lawyer or someone else in the business. It's called ""articles of organization.""
If you are forming the LLC with a partner you should create an operating agreement. Some states require this to start the company. Generally a lawyer drafts this and it governs the way the company is run. Prices can vary - Heraty Law, for instance, will draw up a simple operating agreement for about one billable hour.

**Step 5: Start a Business Bank Account**

Once you've created and named your company, you'll apply for a federal tax identification number, which is like a social security number for your company.

Account for every penny spent and make sure everything involved with the company's finances stays separate from your own. Start a credit card for the company and use it just for that. No dinners or clothes or runs to the drugstore. Just the company.
Heraty recommended buying money-managing software to keep track of everything. There should be a credit card, a checking account, and a petty cash amount. Many things are tax-deductible. If you are interested in signing artists, you can meet with a potential artist in a bar, and, if you pay for drinks, it has the potential to be tax-deductible. Heraty suggested talking to an accountant before counting on all the tax deductions, however.

""People need to take the time to become financially literate. This is crucial: It will make or break you,"" Heraty said.

**Step 6: Sign Other Bands**

If you want to sign other bands, you should pay them some sort of an advance and then they could use the money for studio time plus salary for engineers and day-players. Tony Piscotti, who just released his first album ""Soapbox Parade,"" estimated the necessary upfront cost at about $10,000. Grey Flight Records, a Chicago-based label, started with three bands and has grown to five. Grant Quick, co-founder of the label, describes the experience of growing and working with his friends as the ""greatest thing about my label so far.""

Signing other bands is more than just putting up money - there's should be a signed agreement as well. If it's a band with an existing CD, there has to be a licensing agreement, which means the band gives the label the right to manufacture, sell, and distribute that CD. If the band or artist doesn't already have an album, however, there's an artist recording agreement. This includes things like who pays for studio time and what royalty/profit percentage cuts are.

One structure for these agreements is a 50/50 situation: a record label and an artist get together and they put out the artist's record together. Instead of royalty structure, they share the expenses then split the profits equally.

""It's a revolution in the record industry,"" Heraty said. ""It's more fair and it's more appealing to people in our community who really love the music and want to have a fair deal all around.""

**Step 7: Become Famous, Accumulate Fabulous Wealth, Etc.**

Well, that's the plan, anyway. If your record label and the bands on it are successful, you can hire interns from local colleges and universities to help you out. If you have three or more bands on the label, consider doing a showcase at local bars and venues. Create postcards to promote your bands and your label.

**Step 8: Love What You Do**

(Enough said.)

. . .

Starting your own record label can be a real advantage for indie bands who are either tired of seeing demo tapes rejected or just don't want to deal with the impersonal qualities of a large record company.
It's not as complicated as it might seem (although can get expensive) to form your own company and it does have its advantages.

""It can be easier - and much less heartbreaking - to form your own label,"" Williams said. ""You get total creative control over what you do and what you release.""

Will these steps include every eventuality that might come up? No, but they should make starting your label more like finding a helpful accountant and less like getting an IRS audit."

  I hope I'm in the right subreddit, if not let me know. I have been dealing with some mental health issues for a long time now and I just wanted to write everything down and possibly even get some useful advice. I am really in a need of an uplifting comment from you guys. I apologize for the long wall of text in advance and to compensate I would like to buy someone gold or pay them if their comment genuinely helps me or uplifts me and gives me advice on how to sort my life out.  
  
  Let me first give some background about myself, I have always been a shy person (I hate to admit this) and never was able to just make friends. I used to be painfully shy as a child but I have been getting more 'open' as I have aged. I am still very shy around girls, especially in an informal environment. I don't know if I have ever been truly happy, maybe before my teens but I have never been satisfied with myself as a person. I was never very close to my parents, or anyone for that matter. I have never had a girlfriend until a month ago, although not really sure what that relationship was.  

  I moved to Canada in 2011 as an international student for higher education, and things have been a downfall mentally ever since I got here. 2012 was the worst year of my life, I went through something I cannot even explain in words. I didn't feel alive, I was in a very high state of anxiety. It was a sort of turning point in my life, and ever since that year I have questioned my mental health. This thought of whether Im feeling ok or not has consumed me, I worry everyday about it. The last two years have been a mix of some good days and bad days, and I have tried to make changes in my life since I realized how important people and relationships are in life. I try to exercise and eat healthy and have limited my consumption of caffeine and alcohol.  

  Fortunately, in 2013 I got my internship as a IT support analyst where I got to speak to a lot of people everyday. This helped me a lot with my social skills and confidence. This period of 4 months was a relatively ok period. For the first time in 2 years I had money of my own to spend. Things were looking a little brighter. There was this girl who I liked who used to be in the library everyday (the place where I worked), to my surprise she added me on facebook and we started talking. I asked to meet (which was something I never thought myself capable of) and we went out like 4-5 times over a period of two months. She wasn't ""the one"" but I just wanted to have someone in my life, and she seemed to like me very much. A month back she broke up with me saying that we are very different people (which I agree with) and that she wasn't ready for a relationship. I guess she lied whenever she said that she had a good time, but I genuinely had a good time with her. This whole episode has shook me mentally and I have gotten myself in a downward spiral. Although I have a lot of study related stress too so that might also be a factor. This past week as been especially disturbing. I'll try to explain what exactly I go through now.  

  I have these ""attacks"" or ""periods"" of anxiety and/or depression in which I cannot concentrate on anything, I have to force myself to do everything and I feel very weird. I have no physiological symptoms like rapid heart rate so I don't think its a panic attack. I also feel anxiety when I'm around a lot of artificial light, which I think is a possible trigger for these episodes sometimes. These ""episodes"" don't last a whole day and so I swing between optimism and pessimism, feeling abnormal and normal. When I feel relatively normal, it doesn't feel like mania. I have no trouble sleeping most nights and neither do I get especially interfering racing thoughts during those periods of normalcy. I feel so angry when I think about the reason behind this as I don't have any real problems in my life that aren't fixable. I also have become very sensitive to criticism or anything negative being said about me. I just dont know why things affect me so much now. These episodes of depression and anxiety are the only real problem I have and it troubles me very deeply and I cant stop thinking about them. I don't know what to do anymore, I just want a fair chance at improving my life like everyone else and my share of happiness from this world.  

  Sorry if I my english sounds a bit weird or if I made some mistakes. English isnt my first language. If someone can give me actual advice on what I could do that'd be great. And thanks for reading."
21txox,3,2014-03-31,Going back for a second degree. A little scared of the loans piling up.,hibbert0604,StudentLoans,https://www.reddit.com/r/StudentLoans/comments/21txox/going_back_for_a_second_degree_a_little_scared_of/,"Greetings everyone! I am set to start classes in May for a degree in Computer Science. It will take me 2 years to finish. This will be my second degree. The first, I am ashamed to say is one that I just did not put enough thought into. I ended up majoring in geography and I can't really cite a reason as to why. I then decided that I wanted to take that into a career of Geographic Information Systems. I began tinkering with computers my senior year, however and really began to wish that I had majored in CSCI, something I found I was genuinely interested in, but I was happy enough where I was at and didn't let it bother me. 

I graduated and began an internship under the zoning commissioner of my college town. I HATED it. The job was nothing but endless stress and deadlines of doing things that I was never taught in my two years of GIS classes. I began having fairly bad health problems due to stress by the end of the internship. It probably didn't help that I had another job at the same time, but I have worked two jobs most of my college career with no problems like that. That job just drained me of the will to get up in the morning. 

Anyway, once I completed the internship I moved back home with my parents to begin the actual job search. It began to get quite disparaging quickly, however, because almost every entry level job wanted two things I didn't have. An extensive knowledge of programming languages, or multiple years of experience. I was able to get two consulting jobs working from home, however they were very limited in the number of hours I could work, so it basically just gave me random small injections of cash. Nothing I could live off of and they both eventually ended. And to be honest, I had the same problem with those jobs I did with my internship. 

I have recently decided that I want to commit to doing something that I actually have a genuine interest in and pursue a degree in computer science. I have been using online resources to begin to learn the basic foundation of programming and I really enjoy it. The scary part is going back to school and paying for it. I currently owe 18k on my wasted first degree and from the rough estimate I did in my head it will cost another 26 k for these next two years. That totals up to 44k in debt and that scares the hell out of me. I also feel like it will most likely end up being higher than that due to unforeseen costs not accounted for in my estimation. My question is basically this. Is this a terrible idea? "

21ueoa,5,2014-03-31,"Life, post breakup depression.",wutdoom27,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/21ueoa/life_post_breakup_depression/,"Idk how many people will read this, but it's worth of a shot. 

I'm a 23 year old guy who has suffered from anxiety/depression for some time now. I guess I always knew since I was little that there was something weird going on in my head, but it wasn't until my teen years that I was able to give it a name or something. I had a great childhood. Had a lot of friends, always had something to do, etc. I was never the best when it came to girls but at the time I didn't really care. When I first started high school, I also had a good number of friends and was fairly active socially. Beginning my sophomore year I started to isolate myself. For my junior year my family moved to a total different part of the country. With my social anxiety it was very hard for me to make friends. I mean I had people who I talked to during school, but that was it. Didn't do anything outside of school. I spent the summers after my sophomore, junior, and senior years at home 24/7. 

When college came around, I moved to an apartment near campus. The school was only 40 minutes from my home. I shared the apartment with another guy who had jus graduated high school too. I was excited about moving out and hopefully seeing a change in my life, especially my social life. Things didn't really change. I still wasn't making friends, didn't really like my roommate and stuff. Since I was only 40 minutes away from home, I started going home every weekend. I would just come back to what I already knew. During my freshman year I discovered the world of online social media. I became pretty active in using Twitter and such to meet friends. It was super easy to just find friends online. I had people to talk to without the social anxiety. I even starting talking to this girl who lived in another part of country, and we seemed to like each other. At the time I was enjoying just having friends I guess. 

The summer after my freshman year I began talking to this other girl I met online (2010). We emailed back and forth, talked on the phone, etc. We started a relationship. I was 19 and it was the first time I had a girl friend (if you want to call it that). It was pretty cool. I found out that she had been with two guys before and from the beginning that was tough on me. I guess it was a combination of me being insecure as well as my anxiety/depression. I obsessed over the fact that two idiots out there could say they had been intimate with the girl I really liked. It's one of the strangest things but I couldn't stop picturing it. Of course I didn't want to. It went as far as me digging through old social media posts to find out who these guys were, what they looked like, etc. All just to feed my obsession and fuel my anxiety/depression. From the start this was a problem between us. I wanted to break up with her a couple of times early on, but for the first time in my life it felt like I might not end up alone. 

On the surface things got better as time went on. For a few months I didn't bring up how that bothered me. We texted nonstop, shared pictures, etc. She had always talked about how in the summer of 2012 she would be able to move to where I was. I had always went along with it. We were talking about spending the rest of our lives together. After a year of being ""together"", summer of 2011, I freaked out. I hit a low point. I hated that I had missed out so much on my teenage years and other things. I couldn't think about being with anyone really. So I broke it up. I know I broke her heart bad and I hate that. 

My junior year I started worrying about graduation which was coming up in less than a couple years. I did fairly well in school, but the thought of having to interview and having a job terrified me. I started seeing a psychiatrist and was put on medication (Paxil). I don't know if it was the medication or what, but somehow I found myself going through interviews for internships. Things became ever weirder when I was getting an offer out of every interview. It was a huge confidence booster. I spent the summer of 2012 in a good internship and for the first time in a long time I was myself around people. And people liked me. I was funny and interesting. 

Going back to school for senior year that continued. I met tons of people my senior year. It was amazing to finally be myself and see that people enjoyed me. I was invited to social outings, people knew my name, etc, etc. A few months before graduation I started dating a girl I had met in one of my classes. I had never been so confident in going after a girl before. I really liked her, but once we started dating, the same issue I had before came up. This girl had been with a lot more guys, closer to 10. It wasn't easy. I went down the same spiral as before. I went through social media and tried to find out as much as I could about these guys. It was awful how much I obsessed over it. I didn't want to be that way. I tried to explain my situation as best I could, but I don't think I communicated well enough. I was really worried about her talking to exes and stuff, and she agreed that she wouldn't talk or see any of them. She had a group of friends she hung out with, and every time she hung out with them I became paranoid. Her last ex was also part of that group of friends, although he had moved a couple hours away. My paranoia led to problems as she could tell how I felt when she hung out with them. It came off as controlling and jealous. Although all those things bothered me, I really liked her. Might have loved her. 

I graduated with highest honors from a tough major, had a a great job lined up, had a girlfriend, etc. I felt on top of the world and looked like things were changing. 

After dating for over 7 months, she ended the relationship. Her reasoning was that she wanted to be alone. I know I pushed her away. The breakup was very tough on me. I didn't see how I could go on as she had become a huge part of my life. I adored her. Even after the breakup I continued to obsess over shit about her exes and that she was going to start dating, etc. It's been over 5 months now and I'm really not doing any better. I think about her way too much. We've talked on the phone a couple times since then. She has assured me she isn't interested in seeing anyone or anything. I miss the times we had and I miss having a real best friend. I'm in constant state of nostalgia, where even the smallest things remind me of things we did. It sucks. I've tried to cut her off from social media as much as possible because I don't want to see her random posts and become upset, seeing her enjoyed life while I drown in misery. 

Moving forward is tough. I'm upset over many things I can't change. I'm upset over the missed experiences I've had. I'm upset that I didn't have a high school girlfriend to lose my virginity to together and have that experience forever. At the same time, I'm happy that I lost it to someone I felt very strongly about. But I guess it still wasn't as special as I believe it should be. I think about all those years I spent sitting at home while she was out and about being a normal person. 

What is scary is that even after we broke up I still feel like this. Even if I meet someone else, I know I'll go down the road of obsessing over her past. I kinda tell myself that it would be cool to meet someone who is 18 or 19 who hasn't had a lot of experience, if any, with other guys yet.  

I'm not proud of a lot these things, but it's honestly the way I feel. I don't want to be this way, don't want to obsess over stupid shit, but it's just so hard not to. I know there' s a predisposition in my brain to feel this way. And it sucks. And idk how it can get better. 

I guess what makes it worse is that I have no reason to feel this way. I know I can be interesting, funny, caring, nice, etc. I know I'm a fairly good looking guy. I'm smart. I'm making money that a lot of people at my age would kill to make. A lot of things are going my way, yet I can't shake this depression off. "

Every day, I become closer to fitting the bill of my old self before my family tore me down. Even though I see and feel the fear and shame with which they regard me I decided enough was enough. I refused to be a victim any longer. I could have continued laying there, accepting that my culture, the religion I was indoctrinated into and my family were shafting me or I could take my life back into my hands. I hope my story gives strength to those who are still in a difficult position or have been in the past. 

I applied to every job I possibly could before landing an internship (paid) at a prestigious PR agency. I've taken it by the horns. I am making this job my bitch. When I announced the news of this, I saw the worry set across my parents faces. They're aware of what my financial freedom implicates. But I made sure to spread the word to all of our relatives, all of whom don't know about the situation and they were extremely happy for me. This also meant that my parents couldn't forbid me from taking up this job as they'd then have to explain their actions to our relatives.

This doesn't mean they haven't tried to sabotage my success, however. My mother has been texting me abuse whilst I've been at the office and accusing me of lying about doctor's appointments and working late. The truth is however, I have been dealing with the physical repercussions of intense stress, depression and anxiety and so I have been in and out of the doctor's office and I am working late to ensure I get kept on by the company. When I told her she was irrational and deluded and that she should recognise she has a hard working and sick daughter, she decided to ice me out. So we haven't spoken for quite some time and frankly, I prefer it this way. I leave for work early in the morning and don't come home until the late evening. I have minimal contact with them and it's wonderful to have something to focus on. Also, I took a tequila shot and rapped the opening verse to still Dre with my boss at a work event last week. Life is looking up.  

I'm making arrangements to move out of my parent's place upon confirmation of a permanent position which should be, providing all goes to plan - within the next couple of months. The prospect of this gives me strength and clarity. I can't wait to have my life back. 

Thank you all for your kindness and support. "

I have never dated anyone in college, becoming more and more reclusive and weird as time passed.

I had a lot of good friends, lost almost all of them. They think I'm self absorbed and they're sort of right. After a year at college, I felt so confused about the field I was in. I hated programming but was in Computer Science. But I had no idea what I wanted to do and so I stuck with something I didn't enjoy. 

I started reading slash fanfiction as a weird coping mechanism. I was literally an addict, shutting off the external world. I spent hours and hours reading fic, finding the romance and feelings that I lacked in real life in the stories. It's stupid and embarrassing to spend so much time on this. 

Last summer, I got an internship at an amazing place and it was the best thing that ever happened to me. Except, my bad sleep schedule, fanfiction addiction and lack of self-discipline made me a horrible intern. I didn't properly complete any of my projects. This is probably the biggest regret I have, because I finally found something I loved and I screwed it up. I'm so embarrassed by how poorly I performed.

Since then, I have spent my last year at college hating myself. I have been flunking away, missing job application deadlines, continuing to be unreliable and going more into my shell. The horror of the fact that I have wasted 4 years of my life keeps hitting me, and I swear I am going to change my ways, but I don't take action. I have the same shitty unproductive days, one after the other. The hypothetical ""tomorrow"" where I start over has never come.

So what I want to get off my chest is, I hate myself. There's so much self loathing for my past, for every decision I made. My confidence is shot to hell. I don't think I will ever be able to change my ways, find a way back to the company I did my internship in. I don't think I can ever be with someone.

The funny thing is that I used to be this star student in high school, and a total perfectionist, type-A person about everything in my life. I used to be so outgoing, caring and considerate. What the hell happened. I can't believe I've messed everything up. I wish I could go back.

Really sorry for the huge post, didn't realize I wrote so much."

I'm a couple semesters away from graduating college, this summer I'll be applying to medical schools. This has been my dream for as long as I can remember, unfortunately my grades are not where I want them to be and my chances are very very very slim if they even exist at all.

On top of this I am trying to better my odds at getting accepted to any medical school by finding related work. A few months ago I managed to convince a lab researcher to take me on for a few months as an intern. I applied for funding two months ago and today I was informed that my application was unsuccessful and that I will not be getting funding. I screwed up by letting my grades get so low when I was 18 and 19 and now that I'm almost 22 and trying to rectify the matter, things just seems to keep getting screwed up for me.

This has been bumming me out more than anything else has ever before. I wake up in a funk, I spend my entire day in a funk and I end it in a funk and I don't really know how to shake this feeling. I'm used to waking up the next morning and forgetting whatever's bothering me from the night before but this has been ongoing for a while and I don't really know what to do.

I still have work ahead of me and this is seriously affecting me ability to get anything done, I just sort of feel hopeless. I need to get my head on straight and cheer my self up so I can get back into the swing of things and at least finish my degree on a high note but I just don't know how to. On top of that, i'm seeing everyone around me and their successes and it just makes me feel like a failure.

I feel like I've fucked up my whole life and the goals I had set for myself because  I wanted to party and enjoy myself and not do a single productive thing when I was 18. Now I'm worried that I'll never reach my goal. 


There's even this girl back home who I really like and  I think she likes me but I've been lying to her about how things in my life are going especially about the potential for medical school. I thought I was going to have this internship, but even that's been shot down. She really prides herself on success and looks for it in other people, and I know I can be successful, I just need the chance, but I can't seem to get it.

I wouldn't say I'm doing any of this for her, I really truly want it for myself. I just don't want this image of me stuck in mediocrity to be something she sees. I'd rather her idealize me even if it isn't based on reality than know how badly I fucked myself over through my own actions. Success is something that's clearly important to her and while I'm not in a successful place now, I want to be, and I'll work for it, I just don't know how yet. The last thing I want is for her to think less of me.

Any advice on how to get out of this?

A few weeks ago I was offered a position at a company in New York City which I accepted since it was a good position and I had not received any other offers. 

Today I received another offer from a company which is very close to my University where I already have an apartment over the summer. Both positions are about the same when it comes to experience and pay, but I would save a lot more money taking the position at the second company since getting another apartment in New York City over the summer would be very expensive. I didn't sign a contract with my first company, and they even specified that both parties can decide to break the agreement at any time.  Still I feel bad taking another offer after I already accept the first one. Is it bad form to take a better offer if it comes along after accepting with another company?

Ultimately I would be fine working for either company, it would just be much more convenient and cost effective to take the second offer. I realize that this is a far better problem to have than not getting any offers at all. I just wanted to get some outside opinions."

I'm going to Houston for a summer internship June-August this summer and am looking for a place to stay. I was here last year, and want something different. I'll work in Sharpstown right off of the beltway, and I stayed in a room in Pearland for $500 a month last year. It was nice, but the commute was 20 miles (not too bad for traffic, but still far) and I want to be closer. I've scoured CL and Padmapper and things aren't going well - month to month is hard to find. I'd love to live inside the loop, I really missed out on a lot of social life being so far away so I'm asking you all for help! Sharpstown was a little hood for me so I don't want to be living there, any suggestions on where I should live? College student, like to go out and all. I'm willing to pay more than what I was paying before to be closer and to spend less on gas, tolls, and have a shorter commute. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated! I can't wait to go back. Any other Redditors looking for a place too?"

I have an interview in a few days for a Support Engineer position. I will finish this year CS with a specialization in information systems. I am Spanish, and they are hiring a lot of Spanish speaking people for the ""latin america"" clients.

I've been told they thought the hana team was a good team for me. I think I can fit well in the support position because I like more the ""business side"" of IT, and think I would like being in contact with clients. Maybe I would prefer ""consulting"" instead of support, but I don't really know the differences and how I will like them, so sticking to this position is a good idea. 

Also, I've been told the job would require traveling, which is a plus for me(I know it can be hard after some time...).

Any advice for the interview?

From what I`ve been told, they usually ask you about your work experience and about how you dealt with situations at work, and some ""soft"" technical questions...

Thanks in advance"

To make a long story short, I have been an automotive mechanic since high school but I decided to go to college in 2007.  I graduated back in 2011 with my B.S. in Aerospace Administration and minor in Business Management.  I have been trying to get a decent job in the aerospace industry since I graduated but it is proving futile and my heart just isn't in it anymore.

I am very technically and mechanically inclined and have always enjoyed working on and with computers but I failed to realized that when I decided to go to college.  I have been doing the occasional computer repair side job through friends and family over the years but I don't hold any certifications right now.  I want to get into the IT field but I don’t know how to go about doing it since I work full time and most IT positions require experience and most of them are on the north side of Atlanta.  I’m willing to relocate for work since I’m not married and have no kids but I want to make sure I’ll be satisfied wherever I go because I have moved quite a few times since I graduated trying to chase different jobs.  The other question is I’m not sure what concentration I want to get into since I am a very hands-on person.  Also, should I pursue certifications or go back to college for another degree?  I’m considering more schooling because I have a really hard time studying on my own without having some sort of deadline to follow plus I will have the opportunity to do an internship while in school.

**TL;DR:  I'm 30 and I have my B.S. in Aerospace Admin but I can't get a job in the field without experience (common problem).  I'm passionate about computers and technology in general and I want to break into the IT industry.  How do I get experience without going broke (i.e. $15/hr. desktop support)?  Should I pursue more schooling, just concentrate on certifications, or what?**"

We first started dating the last few weeks of January. We met in a 5 week class that we took together and had a project that we worked on for two weeks. After those two weeks I asked her out. The class only met once a week, so aside from seeing her there, we for the most part, saw each other everyday. Some days it was just a 20 minute chat- others it would've been for a couple of hours. This went on for a month. Our affection towards each other was like any new relationship. We made out. Kind of explored each others bodies (even though we haven't had sex, it really almost felt like we were going to any day). 

So now its almost the end of February and I decided we would have a mini version of ""the talk"". I just wanted to know what exactly we were doing, and basically if she was still interested in seeing other people. We come to the conclusion that hey, we both do like each other, and that for the past month or however long, we haven't been seeing other people. 

Well, about a week ago, we went on a date and she had a pretty stressful week at school. I knew from the start that her summer plans were to include an internship, so she would be gone 3 months. She tells me that I don't have to stick around. I ask her what she means by this. She replies with, you know I will be gone all summer, and that she doesn't want to stop me from doing my own thing (hooking up with other females). Well at this point we still have not had sex. Our affection hasn't been at the levels it was when we first started dating but that's because we really haven't been on a date in a while. We both have been really busy with school so we just see each other there about once a week. Also since we realized that we do like each other, that we will be taking things a lot slower, which is fine by me.

Anyways, I basically tell her that I dont care to have sex with as many girls as possible over the summer. I told her that I like what we have and would continue doing with whatever we have going on. We talk some more and before we part ways she simply just reminds me that the option to leave is still on the table if I wanted. 

So all week long, I have thought more and more into it. Is this really an out for me? Or is it an out for her? Is this a red flag? I know that she has guy friends, one in particular to whom she talks too a lot, but they have always talked a lot so nothing out of the ordinary. It does make me a little insecure that he is almost 100% her type of person, but either way, she has been with me when she could have been with him. So unless something drastic changed that I don't know..


tl;dr: Is this a giant red flag that we need to have a further discussion on?"

My question is about how to change locations after you graduate. I live in the NYC area and I feel like I'd like to get a job and live in Austin tx. Should I be sending out for summer internships in Austin, which would cost quite a bit, or should I intern here in NYC and wait until I graduate to looking for a job there?

I really do not want to get a job in NYC for a few years then move. I'm kind of antsy I guess and I have been for a few years now.

Another question I have is after I graduate should I just move and get something to pay the bills until I find what I'm looking for or should I wait in NY until I get an interview. 

Thank you for any advice."
