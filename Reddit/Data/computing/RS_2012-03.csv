qd8j7,3,2012-03-01,Finishing my degree: bad idea to do an applications programming internship instead of faculty-recommended classes in systems programming and security?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/qd8j7/finishing_my_degree_bad_idea_to_do_an/,"I have a year of lower-division college CS credits in object-oriented and procedural programming in Java and Python, conceptual foundations (binary representations, machine/assembly language basics, vocabulary), and another two quarters of advanced work in operating systems concepts, some really basic kernel programming, data structures in C and C++, and networking and security overview. I need one more quarter of upper-division CS work to graduate with a bachelor of science.

I was just offered a paid part-time internship at a local small business, doing applications programming in a high-level language, probably Ruby on Rails or PHP. I would be able to get the credits I need to finish my BS with this internship and just one more class (Analysis of Algorithms) and I'm really, really tempted. I'm feeling pretty damn burnt out on school lately, I've always enjoyed applications programming more than more hardware-aware work, and making money sounds obviously superior to not making money.

But I know that my faculty will strongly encourage me to stick with the default curriculum for the last quarter of a CS major, which is systems programming and security, and so I'm looking for feedback here about how much weight I should give that advice. It's the same story for both subjects -- useful and somewhat interesting stuff, I'm glad to know what I've already learned, but I just don't get excited about it. I do enjoy writing in C and C++ (notably unlike a lot of my classmates), and I found the academic exploration of networking protocol stacks fascinating, but kernel programming and network administration don't appeal to me as careers. To top it off, I feel like the professors that teach those two classes don't add much to the understanding I get from the textbooks, so if I change my mind later, I could very well get 95% of the benefit just by buying the book and teaching it to myself.

Am I making a mistake here? Is there something important I'm not considering? One side of my brain screams, ""no, you idiot, internship is obvious win"", but the other side says I don't have enough information about my future desires and what employers would prefer to see....I have decision fatigue, help me out."

Questions|Answers
:--|:--
[Would you recommend a masters or doctorate for someone in your field? Do you have any insight into BME based startups?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qbb5u/iama_biomedical_engineer_inventing_and_making/c3w8mjp?context=5)|Not really, my grad degree was worth $4k a year, not really a wise ROI. The flip side is it could lead you to a job opportunity, it could be up to you. For doctorate, it could be worth it, but your faculty adviser will pressure you to go into academia, which is very cut throat.  BME startups are where innovation is centered around. It is exciting, fast moving, and also high risk. 9 out of 10 will go bankrupt, 19 out of 20 will not make it to market, you're asked to go above and beyond the 9 to 5 engineering job. But I love it and will recommend a young engineer to try it out.
[How different is the day to day life of a biomedical engineer in comparison to say a mechanical or civil engineer? Do you Spend more of your time in an office or laboratory?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qbb5u/iama_biomedical_engineer_inventing_and_making/c3w7ocr?context=5)|All depends on where the project is or what needs to be done. So early on, we will try different stuff, in lab and playing with pig hearts and making stuff on the go. Then as it matures, it becomes more paper work and relying on vendors or manufacturing techs, so then becomes more office work. I'd say there's more time in lab than mech or civil engineer.
[How much money do you make per year?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qbb5u/iama_biomedical_engineer_inventing_and_making/c3w8jei?context=5)|After grad school, I started at 70k, and 8 years in, I'm making 110k right now. That plus bonus and stock options.
[PhD or MS? How does the bonus system work?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qbb5u/iama_biomedical_engineer_inventing_and_making/c3wa4yt?context=5)|MS, bonus basically is meeting the goal that is set by my supervisor. If I meet half the goals, I get 5k.
[You have pictures of the prototypes?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qbb5u/iama_biomedical_engineer_inventing_and_making/c3w7xuc?context=5)|You can google the word Corevalve and see a relative example of my prototype.[corevalve](http://cdn.medgadget.com/img/corevalve.jpg)
[What's your favorite device that's currently under clinical trials?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qbb5u/iama_biomedical_engineer_inventing_and_making/c3w7xuc?context=5)|That also is one of the most exciting device right now in the US. To do valve repair procedure without doing open heart surgery, faster recovery and less pain, there are draw backs though. Won't be as effective and could lead to stroke, so for now it's for an targeted patient population. There are two similar trials going on, one by Medtronic and another by Edwards.
[Was that EDMed out of Nitinol?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qbb5u/iama_biomedical_engineer_inventing_and_making/c3wa21l?context=5)|I think Corevalve was stainless steel and Sapien is NiTi.
[I'm also a biomedical engineer and am on my way to getting my masters next year. I was wondering if your company is looking for any interns this summer. How challenging is it do design these prototypes? Do you use SolidWorks? Do you test biocompatibilty in-vitro?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qbb5u/iama_biomedical_engineer_inventing_and_making/c3w8jee?context=5)|In general, the medical device industry is hiring, and job future looks good. The hardest part is breaking in, getting that first internship job or know someone to give you a chance, it's part of the issue with a regulated industry. I would warn about startups though, you could end up joining and company goes bankrupt in months.  Prototypes come in several flavors, (1) just a mock up (2) functional (3) pre-frozen design. I've made mock up and functional prototypes from homedepot and arts&amp;craft stuff. Some people can do it and some can't.  We use Solidworks, but not necessary in prototyping.  We test biocompatibility several ways, the most stringent is to grind it up and implant it in animals. The easiest is to put some cells on it and measure how many survived. But all the tests have to be done to satisfy regulatory requirements.
[What do you need to know to do prototyping?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qbb5u/iama_biomedical_engineer_inventing_and_making/c3wa7jp?context=5)|Not much, maybe the difference between screwdriver and hammer? Some people can't prototype though, I think a good indicator is if he/she is confident (not necessarily good) about fixing a house.
[As someone who is currently an undergrad studing BME, what is the job availability for Bachelors, Masters, etc?  Also, are their any specific technologies or ideas in the industry that are quite interesting, but relatively unknown?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qbb5u/iama_biomedical_engineer_inventing_and_making/c3w8kx4?context=5)|It's a regulated industry, but I would suggest you look into internship, that'll give you best chance to get a job when you leave school, to have that connection. It's a small industry and everyone know everyone, so that connection matters more than being a MechE or EE.  I think it's interesting that as more drugs are taken off the market, more medical devices are being relied on to help these patients. There are always interesting ideas worked on by people, usually in areas of cardiovascular and orthopedic where there's the most money, but they usually keep it a secret. For many good reasons.
[In my biology and neuroscience classes I always used to drift off in my mind and imagine biomechanically enhanced superhuman warriors.   Do you think in the future humans will be able to be significantly enhanced mentally and physically via neurological/biochemical/mechanical implants?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qbb5u/iama_biomedical_engineer_inventing_and_making/c3w8ayf?context=5)|How far in the future? In our life time? Probably only in certain areas of physical implants. The biggest issue with implants is how it is biocompatible, deal with tissue growth, and how it is maintained. So take artificial hearts, most of the implantable ones only have a short term battery, so you won't die when changing the main battery that's hanging outside your body. Things that might happen might be prosthetic that can make you run faster and jump higher, that'll probably happen soon.
[What if I told you that our lifetime will not be limited?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qbb5u/iama_biomedical_engineer_inventing_and_making/c3w9r6o?context=5)|Then.... I guess yes   ...?
[I'm currently getting my undergrad in mechanical with a concentration in biomechanics and I am pretty sure I'd be looking into a Masters or a PhD afterward.  My question is, which should I go for and should I first get a job with a company that would help compensate some of the costs or should I first get the advanced degree and then look for a better job?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qbb5u/iama_biomedical_engineer_inventing_and_making/c3w8pdm?context=5)|I did both, where I applied for jobs and grad schools. I ended up not finding a lot of job prospects, where I wished I did more internship while I was an undergrad. So grad school made sense for me. You should probably be aware that most BME grad schools are able to support the student's tuition and stipend, in return for research (which is great for your resume). I'd say the better reason to go to grad school is the thesis work, research exp, and industry connection. I don't have any comments on the course work, wouldn't want to offend the university professors :)
[Where'd you go to school, and how is the job market for BME's?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qbb5u/iama_biomedical_engineer_inventing_and_making/c3w8uqf?context=5)|I would say, it's not where you go to school, but what you did with it that counts. Where I went to school did nothing for me in terms of grad school and first job out of grad school. 1/3 of people I work with came from no-name schools.   Carnegie Mellon University. I guess I shouldn't have said the phrase, it means different things for different people.
[How long before replacing one's heart with a mechanical one is common?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qbb5u/iama_biomedical_engineer_inventing_and_making/c3w7vib?context=5)|Well, that's a tough question. Advancements are so swift but there has been so many failures. The last company that did this was Abiomed, and after 5 patients they stopped their trial. The hard part is not making an artificial heart that can pump but adjusting it to match the response of the body.  There are some studies done by universities by individuals, but it will be a good 20 years before it becomes common. Especially if you consider how long it takes to do clinical studies and prove it's efficacy to regulatory bodies.
[I'm just entering an undergrad degree of Biomedical Engineering. I'd like to ask you a personal question though. Are you content with the work that you do?   Might I also ask for some advice, to any student starting their degree in BioM, if it isnt too much trouble?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qbb5u/iama_biomedical_engineer_inventing_and_making/c3w91md?context=5)|I'll just say this, someone I was in study group with in undergrad, is making sprinklers. There are people walking around with my implants in them, keeping them alive, yeah I'm pretty satisfied.  Advice: most of stuff you learn in school you'll never see again, but keep your GPA up and do internships. If you can't find one, see if your school is doing summer research, anything will get you somewhere.
[Could you not just use some sort of adaptive control scheme to handle the variation?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qbb5u/iama_biomedical_engineer_inventing_and_making/c3w9hx8?context=5)|Then those sensors will have to plug into all over the patients body, from kidneys, head, liver, etc etc. Just too invasive.
[But isn't very easy to modify pressure using turbine than with some kind of pump?  And is having two turbines a very good fail safe considering one can support the body by itself, especially as there seems to be room?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qbb5u/iama_biomedical_engineer_inventing_and_making/c3wc4bn?context=5)|I think that person that was implanted died shortly afterwards.  Modifying pressure is pretty much the same, I don't think one is especially easier with another, it's adjusting the controller. one pump is for your lungs, another is for your body, so they are two devices. It's not backup of each other. Now your chance for failure just went up twice as likely.
[I am a medical student doing research now for a CT surgeon.  What devices type of devices do you work on?  What devices are considered hot items now to develop due to lack of market or inadequate devices? Things I am familiar with include artificial valves, grafts/artificial aorta, VADs, artificial hearts. Are there any other items that you are working on that are not being used at all?  Any technology developing stem cell grafts for MI or other heart damage? Some ideas might be artificial veins for CABG or new stent technology?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qbb5u/iama_biomedical_engineer_inventing_and_making/c3w9a3t?context=5)|The device I work on are cardiovascular device, something that is novel and not on market. The hot devices are usually the ones that follows the money. So things like cardiovascular, orthopedic, and things to keep patients out of hospitals. The devices that will become huge in the near future, the next gen, are TransAorticValveImplant/Heart sensors/Heart failure devices. I'm not an expert on stem cell grafts but definitely a lot of effort in research universities and private corporations.
[Are you assigned project individually or is usually a team effort?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qbb5u/iama_biomedical_engineer_inventing_and_making/c3w7vvr?context=5)|The projects are team effort, there are so much to do, ranging from design, testing, manufacturing, documentation, pre-clinical trials, regulatory approval submission, clinical trials.   If you break the projects down, to a piece of plastic piece, that'll be individual, but usually people are hired to do specific work. So there's a guy who's good at plastics, another good at welding, another good at testing, etc etc.
[Do you know what hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is? If so, with what you're doing, is there any way to fix it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qbb5u/iama_biomedical_engineer_inventing_and_making/c3w8u08?context=5)|I know what it is, think of basically the heart becomes thicken and inflexible, so it is less efficient in pumping blood, and have to work harder, and it's a downward cycle. My work doesn't address it, but there are implantable heart pumps (Left Ventricular Assist Device [LVAD]) that are addressing it. So far it's been a bridge to transplant device, but the more it is used, the more doctors and engineers are able to convince regulatory and insurance that it's a device for a larger patient population.
[Do you think your company does a good job monitoring your devices once they're in use?  Do your practices exceed the FDA's limited requirements? Would you feel responsible if one of the devices you've designed hurt someone because of a design flaw?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qbb5u/iama_biomedical_engineer_inventing_and_making/c3w98v7?context=5)|Mmm, I would say no. We do monitor but in general FDA does not necessarily require post-monitoring. FDA will require post-monitoring for a period of time when in clinical trial, but not when it goes on market. They've been considering it but there's a huge push back from the industry. Yeah, I would feel responsible. You can't walk away from it, especially since there are a number of required steps to diagnose and deal with the issue. The second worst thing that can happen to a product is someone dies and the way to fix is is impossible. The worst thing is nobody knows why it killed someone.  I will also mention, the category of cardiovascular disease, is very complex. Nobody has just 1 disease, usually it's a long and complex journey of how the heart is now sick. So the category of patients I deal with, end stage heart disease, usually have other causes of death that's not related to our product, and it's still has to be explained and justified.
[Have you seen this TED talk? What do you think about the rush to make some of these types of devices and give them wireless connectivity without fully exploring and understanding the inherent susceptibility of these systems and necessity for well thought out security to be designed into these devices from the beginning?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qbb5u/iama_biomedical_engineer_inventing_and_making/c3w97mq?context=5)|Sure, just like someone can get a RFID tag reader, someone can get a medical implant RF communicator and hack it. Pacemakers have this ""wand"" that is waved over the device, to control and adjust the programming. Company rep and doctors does this all the time. This is nothing new, a ""rogue"" doctor could do the same, just use the device and reprogram it. Question is, why would you want to. Is the world out to get you? A bullet from a gun would be easier.
[How difficult is replicating the AV, SA and Purkinje systems? Do you think we'll ever see a fully self-contained artificial heart? Or, will we always rely on fail-safe externals?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qbb5u/iama_biomedical_engineer_inventing_and_making/c3w8unb?context=5)|Well, in a way, it is done already with the pacemaker. Where leads are placed near AV node and lead down to Purkinje system. There are some stem cells studies done, to see if it will regenerate, so maybe that would be the future.  I think it was around 2005, there was the Abiomed Abiocor totally artificial heart, the system was totally implantable with induction recharging system. It's in trial to be commercially available now.
[If cats always land on their feet, and toast always lands butter side up; if I strap a piece of buttered toast to the back of a cat, hold the cat upside-down in the air, then let go of it, will the cat spin in place?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qbb5u/iama_biomedical_engineer_inventing_and_making/c3w8ys9?context=5)|No.
[Please elaborate...](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qbb5u/iama_biomedical_engineer_inventing_and_making/c3w9hhe?context=5)|It won't spin in space.
[I'm an undergraduate Mechanical Engineering student who would like to continue to a Masters in Biomedical Engineering. Our ME program is very much vanilla ME, but I'm working with a professor in our Biomedical/Osteopathic department to do research in pancreas cells for diabetes on the side.  I'd really like to work in research and design for prosthetic limbs/organs, and human augmentation in general.  Is there any advice you can offer on getting into the field from those initial conditions? I'm trying to find good co-op job(s) for my junior year; can you recommend any companies to look into?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qbb5u/iama_biomedical_engineer_inventing_and_making/c3w8yss?context=5)|I don't know of any large companies that does prosthetic limbs/organs, so most likely you'll be in a startup when you get out of school. Possibly relocation, if you're okay with that.  Sounds like it's in the areas of Tissue Engineering that you're interested in. If you check back, I'll have a few company names that are looking expanding and hiring. One misconception is that people think they need a biomedical degree, grad or undergrad, to do medtech, not true. Medtech has been around for 4 decades and oldest biomedical programs are about 20 years old. So if you'd like to try and apply to these companies, I wouldn't let a graduate degree stop you.
[I'm currently looking for a job, I've got a BME bachelors, and have been working for a couple years now (mostly contract work). I've heard that Southern California is like the haven for biomedical companies due to the high concentration of companies. Do you know of other places to look? Thanks for doing this!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qbb5u/iama_biomedical_engineer_inventing_and_making/c3w9jom?context=5)|Yup, I would look in San Diego, San Francisco. If you're open to other states, I would say Boston, CT, NJ, and Minneapolis.
[I am receiving an undergraduate degree in Biomedical Engineering (with a minor in CSE). I have market analysis experience, am currently participating in BIOMOD 2012 (International DNA Origami competition) and am doing clinical cancer image analysis. I have had past experience with various other things - and am currently a webmaster for 3 separate websites.  My current emphasis is on nanotechnology but it appears as though this is a field that is very slow moving due to regulations and so on. Could you give your interpretation of nanotechnology in Biomedical Engineering? If possible, could you tell me if, from your experience, I require a MS to specifically work in Nanotech? I have the opportunity to talk with a department head of Bio-nanotech for a huge company (Think P&amp;G) and so I will probably have a closer insight into this so feel free to skip over this specific question unless you know something specific that might be of use.  Other than that, could you give some company names worth looking into for employment after graduation? I would love to get my hands deep into nanotechnology with an undergraduate degree but everything I've heard is that I need a master's or even PHD? As an undergraduate, could you tell me what my workload would be like?  As one other thing, do your jobs typically vary? Like in one instance, are you doing specifically animal testing and in the next, doing laboratory work, or even in the next doing computer work or is it strictly to your specific qualities, so like in my case, I am very, very good in computers so I will probably be doing mostly cubicle coding work?  Also, did you have any time between getting an undergraduate and getting a graduate degree where you did work, etc?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qbb5u/iama_biomedical_engineer_inventing_and_making/c3waqb1?context=5)|I don't really see any business development around nanotech. Probably only for surface modification or Stainless steel NiTi metal mesh. I would probably do a Biomedical Engineering Masters and focus on biomaterials and biocehm. That would probably be worth focusing.  As for company names, I wouldn't even know where to start for nanotech. Maybe some kind of medical fabric company, but most of those are dying and leaving the country.  Yeah, every day is different, I would do a little of each. It really shifts things around.
[Sounds like you're mostly R&amp;D? Is that correct? I've been leaning towards going to that area myself. Quality/Validation/Regulatory doesn't interest me. How much of a salary difference is there between R&amp;D and the rest?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qbb5u/iama_biomedical_engineer_inventing_and_making/c3wdo87?context=5)|Yeah, I'm more of early stage R&amp;D, it fits well with my creativity and knowledge base. Basically get a problem to solve and prove it in a patient. Of course, many steps in between those two points.  I think R&amp;D has the advantage here in terms of salary, but companies are always looking for good QA people to hire. But in terms of path to success, I think it's in R&amp;D and marketing.
[I'm a biomedical engineer in my sophomore year of college, and I feel like all the classes I'm taking now are really hard, even though I know the concepts already.   1) What did you do when you felt like things were difficult for you? 2) Are there more of any one gender where you work than the other? 3) Did you go to med school?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qbb5u/iama_biomedical_engineer_inventing_and_making/c3w97rh?context=5)|I think I just stopped taking them, haha, it's good to ask seniors what classes to avoid. Yeah, more male than females, but it's 60/40, and trend is tipping. Nope, thought about med school but wasn't what I wanted to do.
[Is there a benefit to getting an MBA following a masters degree in BME? As far as getting into a product development or project management role?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qbb5u/iama_biomedical_engineer_inventing_and_making/c3w9y4h?context=5)|Yes and no. I think MBA is over-valued, isn't stopping me from considering it though. But a MBA fits in well with large medical companies, that does more marketing, operations, management.
[I'm graduating in the Spring (BS BME, Tissue Eng. &amp; Biomaterials) but am having a hard time finding somewhere to work. When you say you got a job through a recruiter, do you mean a recruiter from the company that hired you or a head hunter?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qbb5u/iama_biomedical_engineer_inventing_and_making/c3w9g5y?context=5)|I applied through Monster.com, where a recruiter found my resume, and gave it to a startup. Not a bad business, recruiting, haha.
[Any tips on finding a job?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qbb5u/iama_biomedical_engineer_inventing_and_making/c3w9g5y?context=5)|Believe it or not, Monster.com.
[I'm graduated last July with my bio engineering degree... I'm working retail now, any suggestions on how to find a job?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qbb5u/iama_biomedical_engineer_inventing_and_making/c3w9cyi?context=5)|Are you willing to relocate? Try looking for jobs in Boston/NJ/San Diego/SF/Minneapolis market.
[Where are most of the medical device companies located in the US? California and Minnesota?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qbb5u/iama_biomedical_engineer_inventing_and_making/c3w9iy7?context=5)|And Boston, NJ, Miami, San Diego, San Francisco.
[Why are you keeping Dick Cheney alive??](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qbb5u/iama_biomedical_engineer_inventing_and_making/c3w9iab?context=5)|I find it creepy that he is flaunting it.
[Any advice for a senior in high school interested in this field and attending pre med in the fall? I want to do medicine but there are so many aspects of it that I'm worried I may pick the wrong field and be unable to find a job after grad school.   Also what medical teaching institutions do u highly respect or recommend?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qbb5u/iama_biomedical_engineer_inventing_and_making/c3w9ae0?context=5)|Mmm, well, if you are thinking about medical school, by aspect/field, do you mean specialty? If so, I wouldn't worry about it, because between now and college and med school, you'll have so much time to choose and find out what you want to do. But I would not pick pre-med as my major for medical school, consider engineer, down side is, it's usually tough to keep the GPA higher than 3.5.
[Follow up question... have you found your job to get harder or easier as time went on? Did your job get more or less rewarding as you went on?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qbb5u/iama_biomedical_engineer_inventing_and_making/c3wchma?context=5)|I'm 33 with 8 yrs of experience, as a product manager. I still do design stuff but do more product management. My involvement with engineering is more early stage stuff, once it's going to manufacturing I try to stay out of it. It's sometimes high pressure, it's not for everyone, but I don't think it's unbearable. It's a clash of personalities and sometimes you're better off sitting back and letting it play out. I've learned tricks and trade to make my job easier, like I tell my friends, a well trained monkey can do 80% of my job.
[Are there any internships you could hook me up with?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qbb5u/iama_biomedical_engineer_inventing_and_making/c3w8mco?context=5)|Sorry, we're not hiring interns this summer. Small startup with limited resources. Good luck with your search!
[I'm in college and thinking about either Materials with a specialization in Biomaterials or Biomedical. What is the job market like for BME?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qbb5u/iama_biomedical_engineer_inventing_and_making/c3w9pja?context=5)|I don't know much about materials, except that there is no perfect material, so the search goes on, I bet the market is pretty good in that regard.   Job market is better than others, I would say. The downside is, it's very concentrated on certain cities, so if you're a biomedical engineer in Alaska, Hawaii, NDakota, you get the point, you're screwed.
[High school senior here looking to become a biomedical engineer - I'm by far a science/math person and molecular bio is my favorite. Do you think I'll have the opportunity to not learn about prostheses and implants and just concentrate on cellular/molecular/tissue work as a biomedical engineer? Or should I go for just a degree in biochemistry and see where that gets me? Any advice is more than welcome!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qbb5u/iama_biomedical_engineer_inventing_and_making/c3w9oml?context=5)|Hi, I think that when you consider your courses and major, you'll have a chance to see what classes are offered. Universities differ, some will offer one but not other, all depends on the Professor. But, at the end of the day, if you're passionate about something, you can always do research of volunteer for an institution that'll give you the leg up on competition, more than any course will.
[I'm a sophomore at Miami University majoring in Biomedical Engineering. I want to work with prosthetics and improve upon the way that they interface with the human nervous system. Couple of questions: 1) What is the job market like for biomedical engineers? 2) What company do you work for? 3) Do you know of any company internships provided through your company or possibly others that maybe you interned at? 4) Any advice for an up-and-coming biomedical engineer?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qbb5u/iama_biomedical_engineer_inventing_and_making/c3wcbp9?context=5)|Great school, job market is good, I currently work for a startup medical device company, sorry too small to offer internships (besides you want a big company that's around when you apply for a permanent job), talk to your Professors to network, and find out who's recruiting at your school.
[Awesome, thanks! and feel free to not answer this one if it's rude but what was your starting salary out of school and how much room is there for advancement?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qbb5u/iama_biomedical_engineer_inventing_and_making/c3wd9ft?context=5)|70K out of school, lots of room for advancement. Good luck :)
[Cool, one of my friends is studying BME (Purdue). A lot of the stuff he's doing is really neat.  My question for you is, what made you decide BME over other engineering degrees?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qbb5u/iama_biomedical_engineer_inventing_and_making/c3w9j1n?context=5)|I was fascinated by medicine and I was an engineer, so I settle for the middle ground. Thank goodness I didn't go to medical school.
[What subjects did you need for you biomedical engineering course, and where did you go to university/ collage?  also what country did you study in?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qbb5u/iama_biomedical_engineer_inventing_and_making/c3w9pc2?context=5)|US, MechE for undergrad, Biomed for grad. I think biomed courses included biochemistry, hemodynamics, numerical methods for tissue, topics in prototyping. etc. Most were worthless.
[Thank you that is very useful, but i misspoke, when i said what subjects did you need, i meant to say (and should have included) what subjects did you need to have already studied before they let you take the course?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qbb5u/iama_biomedical_engineer_inventing_and_making/c3wa89a?context=5)|Surprisingly, nothing, no requirement  oh, also in the US for both schools.
[How do you account for endocrine or nervous system induced signals necessary to change cardiac output in order for a human to adequately respond to its environment?   Obvious heart implant patients are not running marathons, but even some basal level of regulation seems necessary for daily activities for this to ever be considered a viable option.  Has biomedical engineering gotten to the point where we can place, lets say, beta 2 receptors on artificiality grafted cells on the devices surface which are competent for endogenous signaling and can translate that information to the artificial pump? Rather than placing sensors or something mechanical everywhere on the body?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qbb5u/iama_biomedical_engineer_inventing_and_making/c3wagpb?context=5)|Answer is no. That's why artificial hearts and LVAD patients, have to be closely monitored and parameters of output adjusted. When I worked on artificial heart floor, we had to monitor the patient every hour, and if out of whack get a doctor to agree to changes, granted that was a long time ago.
[I mean no troll, but what is your stance on religion?  I ask because my ex's Mother oversees the installation of said valves, and she is a devout Catholic, giving no credit to science and all to god for the miracles he has given.  I mean, whatever you want to believe, but I find it hard to believe that people who work in a 'hard' science field, producing and installing artificial organ components can look past all of the work and ideas that go into the process.  Do you have any insight on this?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qbb5u/iama_biomedical_engineer_inventing_and_making/c3wjjod?context=5)|She oversees them? in what capacity? As a doctor, clinical coordinator, manufacturer? Well, as an atheist, I would say that these are imperfect implants with their faults and downside, if God wants to take credit for it, then go right ahead. But I usually find that arguing with people who doesn't listen to reason, is pretty pointless, I have a better time talking to a wall.
[Do you ever consult with top hospitals or those in private practice? If so which hospitals are you seeking to see the first to use these devices, and are you mainly consulting with cardiothoractic surgeons and cardiologists?   Secondly, what do expect insurance coverage for these devices to be for the average joe who needs a cardiovascular implant?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qbb5u/iama_biomedical_engineer_inventing_and_making/c3wbe88?context=5)|I would say you should follow the doctors, see which doctors are most often on the news, they'll have experience using these devices and have support staff and systems in place. You need both Interventional Cardiologists and CT Surgeons. Afterall, when something goes wrong, CT surgeons will have to do the clean up and also can help with referral.  Can't really speak to the insurance coverage, I thought most are 80% covered.
[Are you my Uncle Tim?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qbb5u/iama_biomedical_engineer_inventing_and_making/c3w9jsj?context=5)|Nope, sorry, good luck finding your real dad.
[An executive from Boston Scientific came to talk to my BME class about the business end of the medical device industry.  He remarked that most of the stents were produced in Ireland at a cost of about 90 cents per stent.  They were then sold to hospitals under exclusive contracts for around $1200 per stent.  I understand that most of that cost is needed to fund clinical trials necessary for FDA approval, but do engineers in the industry see a problem with the business end of things.  Is there any support for nationalized healthcare at the cost of slowing research?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qbb5u/iama_biomedical_engineer_inventing_and_making/c3w9ng1?context=5)|Well, you're talking about a stent, which is a fabricated from a piece of NiTi tubing about a inch long. Made by a government subsidized Ireland (no longer the case) company, and made in bulk. There are more high end medical devices out there. I'm no economist or business major, but I would say that $1200 is well worth the price compared to open heart surgery.
[I'm a BME Master's student at a good school, and I currently plan to pursue a PhD. Do you know anything about the industry market for cellular and molecular engineering as opposed to medical device design?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qbb5u/iama_biomedical_engineer_inventing_and_making/c3w9cgs?context=5)|With tissue engineering and stem cell, it's going to be the next explosion segment. I would say you're on a right path I wished my organic chemistry and cell biology was good enough to be in that path.
[How much do you make in base and bonus?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qbb5u/iama_biomedical_engineer_inventing_and_making/c3w94zi?context=5)|110k + 10k annual bonus + stocks.
[I am have a Biology degree and am considering a Bioengineering MSc, would there be industry jobs for people of my background, or would employers want someone with more of an engineering background?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qbb5u/iama_biomedical_engineer_inventing_and_making/c3w9zby?context=5)|As someone who hires, I think people look at what you did last as the best indicators, so if you did Bioengineering masters, that'll be the degree. There are plenty of people who are science background and does Biomedical engineering, I don't think it's an issue.
[Can an implanted device run off the bodies power supply or do they always need their own power source?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qbb5u/iama_biomedical_engineer_inventing_and_making/c3we4br?context=5)|So far nothing that I know of can run off bodies source, through either kinetic, thermo, chemical, or electrical. It's just such a small amount of energy that can be generated. There is a company though, called Cardiomems, that puts pressure transducers, usually stays dorment, but when near an induction power source, would power up and transmit RF info about pressure, pretty cool.
[This may be outside of your expertise, i don't know, but i ams  a patient facing the possibility of another heart operation. How long do you think it will be before we can non-invasively replace one of a patient's valves in the united states?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qbb5u/iama_biomedical_engineer_inventing_and_making/c3w9f4t?context=5)|Sorry to hear that. It's already here, look into Medtronic Corevalve and Edwards Sapien. But these devices are for older patients and I don't know if you'll fit into that category.
[What are your thoughts on the Da Vinci and valve replacements?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qbb5u/iama_biomedical_engineer_inventing_and_making/c3w9xby?context=5)|Well it is not really proved to be any better than a surgeon. I think the conclusion was that the most damage was done when going on bypass. It's also risky if there's an emergency, where the doctor will have convert to open heart surgery very quickly.
[I would like to know how the inventing process goes. If you have some novel idea for disease treatment, does it belong to your lab? Say if you make a discovery, what happens?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qbb5u/iama_biomedical_engineer_inventing_and_making/c3wa9ub?context=5)|Well, it could be anything. Some times it's a doctor think of a way of doing something better. Or marketing report shows a unmet need in a segment. Or an entrepreneur would want to start a new company. So these would all eventually lead to a room of engineers and ask ""how would you solve this problem""

Simply put, does anyone know or belong to a company that could help me out a bit? I am finding that it is almost impossible to get a job without any ""connections"" and I figured this would be a legitimate way to seek some help. 

It would be great if you could share your knowledge/experience with the job/internship search, and if you could help point a fellow redditor in a good direction. thanks so much!

All my life I've been told that I should do something with my art and my ideas. The astonished statements, the furtive questions-- ""What are you doing working at Walmart when you can draw like that?"" ""I had no idea you could draw so good! Why don't you go to art school?!""

I've never had any idea what to do with my creativity and talent until recently, however. I didn't really see any money in comic books. I definitely didn't want to be a tattoo artist. I'm not quite good enough at math to be an architect. And outside of my own scope on the matter, I had always heard the stereotypes: people complaining that their art degrees were useless, that there were all kinds of homeless people on the streets with the paper and the creds, that there were art school graduates with loan debt and no art job to pay it off with.

Add to that the environment that I was raised in; my whole family has been up to its eyebrows in general labor. Factories, namely. Textile manufacturing, power plants, automobile assembly... you name it. ""Hard work"" belonged on my family's coat of arms, if we'd had one. If you didn't have a job putting something together in a dim and dirty roomful of shuddering, slamming, booming machines, twelve hours a day, six days a week, you were a slacker, lazy, good-for-nothing.

I ended up with a pretty heavy case of depression in high school. What good was this supposedly prodigious talent with no one to share it with and nowhere to apply it? I went to art class every day, where I made straight As of course, and every day stared down our sad sack of an art teacher, who spent nearly every class hiding behind his desk, drawing Time Magazine cover arts that would never see the light of day. I didn't want to be that man.

One day I received a certificate from the National Creative Society deeming me a ""Mentor of Poetry, Prose, Art, and Performance"". I was proud of it--still am, to a degree, but when I saw how envious that art teacher was of it--practically threw it at me when he gave it to me that afternoon in art class--I couldn't help but want to avoid seeing myself in that same chair, hiding behind that same desk.

I tried to write a fantasy novel, but I knew it would be an uphill battle trying to get it published, and the rewards would be slim, if any. So after a couple years of trying to hold down a flighty retail job, a handful of creative false starts, and a failed marriage, I decided to join the Army. What better way to get out of the doldrums of the backwoods and away from a destiny under a carpet-weaving machine than jump into a life of excitement, experience, and travel feetfirst?

Several years passed. I had met and married again, changed jobs from my original MOS as Military Policeman to 'Transportation Coordinator', and deployed to Afghanistan with a new unit in a logistical job moving and tracking enemy movements, ambush incidents, and shipment convoys all over west Afghanistan. It was a hell of a time, and I'd gladly do it again in a heartbeat--but it turned out that while I was on the other side of the planet, my new wife had grown used to my absence and developed a seven-year-itch in three months. And up until I walked in the front door of our house, I thought we could still work things out...we had been talking online, talking about the future, talking about promises and compromises, about how we'd each changed for the better, and how we were going to start over and do things right.

I walked in the front door of our house at the end of my deployment and all of her stuff was gone. But it didn't really hit me until I walked into the living room and saw the blinds I had put up while I was home on leave back in April. The big picture windows in the living room were so big and empty, and there was no shade and she couldn't put them up herself, and I felt so helpless--I had been gone so long and left so much of the stateside business to her, that I had to put up all the blinds. I needed to do something for her, to do something stateside, even if I couldn't be here to protect her at night in that creepy old house when she was there all by herself, or take care of her when she was sick, or take her out to eat for her birthday, two of which I had missed. I could put up the blinds. That, at least, I could do.

I walked into the living room and saw the blinds I had put up just for her, and she wasn't even here to use them, and I withered inside. After she fled to North Dakota with her new boyfriend, I stayed in the house a few weeks while I job-hunted, completely confused as to what to do until my mother offered to let me stay back home for a little while again.

I'll never forget how hard I cried driving back to Georgia with everything I owned crammed into the truck that my new ex-wife had abandoned. She had completely dropped every thread of the life we'd shared for the last several years, and left me up to my eyeballs in debt: the truck I was driving, she'd purchased while I was overseas. A car she tried to purchase after I told her to leave the truck with me instead of somewhere I couldn't find it. We hadn't even taken possession of the car.

When I got to Georgia, the job search didn't go any better. Literally thousands of resumes emailed, dozens of job websites trawled every day: a few interviews, but nothing promising. And I'd had such high hopes for landing a job in logistics. It had seemed such an important field when I did it in Afghanistan. Everybody needs something shipped, right? I had my nose in everybody's business over there; I could find a needle in a haystack from space, and tell you where it would be in twelve hours. My nickname was ""The Eye of Sauron"" because if something happened in my Area of Responsibility, I knew about it.

Three weeks after I returned to Georgia, I was at work, third shift, running a industrial carpet-weaving machine for minimum wage, twelve hours a night, seven days a week, when I had an epiphany.

Talent doesn't just ""go away"" just because you have been convinced that it is worthless. You are born with it. You are born TO it. You can run from it, but you can't hide from it. Stories still came to me, even though I hardly ever wrote anymore. I still got the mental movies you get when you daydream about the stories that come to you. I still got the faces, the clothes, the things they did, the things they said, my ideas. Everybody said I was better off now that she was gone; up until it hit me, I hadn't thought so. I had lost the most important person in the world to me. My whole purpose was gone, leaving yet another gaping hole. But maybe now it was time to let go and commit to what had been inside me the entire time, and use the unfortunate freedom I'd been pushed into to return to creative pursuits.

Games. I have always loved video games, and the best ones are the ones that you can lose yourself in. Slough off the stress of the day with a journey into the woodland heart of ""The Elder Scrolls""' land of Cyrodiil, or burn off some frustration fighting the mob in some crime caper game or some nameless aliens on a cloud-dappled plain. I decided that was where I wanted to tell my stories.

I need this. Funded or not, school or not, all I have left are my talents and my hard work. If I can't go to school and get the degree I need, I'll pour all my ideas into my portfolio and start looking for an internship or something. My pictures and my words, they tell stories, and the best place I can see to accomplish that is with a game developer. I want people to meet the quirky characters that appear to me as I'm standing there gazing into the shivering eighty-three needles of a deafening carpet machine. I want people to get lost in the exotic environments that appear to me as I'm trying to fall asleep at nine in the morning after work. I want people to see the worlds that I've been seeing for the last twenty years, and I need help to make that happen right. I need help being the creator I should have always been.

qf3al,6,2012-03-02,Could someone guide me a bit and answer some questions I have? (not technical questions),takk___,ASPNET,https://www.reddit.com/r/ASPNET/comments/qf3al/could_someone_guide_me_a_bit_and_answer_some/,"Okay so forgive me if this isn't the specific place I should be posting this.  I have seen other subreddits like /r/cscareerquestions but I thought this would be better.

I have a few questions regarding what I should learn and in what order, also if this is the right path for me.  Before that I will give you a bit of a background on me...

I am 24 and recently became laid off from my first Web Developer position out of college.  I graduated in 2010 with a bachelors degree in Information Sciences and Technology from Penn State.  In a nutshell the major exposed us to everything imaginable in IT, programming, project management, networking, UI Design, etc.  That was the good part.  The bad part is that none of these classes were much about ""the basics.""

I took an internship with a web development company and was eventually hired by them full-time after college.  I mostly took care of HTML/CSS emails, but I delved into the world of ASP.NET/C# and also Javascript for the first time here.

Long story short... one of the major clients we worked with got sold and all my work was gone.

Here I am unemployed, seriously attempting to learn skills to better myself in finding a job that I actually LIKE.  I have been interested in web development since I was in middle school and I will always be.  I just have some questions regarding if this is the right path for me etc.

1) I recently started reading a C# book to better understand it, but I hit a wall.  I get all the basics for the most part... mathematical statements, loops, if/else, and things specific to the world of ASP.NET in setting labels text, and on occasion I used table adapters with stored procedures to retrieve data.  However, I am to the point in this book (which is based around Windows Form Applications, not the world of web) where it is beginning to run away with the concept of objects.  I seem to understand the theories behind objects (inheritance etc), but I have trouble actually picturing a potential project in terms of objects.  How far into the C# world does one have to go in order to be proficient enough in the ASP.NET world?  I would like to think I don't need to know EVERYTHING, but I am probably wrong...

2) Because I generally hit these walls, the idea comes to mind that maybe this isn't for me and maybe I am not intelligent enough to be a Web Developer.  I had plenty of classes with CS majors that just seemed so far beyond my comprehension level, yet at the same time, none of them seemed interested in projects they were given.  Is this normal or do most people quickly move through C# books?  This sounds like a dumb question...

3) Now that I have been looking for a job, I am torn between front-end development and back-end.  Most jobs listed are one or the other and working for a small company, I had to do both.  I keep coming to the conclusion that maybe back-end isn't for me, but then I really find it rewarding when I figure something out.  On the same side, front-end development seems easier, but it is a major headache having to deal with different browsers etc...

4) Now that I have all the time in the world until I find something (hopefully soon), what do you suggest I do?  I have taken to the ""Head First"" books by O'Reilly that I really enjoy.  So far I just finished SQL since it was a really easy read.  I am about 1/3 the way through Head first C# and I hit a wall.  I am also about 1/5 through Javascript and have purchased ""Design Patterns"" and ""Object Oriented Analysis and Design"".

I primarily used Web Forms at my previous job but would like to head into the world of MVC3 and Razor although I have very little knowledge of either...

Any help would be appreciated, sorry for the long post!

I landed a killer internship, and while I'm waiting on that starting I still need some money. 


My school contacted me with anther opportunity (again the killer internship is taking forever due to vacations and a few other things). 

For a bit of background:

Now, I am/was a freelance programmer for a while and am pretty familiar with it. It's just not for me, and while I do love it- it's not something I want to do forever. But, it's a job. The school is well aware it's what I do at present for work at the moment and got in touch over a few companies looking for somebody with coding knowledge looking for work.


My interview for one of them is coming up, and going by what both the school itself and the guy had said- he's only looking for 'female programmers' and employees. He claims (and again the school had also said) that 'women have a better eye for detail'.


I have some MASSIVE issues with this. Sure, it's work BUT I'm not about to encourage this kind of sexism. It would be an issue if it were stated that he was only looking for men, and the same holds true in this case.

Hell, at the very least- it's a chance to make a stand on something I believe in. 

So, there's that. 

So, tell me TwoX: 

What can I say or do to make a point (professionally)? "
qelfv,13,2012-03-02,Personal Success Story Here,Tale16,BipolarReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/qelfv/personal_success_story_here/,"Hey guys, just had to get this out there to people who truly understand where I am coming from.  I have and always will be addicted to substances because they induce mania, which is what I'm really addicted to.  Starting with this spring semester at college, I decided to go cold turkey on all substances and become a straightedge.  This is the best thing I've done with my life probably in the past few years and I'm still astonished with the positive repercussions.  Last semester and pretty much all through college I struggled socially, academically, and with managing my illness.  Now, I am a double Psychology and Business administration major taking 19 credits as well as involved in 5 clubs/organizations on campus.  I have gotten an 85 or above on every test or assignment thus far and developed strong relationships with a few of my professors.  I have met at least a hundred new people through different social networks and have some girls interested in me again.  In addition, I rekindled relationships with close friends of whom I pulled away from.  I also no longer have a place to call home for complicated reasons, but that pushed me to find a paying job and I ended up (very likely) landing a paid internship in Industrial Organizational Psychology; Most of all, I feel like I have control back in my life.  I am no longer letting manic depression define my life so much as I am defining my life as a person who suffers from it.  With this amount of positive reinforcement, I could NEVER imagine going back to using and I hope this helps people who might be struggling with the issue because a few of my friends told me it helped them with theirs.  I've only posted a few other times, but this is an awesome community and I'm glad to be a part of it.  And remember, it's not mental illness, it's mental skillness 0.o"

I don't want to die...but death doesn't scare me. If I found out I had 24 hours to live, I think I would feel relieved. Like the burden of pressure to do something amazing with my life is lifted. I feel like Kirstin Dunst's character in Melancholia if anyone has seen it. I sometimes wish it would kind of just happen in a way out of my control. Like riding down the highway, I imagine a large truck smashing into my car...or if I'm flying I kind of hope for the plane crashing into the ground. 

I'm 27 and probably the most depressed I've been in my life. It seems silly though. I've read some of the other posts here...people have had challenging lives. Nothing bad has ever happened to me. The worst things are I've always been fat and I went bald. Shitty but nothing like what other people went through. For the past few months I've wondered: why am I so depressed all of a sudden? I had a few theories, but the more I thought about it the more I realized I've never been truly happy. I don't mean I'm sad 100% of the time. I have friends. I have fun. I lead a pretty normal life, I guess.

I can honestly list of the few periods of my life I was really happy (isn't that weird?):

* The moment I got my acceptance letter from a top 20 school to midway through 1st semester of college. I just felt like...the entire world was open to me. But now I realized I'm too stupid/lazy to accomplish anything.
* A summer internship where I roomed with my friend best and we lived without a care and the future seemed so bright. It was the best summer of my life.
* My last semester of college the moment I got a great job offer and had 4 more to choose from until about 6 months in and I realized I picked the wrong one :(
* Getting [and accepting] a really high paying job at a prestigious company last year despite thinking I bombed the interview. I was pretty happy for about 4 months, but I think it just because I was so busy moving, meeting new people, working that depression seemed to take a back seat.
* The night and week after where I got my first kiss and lost my virginity at 26. I finally felt like a man.
* Reading a message last month from the girl of my dreams on okcupid who [for reasons I didn't and will never understand] wanted to meet me. I think she's the only girl I've ever connected with. But she lives kind of far and just wanted to be friends after the first date (was more of a casual meet really). I guess maybe she thought it could go somewhere despite her never being attracted to me. So I never saw her again. The other date I went on, I couldn't care less about the rejection, but I still think about her sometimes. I get mad at myself a lot. I had a shot and I blew it. If I had spent the years leading up to meeting her taking care of myself and not being fat and lazy maybe she would have liked me back.

I feel like my brain just isn't wired for happiness. It's faulty. Does anyone else feel this way? Did you get over it? Is there something I can do...something to hope for? I want to be happy. I really do. I just don't know how. :(

Every week, I tell myself THIS IS THE WEEK. I'm going to finally get my act together and stick to my much needed diet. And inevitably every week I go a few days and then fail.

Tomorrow I have an interview at the top company in my field. I've known about this for two fucking weeks. I should have prepared like crazy. This is literally an opportunity of a life time, but instead I did nothing. I spent my free time redditing, being depressed, porn, and crying. Why am I so fucking stupid?

Last year someone I knew pretty closely committed suicide. We were very close friends my first year at college, but drifted apart after that. We still kept in touch though. At the time, I was in one of my happy periods and I was so confused. I couldn't understand it. But now...yeah, I get it. He was a good friend. I miss him. I don't want anyone to miss me."

[Here's](http://imgur.com/qTNTo) our network setup (yeah, small company).  I'm the system and network administrator basically (actually an intern) and need to get an IPS/IDS solution in place.  I've read and been told that Snort is a fantastic opensource solution.  My thing is that we have only one option to deploy it due to limited funds and limited hardware.

If you take a look at that picture you'll see a quickly thrown together view of the network I'm working with.  We have far more servers than that, but you get the basic idea from the drawing.  My only option is to implement Snort as a VM on VM1.  Is this something that would work for Snort, or does it need to be in between the network and the ASA on it's own machine to work properly?

Thanks!"
qg768,1,2012-03-03,My 21st birthday.,[deleted],LastNight,https://www.reddit.com/r/LastNight/comments/qg768/my_21st_birthday/,"This was the night of my 21st birthday, during my summer internship in Chicago. I had been out with some friends from work, and at the end of the night around 2 the bars started closing and most of them decided to go home. The only two people left with me were Dave (who I actually knew from high school, a heavyset black guy with dreads, and yes he loves the herb) and his friend from class, Rob (who looks a bit like Jack Black, could maybe pass as his brother). Dave and Rob didn’t show up until around midnight, so they wanted to keep going and hit up a late night bar. We didn’t know of any places, so Dave calls up some random guy that he met last weekend who supposedly knows his way around.

The guy rolls up a little bit later, and he introduces himself as Micky. As soon as I saw this guy, I instantly got a weird vibe about him. He was this short stocky Mexican guy who had a slicked back haircut that made him look like a pedophile. We get into his car anyway, and end up going about just 3 blocks down from where we already were (felt stupid). There was hardly anyone in there, but we didn’t want to leave cause there was no other place open nearby, so we just went straight to the bar and started doing shots between us 4. We stayed for about a half hour, doing shot after shot, when Micky suddenly tells us that we should “go on an adventure”. I had no idea what this meant, but of course being drunk out my mind we were just like “YEA LET’S DO IT!!”

So we get back in Micky’s car, and this where things started getting fucked up. I passed out like 2 minutes after I got into his car, and when I wake back up I ask Micky where we’re going. He calmly tells us we’re going to get ourselves some COCAINE. At this time I was too fucked up to have that statement completely register in my mind, but I looked out the window and realize that we’re literally driving through skid row. It was seriously the shadiest, jankiest urban area I’d ever seen in my life. I look up at Rob in the front seat and I see him just slouched down at an awkward angle, basically as if he expected a drive-by shooting to happen at any second. I started slouching in my seat too.

The next thing I know, I wake up and we’re parked in front of Micky’s apartment. Now at this point I wasn’t sure what was going on. I was still fucked up and I didn’t remember actually seeing the dealer and going through with the transaction, so I thought maybe Micky was just joking about it the entire time. We go inside his apartment, which turned out to be much nicer than I expected. It was actually a really fancy, really huge place, and he told us how he lives there with his wife and kids who were out of town for the week. At that point I concluded he must’ve been just fucking with us; there’s no way he can carry on a coke habit with a family and still live in such a nice place. 

We all sit down on his couch, and Dave pulls out his bowl and his weed and he starts packing it. Right as he’s about to light it, Micky suddenly stands up, reaches into his jacket, and pulls out a bigass bag of coke, grabs Rob, and they just start doing line after line on the kitchen counter. Dave and I just kinda sit there staring at them, we look at each other, and we’re just like “No, we’re not about to do that.” We smoke the bowl ourselves, and go off to a corner to crash for the night, while Micky and Rob are still going at it. As I was trying to sleep I heard Micky yelling that he’ll make us breakfast. I’m worried that he’ll add extra ingredients.

The next morning we wake up, and I see Micky cooking breakfast with a huge smile on his face. Rob is just sitting there on the couch, and I notice he looks really nervous. We ask him what’s wrong, and he whispers to us “We really need to get out of here”. So we make up some excuse for Micky, telling him we gotta go and can’t stay for breakfast. Micky looks disappointed. 

Back outside, Rob starts explaining what happened. Apparently after Dave and I were passed out, Rob was coming down from his buzz so he sat down on the couch watching TV. Micky comes up and starts giving him a shoulder massage. Rob was fine with this at first, but then Micky started to breathe heavily into his ear.. All of the sudden he tells Rob to WHIP IT OUT. 

“…Wait, what?”

“He told me to whip out my dick.”

….. 

Dave and I comprehend this for a second, then we burst out laughing. Dave goes, “What the FUCK??? Why didn’t you knock his ass out on the spot, grab us, and then get us the fuck out of there immediately???” 

Rob stutters and says, “well I felt kinda bad for him cause his wife and kid don’t know that he’s gay, plus I only whipped it out for like 3 seconds and I didn’t let him touch it, that doesn’t make me gay does it?” 

“WWWHHHHAAATTT???” 

Rob: ""Please don’t tell anyone this happened.. I actually feel kinda sick to my stomach right now.""

And of course Dave and I made fun of him the entire way back home, and soon after told his cousin, who laughed his ass off.

The moral of the story: Don’t do coke, it’ll make you gay.

qg33y,4,2012-03-03,About to graduate with CS degree and I'm not sure what I want to do. I think want to do something that involves science. Any advice or ideas?,SnailHunter,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/qg33y/about_to_graduate_with_cs_degree_and_im_not_sure/,"My biggest fear is that I will end up in a job working on menial projects that I don't care about at all. That's how I felt at my internship this summer, where I worked on iPhone apps. It really wasn't fulfilling to me to work projects that I just didn't really care about. I liked the experience of learning, and getting better at programming, and there were moments where I really enjoyed the hunt of coming up with a solution to a problem, but I didn't care about the products I was working on at all. It became very draining to me after just a few months. I couldn't imagine being stuck in that kind of job for a few years. Or a lifetime.

My dream would be to do something in the sciences, working on advancing our understanding of the world in some way. My *real* dream job would be to somehow be involved with writing software used by NASA, or something similar. I would just love to be involved in any way with something like that. I also think I would enjoy working on any type of big project that would affect a lot of people's lives (like writing software that would control an underground subway or something like that). Those types of jobs sound really fulfilling to me, but I'm not sure what exactly my options are when it comes to these things with just a bachelors degree in computer science.



I've got a few questions:

How important is it to future employers that I get a job right out of college? Does it matter? Is it better to just get any old job to start out with than to wait and try to find my 'dream' job (or at least something in the same vein as it)? Also, does it look bad to jump around a lot in jobs, or is it seen as a plus for having that much more or a diversity of experience? 

My basic 'plan' right now is to just find a job (knowing my lack of experience will greatly hinder me from achieving my dream jobs right out of college), and if I end up hating it, just move on to the next one, all-the-while looking into finding a way to reach one of my ideal jobs. On the side, I want to be making my own projects, apps as well, and hopefully make a small amount of profit from those.



What kind of opportunities are realistic for me, as it comes to the types of dream jobs I listed above? What path would you recommend? Should I consider grad school? Does it sound like I maybe should've chosen engineering or a physical science to major in instead of computer science, given my aspirations? Please be brutally honest.

Would it be appropriate for me to ask one of my cs professors to meet up to discuss these types of questions? I feel like my advisor doesn't really help that much, and I have a professor in mind that I really look up to.

One more aside: I love math and I really like the theory side of computer science.  I love studying algorithms, and I'm taking a model-checking class right now that I find really cool. Are there any jobs I could realistically get that involve something like model-checking?

Any advice at all would be so very appreciated. I need some honest direction from people more knowledgeable than myself."
qg2kx,0,2012-03-03,In the Mind of Rush Limbaugh When Reading Sandra Fluke's Congressional Testimony,dichloroethane,politics,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/qg2kx/in_the_mind_of_rush_limbaugh_when_reading_sandra/,"Alright Rush, you've got 15 million real American Americans working hard to build a better America listening to your every word with baited ears. Truly a great responsibility, no burden, rests on your shoulders to make this country great again. Let's see what we have here, ah, a congressional testimony from a one Sandra Fluke. That's kind of a silly name-- Damnit Rush, focus! For the future of America for our Lord and Savior's sake!

 

Well let's see, she's a Georgetown law student. Hmmm, if I remember correctly, students are exempt from the provisions in the Obama policy on employer-provided health plans and Georgetown currently includes contraception in its health plan[1]. She did her bachelors in feminism studies and is now looking to practice law in domestic violence. So Rush, you're dealing with a heavily biased feminist fighting legislation for which she is not technically a stakeholder. Awww, Limbaugh you're going to come out looking great on this one. 

 

http://abcnews.go.com/images/Politics/statement-Congress-letterhead-2nd%20hearing.pdf

 

Alright, so she makes a claim that contraception will cost a woman over $3000 dollars throughout all of law school, which is almost as much as one makes in a summer internship if they are doing a community service based law program. Well, Rush, it would seem your initial impulses that lawyers at top tier institutions make way more than $3000 in a summer is negated by the fact that she is on a public interest scholarship. Think, Rush, think, why is this statistic so unsettling? Come on Limbaugh, you didn't do that thorough literature review on the economics of birth control just to see how easily you can feel emasculated now did you? 

 

Ah, ha. She is using a cost time scale of 3 years and comparing it to a wage timescale of 3 months. Dear my lord and savior Jesus Christ, such statistical manipulation to fit your worldview is essentially a blatant lie. Now, if we assume that an insurance plan would cover birth control pills, which have a median cost of $35 a month but with insurance would be reduced to a $10 copay, it is safe to assume that uninsured birth control would cost about $1260 over three years[2]. She is crying doom and gloom over $25 dollars a month. Well either that number is wrong or her idea of birth control is popping copious amounts of morning after pills at $50 a pop. In that case, she would literally be having so much sex that she can't afford the contraception. Yeah Limbaugh, that line drives your point home. Make sure to include that one when this gets to your mouth. 

 

Alright, reading on, it seems she's going to try and bring up specific sad stories about women who need birth control. The first one is about a girl with ovarian cysts but she states that this is already covered because the treatment has nothing to do with preventing pregnancy. Then she uses a fear tactic to say what if this wasn't covered if the new legislation passes. Wow, that is literally not a point so I'm not going to address it. Okay, so her friend was sick but was denied coverage because the insurance company did not think she had proper symptoms. Again, this is a straw man argument. It does nothing to address the right of a religous institution to deny subsidizing a product that perpetuates a lifestyle under medical pretext that is against its beliefs while not fighting or preventing disease. Rush, your nation is too intelligent for you to be wasting your time addressing every straw man that your opponents throw at you. Skip this one too.

 

Alright, her last point is about a girl who got raped and thought that since the University didn't cover birth control, they wouldn't cover her going to a doctor to check for STD's. Well it turns out the University does do that and this feels like a fairly large stretch in order to invoke the emotional response from hearing of a rape victim in order to further this girl's political agenda. 

 

So basically, she just wasted two pages of paper trying to stir up emotion without ever really addressing the issue. Though she is not like any of the people in the examples she cited, she is looking to have government subsidized birth control to prevent her own pregnancy. This is a clear case of conflict of interest to use a group that genuinely suffers from a disease, ovarian cysts, for the purpose of controlling legislation that will offer you a direct personal gain at the expense of the taxpayer. Dear, son of Jehovah, the taxpayer is literally funding this girl's lifestyle. Bingo Limbaugh, you have yourself an air tight argument. Let's count those culture war chickens and send this argument straight to your mouth. It'll literally be a no brainer to articulate.

I'm back. I posted a few weeks ago looking for mid-level developers. Alas, my search has been fruitless. I've been given the go-ahead to look for 4 more students for part-time hourly internships. Here's what I'm looking for:

1) A serious love of coding. The more you enjoy writing software, the more I want to hire you.

2) You need to be graduating this year (May, Aug, Dec).. the reason for this is...

3) This is basically a trial run to a full-time hired position with salary/benefits. Basically, we'll try you out for a while, and if we like you and you do good work and show promise, when you graduate, we'll convert you. 

4) For part-time, we're looking for a minimum of 20 hours a week, but you can work up to 40 if you can manage it. This is great for spring break and/or all summer. 

5) We have huge office-wide bonuses and incentives for meeting office-wide goals on code drops. For example, in 6 weeks, we have our first big goal, for which the prize if we hit our code drop with the requirements needed is a $3000 bonus for everyone (of which part timer get a minimum of $1500, plus any more at my discretion if you've been kicking ass)

6) I'm the hiring manager. You'd be reporting to me. I have 13 developers working for me (Junior and Mid), of which 6 already are students. From the feedback I've gotten, they all love it. You might know some of them.

Here's the snippet about our company that I put in my last posting:

*A bit of background about us.. We're a company of about 500 people, and we do government contract work, but this particular office (about 55 people currently, ramping up to about 65) is all fixed-bid, so little government oversight (no security clearance or anything) and we're really well funded, so we have autonomy to solve the problems the way we want to solve them, which means top of the line hardware and software. This translates into a really hardcore dev shop (we have a lot of talent up here).*

If you're interested, shoot me a message on here, and I'll give you my work email address to send your resume to, and we'll go from there.

(Location-wise, we're roughly at Prospect and Sharp Point, about 5-7 mins east of campus)

Thanks!

qhmjv,6,2012-03-04,I need advice in negotiating my remuneration [US],JenniferFromHR,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/qhmjv/i_need_advice_in_negotiating_my_remuneration_us/,"Hi.

I work for a Big corporation, a telecom giant (fortune 50) as an Electrical Engineer as a contractor. I was once an intern to this corporation for 1 yr when I was still doing Grad school (my MS), and I later quit my job to finish school. I am now back as a contract engineer to one of the 10000+ engineering teams. I program for this team. I do mostly scripting. I write mostly in C, Perl and Python. I have close to 3 yrs experience now. I am the only programmer in this team. I program for test automation mostly in Perl and Python.

Recently my manager has indicated that he would like to hire me as a staff engineer to the team from the contracting company. I am pretty sure that I will get a call from the HR any time, and I would like to be prepared.

When I graduated from grad school 2 yrs ago during a tough economy it took a while to find a job and when I got this contractor offer, I took it as a foot in the door. Naturally, my compensation is very less compared to the other engineers in this company whom I work with. I am offered 68k a yr. No more, no less. No matter how long or hard I work (I put 65+hrs/wk). I have been a contractor for ~5 months now.

This corporation went to extra-ordinary lengths to first source me, interview me, and then put me on another third party company's payroll and then hire me as a contractor. The other company from whom I receive my paychecks from, hardly have ever seen me, or even met me. I don't get half the benefits what the employees of the company I work for get, but I am required to work twice as hard, and I am always expected to exceed the expectations in hopes that I get hired as a staff.

How should I proceed? They do offer healthcare, complete medical insurance, a sign-on bonus, stock options etc. But I would like to know specifically when in comes to paycheck, how much should I ask for my remuneration per hour? when they offer me. (I already know they undervalue everyone). By now, you'd think this is a shitty company to work for, though it is, the science and research I am presently doing, is not done anywhere else, and as far as compared to what I learn, get to do, this is the best place I can be.

Sorry for the long explanation, though I felt I should explain completely. Thanks!"
qhikz,0,2012-03-04,"Kerry Egan talks about God, from CNN.",BWSmith,Christianity,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/qhikz/kerry_egan_talks_about_god_from_cnn/,"By Kerry Egan, Special to CNN

As a divinity school student, I had just started working as a student chaplain at a cancer hospital when my professor asked me about my work.  I was 26 years old and still learning what a chaplain did.

""I talk to the patients,"" I told him.

""You talk to patients?  And tell me, what do people who are sick and dying talk to the student chaplain about?"" he asked.

I had never considered the question before.  “Well,” I responded slowly, “Mostly we talk about their families.”

“Do you talk about God?

“Umm, not usually.”

“Or their religion?”

“Not so much.”

“The meaning of their lives?”

“Sometimes.”

“And prayer?  Do you lead them in prayer?  Or ritual?”

“Well,” I hesitated.  “Sometimes.  But not usually, not really.”

I felt derision creeping into the professor's voice.  “So you just visit people and talk about their families?”

“Well, they talk.  I mostly listen.”

“Huh.”  He leaned back in his chair.

A week later, in the middle of a lecture in this professor's packed class, he started to tell a story about a student he once met who was a chaplain intern at a hospital.

“And I asked her, 'What exactly do you do as a chaplain?'  And she replied, 'Well, I talk to people about their families.'” He paused for effect. “And that was this student's understanding of  faith!  That was as deep as this person's spiritual life went!  Talking about other people's families!”

The students laughed at the shallowness of the silly student.  The professor was on a roll.

“And I thought to myself,” he continued, “that if I was ever sick in the hospital, if I was ever dying, that the last person I would ever want to see is some Harvard Divinity School student chaplain wanting to talk to me about my family.”

My body went numb with shame.  At the time I thought that maybe, if I was a better chaplain, I would know how to talk to people about big spiritual questions.  Maybe if dying people met with a good, experienced chaplain they would talk about God, I thought.

Today, 13 years later, I am a hospice chaplain.  I visit people who are dying – in their homes, in hospitals, in nursing homes.   And if you were to ask me the same question - What do people who are sick and dying talk about with the chaplain?  – I, without hesitation or uncertainty, would give you the same answer. Mostly, they talk about their families: about their mothers and fathers, their sons and daughters.

They talk about the love they felt, and the love they gave.  Often they talk about love they did not receive, or the love they did not know how to offer, the love they withheld, or maybe never felt for the ones they should have loved unconditionally.

They talk about how they learned what love is, and what it is not.    And sometimes, when they are actively dying, fluid gurgling in their throats, they reach their hands out to things I cannot see and they call out to their parents:  Mama, Daddy, Mother.

What I did not understand when I was a student then, and what I would explain to that professor now, is that people talk to the chaplain about their families because that is how we talk about God.  That is how we talk about the meaning of our lives.  That is how we talk about the big spiritual questions of human existence.

We don't live our lives in our heads, in theology and theories.  We live our lives in our families:  the families we are born into, the families we create, the families we make through the people we choose as friends.

This is where we create our lives, this is where we find meaning, this is where our purpose becomes clear.

Family is where we first experience love and where we first give it.  It's probably the first place we've been hurt by someone we love, and hopefully the place we learn that love can overcome even the most painful rejection.

This crucible of love is where we start to ask those big spiritual questions, and ultimately where they end.

I have seen such expressions of love:  A husband gently washing his wife's face with a cool washcloth, cupping the back of her bald head in his hand to get to the nape of her neck, because she is too weak to lift it from the pillow. A daughter spooning pudding into the mouth of her mother, a woman who has not recognized her for years.

A wife arranging the pillow under the head of her husband's no-longer-breathing body as she helps the undertaker lift him onto the waiting stretcher.

We don't learn the meaning of our lives by discussing it.  It's not to be found in books or lecture halls or even churches or synagogues or mosques.  It's discovered through these actions of love.

If God is love, and we believe that to be true, then we learn about God when we learn about love. The first, and usually the last, classroom of love is the family.

Sometimes that love is not only imperfect, it seems to be missing entirely.  Monstrous things can happen in families.  Too often, more often than I want to believe possible, patients tell me what it feels like when the person you love beats you or rapes you.  They tell me what it feels like to know that you are utterly unwanted by your parents.  They tell me what it feels like to be the target of someone's rage.   They tell me what it feels like to know that you abandoned your children, or that your drinking destroyed your family, or that you failed to care for those who needed you.

Even in these cases, I am amazed at the strength of the human soul.  People who did not know love in their families know that they should have been loved.  They somehow know what was missing, and what they deserved as children and adults.

When the love is imperfect, or a family is destructive, something else can be learned:  forgiveness.  The spiritual work of being human is learning how to love and how to forgive.

We don’t have to use words of theology to talk about God; people who are close to death almost never do. We should learn from those who are dying that the best way to teach our children about God is by loving each other wholly and forgiving each other fully - just as each of us longs to be loved and forgiven by our mothers and fathers, sons and daughters.

I'm a soon-to-be new grad and I would like to get some advice from any software developers working in HK. 

I was raised in Hong Kong. Currently studying an undergrad degree in computer science / finance in Toronto and will be graduating in May. I do have some work experience (1.75 years of internships) in the software development field here in Toronto.

I already got a very reasonable offer from one of the respectable tech firms here (hint: the one that the media hates). The salary, work environment and the experience I will gain there are definitely above average and I will take it in a heartbeat if my family (and girlfriend) are here.

But they are not. They are in HK and that's the only reason why I'm considering moving back and starting my career there.

[Aside from making my favorite mod ever, he is just an awesome guy. In about 2003 when I was considering trying to go from business software product management to a video game job, he took the time to talk to me on the phone for 2 hours to give me guidance and advice!  And in the years since he's always been just a really terrific person to talk to and seems like a really great person. How hard was it to get NS2 on steam? were the valve guys big fans of NS/UW or was it just like any other business relationship? Any interesting memories from when you were working on the first Natural Selection?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qgp6n/charlie_cleveland_cofounder_of_indie_game_company/c3xgoui?context=5)|The beta wasn't for motivation, it was for money. We needed our community's support or we were...going to have to close up shop. However, we always wanted to get feedback from our fans as early as possible, we just didn't want to do it THAT early. - Not hard. We sold a lot of copies of Half-life because people wanted to play NS1 (or so we heard anecdotally, quite a few times) so I think they saw value there. They are also cool folks who want to help small guys like us and have always been there to lend a helping hand. - Heh. I mostly huddled inside and programmed for 2 years. I literally didn't leave my room more than once or twice a week. I was completely obsessed and I had the time of my life. I've never been so productive or focused, not before and not since. I'm glad I did it, but I have to say it wasn't balanced at all. Now our team prides itself on doing great work but without the personal sacrifice. OK we've taken crap salaries for a long time but we're getting past that point now...
[When the beta first came out, you remarked that it was a big risk and you were using the pressure of a public beta to motivate the NS2 developers (if i recall correctly). how did that work out? did you get the feedback you expected?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qgp6n/charlie_cleveland_cofounder_of_indie_game_company/c3xgoui?context=5)|Thank YOU Joe! Thanks for all your support and servers all over the years. How could I forget?
[I am a machinima maker and have started a new comedy troupe that is planning to use NS2 as the main engine in one of our new series. I remember reading that the NS2 edit tools include a lot of things geared specifically towards movie-making. Is this still true and if so what can you tell me about it? Will you be able to import custom models and textures?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qgp6n/charlie_cleveland_cofounder_of_indie_game_company/c3xgquo?context=5)|Please do this! But don't do it yet. We still have a bit of work to do with our tools. Our original Onos teaser was all done with our tools but we need to do more with them to make them fun and easy to use. That said, all the tools are in the main game's directory, you can play around now. You can import your own custom art now. Here's a tutorial: http://www.unknownworlds.com/ns2/2011/7/ns2_custom_model_importing_guide.
[What exactly was the BUS?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qgp6n/charlie_cleveland_cofounder_of_indie_game_company/c3xhxl3?context=5)|Oh, you bitch. ;)  I'm sorry, I am forbidden for ever talking about this. One day you will see something like it from us, but I doubt we'll ever tell you ""THAT was the BUS"".  Sorry I can't give you more.
[Did you ever feel worried that having an OPEN(ish) beta so early in the development process for NS2 would negatively impact how the game is received? Has the feedback you've received been helpful?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qgp6n/charlie_cleveland_cofounder_of_indie_game_company/c3xgmyj?context=5)|Nope. We want to make sure we're making a sequel that is faithful to the original. We've made some bad decisions that we've reversed since even before the beta (we started getting feedback in 2009) and I'm SO glad.
[You distribute NS2 via Steam but don't sell the game on Steam. Why?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qgp6n/charlie_cleveland_cofounder_of_indie_game_company/c3xgl5o?context=5)|We will - come summer. The game isn't ready for the mega audience of Steam. But we want our community to play the game now and give us feedback while we still have time to make (sometimes big) changes.
[In the same vein, considering CS, TFC and DOD are all fully-owned and controlled Valve IP that leaves NS1 as one of the biggest non-valve HL1 mods. Has Valve ever gone to you with a buyout/employment offer? Can you give a quick history of your personal/professional relationship with Valve?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qgp6n/charlie_cleveland_cofounder_of_indie_game_company/c3xgl5o?context=5)|Valve has always been very supportive of us, and continues to be, but has never given us an offer like that.
[As a follow up would you take it now that you've built your own engine?  Would you have taken it before you started to build your own engine?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qgp6n/charlie_cleveland_cofounder_of_indie_game_company/c3xkfd0?context=5)|Hmmm. I actually don't think we'd take it either way, unless a) it was an amazing deal and b) we could continue to operate totally independently.  But it was a pretty big sacrifice to do things our own way (in terms of salary, stress and time taken). For most people/projects I would recommend getting support like this if you can. If I ever start a new company, I would be less concerned with independence and control and more interested in moving quickly.
[How do you feel about how far back the release date has been pushed since the original trailer for NS2 was released? What is the current projected release date for NS2?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qgp6n/charlie_cleveland_cofounder_of_indie_game_company/c3xgk81?context=5)|There are many embarrassing factors involved with not making our original date, but we're going to make this one. - We don't have an exact release date but it will be this summer for sure.
[Piggybacking on that last question/answer, what programming language or ecosystem is the easiest to get into as a new developer?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qgp6n/charlie_cleveland_cofounder_of_indie_game_company/c3xigsz?context=5)|Not a simple question to answer. I'd probably recommend Javascript right now: it's very similar to Lua and here in the Bay Area, you can get a very high-paying great job doing web programming if you aren't able to make the transition into games right away.
[What are the current plans for supporting Natural Selection 2 after its release? Should we expect paid DLC? Or smaller free updates like Team Fortress 2 (and building off of this question, when can I expect hats for my gorge)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qgp6n/charlie_cleveland_cofounder_of_indie_game_company/c3xgzmq?context=5)|We want to ""unite the world through play"". If people have to pay for updates, then suddenly our community splits and people aren't all playing the same game.  So I expect we'll be releasing tons of patches, maps, new weapons, etc. for years, and all for free. We may add a fireman's hat for the Gorge, but you shouldn't have to pay for it. :)
[How did you come up with the names for the Alien 'classes'?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qgp6n/charlie_cleveland_cofounder_of_indie_game_company/c3xgqg7?context=5)|I wanted short names that reflected how the marines might refer to the aliens when they saw them. That also meant that the words were easy to remember. ""Skulk"", ""Gorge"", ""Lerk"", ""Fade"" and yes, even ""Onos"" were all words that roughnecks might use to crudely refer to these slimy creatures.
[What do you mean by not calling yourselves indie? How do you classify UnknownWorlds?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qgp6n/charlie_cleveland_cofounder_of_indie_game_company/c3xj6zb?context=5)|Hard to say. The whole ""indie"" title is so ridiculous. Devs want to call themselves indie because it seems cool and artsy, but no one seems to know what it really means.  We aren't making a niche game with 8-bit aesthetics that is a personal tale of suffering about the designer's life. But we ARE making a game on our own terms, the way we want to make it.   I don't know if that's ""indie"" or not, but I don't really care. We're making the game we want to make. We hope you love every second of it.
[Have you had much adoption of your in-house engine for mods and other independent projects?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qgp6n/charlie_cleveland_cofounder_of_indie_game_company/c3xgkeb?context=5)|Lots of people have been working on mods for NS2. We get regular performance improvements, bug fixes, new alien roles, movement tweaks and so much more from the community. They literally send us the code. We've hired through our community heavily.
[I would like to know how you see the NS2 community?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qgp6n/charlie_cleveland_cofounder_of_indie_game_company/c3xh1q4?context=5)|Yes there are days we hate everyone.
[I just have to imagine some days after a patch with a rough spot you might just hate everyone. But overall do you and the other developers like to see the heavily opinionated community watching over the whole process, does it pressure you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qgp6n/charlie_cleveland_cofounder_of_indie_game_company/c3xh1q4?context=5)|I'm more used to the negativity then some of the other members of the team so I have pretty thick skin. You just have to remember that people usually complain because they care. They care about your game and they don't want to see you mess it up so they react. Harshly.
[What other Sci-Fi games and/or films have inspired Natural Selection?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qgp6n/charlie_cleveland_cofounder_of_indie_game_company/c3xgltf?context=5)|The usual suspects: Aliens. Gloom. Starcraft. Planetside. Blade Runner. Minority Report. Counter-strike. eXistenZ.
[Any thoughts on some spacious, partially-outdoor maps with vegetation?  How would this sort of thing work visually (with the art assets you currently have) and how do you feel it would affect the game mechanics to try this?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qgp6n/charlie_cleveland_cofounder_of_indie_game_company/c3xhw1j?context=5)|Sounds awesome. We would love this, but right now we are focusing on nailing the indoor environments. That's hard enough, especially for a team of our size and resources. If we can pull off indoor environments, there's a really good chance we'll expand them beyond that.
[What do you look for specifically when hiring programmers?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qgp6n/charlie_cleveland_cofounder_of_indie_game_company/c3xgmbh?context=5)|Great communication skills. Great programming skills. Not over engineering things. Passionate about our game. Fun to work with. Knows who we are already and what we do (great cover letter).  We are hiring programmers by the way! http://www.unknownworlds.com/jobs.
[Charlie, I notice that the great emphasis on the cover letter is not just mentioned here on Reddit but on the jobs site itself as well as even the programming test document where it is said to be ""very important!"" I am a college freshman in CS with experience writing a minimal amount cover letters for internships and advice given to me over the months has been varied in regards to what is actually expected of it. Would you be able to give some insight into some potential content a great cover letter would cover from your unique perspective as a programmer (i.e. how do we demonstrate knowledge of the company, should we reiterate parts of the resume or not, talk about side projects/plug our Github, etc.)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qgp6n/charlie_cleveland_cofounder_of_indie_game_company/c3xi7n4?context=5)|It's kind of like giving a wedding toast: it's hard to give advice on how to do it, but it's completely clear to everyone on the receiving end when you're got a good one or not. The only criteria is that it comes from the heart. If you actually care about our company and game, let it through. If it, it doesn't matter what you say or how you say it.
[As an employer, what are 3 things that you specifically look for when a veteran 3D artist, yet inexperienced in the gaming industry, sends in a resume and art portfolio?  Do they have any chance at all?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qgp6n/charlie_cleveland_cofounder_of_indie_game_company/c3xgkyd?context=5)|Cover letter is extremely important: we want to see that they candidate knows who we are and is passionate about what we're doing.  A hot portfolio is very helpful (keep it simple and loading fast, we have ADD). Being versatile in your skills also helps a lot, as we sometimes have to move people around.
[Hey, how big was the spike in sales after NS2 was frontpaged not too long ago?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qgp6n/charlie_cleveland_cofounder_of_indie_game_company/c3xhtsl?context=5)|We had the biggest day of pre-sales today in at least the past 6 months. It's been really nice!
[When is heavy armor coming?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qgp6n/charlie_cleveland_cofounder_of_indie_game_company/c3xhtsl?context=5)|Exosuit is being worked on as we speak. It's coming.
[NS1 had a decently popular professional gaming scene. What do you think about e-Sports today? Are you willing to support and encourage the development of it in regards to NS2?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qgp6n/charlie_cleveland_cofounder_of_indie_game_company/c3xhbei?context=5)|We are quite committed to it. I watch scrims whenever I can (thanks NS2HD!) and I love it. It's amazing to see what very skilled, very focused teams can do. It's always a rush. I actually can't think of much I'd RATHER do than watch two amazing teams struggle for dominance.  It's hard to get a handle on e-sports today, but I do watch a lot of competitive Starcraft 2 and that's a great model. I'm hoping the scene is ready for something new.
[I loved NS1 specifically because of the asymmetry between the two sides not just in weapons/abilities but in how the teams were managed.  The marines were highly organized but relied on their commander, while the aliens had a more individual approach but everybody could do their thing without being managed by a commander.  So I am wondering why you guys decided to add an alien commander in NS2?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qgp6n/charlie_cleveland_cofounder_of_indie_game_company/c3xi95n?context=5)|I get this question a lot. It's to unify the resource model.  Not having an alien commander in NS1 made the resource model asymmetric which was a big problem for balance. The game could be balanced for small teams or large teams, but didn't ""scale"" for all player sizes. I ended up balancing it for 6 vs. 6 but for NS2 I wanted to fix this problem. That mean unifying the resource model and adding an alien commander.  However, keep in mind that the two roles are going to be totally different, so we're still committed to ""Two Unique Sides"". Just like Starcraft where Zerg plays very different than Terran, but I would say our differences could be even bigger. The alien commander is by far the least finished part of the game right now.
[Do you guys ever get overwhelmed by the feedback on the forums? I know sometimes it can be overly negative or critical. How much actual game balancing takes place from online feedback vs. playtesting/simulations? (and how many playtesters do you guys use?)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qgp6n/charlie_cleveland_cofounder_of_indie_game_company/c3xiacv?context=5)|Yes we do get overwhelmed, to the point where sometimes we can't look or have to take a break for awhile. I'm pretty good with not letting negative people get to me though.  Balancing is done using a combination of feedback from our internal play testers (I think we have about 30 who play the game almost every day), our development team (we all play the game almost every day) and our wider beta community (31k players). We also have extensive game stats that we've been collecting and we're adding to that almost every patch.
[How many official maps / Environmental texture sets do you currently plan on releasing post-launch?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qgp6n/charlie_cleveland_cofounder_of_indie_game_company/c3xi3sd?context=5)|We are starting on a new map/environment art set now. I imagine we'll add a few new sets, at minimum. We would love to see some new looks!
[Is NS2 going to be localized, or will it only be available in English?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qgp6n/charlie_cleveland_cofounder_of_indie_game_company/c3xj06r?context=5)|I really really want to give our community free reign over localizations. The plan is to allow people to translate the game through a web form (add a new language, start translating) and then people could vote up or down the translations (to get rid of jokes and briefing).
[Just thought I'd say 'kudos' for Mod Support, custom maps and gamemodes were what kept me playing the original NS for as long as I did. I was wondering: Have you thought about adding a 'survival' mode? Single-life marines lasting for as long as they can against a single alien infestor?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qgp6n/charlie_cleveland_cofounder_of_indie_game_company/c3xkcga?context=5)|I think ""survival"" mode would be awesome. You know what? One could make this as an NS2 mod with about 300 lines of Lua script. The most work would be creating a new alien model, but you could use a scaled/tweaked Fade or Onos for now.
[Could you maybe help me understand why NS2 is awesome in ~two sentences?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qgp6n/charlie_cleveland_cofounder_of_indie_game_company/c3xih4e?context=5)|An immersive video game like NS2 is the best way to experience these things - more powerful than books, more fantastic than paintball, more personal than film.
[Charlie, how long are you going to use that picture?  Its been around forever!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qgp6n/charlie_cleveland_cofounder_of_indie_game_company/c3xhm69?context=5)|Busted. Sorry I need some new pics.
[If you were to hypothetically make a sandwich in the next hour, in a kitchen full of everything you need to do it, what would you put on your sandwich?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qgp6n/charlie_cleveland_cofounder_of_indie_game_company/c3xj06n?context=5)|Oooh, so hungry.  Crusty toasted focaccia. Avocado. Mozzarella. Roasted red peppers. Arugula. Just a sprinkle of the finest olive oil and the best salt you've ever had.
[I actually thought it was really fun. It was very team oriented, and there was more communication than in games like CoD or Battlefield. I haven't tried out Natural Selection yet (I have a massive backlog of games on Steam), but it looks great.   What kind of games do you play?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qgp6n/charlie_cleveland_cofounder_of_indie_game_company/c3xkt3y?context=5)|I play a lot of Euro board games, as well as more artsy/unique video games. My favorite video games of recent memory: Braid, Limbo (perfection), Portal and...Mortal Kombat 9.
[Charlie, you do some amazing work with the community, you keep us all well informed of whats going on, my question is how do you cope?  what energy drink fuels Charlie Clevelend?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qgp6n/charlie_cleveland_cofounder_of_indie_game_company/c3xhhms?context=5)|Black tea and lattes. Sightglass or Vega preferred. Our office is in the land of amazing, snobby coffee.
[I've been a huge fan of ns since way back. I've always wanted to play it single player. Now when beta is starting to look and feel real good to play I'm even more interested in the idea. Perhaps something to dabble in after the game is released? I mean... Just look at it.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qgp6n/charlie_cleveland_cofounder_of_indie_game_company/c3xhdk0?context=5)|I've had an idea for a story for awhile, but I don't see us doing SP any time soon. Budgets have gotten completely out of control in this area (Uncharted 3 anyone?) and I don't want to figure out how to spend 30 million dollars creating cut-scenes.  I think our company will always be about multiplayer. It just makes so much more sense to make a game that people play forever instead of once, and I'm much more interested in people-oriented games than story-oriented games.
[You've been committed to NS for a long time now. How did you decide to start, and did you ever imagine you'd still be at it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qgp6n/charlie_cleveland_cofounder_of_indie_game_company/c3xhtw9?context=5)|Heh. No, if I realized how much time I would on this game I'm not sure I would've gone down this path. It's become a lifestyle.  I started because I got fired from my last job and I had saved up some money. I had this idea of a game burning in my brain and was amazed to see how big the mod scene had gotten. Making it a HL mod seemed like the right approach to bring this game to the world so I just started.   http://www.gdcvault.com/play/1014394/1-Hour-Video-Game.
[I bought your game twice via various deals (one was humble bundle, the other something else). I'm on Ubuntu though, and while there certainly won't be a native version, will any effort be put into any potential incompatibilities with Wine/Crossover Games?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qgp6n/charlie_cleveland_cofounder_of_indie_game_company/c3xgs1y?context=5)|Probably not. We're a tiny team and we barely have enough resources to get the game done. I don't think it makes sense for us to work on the a linux client or Wine support.  However, I bet our community can and will do this.
[That woul require some access to the source code. The renderer has to be rewritten to opengl, and probably some file access/threading changes. Totaly doable, but not only with the lua code. In an older newspost that possibility was mentioned and seemed like the way forward for a potential linux port. Is this still the case?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qgp6n/charlie_cleveland_cofounder_of_indie_game_company/c3xkjcc?context=5)|Hey Asraniel, good to see you outside of our forums.  Sorry, I was talking about the Wine support. I don't know much about it, but I know our players got NS1 working in Wine, I bet they could do for NS2 also.
[What will you do after the game is released and you can take some time off?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qgp6n/charlie_cleveland_cofounder_of_indie_game_company/c3xgw7n?context=5)|I plan on bicycling across Italy. It's something I've wanted to do for a very long time.  Then it's back to work.
[How does one get Jeremy Soule http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Soule#Discography to work for a free Half Life Modification?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qgp6n/charlie_cleveland_cofounder_of_indie_game_company/c3xla8w?context=5)|Good question. I think that was just luck and timing. Or maybe it's just that most people don't ask?
[Do you have any other projects in mind for the Spark engine?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qgp6n/charlie_cleveland_cofounder_of_indie_game_company/c3xgvy8?context=5)|Yes, quite a few. Some very different genres too. Some pretty experimental ideas too.
[Hey Charlie! I started playing NS in early 2003. I've had my times off but I always come back to it. Just wanted you to know that you and your mod (and now game) have given me many many hours of enjoyable videogame moments. So here's the question, how comfortable do you guys feel with the release date for Ns2?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qgp6n/charlie_cleveland_cofounder_of_indie_game_company/c3xguoa?context=5)|We're committed to it. If the game has serious flaws that we think we need more time to address, we'll fix them instead of releasing something bad, but I'm think we're going to hit it.
[I'd love to hear more about your involvement with MindRover. Sadly it's no longer available for purchase, but it succeeded in getting really good reviews at places like IGN upon release. Do you think it would be more successful if released now?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qgp6n/charlie_cleveland_cofounder_of_indie_game_company/c3xl5it?context=5)|Wow, you played MindRover?! That was the first commercial game I worked on. It was just a couple a people - I worked my butt off on that game. It was a complete blast too.
[Any ideas on what happened to the rights? Could we see a re-release on GOG or even an open sourcing?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qgp6n/charlie_cleveland_cofounder_of_indie_game_company/c3xl5it?context=5)|Kent still owns the rights to MindRover as far as I know. You can contact him if you Google Kent Quirk.
[Are you planning to make anything after NS2? :)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qgp6n/charlie_cleveland_cofounder_of_indie_game_company/c3xlsdi?context=5)|Oh yeah.  We're just getting started. Lots of ideas, some very different. It's my hope that as we grow we'll be able to do more projects and do them a bit faster too. It would be amazing to release a game every 6 months or year.
[Why is your Spark engine so sexy?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qgp6n/charlie_cleveland_cofounder_of_indie_game_company/c3xka8v?context=5)|That's a question for Max: http://www.unknownworlds.com/about.
[How the hell do you kill fades?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qgp6n/charlie_cleveland_cofounder_of_indie_game_company/c3xknfu?context=5)|You need to gang up with your buddies and get shotguns! The balance isn't perfect yet though and a good Fade player can really rip you up.
[Still, fucking awesome game.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qgp6n/charlie_cleveland_cofounder_of_indie_game_company/c3xlbz7?context=5)|Just think about all the work you DIDN'T have to do to play this game...
[Of course =(](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qgp6n/charlie_cleveland_cofounder_of_indie_game_company/c3xj1bx?context=5)|I don't see us adding a third race any time soon. What I really love about the game is the Marines vs. Aliens feel. We all know what that's like from various sci-fi books and movies, and as soon as you add a third race it totally changes that.

Its been between 3-4 weeks since I last smoked, (thank god I ran out and didn't have time to get more... def. wasn't thinking about drug tests w/ internships) but before that it was daily for years. I've never tripped on this before but I actually searched it a minute ago and I'm reading for daily use it can show up in testing for 1-2 months. I'm not fat, but I have a little weight. I plan on accepting Thursday, and the test has to be two business days later, so a week from monday. 

Am I tripping? I've no problem ordering something online to help detox, Ive got cranberry juice and I'm contemplating hitting the gym like a beast next week. I just can't fuck this up, its one of those internships that ""launches"" a career deals... 

Help me out, let me know if I'm tripping, or what the best product is on the market to help pass this thing, anything else that might help.

For as long as i know i haven't been able to study or work properly during the day. 

During daytime i will sit behind my desk and try to get on with my dissertation but ideas won't come, i don't seem to understand the information i'm reading and i loose track of my progress. I get frustrated and basically browse the web or find excuses not to work.

However as soon as the clock strikes 8PM i turn into a focused machine that knows how to proceed and actually gets something done.

This shouldn't be a problem but i would prefer a normal rhythm and during internships i experienced the same problem. I don't think this will make me a good employee.

I tried using Ritalin, green tea, coffee but all this just seems to block my mind even more.

I always study in my room, which is a quiet clean place.

Any tips?"

I was informed that they will do a background check on me.  I told the clerk that I had been convicted of misdemeanors several years ago.  I have turned down all other job offers, and I am really depending on working this job.  So my question is, will my background kill my job offer.

-I have been caught with a small amount of pot and a pot pipe.  I have like 4-5 underage consumptions and minor in possessions of alcohol, a hit and run, a disorderly conduct.  I may even have a resisting/evading arrest.  I also have had several tickets in my past.  I also was convicted of violation of probation once, and served 30 days in the county jail.  All of these were misdemeanors.  I have not been in trouble at all in around 4 years.  I'm also close to the top of my class, and have like 5 years of military experience.  So how screwed am I, or is there a chance I will get to keep my internship.

I feel as if it is a fairly reasonable goal. It would mean losing about 40 pounds. Do you think this is practical? I have been trying a number of things. I started out on a calorie restricted diet and that wasn't really working (even paired with daily exercise) and then I tried keto for a while. The keto went great for a little while but I have my suspicions that it was mostly because I was starving myself because all the food I had at the time had too many carbs. I can't keep up with keto however because it just wasn't practical for my current lifestyle. So now I'm going to try a strict calorie with lower carb type diet. What do you think about this? I could really use some more advice. 

Also are there any little pointers any of you may have? I have a really hard time losing weight. I'm a pretty active person. I was working out every day of the week last semester and only lost about five pounds. I'm going to get my thyroid retested when I get home from my current internship.

We have discussed how I feel about porn many times and he knows that I don't like him watching it. He has assured me multiple times throughout this transition that he has not been looking at porn in any way. 

I'm here to visit and am using his computer. Today I found 60+ links to porn videos, amateur albums etc. I am very upset and am not sure what to do. We have never had problems like this and I don't understand what lying to me was supposed to help.

Should I just forgive him and let him watch/look at these things or should I stand my ground and tell him I don't want him too...

qifyi,1,2012-03-05,Reddit was I right to step out of this friendship?,Paars,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/qifyi/reddit_was_i_right_to_step_out_of_this_friendship/,"This story starts about a year ago when I was very depressed about my life not going in an upward direction and I had some mental issues which I was in therapy for. For a number of years I was very close friends to a guy and a girl who are a couple together and had a son (The female is sick it's not terminal but it is pretty serious and they have no idea what is going on). I regarded them as my family and did everything in my power to help then whenever they had problems. On one occassion she called me up crying cause they had a huge fight in which I was going to get sucked up in at 04:00 AM and I instantly got in my car and drove over) however there was about a 150km distance between us. So I visisted them alot and then stayed for a few days during that period. Keep in mind at that moment I had no job no school and no source of obligations.

That lasted for about 6 months during the time my depression got less and started doing some freelance work for an old internship for some small payment just to keep busy since the owners of that company were worried about me.

About a month later (this was about July) I met my current girlfriend and felt my life was going in an upward stream. All was well untill I landed in October with an chance to get a contract. It was a freelance job for 3 months (till January) so I made clear to everyone that this was very important for me and that I wanted this job so that was my number one priority at the moment.

During the course of those 3 months we spoke less and less resulting in her questioning our friendship. I tried to make clear that with this contract and my new girlfriend (We just got serious during that period) that I didn't have alot of sparetime however that I still cared about them deeply and that I would surely visit them later when things had calmed down. So we had like 4-5 of these conversations during the course of November. Then we had another one in which I lost my temper a little bit and said that I felt she was claiming me. At that moment she got mad at me and said she never wanted to see me again and logged off and distanced herself from me. I didn't like her reaction and was very sad and upset about it. However in my view it was her choice and I had to respect it if I liked it or not. So about a month went by and I had kept her in my phone on MSN and on FB so she could contact me if she wanted to. But she didn't.

So after 4-5 weeks I give up and remove her from MSN and FB assuming our friendship was over. So about 2-3 weeks later her boyfriend hits me up asking me if I removed her from MSN and FB so I reply in all honesty that I did she he questions me why I did it. I told him it was because she said she never wanted to speak to me or see me again. He then replies why I didn't try to contact her. At this moment I was baffled cause I could not believe he just said that or that that was my responsibility because she was that one that distanced herself from me and all I cared about was just get an apology from her for saying she never wanted to see me again. We argued for a few hours untill we realised we couldn't solve this so he removed me and we lost all contact.

During February my girlfriend and I moved in together. We hadn't planned on it but it was the right move cause we would both be alot closer to our jobs since my contract got extended. I celebrated my birthday went on a snowboarding holiday without ever hearing from them.
One saturday afternoon my phone starts ringing and it is her calling me. So I pick up and she instantly starts crying that her father got diagnosed with terminal cancer. I have no idea how to react to it so I just talk back that I am sorry for her but that I can't do anything for her and I make sure I don't react to attached so after a few minutes she hangs up and again I hear nothing on them. Then last weekend I get another message from her boyfriend on FB that still although what happened they still see me as a close friend and it hurts them that I haven't called them after her call yet still during all this they never even asked how I was doing so I just ignored it.

I am sorry for the bad grammar and since this is quite lengthy I wasn't able to include all details. I appreciate any response :).

Questions|Answers
:--|:--
[How do you respond to people that think GMOs are like radioactive Nazis?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qhb2d/ama_im_a_scientist_in_gmo_transgenic_plant/c3xlpos?context=5)|That unlike radioactive Nazis, there is no solid reproducible harm of GMO technology.  Scientists almost universally agree.  Plus, if any of us public scientists found harm in GMOs, we'd report it, and be set for life with grants, Nobel prizes and awesome papers that changed farming!
[Can you tell us about the light side of GMO science?  I feel that companies like Monsanto really give the field a bad name.  What are some things that will be of *benefit* to our species on the horizon?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qhb2d/ama_im_a_scientist_in_gmo_transgenic_plant/c3xlp24?context=5)|This is a tricky question. First the science.  From model plants we have learned about the pathways that help provide tolerance to extreme weather, drought, etc.  We know how plants make metabolites and resist disease.  All of these could be parts of the new generation of transgenic plants.  More flavor, nutrition, etc too.  However, it is almost impossible to commercialize these materials.  The approval process selects for big companies, and that's why the only transgenic crops are big ag crops!   In the long run, safe transgenic technology will be the norm.  Thanks.
[Most of the questions so far seem to be based on the health vs risk factors of eating GM plants. I'm aware that transgenic plants can be used for other highly useful tasks such as landline/radiation detection.  Are you working on anything related to non-nutritional issues? If so, what? And are there any major areas that you think GM plants may be incredibly valuable?  Cheers.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qhb2d/ama_im_a_scientist_in_gmo_transgenic_plant/c3xm4j5?context=5)|Funny you should ask.  We are partnering with a Spanish lab to make a plant that gives a strong visible response at the first onset of pathogen attack.  It is not fertile with other fruits, so it can't cross out to non GMOs.  It will give a visible warning to the farmer that a pathogen is present, allowing precise application of controls. Farmers will use less pesticide/fungicide, less in the environment, huge savings, less fuel, more precise applications, less for consumers to worry about.  It is a fresh project just at the start, but could have wonderful environmental impacts. 
[I guess, a question would be how do you feel about ownership of genes?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qhb2d/ama_im_a_scientist_in_gmo_transgenic_plant/c3xlwvv?context=5)|Ownership of genes?  In my lab we have a few novel genes we've discovered that can increase fruit size and yield.  If I can patent them, hire more people, train more students, and generate improved products for the industries I care about, I think that's a good thing.  Right now, all on the remote-remote drawing board.  Even if I had a great solution there is no way I could afford to commercialize it.  That's a game only for the Monsantos/Bayers/Dows because of the high barriers set by regualtors.
[Do you believe, based on studies, that GMOs will harm humans in the long run?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qhb2d/ama_im_a_scientist_in_gmo_transgenic_plant/c3xlokd?context=5)|Based on the current literature there is no reproducible, independent evidence of harm.  It all comes from the same labs and is not in the best of journals.  I can't say what will happen in the long run- no real scientist can.  However, based on our understanding of the science there is no plausible means that the technology can be harmful any more than traditional breeding.  Thanks.
[Is saving seed illegal and why?  Do you find a living organism that is produced to feed humans, engineered to kill itself frightening and maybe a tad risky?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qhb2d/ama_im_a_scientist_in_gmo_transgenic_plant/c3xm8y5?context=5)|This has been the case for 100 years with the introduction of hybrids to protect a company's hard earned intellectual property.  Seeds from hybrids do not produce true-to-type offspring, ensuring re-purchase.  Not new!  Farmers that grow GMO crops agree to not save the seeds- they are the intellectual property of the company.  It is not just GMOs.  Farmers are not allowed to propagate NON-gmo ornamentals, fruits and vegetables protected by plant patents.  These are superior lines that took a long time to create, so their propagation for production is forbidden except for the patent holder.  This provides a means for a scientist or company to continue crop improment efforts.
[1) How are most transgenes inserted?  Viral infection?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qhb2d/ama_im_a_scientist_in_gmo_transgenic_plant/c3xlxnt?context=5)|Most transgenes are inserted using Agrobacterium tumefaciens, a natural, soil bacterium that performs genetic exchange as part of its life cycle. Scientists exploit its innate properties to introduce genes. 
[2) Can you predict what the biggest obstacle that needs to be overcome is before next-gen GMO crops become the norm?  Is it identifying the correct genes/specific alleles necessary to confer drought resistance or whatever, or is it going to be incorporating these genes into the target genome without making unwanted alterations to the resulting plant?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qhb2d/ama_im_a_scientist_in_gmo_transgenic_plant/c3xlxnt?context=5)|The biggest obstacle will be correcting perception.  Transgenics have been tarnished by fear and disinformation.   I think that cis-genics, or using a plant's own genes to do the work will be the intermediate step, but it is scientifically unnecessary.
[3)In your estimation, how long until a farmer can custom-order a variant of most crops that is optimized for the climate he or she works in?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qhb2d/ama_im_a_scientist_in_gmo_transgenic_plant/c3xlxnt?context=5)|Coming soon.  I think that GM technolgies will greatly expand ranges and will be used to accelerate traditional breeding in concert with molecular markers.  
[4)If you aren't part of big ag, you may not know this one.  How much of Monsanto's business model relies on the sale of Round-Up?   In other words, would it be economically viable for them to sell seeds for climate resistance, which do not require further purchases, or would this model require seed prices to be too high?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qhb2d/ama_im_a_scientist_in_gmo_transgenic_plant/c3xlxnt?context=5)|Big Ag built itself on proprietary hybrids that did not need downstream products.  While roundup-ready has a product to use it, Bt corn, cotton etc do not.  These are superior products that farmers choose, and will continue to do so based on performance.
[I find it difficult to accept that GMO and selective breeding equate to the same thing. Can you help me understand?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qhb2d/ama_im_a_scientist_in_gmo_transgenic_plant/c3xm3ke?context=5)|They are not the same thing.  Selective breeding moves tens of thousands of genes at one time, GMO 1-3.  Much more precise with predictable, traceable outcomes.  Selective breeding takes much longer due to linkage drag and the need to grow generations to fertility... e.g. transgenic apples resistant to scab made in a few years where selective breeding took over fifty.  They absolutely are not the same-- you are right on.
[What kind of research do you do? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qhb2d/ama_im_a_scientist_in_gmo_transgenic_plant/c3xlqle?context=5)|I work in genomics, mostly in linking genes to the traits they control.  We use GMO technology only as a tool to learn about biology.  All in the lab.  We use this information to guide traditional breeding efforts in strawberries and small, high value fruits.  Unfortunately, even if we have a proven technology that could help farmers, we can't commercialize it.  Too expensive, too much resistance. For now... 
[How hard would it be to make tomatoes produce cannabinoids?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qhb2d/ama_im_a_scientist_in_gmo_transgenic_plant/c3xma85?context=5)|I get emails on this one a few times a year.  I have to be careful and only say that it would be possible to make a BLT that would make you want another one.
[How would you describe your career field to a high school student? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qhb2d/ama_im_a_scientist_in_gmo_transgenic_plant/c3xm01z?context=5)|Also- find an internship in a real lab.  Learn how it works.  Find a good role model that can guide your early career decisions.  I train lots of high school students and undergrads- my favorite part of the job!
[Do the chemicals that break down vegetables in my stomach know the difference between GM tomatoes and heritage tomatoes? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qhb2d/ama_im_a_scientist_in_gmo_transgenic_plant/c3xly5j?context=5)|Your stomach cannot tell the difference.  The GM/ non-gm are functionally equivalent in that there is no plausible way that the transgenes can affect guy physiology in humans.  That's well established. 
[Do you think companies should be required to label things as GMO?  What are your thoughts on patenting organisms, genes, etc?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qhb2d/ama_im_a_scientist_in_gmo_transgenic_plant/c3xm4ay?context=5)|More information is always good, so in theory I'm all for labeling.  However, do we also then have to label intra-specific crosses that move tens of thousands of genes randomly from conventional breeding?  That would be intellectually consistent.  The problem is that the anti-scientists in the anti-GMO movement have scared people to death, and labeling will just provide a target to instill these fears.  I'm a scientist, environmentalist, and have concern for workers and consumers.  I don't fear GMO technology, maybe because I'm so connected to it and understand it.  That's why I'm here.  
[Did you hear Amit got tenured up at Washington State?  Also, do you think that securing funding for your lab effects the quality and direction of your research positively or negatively? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qhb2d/ama_im_a_scientist_in_gmo_transgenic_plant/c3xly67?context=5)|Yikes, an inside question!  Good for Amit- he called me right away.  I'm really happy.   Funding affects the direction of research only in that we need to test hypotheses relevant to the funding agency's wishes.  HOWEVER, funding NEVER influences experimental outcomes.  The results are, what the results are.   The former is a problem.  I find myself moving into areas I'm not comfortable with and spending a lot of time learning new areas just to be able to hire students and postdocs.  However, I'm learning a lot.  Thanks for the questions.
[I find it interesting that you make the specification that funding doesn't influence experimental outcomes, but mention nothing about how funding *can absolutely* influence what is done with that data, whether promoting it or burying it, as well as how the data is presented, which is frequently skewed to be beneficial for the group paying for the research. Thoughts?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qhb2d/ama_im_a_scientist_in_gmo_transgenic_plant/c3xncw2?context=5)|Skewed to be beneficial to the group paying for it?  What they are paying for is the Truth.  There is no merit in ""skewing"" data.  Facts always come out and one must never sacrifice a reputation.  Bogus data does no good for a company.  Facts rise to the top sooner or later- they need it sooner especially in litigious times.
[Why do you say that anti-GMO sentiment is anti-science? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qhb2d/ama_im_a_scientist_in_gmo_transgenic_plant/c3xnkda?context=5)|It is anti-science in that the concerns are not substantiated by the peer-reviewed literature.  With your credentials you should be able to see that. Plus, all of your scenarios about protein disruption etc. could just as well apply to naturally occurring transposons and other genetic rearrangements. What about straight-up crosses?  Induced polyploidy?  Spontaneous polyploidy?  All much more intrusive than adding a gene or two (and most labs don't use gene guns these days). Moreover, the allergen argument is not substantiated by the science and chemical concerns are no different than conventional farming.  Intellectual property is not GMO specific either- plants have been patented for well over a century. So the arguments specifically levied against GMO technology are inconsistent with the state of the literature and are intellectually inconsistent with what is done by other breeding efforts.  That is anti-scientific, denial of sound processes. And there is FDA mandated testing. I know people that have been through the long and expensive process.  I'm happy to discuss this further, but being anti-GMO is like being anti-vaccination or anti-climate change.  It is a sentiment inconsistent with the science.
[Do you think that GMOs will significantly alter evolution on a short-term scale, like in the case of Monsanto's Round-Up resistant ""superweeds""?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qhb2d/ama_im_a_scientist_in_gmo_transgenic_plant/c3xlqn3?context=5)|We have been farming crops (plants) that never were here, don't belong here, and require huge amounts of chemicals/labor/fuel to be here.  It is all unnatural.  The 14 species of Roundup resistant superweeds are just like the hundreds of other superweeds created by more harmful, hazardous chemicals in previous decades. Roundup is safer for workers, the environment and consumer.  Yes, we will need another solution as roundup looses effectiveness, but that's the battle to grow food for our growing planet.  Thanks for a good question.
[Proof that you are ""a public, academic scientist with no ties to Big Ag"", esp the latter part?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qhb2d/ama_im_a_scientist_in_gmo_transgenic_plant/c3xm22q?context=5)|Google my username. I'm real!  Plus all of my funding comes through the university, regardless of source, so that's all public record. You can investigate.  
[I have heard that GMO is often used to increase tolerance to pesticides (instead of increasing tolerance to the pests, in order to sell more pesticide), is that true, and any comments? Could it be that it is much easier to provide pesticide tolerance than pest tolerance? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qhb2d/ama_im_a_scientist_in_gmo_transgenic_plant/c3xm4zi?context=5)|I think you are confusing herbicide with pesticide.  Some GM plants are made to be herbicide resistant.  That uses more of some herbicides, less of other more toxic ones.   Pesticide resistance? It is true, but it is true of any mechanism to control pests.  What GM /transgenic technology provides is a much more durable mechanism (Bt protein is good example).  It is hard to develop resistance because of its mechanism.  
[Is Monsanto evil?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qhb2d/ama_im_a_scientist_in_gmo_transgenic_plant/c3xm8bb?context=5)|I'm a scientist.  I don't like any company dominating market share so much and would love to see new products and new competition. However, lawmakers are owned by Big Ag and activists want regulations and restrictions high.  This is a perfect storm that will ensure Big Ag's long-term survival!
[What do you think of Monsanto and of the constant negative attention it attracts, particularly on Reddit?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qhb2d/ama_im_a_scientist_in_gmo_transgenic_plant/c3xm7nj?context=5)|I have mixed feelings because I'm a scientist that supports GMO technology, not what companies necessarily do with it.  As stated earlier, those that oppose Monsanto et al should seek to loosen restrictions on deployment and commercialization of GMO technology- let in new competition!  Seems strange, but that's the best way to oppose them.
[If there is ""no reproducible, independent evidence of harm"", why do you think that a lot of Europe has banned gmos?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qhb2d/ama_im_a_scientist_in_gmo_transgenic_plant/c3xm9ki?context=5)|Perception and protectionism for resident farmers.  There is no evidence of harm-- only one lab seems to find problems and they are never verified outside of that lab.  If there was hard evidence of harm it would be the biggest story in a long time. If I found it, I would get a Nobel Prize!  Just no evidence at the moment to support a position of danger.
[Thanks for doing this AMA. I feel a lot of people are concerned GM food being 'dangerous' or 'unnatural', and I am glad you are here to correct some of these pre-conceived notions.  Are there any crops that are more difficult to manipulate than others?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qhb2d/ama_im_a_scientist_in_gmo_transgenic_plant/c3xm9ta?context=5)|You're welcome- important topic with lots of bad information out there.  Some plants, like tobacco, are really easy to work with. Petunia too.
[To expand on the question that was previously asked though... wouldn't you say that GMOs would only have short term gains as general evidence has shown that evolutionary adaptation in harmful organisms such as bacteria, and viruses would neutralize the benefits of genetically forced resistance over the long term? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qhb2d/ama_im_a_scientist_in_gmo_transgenic_plant/c3xm1g5?context=5)|But this is not an argument restricted to GMO/ transgenic technology.  All gains are short term in any crop or cultivation system.  Problems find a way back in.  GM technology gives you fast response and ability to mount a counter-response faster than traditional breeding or alteration of cultivation techniques.  Plus, it is much easier to pyramid transgenic traits without associated linkage drag (ask me if you don't know that one).  Thanks.
[1. Are any seeds sold in stores GMOs? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qhb2d/ama_im_a_scientist_in_gmo_transgenic_plant/c3xre9c?context=5)|None for sale.  Highly regulated.  I can't even send transgenic research seeds without paperwork. 
[2. why do you go straight for a lab solution rather than rely on tricks that have been used for hundreds of years to increase yield and repel pests? I use companion planting, and certain plants that attract parasitic and predatory insects, lizards, and pollinators, as well as make my own compost, and provide bee hotels. I never have problems, and they're cheap and easy. Why rely on something expensive? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qhb2d/ama_im_a_scientist_in_gmo_transgenic_plant/c3xre9c?context=5)|Your second solution is nice, but can't be adapted for a production scale without increasing food costs through the roof.  It is hard to manage one crop, let alone intercroppings, at least on an industrial scale.  Plus, when the technology is safe, why bother?
[How would [you] feel if all/some/future GMO research, development and eventual products were 'NON-PROFIT' and publicly owned? Sort of like NASA, so that all of the benefits of all things GMO would remain to benefit the peoples that supported this science and research and not individual corporations and stockholders?   [Edits]](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qhb2d/ama_im_a_scientist_in_gmo_transgenic_plant/c3xn04r?context=5)|Would be nice, but you know as well as I do that NASA is out of business and that privatization of space is the sustainable model.  If anything, keep it public and competitive, profitable, but let more people in by relaxing regulations.  That's how you take it away form Big Ag.
[Didn't some foundation use those techniques a couple of years ago to develop a flood resistant rice strain?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qhb2d/ama_im_a_scientist_in_gmo_transgenic_plant/c3xr1vi?context=5)|And the flooding resistance rice works and is quite brilliant.
[Do college classes/majors actually matter when finding a job with gmo companies? The major probably helps getting in, but does the school work help with understanding what you're doing? Or do you get almost all training on the job?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qhb2d/ama_im_a_scientist_in_gmo_transgenic_plant/c3xuazm?context=5)|Yes, good jobs at BS/MS, some at PhD too.  If you can have molecular biology skills coupled to traditional plant breeding you will find many opportunities.  Not necessarily GMO, but a good job.  The GM part is just a tool in the process.
[How is the political and business climate affects our food supply in regards to GMO's? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qhb2d/ama_im_a_scientist_in_gmo_transgenic_plant/c3xtvwr?context=5)|I'm really here to talk about science and not the business. However, patents are not MON driven.  They have been commonplace for well over 100 years.
[How applicable is GMO technology to growing Agave Cacti on the nutrient barren Lunar regolith?  We need our tequila in space.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qhb2d/ama_im_a_scientist_in_gmo_transgenic_plant/c3xnddk?context=5)|The agave are no problem and take well to the regolith- it is the limes that are the problem.

Even a plant coming in for DNA alone has to go through the USDA for inspection, then has to be destroyed upon receipt.  Fear of pests and pathogens-- and a good fear to have.

To me, the carsnoble seems more formal, as it's most of my first name and my last name, but the Mango.Tux is the one I check more often, and the Tux is a reference to Linux, which I think \*might* be worth a bit more credit for a programming job.

If I accept SAIC's offer for a summer internship, they want me to rescind my GD offer so I can work for the summer internship and FT after I graduate a year from now. My question is, what legal repercussions or negative things can sprout from cancelling or rescinding a contingent job offer?

I ended up basically phoning it in and organizing files for the summer, which I didn't mind at the time, because I wasn't very motivated.  Now I am older and wiser, and I realize what a bum I was.  My boss at the organization was really nice and could have been a great contact for me (I have actually used her as a reference) but at this point thinking about the internship just makes me feel embarrassed.  

I have a job in the private sector now, but I am considering applying for jobs at a non-profit.  I would probably use her as a reference still (I am guessing she would say something non-specific to potential employers) since I don't have too many other contacts in the field.  I am always tempted to send her a message to sort of apologize though, so she knows that I realize how lame I was and that I'm at least somewhat better now.

qjukd,13,2012-03-06,I am a QA engineer and I hate my job :( Help,mad_max_,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/qjukd/i_am_a_qa_engineer_and_i_hate_my_job_help/,"Dear Reddit,

Just to give some history, I have a Bachelors in CS which I followed up immediately with a Masters in Computer Engineering. School was a great learning experience and some of my favorite classes were Concurrent Programming, Algorithms, Operating Systems and Computer Networks. 

When I graduated, I started looking for a job with some of the biggest software companies around. However,  the times were rotten and the economy was FUBAR. After months of unemployment and failing to get a job offer from the dozens of interviews that I attended, I was finally offered a role with one of the biggest software companies out there. The catch was that it was a QA and not a dev job but I was desperate for anything and I had student loans to pay off. In retrospect, that might have been the worst decision I've made in my life. 

It was exciting initially - I had my first real job and the pay (to me) seemed fantastic. Flexible hours, stock options and a great boss, I had it all. However, then the excitement wore off and I started hating my job. The only times that I felt good about my work was when I was developing test automation but that was a really small part of my job. For the most part, I was running tests manually and filing bugs. I also realized that QA people are looked down upon by most developers in the industry. I started feeling that I wasn't utilizing anything that I learned in school and that I had wasted all those years of education. I also found out that I was woefully underpaid in comparison to the industry average. So I started looking for a new job.

So after one and a half years of working for my first employer, I started working for a second employer with a significant pay increase ALSO in a QA role. I told myself that the increased pay would make me like QA and make up for the downsides. Boy, was I wrong! I've been with this company for three years and I hate this job as much as the last. I've realized that the only way I'm going to be happy is if I find a full-time development role. I'm interested in system programming, writing device drivers and operating system kernels. However, with the kind of experience that I have on my resume, the only kind of job offers that I get are QA related.

What advice does reddit have for me? Here is what I've thought of:

1) Writing open source code: I've actually been trying to contribute for a long time but its so freaking hard to get started. How do I find a project I like? How do I contribute to that project?
2) Working on side projects outside of work: Again, with my relative lack of experience and because of my full time job, its hard for me to just write a project on my own
3) Apply for programming internships. Is this even an option given that I'm not a fresh college graduate any more?

TL;DR I am a QA engineer who hates this line of work after working two years in this industry. I'm desperately looking to move on to full time development roles but I'm getting typecasted into QA positions because of my prior work experience.

Please forgive any grammatical and spelling errors; English isn't my first language :) I'd sincerely appreciate any advice that Reddit has to give."
qjt7q,19,2012-03-06,Ethical and Legal Questions Regarding an Accounting Intern Becoming Aware of a Possible Fraud and Investigation. What Should I Do?,FutureCPAneedshelp,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/qjt7q/ethical_and_legal_questions_regarding_an/,"**Forward:**

I would like to thank each of you for your interest in the post, firstly.  I understand that all the postings in response to this are merely the opinions of the poster, regardless of that individual’s accreditation, and I will not consider it legal advice or counsel; instead, solely as friendly opinions and points of discussion. I would prefer that opinions be supported with accredited sources when applicable. Again, thank you all for your incite and perspectives, trust that all information you can provide will be taken to heart. 

**Background:**

I am a senior undergraduate accounting major at a small, private, not-for-profit university. Because of the nature of the underlying questions involved in this posting and the confidentiality involved I will not disclose the name of the university. I am currently employed as the Intern to the Finance Department of that university, in which I work directly under the CFO/Treasurer/EVP of Finance, the Director of Risk Management/Assistant VP of Finance, and the Director of Compliance and Tax Issues. Additionally, I am currently wrapping up my 150 with plans to sit for all four sections of the CPA during the summer, after I graduate in May. Following my graduation, I have an offer to begin in the fall with a CPA firm as an auditor; I previously worked as a tax/audit intern with the firm. That firm currently audits the financial statement of the university of which I am employed and attend, however, though a different office than that which I would be employed and with a different partner than that I would work under.

**Situation:** 

Within the past week I became aware that a number of professors at my university, including one in the accounting department who informed me, believe that there may be a number of material misrepresentations in the university’s Form 990 (the not-for-profit tax return, issued to the IRS and disclosed to the public) and the possibility of a number of illegal accounting activities, as a result of management fraud. Specifically, to the best of my knowledge, the group of professors believes that three identifiable frauds may be occurring: misstatements in the 990 compensation disclosures, misrepresentations in the 990 treatment of our art collection, and the unlawful and fraudulent use of proceeds from the sale of assets included in that art collection. 

Firstly, this group of professors believes that the 990 form misrepresents the university it its disclosures related to the compensation; however, not the specific dollar values, but rather the related yes or no questions. I have no knowledge to suggest this accusation has any merit and have very limited knowledge as to the evidence or knowledge being used by the group of professors unofficially investigating the issue. 

However, I am more aware of the circumstances of possible fraud relating to the art collection and the use of its proceeds and its treatment on the 990. Our university has long held an art collection valued at roughly 1.5 million dollars which was reflected on both the audited financial statements and the 990 form until 3 years ago. At that time our university came under new management, including a new President and a new CFO/Treasurer/EVP of Finance. Apparently, under that new management the university decided that the art collection should be liquidated and assigned the accounting professor mentioned previously, along with others, to investigate how to go about the liquidation process. He informed me that he recommended that the university’s only options were to either reinvest the proceeds back into the art collection or donate the collection to a not-for-profit which could be better suited for the collection. He also informed me that the following year the art collection was no longer shown on the 990.

Since the conversation, I have started looking into the issue myself. I came to a similar conclusion regarding the proper treatment of art collections and the required reinvestment of the proceeds from the sale of art collections, as is outlined in SFAS 116 and FASB ASC 958. Also, I have compared the audited financial statements against the 990 to confirm that the art collection still exists, and is shown as “Art Collection” on the audited financials, but shown as “Other” under the Part VI disclosure of the Schedule D attached the 990. Additionally, the 990 has a series of questions and additional disclosures related to art collections, these are either unanswered or answered in contrary to the existence of an art collection on the 990. My understanding of the instructions regarding the 990 would require alternative answers to those provided by management in the case of our art collections, and the purpose with which they were donated and had been capitalized and recognized. 

Today I was informed by one of my direct supervisors that I would be involved in the liquidation of some of the university’s art. I asked him what purpose the university was planning on using the proceeds of the sale of the pieces for and he informed me that the funds would be uses as general revenue and would go into our general fund without restrictions. Also, I asked what percentage of the collection we were planning on liquidating and he informed me that the pieces we were planning on liquidating where not included in our collection according to the financial statements, the collection is stored at a local art museum. These pieces were assorted items with which we had been unable to valuate and properly keep track of. He said there are inadequate records regarding these pieces and that updating and compiling those records would be the majority of my duties related to the liquidation. 

**Request for Advice:**

I would appreciate any additional understanding you could pass onto me regarding the proper treatment of these items and please correct any misunderstanding I may have regarding the regulations and laws related. 

I am looking for advice regarding how best to handle the situation in general. It is important to me that I uphold the code of conduct of the AICPA and avoid any unlawful and unethical actions during the remainder of my employment at the university. 

My university does have a whistleblower policy which I will be forced to utilize if I find any substantive evidence of fraud; I would appreciate any incite as to when/if you think I should use this. 

What disclosures am I required, permitted, discouraged, or prohibited from making to my department, the professors, and my CPA firm which audits the university?

What would you do in my situation?

Any other advise you think would be useful. 

**Current Opinion:**

I am currently leaning toward a course of action which will try and avoid involvement in the situation. I believe that I should make my supervisors aware of the restrictions and regulations related to art collections and inform them of my opinions regarding 990 disclosures related to art collections. Also, I believe I should inform them that “I have become aware of concerns related to the answers provided in the 990 form” and leave it at that. I may also have to request not to be involved in the art liquidation process. Additionally, I thought I would inform the professor I spoke to (and am currently taking an accounting ethics course with) that I was going to make this disclosure to my supervisors. Also, I do not believe I can inform the CPA firm of any of this because it is confidential information I acquired outside of my employment with them. 

**Conclusion:**

Thank you again for your input and concern. I truly appreciate any insight you all can offer and will consider it thoroughly. As I am sure you all can see, I really feel as though I have no other good source to seek counsel from, with my future firm, supervisors, and professors all intimately involved. As stated above I would prefer any references to creditable sources when available just because of the nature of reddit and the fact that I may have to support my positions in the future if an investigation ensues.

On top of that though, I need to practice my programming. **What kind of stuff, that is around my level, can I do that will look decent as part of a portfolio?** The only thing I've done lately is perl and AHK scripts, which I doubt would look great anywhere.

Second: Because I'm looking to learn more programming/web development on my own time, I've decided to pick up IT jobs instead of programming-related jobs so I can actually have money to start paying back my loans - and eventually be more attractive for programming-related jobs. So question is: **Is it going to look badly if I have an IT job right out of college instead of a programming job?**"

It is my motivation for everything in my life.",Cat_Fish,GetMotivated,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/comments/qjo1v/hi_getmotivated_im_new_here_but_i_have_a_story_i/,"Hello everyone. I'm Cat_Fish, I'm a 19-year old college student and I have a story I want to share with you. It will be pretty lengthy, but its something that I really think will help anyone who wants to get motivated for the gym, and possibly life in general.

When I was 18 in my senior year of high school, I was 5'4"" and 175 lbs. of out-of-shape-ness. That January, I came to the conclusion that it was time to make a difference in my physique and life mind-set. I decided to get the jump start on my fitness goals through our school's ski trip, which ran from January 21st to January 24th. The plan was to take a bus to Vermont from New Jersey and snowboard all weekend on various mountains. It was my last time on the trip and I was excited to beat the hell out of myself on a mountain.

Now I ask: Do you remember where you were January 21st, 2010? I do. 

I was coming up to a bend, where out of nowhere another skier cut me off. I had no choice but to avoid collision. However, my stop wasn't clean and shot me down the slope *horizontally*. I went off the trail, and hit my right leg on a fallen, dead tree. Instead of hitting my boot, it hit *right above* it, shattering my right leg. After an hour of screaming for help, a respiratory therapist found a scared, raspy-voiced boy. After being rushed to the hospital, and getting these [gnarly X-rays](http://imgur.com/a/8hadQ), and going straight into surgery, I woke up about 17 hours later to find that my leg had 4 screws and a metal rod in it. Now conscious, my surgeon came in to check on me and asked me to wiggle my toes. I wiggled them down successfully, but coming up didn't happen. My surgeon got nervous and, after checking over and over again, I had developed [Compartment Syndrome](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0002204/). Basically, there is a compartment in our right shin just off to the right that filled with so much fluid, it choked my nerve and killing off a chunk of muscle in my leg (NOTE: I tried taking a picture of this, but couldn't get a clear one at the moment.). To counter the compartment syndrome, they made a six-inch incision on the compartment, releasing the pressure that was destroying my leg. This was my 2nd surgery in 3 days. I do not remember anything of day 4 unfortunately, but on day 5, I figured out why my leg was in so much pain still.

On day 5, my surgeon came in and notified me they had to ""clean my wound"". I was completely baffled,""What the hell do you mean you have to *clean* it?"" And then, I saw it: underneath my splint was a completely open wound that had been sitting there. I saw the muscle and everything. I was in so much pain because the swelling had not settled yet and the incision that was made was unable to be closed in the surgery. 

Fuck my life.

2 more surgeries occured in the following 4 days, but nothing was like the hell I wasn't prepared for on my last night. You see: The doctors were basically feeding me Percoset. I was dependent on them to sleep somewhat soundly, but I hadn't eaten in 4 days and it was making me sick to my stomach. I quit all my narcotic pain meds cold turkey my last night. Welcome to hell night. I endured cold sweats, 4 vomiting fits, 2 panic attacks and 0 hours of sleep. Oh, did I mention I was going into surgery the next day? So no food or water. After vomitting up nothing, being dehydrated, anxiety attacks, cold sweats, and exhaustion for an entire night, I was wheeled into my 5th and final surgery to close that open wound on my leg. 

Thankfully, it was successful.

I woke up from the surgery happy, clean, free of pain and pain meds and eating my first meal in 6 days: spaghetti and meatballs. Absolutely delicious. Afterwards, my mom and I drove back straight from Vermont to New Jersey in one shot, where I had the most delicious burrito of my entire life.

But wait, the story continues. 3 Months later...

I'm finally back in New Jersey, on crutches, with a cast.

After being in a massive, bulky, heavy cast for so long, it was opened to reveal that my right leg was at a 45 degree angle. My surgeons had not rotated my leg back when they put in the metal rod, causing a HUGE problem. If I did not fix it, I would never be able to run again, and a 95% chance of getting arthritis in my knee and hip, as soon as the age of 30. What could I do to fix something like this? 

I had to give consent to another surgeon to re-break my leg, twist it back, and insert a new metal rod into it.

Great. Another surgery. This one, however, was successful after one surgery. It was a clean, one night stay at the hospital and I was on my way.

Fast forward 8 months of physical therapy 4 times a week, and I was able to finally support my own weight successfully without limping, just in time for college!

On my first day of college in september of 2010, I met a kid named Dan. Dan was a well-built kid with beaming confidence and a unique ability to rally everyone to have fun. Perfect best-friend material. He pushed me to start going to the gym with him as soon as I had felt ready. I took the last 3 months of 2010 to get my legs back to where I felt comfortable to lift. 

On January 3rd, 2011, I performed my first squat. It was 60 lbs. I was sore for 3 straight days. Dan, however, performed a 175 lbs. squat. I told him that, one day, he will see me rep that much weight as well.

He held me to it.

I went to the gym with Dan 3 days a week and hung out with him 7 days a week. We went from total strangers to best friends in a matter of months. He was there for a lot of firsts in my life: such as my first time lifting seriously at the gym and including my first time smoking marijuana. We went to tons of concerts and generally just chilled all the time.

After 4 months of lifting, it became a lifestyle change for me. I had lost weight, gained substantial muscle, and gained more confidence than I ever had. The only person I had to thank was Dan.

My squat weight was up to 135 lbs.

At the end of the year, I was excited to be able to hang out with my friend over the summer, but it was postponed. Dan had suffered a seizure back at his home in Pennsylvania which side-lined any driving for him for a while. So in the mean time, I went to the gym rather casually (due to distance and work) and enjoyed some time at home with my friends and family.

No problem though. He recovered over the summer and we hung out again once school started up.

Back at college in September of 2011, me and Dan went right back to our usual way of hanging out all the time. We continued going to the gym and hanging out with all of our old floor mates and friends. 

Everything was completely normal, although my squat had totally plateaued at 150 lbs.

Fast forward. On November 18th, 2011, Do you remember where you were? Because I do.

I had started my internship and I was leaving work at 2:30 P.M. on a rather chilly November afternoon. I had made plans to go to another concert with Dan and mosh all night. But it was interrupted. I received a call from an old floor mate of mine asking if I had heard what happened to Dan. Confused and concerned I asked what happened to him. 

I was informed that he had attended a concert and suffered another seizure afterwards. Complications from the seizure took my friend's life that pervious night.

I honestly cannot put into words how I felt at that moment, nor the weeks and months that followed. It destroyed me from the inside out.

I had entered a serious state of depression. I felt convinced that there was nothing in this life worthwhile. I felt almost suicidal. I sat in my apartment, lethargic, feeling like I'm just waiting for death. I was completely miserable. Days felt like blurs and I was a void of motivation and happiness.

But I couldn't live like this. I knew that this was an insult to Dan's memory and lifestyle. He lived life to the fullest and made sure that he, and everyone around him, was happy. I realized I couldn't just sit here on my couch and feel like I'm just waiting to die.

I got up and started hitting the gym again, harder than I ever did before.

What this comes down to is that on December 18th, 2011, I squated 175 lbs. I had fulfilled the promise I had made to Dan. I was nearly in tears at the gym, by myself, at the squat rack. 

It is the memory and life of my lost friend that I do anything anymore. I knew I had to get up and start living because, at any moment, you could have your life taken from you. He embraced life and ran with it. I cannot tell you how much I miss the kid. It still bothers me months later, but I am stronger because of it. 

I can honestly say I am happy and healthy again. I changed my routine and I go 5 days a week now. My legs are actually MUCH stronger now than they were before my snowboarding accident. I made a promise to myself to live the absolute fullest life I could, because I know that was what Dan would have done.

R.I.P. Dan, you were the best of us.

**TL;DR- I broke my leg snowboarding after wanting to get in shape, took about a year to rebuild the strength back, met my new best friend, and started lifting and getting into the best shape of my life. In November, my friend passed away. His death taught me I could not sit around and just wait for death. I needed to start living. I promised him I would rep 175 lbs. on my squat, and about a month after he passed, I did it.**

Sorry for such a massive text wall, I tried to make it as easy to follow as possible.

EDIT: If anyone has any questions about anything, or holes in detail, I will be more than happy to answer them. However, I am going to sleep soon. But nonetheless, I will answer anything unanswered tomorrow."
qjlx9,5,2012-03-05,A friend's letter to a College Professor..,Vulgotha,education,https://www.reddit.com/r/education/comments/qjlx9/a_friends_letter_to_a_college_professor/,"I'm new here, but this struck me as the sort of thing Reddit would appreciate. I've been lurking here for a bit, however. 

This is from a very close friend of mine (who I would aptly describe as being a superior specimen of humanity)  to an English Professor at a particular large college in Nebraska. 

I simply had to post this:

""You've made good points and I appreciate your honesty. I try not to be a selfish, egoistic or a merciless person, if I have erred then I have erred. The fact that your willing to tell me how, more or less resolves the issue. Had you not been as definite with me, I would have pushed this further.

The reason for absence to your class specifically was the I worked from 10pm to 6am then would try to sleep as short as possible in order to see a girl between waking and going to your class. I could only see her at that time, because her Parents are fanatic evangelicals and since she contracted a heart illness about 9 months back, they put a prohibition on her seeing me because they are afraid she is going to die and go to hell or something for being with a 'non-believer'. So I had to sneak in during the two days when her Mom wasn't home. Unfortunately I would sometimes fall asleep there, or often she would beg me to stay as we hardly got to see each other. At the end of the day, I had far more passion for being with her, than being in your class. That put the strain on my attendance in your class, so I hope you don't take it personally that I wasn't there, nor that I told you I was 'sick', as I don't really think telling you I was sneaking into an evangelical home to see a fatefully ill ex-girlfriend with religious extremist parents would have been appropriate or believable at the time. So I'm glad you cut me slack on the attendance policy because it was a bit complicated. Even without that aspect however, my attendance would have been lacking. 

The problem is I hate University but I love learning. I hate University exactly for some of the reasons you have stated why my grade was a confusing choice. University favors bureaucracy not industry, it seems more often than not that Professors desire obedience rather than merit, or rather that obedience is confused for merit.  In many classes there are those who work very hard but lack talent, and often they are favored in grading because they have put in so much effort over someone whose raw ability is better, even though their outcome is lesser. The objective always seems muddled to me, is the purpose of a class to improve your basic skill set or to execute the highest degree of dominance over a skill-set regardless of improvement? Is the purpose to 'try hardest' or to 'execute most successfully'?

I have faced this conundrum several times, and luckily I have gotten better at playing the game, but I've never respected it. Perhaps the worst example, was a 3000 level Spanish class I leap-frogged into at my last University, mind you I am a native speaker of Spanish. I recall reading the papers of my 'editing partner' and being unable to understand this caveman imitation of Iberia's most important language. At the end of it however, she got an A and I got a C, despite the vast disparity in the quality of our work. Upon asking the Teacher why, the reasons stated were attendance and that I would just 'turn in assignments' without submitting prior 'outlines' and 'vocabulary search' along with them. At that time I was more detached and cared less, I simply stated to her 'why do I need such things if the point of the class writing papers not doing vocabulary crosswords.' This obviously didn't go well.

I've seen some justice though, I had a Biology professor that refused to accept a research paper from me because the binder was 'unaesthetic' and according to him ""It was clearly stated that an aesthetic cover was part of the assignment.""  I told him plainly that I'm not a 13 year old girl with glue stick and glitter, the point of this class is Biology not getting an art badge in Brownie Scouts. The Teacher disliked me from long before, he confused my dispassion for arrogance and my detachment as an insult. I took it to the Dean, and he found that the Teacher's actions bordered on harassment. In the end, my grade was reversed from a D to an A, mostly because I got the highest grade in the class on the Final.  Ironically, at UNO they didn't accept this Biology credit transfer.

Some might say these 'details' are well founded in industry and that doing an outline has an equivalent in industry. Perhaps, just as when you write a program you need to have supporting documentation. It's not entirely the same thing though, an outline is a supplement to aid in a result but it is a supplement no less, not the core of a project, while documentation is necessary for successful management of a program. If the capricious frivolities in academia do mimic any type of industry, they mimic corporations in over-regulated vertically-oppressed quixotic nations such as the one I am in right now. Here you have to get the social security number of every person you make a sale to,  taxes start a 37% and there is a permit for anything you want to do. Otherwise the police come and throw you in jail for the societal equivalent of academic insubordination. However, these laws only apply to those who are successful enough to launch an enterprise by the book, for the rest of the 80% of the population who try 'really hard', the Government turns a blind eye to their black-market and gives them hand-outs taken from the taxes of the more successful. The reflects quite aptly the situation of intention over result present in academia at large, most commonly found in the Humanities, where the 'details' are largely capriciously invented by Teachers, while in the Sciences they are axioms determined by nature herself.

It's exactly for these reasons, I'm about a hair strand from just quitting college and focusing 150% on getting a job in my field and launching an enterprise. Why should I pay money for a bureaucratic beating? Why should I be chastised for not wanting to participate in class discussions with people who I otherwise wouldn't even speak to otherwise? Do I really gain anything of value from listening to a person so bereft of critical thinking that they give a presentation on why it is 'Christian' to support the 'death penalty' or when I'm forced to write papers supporting social agendas which I thoroughly oppose?  I get nothing from it, just debt, frustration and lost time.

You state that my grade fell to a B due not to attendance but to mere lack of achievement in the 'details' of assignments in which I got A's in. I see reason in that, and I have no reason to believe you docked me points on those assignments simply for absences. I respect that I did not get the points on those assignments and had I not been at Carnaval and then my internship here in Bolivia, I would have conferenced with you before the end of class to have dealt with it. That was my responsibility.

The question however, is do those missed assignments reflect didactism, or are they simply the defects of the sub-conscious impulse to control?  Does the fact that an annotated bibliography lacks 'similarity' clauses change the fact that the paper it was meant to support was well-researched enough to get an A? Does the fact that there was no idea outline drawing, change the fact that a well-organized nebula of ideas did exist in the paper? Was the purpose was to use the crutches that aid in writing in a good paper, or actually write a solid paper? Was the purpose consequence or intention? As far as I can see, you gave me points for 'doing' but docked me points for 'not trying'...to me that is the definition of cognitive dissonance. 

Ultimately, only you know the answer to these questions. At large, it is this sort of introspection that will have to take place before the academic system can cease to decay in the way it has been. In the way that has made me so estranged to it."""

Now, my recovery has been a slow process—the broken bones healed, but there are still episodes of confusion I have, that are associated with the brain injury. And the migraines don’t get me started on them. 

When I began thinking about the accident, and the trauma that had induced it, I began to believe I had presented myself with a valid, tangible way of explaining the things that had been happening to me. I even went as far as, on that Monday morning, sitting down at my desk with a pad and paper over lunch break and making a list of all of the strange experiences I’d had in the past three years since the accident.  What I came up with centered mainly around the first year after the accident. Several things I’d been experiencing bore a striking resemblance to what I was now experiencing.

It wasn’t as if I didn’t know about the side effects of brain trauma, and I don’t find myself particularly given to fancy, however… the things I saw that first year, mostly in dreams, disturbed me. My sleep patterns were highly irregular for months after the accident—sometimes I would not be able to sleep for days on end; I just had no desire to. I’d estimate that it was about six months after the accident that my sleep had evened out, and, coincidentally, when my dreams had gotten a bit more concerning. With more sleep came more dreams, and with more dreams came some interesting, albeit frightening, occurrences. At this time, Jen and I were experiencing a rough patch; she had been offered an internship upstate, and was planning her move, while I was grounded where we’d been living for two years together. 

We never imagine the ease with which some people can sever others from their lives; but they can and they do. Long story relatively short, Jen took the internship. In all honesty, the choppiness of my sleep schedule and my irritability following the injury probably had had a great deal to do with all of it, as well. She and I had tried the long-distance thing for a while, but the time and the money eluded us, and soon the contact had trickled to a halt. I’ve been a lone wolf, so to speak, since then.

Getting back to business… due to the lack of sleep, I believe, anyhow, there were these… hallucinations. They started small, things in my peripheral vision, dark spots, shadows on the wall, the cliché stuff of any ghost story. They seemed sleep-related to begin with, they correlated to the amount of sleep—if any—I was getting, and it seemed that the closer I got to a regular sleep schedule, the less frequent they’d become.  First, though, I should explain the dreams.

I’d see a person, in my dreams. It was always a tall, large figure, and he or she was always faceless. I got the impression that it was a masculine presence, however. Explaining “how” I knew that never makes sense, even to me, so I will not even attempt it here. Essentially, this figure would be in nearly all of my dreams, and he looked and felt like the presence of those faceless people I’d imagined after being hit. It wouldn’t matter what the dream was, necessarily, either—it could be a silly thing like a family reunion or bungee jumping—he’d still usually make an appearance. He never interacted with me, just merely stood and watched. It got to the point, for a while, that when he didn’t show up in my dreams, I was unnerved. Thankfully, those dreams lessened quite a bit, to the point that, presently, I rarely ever dream of him.

Like I mentioned before, it was about this time that the hallucinations began, full swing. They began in dreams—much like what I’d experienced with Eric. I’d see an image in my dream, and it would carry over into waking life. Sometimes I’d see it right as I woke, but other times it would appear at random during the day. One of the most memorable of these hallucinations occurred while I was at work. I had just begun the job I have now, in the university’s counseling office. It began with me, at work, just sitting at my desk, between appointments. I usually had fifteen or twenty minutes between them to check over the next kid’s paperwork or organize things. Well, I was sitting there, just having awoken from dozing off at my desk for a few minutes, and I felt as if I was being watched. I don’t have to elaborate on that feeling—we all have been there. Now, my office is small; it’s only about ten feet by eight, and there’s not much hiding room. It also has no window. I was feeling a presence, and paranoia set in—feeling as if you are being watched in a space as small as that is one of the most unnerving feelings in the world, I believe. 

Feeling like a goofy, superstitious idiot, I checked everywhere in the small office. I looked under my desk, behind my small filing cabinet. Of course, there was nothing there. Had I expected there to be? I took a seat back in my armchair, waiting for the next patient and checking the clock on the wall every thirty seconds or so. I contemplated opening my door and going into the waiting room, but I had just begun working there, and did not want to appear unprofessional and nervous. I decided to stick it out. 

I heard a noise. It was a scuffle, sounded like a footstep against the carpet in my office. Needless to say, I was frozen, eyes glued to my office door. I began reciting to myself, as I’d done since the accident, “This is not reality. You are not hearing or seeing anything; your mind is playing tricks on you. Remember your mind is playing tricks on you.” Generally, this mantra, paired with a calm demeanor, would eventually allow the feeling of dread to pass. This time, though, I felt something touch me. It was like a hand on my shoulder for a split second, and then it was gone. Just as I mustered the courage to reach up to feel for something behind me, my office door opened, nearly causing me to soil myself. The look on my face must’ve been priceless. The receptionist was letting me know my client was ready to see me. I told her to show him in, but that I wasn’t feeling well and might need the rest of the day off. 

Now, since this incident, there hadn’t been anything major. Just a few odd dreams and some fragmented paranoia once in a while. Sitting in my office chair the Monday after seeing Eric’s imagined image in my dreams, it seemed that these incidences had a lot in common. Really, at this point, I was worried for my neurological health; the doctor had warned me that there could be side-effects like the dreams, or like the hallucinations. He also told me to keep track of them, and report them to him every six months we had an appointment, just to make sure nothing more serious was going on in there. Well, it had been so long since one of the more full-fledged hallucinations, that I was beginning to worry it might be a sign of something much more serious than a bout of sleep paralysis. 

As I sat making that list of episodes, I resigned to calling my neurologist and seeing how soon I could get in for an appointment. I spoke on the phone with his nurse, and she assured me that what I was experiencing seemed to be, indeed, related to the injury, and to try not to worry. I was able to schedule one for the next week, early, which gave me much-needed peace-of-mind. 

*I'll stop here, for now. It's been a long day, and I have some work to finish with. I will update you very soon, though, if you're interested. I am thoroughly surprised at the response, you guys are great; there is peace-of-mind in sharing this with ya'll.* "

qmb7o,3,2012-03-07,Life and the unexpected turns of its wheel,YourDirtySlut,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/qmb7o/life_and_the_unexpected_turns_of_its_wheel/,"Before 2010, life for me was the usual suck of someone in their early 20's.  Crappy job, still in school, struggling constantly to make the bills.  Single, horny, and trying to make the best of things.  Every day had been a struggle since I was 15 and first diagnosed with depression and anxiety- like a never ending case of pessimism that I couldn't win again.

Then Aug 2010, I was nearly killed in a head on collision.  Lets just say it COMPLETELY fucked up my life for a whole year.  And not the good way.  My leg and arm were fucked up, so I was in a wheelchair for 2 months.  i couldn't wash myself, cut my own meat, or hell, make a quick run to the bathroom, it took me 15min to finally get up and go take a piss!  I lost my awesome place living with my best friend for cheap rent because I lived in the upstairs.  After 2 months in the wheelchair, I graduated to 2 months on a granny walker with an arm rest.  Fuck going into public with THAT, so i continued with the wheelchair.  Oh yes, I forgot to mention that the car crash happened 2 weeks before the new semester began, and I had surgery a week before.  So I had to deal with tests, homework, physical therapy, occupational therapy, lawyers, and learning how to get around on my own.  I fell once in the parking lot trying to get the wheelchair in my car by myself.  People waited until I fell to help me.

Also during this time, I became very depressed, no matter how stoned I was on pain pills.  You realize who your true friends are in situations like this.  I basically realized I only had 2 good friends and a loyal boyfriend.  It devastated me.  People were willing to say ""get well soon!"" but not come visit me during the 4 months I was pretty much trapped in my parents' basement.

Following my physical recovery, I developed even worse anxiety and depression.  I became the psycho needy girlfriend who NO ONE likes.  And after 3 years, I had to be put back on medication just to be able to deal with the crap that was my life.  Once my medication got stabilized, and I felt normal, I realized I was in an abusive relationship.  My (now ex) boyfriend made regular comments about my weight and even told me I was fat a few days before valentines day.  I had put 10lb on while I was in the wheelchair.  And as soon as I started walking again, he expected me to go out and lose weight on my own while he stayed in doors and watched video games.

Then things began to change.  I finally left my boyfriend after he fucked me over yet another time, and ended up with this GORGEOUS guy (like way out of my league gorgeous) who thought I was just stunning and perfect the way I was.  So I started working out, because it was a different sort of motivation.

Shortly after I met him, I FINALLY got the settlement I had waited a year and a half for.  During the wait I had planned, planned, planned, and been stuck with the frustrating hope.  Now I got to make all my dreams come true :)

My folks finally caved and let me finally get a dog, so I got a $3,000 puppy (blue and white olde english bulldogge) on Christmas and she has been the light of my life.  This Saturday my parents, best friend (one of the 2 who was actually there for me after the crash), and I are leaving for a cruise.  I paid for their plane tickets and rooms on the ship for a week long cruise in the western carribean as a thank you for being there for me.  I got a new car- until now i had always driven pieces of shit that required constant monitoring so I didn't blow up.  I redid my bedroom at my parents' so I could stop sleeping in a bunkbed, lol.  I got a new wardrobe so i didn't have to keep wearing clothes from middle school (I'm 25).  And this summer I am taking an adventure of a lifetime!  

Before the crash I would have never even considered it, but this late May I am leaving for California to do a 3 month internship.  And me and the pooch are driving (from Minnesota).  I've never been past the dakotas western wise, so I am going to make as many stops as possible.  I get to finally see the grand canyon :)  It will just be me and the dog, doing whatever the hell we want, and capturing it all with my camera.

So, I guess, just remember.  No matter how shitty things can get, and they can get really fucking shitty, they always get better.  My arm and ankle will never be the same, I'll never play softball or run a marathon, but there are other things I CAN say I got to do :)

TL;DR- Almost died in car wreck, life really hit rock bottom, now it's at its peak a year and a half later."
qm8sj,2,2012-03-07,What do I need to use to make advertising samples?,angrypeach,Design,https://www.reddit.com/r/Design/comments/qm8sj/what_do_i_need_to_use_to_make_advertising_samples/,"I have a marketing internship interview coming up, and I need to have some samples to show them, which I don't have (I know I should).

Since it is marketing, I was going to try and make some sample ads. Except I don't have a camera, models, a studio, etc, so any ads I whip up will have to be drawn on the computer.

I have a Macbook Pro that runs Lion and Windows 7. I think I need some vector drawing software? Which one's the best? Is it possible to take stock photos and edit them to fit my design, so it looks photographic and realistic, and not something I drew?

Basically I'd like my samples to turn out something like this: http://media02.hongkiat.com/creative-ads/glassex-cleaner.jpg

Simple, creative, and gets the point across. One idea I have in mind involves the smoke from a cigarette writing a word in a beautiful, smokey font. How could I go about doing that?

Yeah, I'm completely clueless, but I'm going to give it a try."
qlztw,4,2012-03-07,One small company wants to hire me but I have an interview scheduled for a larger one. What do I do?,Osupda,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/qlztw/one_small_company_wants_to_hire_me_but_i_have_an/,"This is my first question on Reddit, and I really need some advice. I graduated last year with a Bachelor's in Computer Science, and I've been living at home ever since, working a part-time job in town. During the summer I applied to several full-time jobs, one of which for a big, very well-known company (can't say who it is). After months of no luck I decided to take up an internship in September and put job searching on hold so I gain some applicable experience and improve my chances of getting hired.

In early January, I was told by my parents that it would have to end soon because our car would be needed for my dad's work and I would have no transportation (there is public transportation, but it would mean getting up at 5AM for a 2-hour commute). Until the internship ended I applied to several other jobs, one of which is a start-up company located right in town. This particular one was on Craigslist and shortly after I applied, the posting was removed and I did not hear back for several weeks.

In early February, the big company from the summer responded back by saying they wanted to schedule a phone screening with me (as well as an undefined number of others). I did great on the initial screening and on the second one as well. In late February they scheduled me for an in-person interview, which is two weeks from today, and I am very excited for it.

This is where it gets complicated. A few days ago, the small company from the Craigslist posting finally responded back and asked if I was still available and interested for a part-time position, which would eventually grow. I was advised to reply ""yes"" and not mention the upcoming interview, because it's likely to be a deal breaker even though an interview does not necessarily mean I'm unavailable. Yesterday I had one 10-minute interview with the small company, and they want me to come in a few days from now and start initial training.

I don't know what to do now. I'm afraid that telling them about the upcoming interview might ruin everything: if the upcoming interview does not yield the full-time position, then I could also lose the opportunity for a position I would have received otherwise.

I really need some advice. How should I handle this mess?"

I tried taking a few small classes thinking maybe getting more skills would help and they haven't done anything except make me slack on keeping up to date with trends regarding my degree and put me in a deeper hole.

I live at home still and basically do nothing except look for job postings to apply to and reddit/junk...

I just don't know what to do with my life, I'm not good at anything. Everyone i know has always shown either an interest or skill with something and i...just don't have anything. I'm antisocial as hell, overweight, broke, a virgin who has never even had a girlfriend and living at home in the basement. I would be the definition of internet nerd if I even had any sort of interactions online with people. I have no friends, both real life and internet/online gaming. 

I had a friend who ive known since we were kids, through who i met a few other friends of his to hang out with but they never considered me their friend. Unless the middle friend was there, they didn't care to hang out with me and slowly all of them just sorta stopped talking to me. 

I feel sad for my parents, who worked so hard to help get me through school, who are always talking with parents boasting about how great their kid is doing or something and how embarrassed they must be time and time again to repeat the same thing on how i'm still jobless doing nothing.

I really wish i even had a hobby or something i enjoyed doing, but i dont. I'm terrible at video games, seem to have a horrible memory when it comes to specifics, not athletic(im a fat fuck), dont play any instruments(tried learning guitar and failed horribly), nothing to help guide me on where to go. I have no ambition or goals at all. 
What do i want to be? I have no idea. What do i want to do? No clue. What do i enjoy doing? Nothing.

I've thought about suicide countless times, planned it all out and just could never go through with it because of my parents. Just the thought of doing something even worse as a final spit in the face of what they've done for me...

ugh sorry for the huge wall of text, this is the first time I've ever said anything to anyone.

I decided to enlist in the Marine Corps in 2006, and I loved every minute of it. It literally turned my life around... I used to do absolutely nothing, most of every day. I really hated myself, and I tried to make sure everyone around me suffered as well. 
I enlisted out of a last-ditch effort to change things in my life... and I'm the first one to admit I enlisted at the right time. It was 2006, so the housing boom created great incentives for anyone joining the military, so I got a 10k Bonus once I completed RIP. But I got out in 2010, and decided to use the new GI Bill to go back to school. I'm at NYU, and I literally CANNOT GIVE MY WORK AWAY. I will interview with companies, and tell them straightforward that because of the GI Bill and all that it's given me, I am willing to work for them for free, just to gain civilian work experience, I can be classified as an 'unpaid intern'. I am 27. This isn't a pride issue, because I am literally trying to give my labor away for FREE. But most companies tell me I am either a)too old, or b)not a 'cultural fit' for their junior member employment pool. I understand that it's difficult to imagine someone who wants to work full time while they are going to school, but you have to imagine what kind of environment I am coming from. I am used to working 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, for months at a time. I have spent my life identifying who I am as what I do. When I don't have a purpose, I feel like I'm worthless. I try and keep this desperation from my interviews, but it is difficult to play hard to get when I so desperately want to work, and validate my identity. I understand that the job market in NYC is oversaturated with qualified graduates, and degrees that go unused. But To tell me that I can't shovel dirt at a construction site for minimum wage because I have too much experience fucking kills me. Combat Vets aren't the poisoned candy that the media leads you to believe we are. We are, and I believe I can generalize here, hard working, loyal, and above all we fucking love to accomplish things.

Majoring in CS, focusing in computer systems and minoring in math. I was at a university career fair, and when talking to many of the employers, many of them asked me 'so what do you enjoy more, hardware or software?' and I found that difficult to answer, because well, I like a mix of both. I expressed that I have a very flexible skill set, but I get the idea that the employers looking for hardware guys are seeking computer engineers, and the employers looking for software guys are seeking software engineers. Computer systems is basically a mix of both, and due to my lack of experience in the industry, I don't know what I would *enjoy* more if I could only pick one.

I enjoy computer science, I do pretty good in the classes that do low level stuff like assembly, cache organization, etc. On the other hand I find my data structures classes challenging and I don't particularly hate it because I am learning so much.

I will also add that I do freelance/word-of-mouth computer repair IT stuff, it's easy money and along with tech retail experience I have, I have no problem communicating with clients or expressing my ideas. I find this as a trait most CS majors do not have.

I have been in a relationship with my fiancee for about 4 and a half years, and she is a really outgoing person and is a theater member. 

Note whenever I am saying party, she doesnt get drunk (maybe 1 time a year). 

Currently I am trying to not get upset over something, but is coming to be near impossible.
Back story:

We go to 2 different colleges, and during one of the nights she was at a friends party she offered to show 2 of the guests where they would be staying (walking them just to the building). One of them decided that he would grab her, kiss her and ask if she wanted to go upstairs with him. As I stated, she is outgoing and pretty oblivious. She was giving him mixed signals due to being just nice, such as hugging both of them goodbye. She told me the night after it happened, but I was still upset that she put herself in the situation. Told her to be more careful.

Fast forward a year later, I was up at her school and met some of her guy friends she parties with. One of these guys a week later runs into her in the stairwell after they both had drank and she hugged him goodbye (once again...) and he kissed her..she didnt say anything and just walked away. She did not tell me for a week, when i came up to see her. She thought hugging him was fine because he was a friend and knew she was engaged (met me already). I have huge trust issues with her guy friends, but i just ""deal with it"" in order for her to be happy and hang out with her friends. She told me and cried for hours right after I just told her I would try and be more trusting with her guy friends...as in 10 seconds after I said it. I went over to his room, punched him in the gut, told him to stay the fuck away from her and not talk to her again, and told her she really needs to stop being so familiar with other guys. 

This last month I had a 2fer. I found out her normal room she drinks with her friends happens to be his room, but I can confirm that he does not talk to her and vice-versa. It was just she didnt think to tell me for 7 months that he lived in the room, seeing as how they dont talk she didnt think it was a big deal. ALSO she got the lead role in a play, in which she has to kiss the male lead, and not just on stage, during every practice for 2 months as well, once every time they go through that scene, 3-4 rehearsals a week. She did not know about this when she auditioned.

My blood still boils every time I think of these events. I am trying to get over them, but by the time I am about to another related problem pops up. It has helped that she seems immensely remorseful and sorry every time something has happened and she said the last thing she wants to do is hurt me in any way. She was going to turn down her part in the play but I told her not to otherwise I knew she would resent me for it, even though I do resent the fact she kisses another guy for her part, I just....deal with it.

I feel as if something special is being taken away from me. It is something that only me and her do. We talk a lot how ""you are mine! and I am yours!"" Jokingly and cute-like. She has been my 1 and only gf, she took my first everything. Other guys kissing her just drains me whenever I think about it, and this roll she got is just the last push I needed before I started getting really upset over it and realized it. I don't know of any method other than just bottling it up and ""dealing with it"", as it is the main way I got through my school years. 

We did discuss it, and I told her pretty much what I posted here about having it feel like it was taking away part of what was ours. I am not a confident man by any means anymore. I got diagnosed with T1 diabetes my freshman semester in college, and I lost all of my muscle mass in the hospital. I have had issues working out sense, and I still live with my parents since I work a no-pay internship for my last semester. I also do not get to see her but like once MAYBE twice every month since we both lack cars. The things we do together that are ours, was pretty much my last salvation when it came to my confidence.....

Any advice guys? I am getting pretty damn depressed with this coupled with other things. I figure things will be better once I am able to move out and start a career and she moves in with me so we can actually see each other. I have complete trust in her, I know she hasnt cheated on me...I have too many eyes and ears on her campus to know otherwise. I just fear I will hit in the face with a big ol' blob of depression. "

----------

Currently a junior in the University of Michigan's College of Engineering. Currently double-majoring in CS/CE, because I enjoy both and at this point, I feel two degrees might help me stand out more in the post-college job market. Have covered lots of core classes in both degrees. Looking for a summer internship, potentially at a startup, as I really enjoyed my previous experience and how casual it was. I also actually enjoy dressing formal (part of why Chicago attracts me is it's fashion-style from the Mile and the financial district), so I can go either way.

I've got quite some experience under my belt -- my first computing job was working for the University of Michigan under their EECS (Electrical Engineering and Computer Science) department, on developing a C-based Windows driver (NDIS, involving network transmissions and the OSI model -- I completed two semesters of Cisco's Networking Academy) for a software-defined radio, developed by Microsoft Research. That was two summers ago.

My second (last summer) was working for a large startup in Austin, Texas, doing front/back-end web development. I became fairly proficient in C# ASP.NET MVC dev; and learned how to incorporate multiple API's, and existing in-house systems and the like. I learned how to do revision control (for the previous job, I created my own style of revision control involving Dropbox, and it was sloppy compared to, say, Git -- something which, by the way, I use in my programming projects for college all the time, now). Also learned how to participate in the Agile style of code/management. Would love to discuss this in detail with potential employers.

In my spare time, I've written scripts to make my Macbook embed music information from nearly any client on the desktop, little plugins for Adium (an AIM/everything else client), and things like that. I've also written short programs to help my workload. More notably, for college, I have written sorting algorithms/breadth &amp; depth searches, started to learn how to properly hash, and, for the extra push to get a good grade in a prior class, taught myself basic Android development and wrote my own app.

To tell it to you straight: I don't particularly like doing front-end development, and I LOVE back-end dev. Javascript is cool and all, and learning good object-oriented programming was really beneficial overall, but writing raw HTML was...annoying at best. The company I worked for admitted willfully that my distaste stemmed from the fact that the site I was assigned was created rather sloppily from another company, and I had to work around what I was given, but regardless. If I am paid well enough, I'll happily do front-end work, but for the record, I prefer things that are C#/C++/C based. I just enjoy that language set; it makes sense to me.

qmosv,1,2012-03-07,Need a little guidance.,OffInBed,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/qmosv/need_a_little_guidance/,"Hello /r/learnprogramming! This subreddit has been very helpful for both I and my 13 year old bro (who hasn't started yet but knows exactly what he wants)

I have a little situation, there's a very solid software development company that I want to work for in the future. I've got connections into the company, but not exactly as a software engineer person (especially since I have no experience). I asked someone who works there what language do they want their employees to be proficient in, and I was told that most people they want are efficient with Java (yikes). They told me in 5 months, send my resume over to them, and they will see what they can do as far as getting me a paid internship with the software development team.


Now...I by NO means expect to be a Java master within 5 months. I just want to develop a solid/basic understanding of Java, enough so that I'd be acceptable as an intern to this amazing company.

Is that realistic? Should I just jump straight into a Java course? Is there another language that would help me develop fundamentals that are really similar to Java writing? I JUST started CarlH's lectures and, while I don't feel like I'd be wasting my time with C, I am jsut curious if there is a better way of going about it.

Thanks in advanced!"

Last year, I want to say around this time, my boyfriend and I met a girl at a party. We decided to try a threesome. I don't consider myself bisexual, I am just willing to do anything he asks me to. The experience went as well as one could hope for and we even meet again. Fast forward a few weeks later. My boyfriend and I break up. Now I'm not sure what exactly happened after we broke up, but a month later I (this is shameful to admit) pretty much begged for him back. He just meant too much to me. In the month we had broken up, he hooked back up with the girl from our threesome at least once. I don't want to ask him about any more nights, I just can't think about it. I do trust that he would tell me the truth. We got back together, everything was sorted out and it's been great since. Recently we've started discussing the possibility of a ring.

**This is where I need help**

The past month or so, he has begun texting/im'ing this girl quite a lot. I've been very stressed out from work and he's noticed this. It's been tense. It's gotten to the point where it's almost constant contact between him and this girl. I've only gotten to peek at what they've been saying once or twice and it was all pretty dry stuff. Just talking about school/work/what they're eating. I am usual very level-headed but there's just something about this girl that gives me pangs (yes! PANGS!) of jealousy everytime I hear his phone buzz. This is made even worse by the fact my boyfriend is going to be leaving for an internship 250 miles away. There won't be much time for visits because we both work full-time. It is very apparent that I'm going to miss him more than he misses me.

I want to know, is it time to move on? I have never felt so strongly about someone, and because of this I am trepidatious. I want to trust him, and I know it probably is idle chatter. However, It's a constant stream. It only stops at night. I know it's going to get worse when he leaves, and I worry that he's going to drop me all together. Should I leave now before I get hurt?"

If it goes bad, who knows?",suicidethrowaway1112,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qom14/court_tomorrow_if_it_goes_bad_who_knows/,"First I should go into what you should know about me so you can get a feel why I'm pretty set on killing myself if I have to go to jail or something. I am the baby in my family. I've always had someone to love and care for me. I was blessed with amazing intelligence, which I am very grateful for. My whole life I've been taught that with hard work I'll be able to go to a good college, get a good job and live happily in a nice house with a nice family. I did everything I was supposed to in high school, graduating with a 3.8. Finally, I got what I was promised and continued on to a very good college. I entered college this fall. Here is things get nasty. The transition to college from high school was very hard. I've never worked so hard in my life. 

Well, after my first mid term ever in college I felt okay. It was a very hard test but I had to remind myself that it was curved so it didn't matter. I texted my friend in my class and asked what she thought of it. She said it was super easy and that she finished early and left. I was crushed. (I'm not sure why but I was) I cried all day until my friends came over to go to a concert we had tickets to. This is when I ran into the law. I went there just trying to have a good time. I was dancing and was pretty close to the front when this chick behind me taps me on the shoulder and says something about her friend right behind me not being able to see. I don't know what she expected me to do, so I say to her ""It's a concert bro"", and turn back around. She then turns to her friend and starts laughing at me because I said ""bro"". I was keeping cool but then she started pushing me. Mind you that she is the only one around me pushing me and she's not directly behind, right, left or in front of me. Finally after a few pushes I turn around a bop her in the face. I'm not a violent person, everyone that knows me would know that that was completely out of character for me. That evening I was super emotional from the midterm and I took it out the wrong way. She says ""YOU PUNCHED ME!!!"" I'm all ""You wouldn't leave me alone"". I guess I wasn't thinking, but I stayed in the same place. She got the security and I was escorted out. The security were pretty nice to me. The first guy even thought I would be able to go back to the concert. Well I'm sitting there and a small fire truck comes. She had firefighters come to examine her face and put an ice pack on it. Which there was 0 damage done. No bruises, no swelling, no cuts. The firefighters put a pack of ice on it and leave. Then the police come. They were pretty much huge ass holes to me. I thought it was pretty funny because they were all ""well it's obvious you aren't telling the truth, and we'll see that when she tells her story and see that they are different"". We had the same story, but that's besides the point. The whole time I was apologetic. Even right after she left I was thinking about going back and finding her and saying sorry. The whole time I was beyond cooperative and beyond apologetic. I mean the police asked for my name and address without looking at my ID and I gave all the correct information. Any ways, they didn't take me in because this girl ""had mercy on me"" as the police put it. They told me that I would hear from them within 90 days. Also, after the police said I could go, me and my friends were walking and we saw her (she didn't go back to the concert even though she could) and she had thrown the ice pack away. 90 days passed and I didn't hear anything from them so I was pretty happy because I thought they weren't pressing charges. Well two weeks ago I finally got the letter summoning me to court. I was completely crushed. I had just applied for this program at my college where I would be an intern at Boeing. Even worse the court date was right before my math final for this quarter.

So here I am, it's the night before my court date. I just REALLY needed to get this off my chest. Basically I feel like this could just totally fuck up all the hard work I went through to get where I am. I have nothing besides school. I can't just live with my parents my whole life. I have a final on Saturday and I just can't understand Taylor series worth shit. But who cares because I might be going to jail anyways. If I am sentenced to go to jail I will be killing myself. I've counted all my mom's sleeping pills. 

This is a throw away. But thank you reddit. You've been great. 

tl;dr I have court tomorrow for assault charges, if it ends up fucking my life then I will personally fuck it. "

I'd like to intern/coop somewhere, and I've have been looking, but every company will only hire STUDENT interns.  There's no position for adult interns.  I'm willing to work for a sub-industry standard wage to gain invaluable experience.

I don't want to go back to school for 3 years, and accumulate massive debts.  Then possibly exit University into a horrible Ottawa job market (Fed govt cuts expected to push Ottawa unemployment up to 10% within 2 year)

  I already have one degree. I'd rather learn on the job.  University (Carleont U) didn't offer me anything I couldn't have learned on my own.

I work in IT-Research Support, which is the branch of IT responsible for supporting research professors. As this university is all about research, you'd expect us to be pretty important...which is entirely not the case. Instead, we're 3 full time employees and 5 students running a cluster, building one-off research tech, setting up sensors to gather data, and many, many other things. And we're all significantly underpaid, even for the middle-of-nowhere town that we live in. 

I've worked at this job for over 2 years. I stay around mostly because I like the work (I administer all the linux computer labs, among other things). 

Recently, my boss has decided to try to get us some publicity so that people realize that what we do is a lot of hard work, and therefore land us some more money for the team. The way he's decided to do this is by putting all of the student workers on one project that is going to be pretty impressive (I'd say what it is but I'm under NDA). The project involves a lot of cutting-edge tech and is about the same type of work undergraduate research students do here. Unfortunately, this project has a ridiculously tight deadline, and my boss knows the only way we'll get close to making it is if we all work more hours than we're getting paid for. (We can only work a maximum of 20 hours per week as full-time students.) I, in particular, have much more experience with the tech on this project than any of my co-workers, and I can objectively say the project would fail if I left, unless my boss was able to find someone to replace me within a week. Most of the people here who could replace me are working on other projects or jobs that pay more than what this one does. I know, because I've tried to recruit them for this project...

On top of this, he's lately made a couple points when he asks why things aren't getting done or why we haven't been at work at times (we get to choose our own hours). We'll be like, ""But I have homework/other things to do"" and he's said, literally, ""That's not my problem.""

On top of all that, he's paying me $8.75 an hour. The USGS recently posted part-time student job openings for CS majors at $15 an hour. I've got an internship at Amazon this summer, so I'm pretty confident I can land a position at the USGS if I wanted to. The *only* thing that keeps me from doing that is that I like my work. That, and one of the students is using this project as a final project for his senior capstone class, so if the project fails he can't graduate. 

tl;dr: My boss is kind of a dick, and he doesn't pay me anywhere near what I'm worth. 

How do I go about getting some respect and a raise from him?"

Cold science. Hannah had the results from the failed experiment in her hands. Small consolation this black and white document would further her quest: the grail of the human cognitive sciences. She wanted to finally know, in concrete form, what motivated people. 

She approved David's application for the new trials because he had agreed to secrecy. And because he was probably the only man she would ever have sex with. She liked him. He destroyed the muggers that attacked her in the city. Healed now, his scar from one of the attackers left a faint line from his left eye to the corner of his tanned mouth. *Blue sky to sand*. Her vision glazed over and she remembered his scent of salt and cedar.

She read her notes. *People can save others' lives through self sacrifice. People can kill millions of other people in a blink. Human existence itself relies on the actions of every person on this planet, to whatever end...*

In her spare time she wrote reports, researched the latest breakthroughs in medicine, and purchased bits of history. The time flew by as the brown packages arrived at her door. She was closer to realizing her dreams. The results were going to be fantastic. 

She was going to be rich. The new drug that was privately funded was hers only if she had agreed to the strict confidential agreement. Hannah had to make the best of it. She had the finest bio-metric measuring devices, cameras, and computer systems. *This was going to be easy* she reassured herself.

She had sway and tenure, and could always count on getting the full attention of the faculty. It had been no problem setting her experiment in motion. Her beauty had the right flaw that taunted perfection, and it made her approachable to a fault. Even the blind followed her everywhere. Everywhere except where she was going next. With David.



                                          David

David was on time for the first time in his life. He loved Hannah. He forgot things with her. 

Things he didn't want to remember. 

He blackmailed doctors tied up with black market medicine. Their kickback money came in handy for college but he never forgot how he achieved his vaulted credentials. There was a time during internship he was going to open a clinic in some great city. As a healer, he would 
improve the lives of all who came to him. Then he realized the dark part of himself that learned pharma traffic routes, fronts, and contacts had always been there, and was just waiting for the right opportunity. 

This trial with Hannah was a means to an end. A way to satisfy, and channel, his less than desirable urges toward something good. He wanted Hannah on her terms. 

David felt strong again. He finished his final set of body weight exercises two nights ago. Well before he would see her. He was happy to taper off before *this* event.


                                       The Trial


The wing harboring Hannah's experiment room hadn't been used before. *Neither have I* she 

mused, *Odd*. Her eyes dotted purple, the blue mixing with the last red light of day through her lace office curtain. She raised from her desk and looked out of her open window. A breeze delivered David's aroma to her nose. Everything was in place and she was ready to begin.

She strolled down the hall to the control room. Unlocking the door to the room she was going to use for her experiments, she paused. Everything was new and gleamed, having been set up as a clean room. It was a completely controlled environment: optimum regulated oxygen supply, humidity, temperature, and light. She lay on the bed. The sheets were handmade Chinese silk, unused from some royal family in China's opulent past. She walked back out to the hall - didn't want to seem *too* eager today. She locked the door back, and returned to her office.



David arrived at the agreed time.
""Did you take the pill?"" she queried.
""Yes.""
""Well then, you first."" She unlocked the door, and he walked in before her. Closing the door caused an echo throughout the complex.
David's eyes widened. 
""It's quiet.""
""Is that okay?"" She attempted a frown but nothing could hide her smile. It was wide and full. 

She closed her lips around her nervous expression, straightening her shoulders. She was 5'8"" tall, but appeared much taller. Her body filled the artists' proportion and her legs were long.
""How are you? Does the sensory perception throw you off at all?"" She quizzed. 
He reached out and touched her shoulder with his right hand, then her other shoulder with his left. He looked into her eyes, and tilted his head slightly to match her hug indicating posture.  

Pulling her close, David glanced at her mouth, lowered his head and pressed his lips into hers. She breathed in sharply, waited for a drifting second, then slowly exhaled. Her perfume, some Hawaiian flower, filled his mind. She led him to the bed. 

Undressing in the dim golden light the curved and lined shadows danced on their bodies. It looked like a fire was burning somewhere in the room, and the glow basked them in radiance. 

Laying down he reached out and touched her before she was completely on the bed. She responded by shifting under him. He pushed up, his arms bending then straightening over her. 

He put each hand flat on the bed beside her elbows. He lowered himself on her, feeling himself part her. He was aware of the lack of sensation the pill was supposed to cause. It was working. He only felt the slightest presence of something there, around him.

She watched David and slid her hands down his sides. He put some of his weight on her, testing her, and she felt the ridges of his muscles against her thighs. He moved slowly around, and up and down as he kissed her. His stomach touched hers which set off an electric sensation, like a butterfly on the back of her hand. Then she felt pressure.  

He felt minimal pressure, but no warmth and no tingling or pleasure. Well, at least nothing physical. He wondered at that revelation. The pill was designed to remove all but the barest of sensations. He could believe he was going to the bathroom if he didn't see her and know what he was doing. If he wasn't lost in her somehow.

""What is it like?"" She said between deep breaths. 
""It is nice. *You* are nice. The physical effects are...not really there, though.""
He felt completely solid to her. Everything she was feeling promised to push her over some edge of pleasure she had never felt before. Every move he made she met with enthusiasm, pushing against him harder and faster with his penetrations. Somehow it seemed he managed 
to open her wider and deeper with each gentle push. And with every pull, her muscle constrictions tried to keep him in her. He moved so fast now that she was having one continuous sensation of pressure and motion and warmth. The sensation increased making her quiver. She grabbed him and pulled him in, their bodies finding their own rhythm. She let it take her over. She was completely filled with him at every thrust. 

It was what she desired now. In one surprising, soft motion, her legs tensed. She was consumed with contractions and pleasure. She opened her legs wider and grabbed the back of his legs to pull him in, again and again. Waves of pleasure rose to wash over her, tickling warmth caressed her body. She felt him continue and she wanted more. 
""I don't feel tired."" he pleaded with his topaz eyes. ""I can't feel anything, but I don't want to stop. You are amazing!""
She slowed him down and wrapped her legs around his back, resting on the lines of his hips. 
""I.. love you."" he said.
She raised her hands to her chest sliding them over her firm nipples, then wrapped her fingers in his hair. His mouth was willingly lead to her breasts, where he kissed her softly. Her prim points became firmer with every touch. He put one after the other into his mouth and she pleasantly realized his tongue was much hotter than his lips. 
""Can you feel it?"" she begged. 
""No. I can't stop though. I won't stop. I will have more of you. I am letting you go wherever you want with me, and I will know you completely."" 
She felt the blood rush to her head and was taken to a place she had never been before: a valley, a rushing sensation, rising to a peak of clear euphoria. Her body was still. There was an unending feeling of release mixed with the deepest relaxation.
Looking into her eyes, parting his lips, he spoke softly,
""I have you. I could not feel anything familiar I felt in the past, yet there was something there. Something with you that I couldn't pull away from. I felt driven."" 
Hannah moved her lips slowly and eased his mind.
""I'm not worried about the results right now. I know the computers have the numbers and will corroborate my research. How about you?""
""I'm free tomorrow."" He bared his teeth that glowed in the dim light. 

Hannah took one last, lingering look at him laying next to her before she would get up to leave. 
""Sex sells. Tomorrow, no pill, Mr. bittersweet."""

Looking for advice.,__truestory__,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/qqmqk/starting_to_apply_for_jobs_in_2_months_looking/,"I'm currently doing my MS, and I have a fairly nice CV, with a couple of good internships (a GSoC, an RAish internship, another one at a startup, a few months of job experience at another startup, and a couple of months of experience as an RA at my current university). I'm fairly comfortable with being grilled over my earlier projects, but I tend to get stuck in the algorithmic/coding rounds. I've somehow managed to clear them in the past, but I know that this is a weakness, and I want to work on it in the next 2 months before I start sending in my applications.

My question is - what is the best way to prepare for such rounds which involve problems which are highly algorithmic in nature? Should I just start with solving problems on sites like codeeval.com, or problems from previous Code Jams? Should I review all the data structures and the most common algorithms, and code them up while doing that? Should I even care to pick up a book for that (just because books on such topics tend to be very exhaustive and it might not be possible to finish them cover to cover)? Or are there any concise books that I could refer? I'm just looking for the best way to tackle this. Any suggestions?

**TL;DR** What is the best way to prepare for highly algorithmic interview rounds?"
qq960,1,2012-03-10,I told her I couldn't do it anymore...,JSlasha88,LongDistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/qq960/i_told_her_i_couldnt_do_it_anymore/,"So, long story short, I met a girl back home in Upstate NY last November, and we fell for each other pretty fast despite being from pretty different backgrounds and viewpoints on a lot of things. Around mid-December I got offered an amazing nine-month internship with a professional sports team in FL, something that I knew I couldn't pass up, because it could give me an actual real job and career sometime down the road.

So basically we tried the long-distance thing, but after two months, I couldn't take it anymore. The problem? She pretty much smothered me. We did everything you'd think would help - FaceTiming pretty much every night, texting/emailing during the day. The issue was that she doesn't have a lot going on in her life outside of a boring job, so she wanted to text and email me ALL day long. I was pretty much giving her the play-by-play of my life from 1300 miles away, and I got tired of it. She would get antsy if she didn't hear back immediately from me, and would usually jump to horrible conclusions and assume the worst. For example, if we were texting and all of a sudden my parents called and I didn't get back to her for 30 minutes, she would send me like 3 more texts asking what I was doing and if I didn't want to talk anymore.

I guess the bottom line was that this whole thing down here is like a big new adventure for me, and I'm working like 60-70 hours per week, which gives a very tiny amount of free time at the end of the day. And I just got to a point where I couldn't justify spending all that free time in constant communication with her. I felt like I was constantly answering to her.

Of course, I tried to explain this to her and logically spell out why we needed to slow it down, but she was like...1000mph running on emotions, and of course was unable to process my very well-explained, rational opinion.

Has anyone else ever felt like this? I feel really bad for ending it, but my heart just wasn't in it anymore.

TL/DR: My long-distance girl, who I had casually dated for two months prior to moving, smothered me by being extremely insecure and needy.

**Description**

Solo show with Patrick today – kind of an inside baseball show. As one caller says, the show is all talk about food and fans. But sometimes that’s what you people need. More Anjeli Jana bashing, more calls from fans, good and bad, and we learn something about what Armenian people eat. One caller calls in to bitch. Patrick is upset about people who pretend to want to help. We talk about upcoming Texas and New York City meetups and shows. Creepy Bill from MN proves why he will never be an intern for the show, despite his undying dedication.

qprjn,42,2012-03-09,"Invisible Children CEO, Ben Keesey",QuestioningKony,conspiracy,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/qprjn/invisible_children_ceo_ben_keesey/,"Let me preface all of this by saying, I've never given much stock to conspiracy theories as a whole. Many of them require such intricate machinations that I don't think they could be covered up for so long, or would require more competence from more people than I'm willing to credit the human race with.

That said, the past day or so, it's like I've been pulled into a rabbit hole, and little bits and pieces of things I've seen lately are starting to create an ominous picture. And the scariest part (to me) is that it doesn't require that complex of a scheme... at all...

Alright, I really have a strong intuition that this Kony 2012 thing is a distraction for some bigger story. We all know that there have been some very suspicious [FBI actions](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXi-oDoMQhc) and [TSA actions](http://tsaoutofourpants.wordpress.com/2012/03/08/breaking-tsa-threatens-mainstream-media-not-to-cover-story/) in the past few days. But I really feel like there's a major cover-up going on with this ""campaign."" At first, I felt like it might be a political candidate trying to draw attention away from Super-Tuesday or something moderately tame like that.

Unfortunately, I'm starting to feel like that would be... er... simpler than the real story. Although the political aspect of calling it ""Kony 2012"" and releasing it on Super-Tuesday (technically it was released Monday) have a strong psychological effect (it's essentially using very basic priming to get it stuck in their heads), I now truly think that that timing is ONLY to use that priming.

Without going into all of the criticism of Invisible Children (which are numerous and mostly valid... though I will maintain that there's at least an argument that the ""filmmaking budget,"" while separate from the program budgets, could be considered a ""program"" because it's raising awareness... I'm not sure that that argument is strictly ethically *correct*, but nonetheless...), I'm very interested in one person in particular.

**Ben Keesey**

Keesey is the Executive Director and CEO of IC. What first drew me to start looking into him was that he IS the top of the company, yet I haven't seen his name in ANY of the media rebuttals. So, I started poking around publicly available records on the internet.

At first, I had no idea what I was looking for. I tried to find any tie between the FBI and Keesey or IC. I couldn't turn up a direct connection, but then I found something rather startling on [Keesey's Link'dIn page](http://www.linkedin.com/pub/ben-keesey/4/b19/24a). He leap frogs from an investment banking company, to a management consultant firm, straight to IC. It's not an entirely unexpected career path, but it's a bit unusual to move into a high-capital non-profit after a couple internships and to build it up in less than five years.

My working theory is that Keesey made some connection at [Brentwood](http://www.brentwood.com/) that took him to [Deloitte](http://www.deloitte.com/) (which does some high up business in Africa... a brief search turned up [this](http://www.techzim.co.zw/tag/deloitte/)... granted it's Zimbabwe and not Uganda, and that they're not really even that close... but I don't remember if I heard that the LRA had been in Zimbabwe or something...) which set up IC as a media front for some of their less scrupulous actions. Granted, it's only intuition and a working theory.

Here's where I need /r/Conspiracy. I need help to sort out all this information, to follow the thread and see if it leads somewhere. I keep coming back to the word ""Evangelical"" too... If Keesey has a connection, I strongly feel it will be church/evangelical related. I'm not so good at all this, but it's your bread and butter. Maybe I'm completely wrong, but better to be proven wrong than to have never said anything at all."
qrzt0,1,2012-03-11,Am I cray cray?  Need moral support.,magenta_panda,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/qrzt0/am_i_cray_cray_need_moral_support/,"Warning: wall of text.

I am currently depressed.  Let me explain how I fell into the underbelly of darkness.  

In May 2008, I moved back into my parent's house from college.  I decided that it was for the best to save money, and I had an internship.  I had recently gained a bit of weight because I was unhappy in a relationship.  Eventually we broke up, and this coincided with me moving back into my parent's house.  I decided to diet to lose the weight.  My mother was more than thrilled to help me.  We cooked together, and I started going to the gym more often.  I asked her to help me.  But it started becoming demeaning when she would walk into the living room, and ask why I wasn't at the gym.  I felt worse when one day, she became angry when I ate too many frozen raspberries after dinner.  I continued seeing my friends at this point, which meant that I ate with them.  I remember becoming upset why I wasn't losing weight at a quicker pace, when my mom pointed out that my friends were not exactly the healthiest eaters.  She recommended that I stop seeing them because I would continue my old habits with them.

After a few months, I lost a dramatic amount of weight.  I went to the gym more frequently.  My diet became much more restricted and then I decided it was time to cut down my portions.  My mom laughed at me when I cut my food portions in half, and called me her little rabbit.  In response, I said ""Don't fuck with me.  Whenever I am in the kitchen, no one can enter"".  Then on, my parents obeyed this rule.  

The last time I hung out with one of my friends from high school, she called me ""skinny bitch"" the whole time.  Some of my friends did not accept me for being thinner.  I did what my Mom suggested.  Goodbye socialization! 

In the meanwhile, I was losing more and more weight.  In November, I reached 105 lbs.  I am 5' 7.5"".  I am female, and this was not my lowest adult weight.  

From 2008 to September 2011, I was anorexic.  I learned all of the tricks to not let anyone know.  I did not spend more than a few hours at a time with anyone.  I did not like eating with people, and tried to avoid it as much as possible.  I went to the gym for 2 hours everyday.  

One of the worst points came in 2010 when my sister's family came to visit.  I was reclusive.  I had locks installed on my office and bedroom doors so I could hide food in the trash.  I told everyone I was vegetarian so I couldn't eat with them.  

During 2008-2011, my Mom talked to me a few times saying that I was a little underweight, and it would be okay if I gained a bit of weight.  But at the same time, she told me that ""while you can always get a job, you have one body and you take care of it.  Men only like women who take care of themselves.  Look at how may fat girls there are.  Men don't want them.""  She added fuel to my fire.  I also remember Christmas 2008 when I was supposed to go to my family dinner.  I protested that the dinner food did not agreed with my diet, and my Mom's response was ""act like model.  Push around your peas, and talk a lot"".  I did not go, and neither did my parents.  The last time I ate a family meal was 2008.  During my anorexia, my Mom bought my food.  I gave her shopping lists and demanded that she buy crazy amounts for fruits and vegetables (the majority of my diet) so I would always have extras stocked in the house.  And she did.  She was so proud that I was skinny and told me that I was special because there are many girls like me.  She said I should consider modelling.

I feel angry at myself more than anything for spiraling into crazzzzziness.  I feel angry at my Mom. My Dad was not any better... during the summer of 2011 he used to torment me.  He would always yell at me ""did you remember to eat up?"" or ""did you eat?"" or ""are you anorexic?"" when I left for the gym.

In spring 2011, I went to the extreme.  I estimate my lowest weight at around 85 lbs.  I had a person in the street yell at me ""eat something girl!"".  My gym demanded that I retrieve a doctor's note.  I did and the note said I was okay for moderate exercise.  My gym demanded that I get another doctor's note saying that I could do regular intense exercise.  I got another note.  My manager at work called a meeting with HR and me to discuss my weight loss.  He wanted me to get help.  However it was a contract job that ended 1 month after that meeting.  Afterwards, I decided I wanted my life back.  I stopped doing activities which I loved.  I decided to move away, and I did.  

Fast forward about 6 months to now, when I tried to recover I got a new eating disorder: binge eating!  I am now overweight.  At times, I am suicidal.  I want a normal fulfilling life but I do not know if it's in the cards for me.  When I started eating again, a flood of emotions came over me.  I realized that no one really gives a fuck about me.  As long as I do a good job at work, no one knows my secret.  They think I am normal.  I used to be a great person.  Now, I'm nada.  No one will ever love me for who I am.  Because there is nothing left.  My parents and my sister, the closest people to me, I do not respect anymore.  I am afraid that I am going to become old, and even with all of my freedom and financial independence, I will never be happy.  I don't how I will ever have a boyfriend again.  I haven't worn a tank top in public since 2008.  (The last time I did I remember the disgusted faces in the gym).  My body issues are so bad that I can't stand it when people touch me.  When I was skinny, my guy friend rated me a 9.5.  Now, I'm probably a 5.  I like to say that looks do not matter, and I want to believe it so badly but I can't.  People treated me so differently when I was skinny.       

I want to believe that I can get better, but it's hard when I feel so unloved.  And I live on my own, and I need some help installing a few things in my apartment but I hate being in private places with others so I haven't received the help that I need.

Like I said earlier, I am pretty depressed.  The only high point in my life is my career.  I am amazed at how I compartmentalize my successful work life with my shitty personal life.  I am seeing a therapist once a week after work.  I am trying, but deep down I feel that I do not deserve love.  That I am invalid because I am fat (which I have never been in my life up until now).

And why I am posting this online?  Because it feels good to tell the story as a cautionary tale.  Because I am desperately seeking hope. Because the only other person that knows this story is my therapist.  

One day, I want to be honest. I want a close friend.  I want to trust them with the truth.    

Has anyone reading this experienced something similar? "
qry8f,3,2012-03-11,Advice Needed on Job Offer Etiquette,[deleted],engineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/qry8f/advice_needed_on_job_offer_etiquette/,"Hello fellow engineering redditors, I'm a senior graduating this semester with my BSE and am going through the whole job searching process.  
  
  
I've recently been offered a position at the small company that I'm interning at and while I'm glad I interned there and I think working there would be fine, the problem kind of is that working there would be just fine - not my dream or ideal job fresh out of school. They have offered me a position and would like my reply by then end of this next week. Meanwhile, the other companies I've been applying to haven't even begun their hiring process (no calls to me - no calls to anybody I have talked to in my major/courses).  
  
  
The offer I have at this point is good and it's well, an offer as opposed to not even an interview. My issue is what I'm to do next. As far as I know now, there are three options:  
* Take the job, stop looking for other jobs. The economy is not amazing. If I was a stellar candidate other companies would have already  been in contact with me. It is unethical to sign an acceptance letter and continue to look for another position.  
* Take the job, keep looking. I live in an at-will state and am free to choose what is best for me. I can rescind my acceptance courteously and although the company will not be happy, there's not much they can do about it.  
* Refuse the job. Hopefully with an engineering degree this wouldn't be my only job offer. I wouldn't become homeless if I were to be unemployed for awhile and I'm a professional and cannot make commitments I can't keep.  
  
  
Some background on me is that I don't have much experience, this internship is pretty much it. My GPA is between a 3.0 and 3.25. Decent but not impressive. There is another intern at this company that I'm sure the company would switch to in a heartbeat if I didn't seem interested.  
  
  
I wish I could just ask for more time but I feel like this would reflect really badly and they would just go with the other intern (there's only one position). I like to hold myself to a high standard ethically and would hate to back out of the contract but it's extremely hard to pass up a sure thing. 
  
  
Please help me out and state your opinion on the matter and what you feel you would do in this position. Thanks for reading and let me know if I left anything out (or feel free to gripe at me for giving too much info)!"

In the past year, my gpa has dropped from ~3.8 to 3.45 and I **do not** want that shit to drop any more, my goal is to graduate with higher than a 3.5. Over the pat year I've become so fucking unmotivated I just hate myself. I've started smoking a lot of weed which I feel gets in the way of my academic success. I have no idea what the fuck is wrong with me, I used to be disciplined and used to get whatever shit to be done, done. Now I just procrastinate like a bitch and it's really screwing me over. To be clear, my college is about 25 minutes away so I commute. I have no friends few friends at college that I never hand out with so I'm at home most of the time and I've filled that void with pot. 

I'm taking the hardest accounting class of my life and I've not started studying for my huge midterm on wednesday. The class is comprised of 2 midterms and a paper and I'm probably going to get a D or an F on the test this wednesday which will probably cause me to fail the class. Something is wrong with me. My sleep schedule is fucked up, I'm always tired, I don't give a shit about anything including school when I really should at this moment in my life. I need to start applying to internships and such but I just haven't brought myself up to do it. I don't know how to cut my weed habit, which I think is the problem. One of my friends who is a daily toker has one of the highest gpa's in the school and he's doing just great for himself, but me, I'm fucking up. This is the first time I've admitted my problems and I'm scared to even talk to my parents about it. I won't tell them about the weed, but I just feel like shit on a daily basis and have no idea where my life is heading. I feel like I have no one to talk to about this so I made a post on this subreddit because I feel I can talk to you guys about this. I'm starting to hate what ~~I'm becoming~~ I've become and I need to change my ways if I don't want to be left behind in the future. "

To top it all off I just found out that the week he gets back he is planning a 4 day trip to see his friends. 

I feel like he is being selfish and not being considerate of how I feel and how much I miss him. He says he misses me too, but it seems like he just wants to be away from me. It seems like he just wants to do what he wants and I have to wait around to spend time with him when he feels like it. Am I being crazy reddit?"

Background 
--

---

I started college with no real goals or knowledge as to what I wanted to do. I love computer science and programming, so I started a degree at Lawrence Technological University in Michigan for Computer Science and Mathematics, but a life tragedy happened at the end of my first semester in college and I never really picked myself up.

Now after 3 years of basically sitting in the back of the classroom listening and not really participating I've decided that my programming hobby isn't going to make a very enjoyable career and I want to take what I've learned so far and steer that down the path to become an actuary.

My friend recommended this profession based on the fact that he had come down a similar path and even completed a degree in Mathematics at LTU. The degree itself is essentially worthless which has me gritting my teeth at how stupid I was as a youth to just blindly follow a high school friend to this expensive shill.

Foreground
--

---

Being a third year I have most of my mathematics done. I stopped at partial differential equations because at that point I didn't even know why I was getting out of bed in the morning.

What I really want to do is find a university that I can study to get into this summer or fall, but my GPA is a miserable 2.4 (I think) and no university will probably accept that. I can probably go to a community college to start some college level financial classes, but I don't really know what I'll need to complete a degree with my accumulated 52 credit hours as it stands.

I've disowned the university, but I'm open to completing the degree there if that is my only choice. It is very expensive and I really cannot afford to go there anymore (10k per semester).

I don't know of any universities with actuary programs near me, but I'm willing to relocate to finish school. I have a job and I'm sure I can find another one if I need to relocate.

So any advice?

---

I want to thank everyone for giving me their opinions.

So now I have compiled a list of what I will try to do:

* Finish major in comp sci and started on exams.
* Market myself for IT work and do some data mining.

My reputation as the crazy kid who always drank and bitched everyone out seems to proceed me.  I no longer drink but have replaced my lithium with weed just so I do not have to deal with the nausea and other side effects.   I am stuck between missing the crazy impulses, and being a mature college student about to enter my masters degree in business.  I do not know how to move on make new friends and find people to confide in.  I do have a boyfriend of 2 years, and I love him (though marriage is illegal due to the gay thing).  However, I feel that my growing anti-social reluctance to trust anyone enough to start a friendship is effecting him also.  Just need some advice I suppose. (sorry for the rambling)"

So I have been out of work for about 2 years. Before this I was a journeyman carpenter in Las Vegas. Work dried up pretty bad and now I'm living in southern Oregon with some friends who have been very gracious with me. I had a good amount of money saved up, but it's been gone a while.

A few problems I may be having are the lack of an in state driver's licence. I am working on getting a birth certificate so I can get a new drivers license. My references are probably terrible in that I doubt any of them are even reachable. The construction industry got tore up pretty bad and most of my contacts have been fired or layed-off and no longer have company phones. 

I don't have good relationship skills, so that has hurt me a lot. I moved around growing up between parents and just didn't really understand the benefits of keeping in contact with friends and coworkers that would put in a good word for me.

Before that I worked at a automotive supplier as a part of an internship in college for mechanical engineering. I only completed a year of that before I had to drop out for financial reasons.

I need to get on track and gain a reliable source of income. I fear I am on the verge of homelessness and more bad news in general.

I am pretty computer savvy, always work hard and have always had employers that were very happy with me. I just don't know what to do to get started again.

Any insights or advice would be greatly appreciated. I will try to answer any questions if anyone has any.

qt8rw,2,2012-03-12,"Aspiring Musician/Audio Engineer in CA, should I move to Ann Arbor, MI?",creatoranddistractor,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/qt8rw/aspiring_musicianaudio_engineer_in_ca_should_i/,"Hi guys, I'm having a tough time coming to a big decision affecting my life, relationship and career, and thought maybe someone here might have some wise insight. I am really at a loss as to what to do. Do any of you live in or near Ann Arbor, MI? 

A little backstory, my girlfriend of 5+ years and I are both 26 and live in San Diego CA. She's applied to a number of graduate schools, including UC Berkeley, The New School (NY), American University (DC), University of Washington (Seattle), and University of Michigan. She's studying International Sustainable Agricultural Development, and all these schools have good programs related to this field.  I am a musician/music producer whose career is just starting to materialize...my band just released [this] (http://creatoranddistractor.bandcamp.com) and I cowrote/produced a song for  [My Drunk Kitchen's Hannah Hart](http://youtu.be/mafimBTMTmY). My bandmates are based in California, and we have a number of friends in the industry here, so we have sort of an established ""home base"" in California. 

Anyway, she's starting to hear back from schools. She's been accepted to University of Michigan and American University so far. She hasn't been rejected by any schools yet, but because she heard back from these two schools first, these schools have sort of subconsiously jumped to the top of her list in her mind. She's starting to get really excited about the program at Michigan, despite the fact that when she first applied, it was at the bottom of her list, due to the high cost and its location. Suddenly now, the program at Berkeley, which used to be her top choice, doesn't look good enough to her, and the Michigan program is ""exacty what she wants"".

We agreed that we would move together to wherever she decides to attend, and to her credit, she based her application list somewhat on the music scene in and near those schools, taking my career into account. Obviously the bay area has a great scene, and is close to LA, and NYC is an obvious choice. Even Seattle and DC have pretty great scenes. Ann Arbor Michigan scares me though. I've been into music my whole life, and before she applied to UM, I'd never heard of the place. I've been looking into the music scene there, and have come up pretty empty handed. We're going to visit in a couple weeks to attend a Student's Day, so I'll do some more research there, but I'm starting to worry that the trip out there might sell her on the college and place, while simultaneously convincing me that I don't have much of a future there.

Moving to Michigan would certainly and significantly change the direction of my career. I've just started to make some meaningful connections in the industry in CA, and even have an internship at a recording studio lined up here in San Diego. If we move to Michigan, I'm afraid I'll be forced to put my music on the shelf for a while, and take any job I can get out there, just to pass the time while she earns her degree. Of course I want her to go to the best school for her, and get the degree that she truly wants, but it's starting to dawn on me that doing so may be at the expense of my own career. We've tried doing the long distance thing a couple times in the past, and it's fine for the short term, but the idea of having a 2 year long-distance relationship sounds...hard at best.

So I'm asking you, the fine populous of reddit, for advice. Does anyone live in or near Ann Arbor?  Is anyone attending UM and in the International Sustainable Development MA program? If so, how is it? What's the music scene like out there? Should I abandon my CA band (who will definitely not make the move with me to MI), to follow my girlfriend while she gets her MA? Should I stand my ground and follow the music? 

**tl;dr Should I follow my music career, or my girlfriend to graduate school? Are these mutually exclusive?**"

After my sister moved out in '96, my two brothers have both moved away, and then all of my best friends have moved away for educational or job opportunities and put down roots and haven't returned. I have friends in Alaska, Nashville, Eastern Washington, Chicago and two are in Europe. Now I can add Salt Lake City and Phoenix to that list. None of them are likely to come back, most have put down roots.  

The only support I have is my parents, but they are very negative and toxic people. My parents love my daughter a lot, but my mother is morbidly obese and a borderline hoarder. My dad is...unreliable. My husband and I have been separated since July, and while we are friendly we are not friends. 

Mostly I'm worried for my daughter. My parents moved up to the Seattle area when my siblings were little, and they never could quite break into any sort of social community/group. I was a very lonely child, my siblings were very dear to me. I followed their example and moved away to chicago for my freshman year of college but my experience was awful.  I would've moved home immediately but my parents refused to let me come home. When I did come home, I married pretty quickly to the first guy I met back home. I never made many new friends after moving home, and now the two girls who I've been abke to befriend are leaving. They are both people I wanted to be in my daughter's life as role models and women she could rely on. I have multiple sclerosis, so I want to have people who love my daughter and that she could turn to if I were ever to be incapacitated.  

I've toyed with the idea of finding co-housing or an eco-village to move into. It seems kinda risky, and most co-housing communities would be way too expensive for me to afford. 

I don't really have a question, or anything to say, I'm just tired of being left behind by everyone on their way to bigger and better things. I'm not the greatest at meeting people, and I'm naturally more introverted. Socially I am very normal, but I've always been better with fewer, more intimate friendships. I don't want my daughter to be lonely like I was growing up. I want her to feel secure and confident and to have some sort of community that is static and reliable. I am helpless to provide that for her, and it makes me so sad. "

I'm kind of at an interesting point in my life, and was hoping for some advice from someone with much more wisdom than myself.  It would be a shame if I didn't try to tap into the interesting minds of the reddit community :).  Hopefully this 4 minute read is worth your time, and is greatly appreciated…  

I'm in my young 20's, ""fresh"" out of college currently living in southern California.  I graduated with a 4.0 from two universities in two different countries with two separate degrees (consider it a super-study-abroad).  I've traveled all over the States due to internships and Europe due to schooling.  I have seen more sights than most people dream of.  I have no loans, financially very sound for my age, and jobs out to wazoo ranging in every industry from space, to biology, to even top secret jobs (I already have a clearance).  I've never had a problem finding a girl, although have yet to find one that I see spending the rest of my life with.  I have an absolutely amazing family, all of whom live in a nice retirement community and are begging me to come back home (rent free!).  I have four or so very close friends that are scattered across the states, and plenty of additional friends here and there.  From an third party standpoint, I'm beyond ""blessed"".  And yet, even with all of this, I still feel empty.

Moving to southern California was the first decision I made in my life so that I would be happy instead of an advancement in my career path.  However, things didn't turn out to well.  Being a workaholic from the east coast, I'm having a hard time adjusting to the California life style and all these party hard girls :).  After getting with a girl last night, her leaving because I wasn't interested in the whole shabang (I prefer wine and dine instead of get in get out), and not sleeping all night, I came to the realization that I'm not sure what I'm doing with my life or what I want.

On one hand, I've been debating joining the Red Cross and going to teach programming abroad, preferably in Africa or somewhere destitute.  I'm a little scared of making a career at a desk job at such an early age and have no interest in money.  I just want to do something for society and have a great time.  I enjoy research as well, and have considered doing an internship at the NIH to help advance modern medicine.  On the other hand, I want to find something meaningful.  A nice girl, steady job, home close to family, and friends that I know I will not lose in 6 months due to traveling so much.  For someone who always seemed to have an answer for his friends, I just don't understand why I'm not happy.  

Should I stay in California and give it a chance (been here 3 months), or go home (not sure I'll be happy either way)? Should I see a therapist?  Have you seen a therapist before?  What if it doesn't work?  I don't want depression meds or their 8281903 side effects…  What are some good books to read? Does this feeling of emptiness I've had since the beginning of college ""go away"" as I get older, or is it just one of those life situations you need to cope with?  Am I a spoiled punk who just needs to appreciate what he has (rules say ""No yes/no answer questions"", so ignore this one :))?

I know there are millions of others with the ""quarter life crisis"" as they call it that are way worse off than me.  I just wanted to here some anonymous thoughts from people who have maybe been through the same.

Thanks greatly for your time in advance."
qsncq,1,2012-03-12,Collapse of an abusive 8-year friendship,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/qsncq/collapse_of_an_abusive_8year_friendship/,"(This is a bit of a novel -- sorry.)
This is too long to fit in one post, so I’m putting the TL;DR at the top.  The rest of the story is in comments:
**TL;DR** I went to undergrand and then grad school with a guy who I didn't know before college.  He was an opiate addict.  I went along with this friendship for years and years as he gradually, but then quickly, entered a downward spiral.  Shit hit the fan this year when he stole thousands of dollars from me.  I saw this coming for years and yet continued to trust him.  Finally, last week I contacted his sibling and his family intervened, yanked him out of grad school and sent him to rehab.  

Story (Part 1):
I met him the very first day I moved into my freshman dorm at our non-prestigious public university.  I was 18, had just moved over 1000 miles away from my small bedroom community hometown, and I was looking to make new friends.  About half of the residents on this floor had the same prestigious scholarship that I had, so I was sure I'd make some great new friends who were also really smart.  He was the first.  At that time, I was a closeted gay kid and he was an attractive, outgoing, and athletic guy who had also just moved in from across the country.  Of course I was naturally drawn to his looks and personality, although he has always been 100% straight and I knew I'd never get with him -- he would always just be a friend, and I was fine with this.  But throughout the eight years we were friends, I allowed my feelings for him to override every instinct I would otherwise have about a person, and allowed him to gradually become more and more of an abusive, troubled person, a person who has been nothing but a bad influence on my life.  

As undergrad progressed, he was one of my very tight, six-guy group of close friends, all of whom lived on this same dorm floor when we were freshmen.  Freshman year was a blast -- we had many nights of quiet drinking in dorm rooms to not draw RA attention, went to many house parties, smoked a few trees, and yet everyone still went to most of their classes and got good grades.  He found a local girlfriend (another freshman who got us access to many off-campus parties) during the first week of classes.  They dated for two years, and she bore the brunt of most of his rather erratic mood swings and semi-irresponsible behavior.  

At first, his irresponsibility was minor -- things like bad driving, never cleaning his room, and lots of underage drinking, but these habits were not unusual for a freshman guy and generally not a concern.  He also took a serving job at some chain restaurant in town, made good tips, and held that job down for the duration of freshman year.  From outward appearances, he was a successful person who was just enjoying college.  He even played some college sports, mostly as a walk-on player, or as a practice squad member or something like that.  

See, he had been a big athlete in high school and had got injured at one point and evidently once got prescribed vicodin or percocet.  By the day we first met, he was already a small-time opiate abuser.  He kept this a secret, but may have mentioned at a party or two that he had ""taken them before,"" but always in the past tense.

Freshman year was a blast, and he and I and two of our other very best friends moved in to a house together for sophomore year, and we lived there for three years until we all graduated on time.  The entire house was generally irresponsible, mostly by completely trashing the place through constant beer pong games, messes, and several house parties.  But everyone was still responsible with school and work, and things seemed fine.  He was still dating his girlfriend, and he adopted a puppy that he took very good care of.  Sophomore year was fine, although he and his girlfriend were constantly arguing.  Finally, at the beginning of junior year, they broke up.  This event led to his increased opiate use.  A year later, the dog escaped through a faulty fence and got hit by a car and died.  This further depressed him.  He spent most of his time in his room or working.  At this point, he was still good with money and was responsible at work, but he did this so he could use his tip money for pills.  None of us needed outside employment -- we had full scholarships that covered living expenses -- so extra income could be spent on anything, and he used it on pills.  None of us knew this was going on, but there were red flags.  He was spending less time with the rest of the roommates, and he'd have erratic mood swings and would constantly be scratching himself.  But he went to enough classes to still graduate with average grades, but he definitely had the lowest GPA of our group of friends.  When we moved out, we faced a steep repair bill.  He somehow didn't expect this or have any spare money.  That was the first time he borrowed money from me.  I lent him something like $1000.

When we graduated, we all went our separate ways.  None of us was from the city we went to school in and we were all from different cities.  I didn't hear from him for a few months.  He apparently spent the time waiting tables back home as we was taking a year off before grad school, which gave him plenty of tip money and access to opiates (which are big in the restaurant industry).  I worked in an office back home during this time.  Around Christmas, I finally got my money back from him, which I thought was gone forever, and he included a good amount of interest as well.  I also found out that we were both applying to grad school and were applying to some of the same schools.  Ultimately we both wound up enrolling at the same somewhat prestigious university.  I had gotten admitted a month or two before him and had already committed to living on-campus, and he wanted to live off-campus.

So, during our first year, we were not roommates but we hung out a lot at his off-campus house, which he shared with others who were in school with us.  He did not work outside of school until the middle of the spring semester, because his student budget ran out early.  (By the fall semester of our first year, he'd already developed a reputation of almost never attending classes, even though we're in a professional program.)  During the spring, I was irresponsible as well.  I didn't focus much on my classes because I'd drink with him.  Sometimes I'd take drugs with him, but never painkillers.  We did ecstasy a couple of times and took shrooms over spring break with one of his roommates.  During this year, he apparently borrowed rent money from multiple roommates of his because he was spending money on drugs.  I knew he borrowed money, but I didn't know how much, and it wasn't my business.  He didn't ask me for money that year.  I agreed to live with him the following school year, which is this year.

My grades sucked, but I got a good summer internship and everything was going great.  I didn't really keep in touch with him over the summer, but he was back at home so he didn't have to deal with rent problems that summer.

This school year, where we've been living in the same house (with some other students -- not the same ones as the ones he lived with last year), things have gone downhill quickly.  The pace accelerated in the fall semester, and then collapsed between December and now.  Right after we moved in, we were fighting frequently over frivolous things.  Knowing my reluctance to lend him money due to his delay in repaying me for his share of the housing damages after undergrad, he discovered a new way to get at my money -- by getting me on the habit with him.  The first time I took vicodin or percocet (I don't remember which; the drug of choice would change frequently depending on whichever was available) was probably in October.  He gave me some for free and explained what they did.  For some reason I decided to try them out (I was probably really hungover and wanted to kill the hangover).  I loved them.  I'm normally an introverted, socially awkward penguin.  When I took pills, I'd have a major personality improvement, I'd be smiling and engaging.  Soon, of course, he'd ask for me to pay for my share of the pills.  He'd buy about 120mg at a time ($1 per mg), and I'd get about 20 or 30 and he'd get the rest.  He'd get me to go to the ATM and give him $120 at a time and he'd promise to repay his share.  His failure to do so in short order didn't concern me because I was on these new awesome pills.  (He had worked at a restaurant for the first half of the semester, which is where he got referred to the local drug dealer, but he got fired halfway through the semester.  After this, he was constantly assuring me that he was looking for new jobs.)  I even secretly took some home for thanksgiving and had them in the bathroom at the beginning of a big family gathering, so that I could be more outgoing and have more fun chatting with lots of people.

It's been difficult but he's my best friend and my everything and the guy I'd love to spend forever with.

He's graduating this year and is planning to go to law school but hasn't decided which one... We had this plan that he would go to school and I would work in NYC so that we could start our life together finally in the same place but unfortunately the only school he's been accepted to in New York is Brooklyn Law (waitlisted at Fordham) but I know he doesn't really want to go there. He also got into William and Mary with a decent amount of money and is seriously considering it instead. The obvious problem here is that I still want to work in NYC and he would be all the way in VA. I want him to do what is best for him which at the moment seems to be to go to William and Mary as its ranked higher, cost of living is lower, and he would graduate with significantly less debt compared to a school in The City.

I don't know exactly what my ""Job Title"" would be, but I'm hoping to find an intern position, or a full time job, some where that repairs computers all day, every day.

I want to wake up, get ready for the day, and be entertained all day. I don't want to just ""work"" all day. I've done that and it's not getting me any where. Repairing computers is not ""working"" for me, it's a way of life for me. I'm like Dr. House when it comes to computers, (except that I an not an ass and I help every one): It excites me when an issue comes up that some one can resolve. I LIKE finding out how to do what people want with their computers. Every time I fix a computer, I don't just get the job done. I go above and beyond to TEACH them new things, while at the same time achieving the perfection they weren't even sure they wanted until I showed them how to fully utilize their system and get the most out of it. I just really enjoy working with and on computers and helping people.

Reddit is a huge community and I have seen wonders come out of it. So I am posting my certificate here in hopes that I can get hired. I suck at writing resumes and cover letters, but I'm one heck of a test taker, a demonstrator, personable, committed, social, punctual, reliable, produce results, motivated, educated, willing to learn more, and am able to provide the best of customer service to any one requesting help from me.

Let me know if you need any other information. I am able to start ASAP. Finding jobs down here in Hayward is not cutting it. I'd rather shoot for a career. I've checked out all of those ""Online Courses"" and they are way to expensive and would take years to get what I just got in 3 months time.

* Phone: what should I do? What is the best deal?

* Internet: what should I do? What is the best deal?

* Job: my SO is going with me (already graduate). He is a computer / software engineer. Where could he look for work?

* By the way, how is the labour market in Ireland / Dublin? Is it very difficult to find a job?

quo3h,5,2012-03-13,career confession,slimesnake,confession,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/quo3h/career_confession/,"i was a chef for a good part of my early manhood. I started as an intern/assistant in a very busy major north eastern city after applying for a saute position, the chef noticed i walked into something completely over my head but offered me a internship. 


I got my first real kitchen job shortly thereafter working as a garde manger(cold entrees,salads,desserts) the whole situation was very overwhelming. It was awful im naturally disorganized and not that fast, mostly very chilled out so it was a terrible match. I told my girlfriend of the time how miserable it made me, she threatened to kick me out if i quit. Having no where else to go at the time, i bit my tongue and complied until i got fired. Even thought I hated it, it broke my heart.
 My next gig was at a eastern European place in another north eastern destination but known for its agriculture. The place was new and it would just be me working with the owner, Everything was great for the few months. But then I started messing up much more than I did in the past. Breaking things on accident, messing up orders, getting frazzled and stressed until again I was ""let go"" via email.



 After a stint of unemployment I was back in the kitchen but this time at a ski resort out west. It was a glorified FRIDAYS type place, with burgers and some nice fish and steak entrees. I started out on the grill doing really well and then again slowly started to commit more erroneous acts, eventually being demoted to the cold station. I always tried and worked very very hard, but certain practices never really clicked. I lived alone in a one room apartment at the base of a mountain. I never really went out since the only things to do there were to ski or get hammered. I liked to stay home or go out alone to different towns, smoke pot and enjoy myself on down time, its how i relax. After a few months I left because the pay after rent was rather skimpy and again was just not feeling the whole situation. I still kept at it thinking that the whole ""Dont give up"" quotes were working hard at things that make you completely miserable. 

Shortly after I worked at a very small but very high class gastro pub, the kitchen was microscopic. 11 hours a day I prepped right in front of the hot flaming grill, dripping sweat nonstop until i left for the night. The days were filled with heavy lifting, mountains of prep work, insane service during the rushes. Again i was miserable, but I tried to have a better attitude about it and stuck with it. Unfortunately my means of transportation broke and could not still get there. When I called and told the chef about what happened he screamed at me and let me go right then.

 Next stop was the zionist summer camp, I did pretty well there as the chef preparing a nice meal for 250+ people daily for lunch and dinner all by myself. I got a raise in the first 2 weeks, it was great until they never put my raise into my pay checks. I left a week before it was over after not getting payed the amount I was owed and they started pushing work unfair work loads only onto me and not the other cooks.

 My mind would always break at a certain point craving to do other things with my life, but I always made myself keep with it. Further down the line I was the lead cook at a kosher catering place that had poor practices considering actual quality and that really hurt my soul, I stayed with them for half a year until i was fired for making the chef a bad sandwich. I had a few jobs after that in NYC which were great paying higher up chef positions but my spirit dwindles. I just didnt care, I cant make myself care about this profession but i keep with it because i dont know what else to do with myself. I want to start a farm and have been trying to get internships. i have two starting in a few months, one is just harvesting produce and the other I have yet to contact the people to set it up.

qukju,8,2012-03-13,5+ Year IT Professional facing crossroads,enetix,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/qukju/5_year_it_professional_facing_crossroads/,"I think this is really more of a &lt;/rage&gt; or &lt;/gripe&gt; post more than anything but reddit always seems to be the best place for me to expunge some of my frustrations.

So here's the down low, the nitty gritty, the, well, you get the idea. I've been working in IT now for over five years. I started off at 18 years old as a Technical Intern, basically being an account administrator to my current company's EDMS system. The 6 month internship turned full time soon there after, which was great. I shown that I could do more than just add domain accounts to certain user groups on an application. My manager helped me transfer to the EDMS Application Development team, and I assumed the position of Junior Developer as one of my colleagues had left the company.

This position was great, and my manager was awesome. I had good amounts of direction on what I should be doing, and also got to work with a couple stellar Senior Developers and System Architects, where I tried to suck every bit of information from them as I could. I wrote and deployed several very successful applications for our EDMS system that our company considers cornerstone applications today!

That was short lived. I was a part of that department for about 2 years, then an IT reorganization happened. I was shifted out of Application Development into Application Administration (wtf?) and was told I was not a developer and had no idea what I was doing. Now, I am more unhappy than ever. My job consists of the same things I was doing as an intern, and keeping sharp in this interim has been hard. 

Now normally, any person within their right mind would say, ""Okay, time to go get a new job"". For me, this is a bit of a struggle. I've had *amazing* interviews where I knocked the socks off of IT Directors as well as technical leads to Application Developers. All of these interviews would end in heartbreak, because I only have my Associates Degree. Albeit, I am 8 classes away from my BS in CIS, and should be done by the end of this year, but being told that your experience is great but we're going to choose the joe right out of college with a BS instead of you with your 5 years of experience that matches up well with our position sucks. On top of that, I cannot particularly take a contract due to medical reasons (pre-existing conditions).

qujp7,10,2012-03-13,Am I being underpaid? Would anyone hire me in the USA?,hubcon,sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/qujp7/am_i_being_underpaid_would_anyone_hire_me_in_the/,"**TL;DR: Sick of current job, all alone in a foreign country (the USA), do I have what it takes to get a decent, but different job?**

Hey! I recently moved to the US from Denmark. I actually am in possession of both an American and Danish citizenship, although this is my first time living here (I already have been for a year by now though).

I'm a young man, 20 years old, and work as the ""junior"" sysadmin in a small business for the last 2 years. Well small in we are less than 25 employees in total, but from a technical perspective, we have plenty of IT related services including 6 branches in 2 countries with site-to-site VPN connecting everything together (what we do is provide virtual &amp; shared office space).

I have no certificates to show for, all I got is my 2½ year education as an ""[it-supporter](http://www.ug.dk/job/dataitogteleteknik/itadmsupport/it-supporter.aspx)"" where approximately half of that time is spent as an intern. I started that education when I was 15, learned the basics of electricity, but more relevant Cisco CCNA and basics of Microsoft domains. Although where I believe the education was most useful was the time spent as an intern, as I got my foot in the door &amp; learned how to act professionally as it was my first real job considering how young I was (or still am haha).

Anyway, my entire life is revolved around my current job, and I am starting to realize how unhappy I am since the job in itself is not what I want. Our CEO has major personal issues, has been going through a harsh divorce the last 3-4 years or so... and the only other IT person in our company is a sick person and an entire different story in itself. Let me just say that he is rarely at the office and can get away with this since our boss is across the Atlantic ocean, and has an extremely poisoned view of IT doing the bare-minimum required, even if it means going completely against best practices to get the job done. For example as we speak right now, our main and most important server, hosting 5 very crucial virtual servers, is and has been running off of a defective raid-5 array for the last half year.

I would be ""allright"" with this job, if it weren't for the fact that many of my ideas of improvements are often flat out denied, and when I do accomplish good things, there is no appreciation or feedback what so ever. Besides that there is barely any communication and/or teamwork between me and the ""other"" IT-guy and our boss is in Europe most of the time so I am alone pretty much EVERY single day. I just accomplished a major goal in my opinion last week, fully inspired by myself, a complete Nagios implementation monitoring ALL of our IT infrastructure, with alerts to everyone and an app for my iPhone which can wake me up in the middle of the night should something go wrong. Even utilized CloudKick for notification in the rare chance that the actual Nagios server loses connectivity. After documenting the entire setup and sending an e-mail regarding my work to boss and other it guy; I never even received a reply...

ANYWAY, on top of this my social life is non-existent and I'm living alone so I desperately need something to change as I feel like I'm breaking down. If I may summarize: 

I'm 20. Have been working as a junior sysadmin for 2 years at this company, before that was my education as an it-supporter, where 1 year of that education was spent as an intern working as a technician for personal and small-business.

I have no major specialties and no certificates besides my ""it-supporter"" education (in which I scored perfect 12 in all final-tests, although I could imagine that means nothing for an American job).

What I DO have is plenty of self-taught knowledge. To quickly go through skills and other various topics &amp; tools I know and have familiarized myself with: various raids, php, mysql, wordpress, deploying servers in ec2 and utilizing other various services from Amazon AWS such as S3 for backup, basic pentesting within BackTrack and assessing network security, the whole aircrack-ng shebang for pentesting wifi, utilization of encryption from tools such as truecrypt, google apps, microsoft ISA, ubuntu, xenserver &amp; vmware workstation, cisco from my CCNA practice from school, exchange, IIS, iphone app programming, rackspace cloud hosting, deployment of IT monitoring from nagios, google adwords and analytics for analyzing and improving marketing. Tools I know and use including malwarebytes, hijackthis, zenmap, windirstat, powershell, sysinternals suite, keepass, apache, iptables, photoshop, afteraffects, sony vegas.

I have no idea how relevant what I listed above is, and I don't want to come across as a typical ignorant and naive know-it-all, as I have great respect for everything I DON'T know. I obviously know far from everything about php, exchange and microsoft domains, but I know how to get them running, the basic troubleshooting and the basic programming in PHP. My point is that while I don't feel as if I have any unique specialty, I am good in the sense that I have a firm all-around skill base with the motivation and logically thinking brain required to easily go out and teach myself new things, in spare time or work time, if relevant. 

Now that you know a little bit about me, do you believe I have any shot of finding something else decent to do here in the United States despite my lack of a lengthy CV, certificates or local education? Any idea on where I'd stand and what I should aim for perhaps? Heck, I'd be willing to move anywhere practically. I'm just afraid that everything I can put on document will mean jack to an American company, but then again, I have no clue how it works.

Secondly, I'm being payed $2400 a month excluding healthcare, but actually including a company car... I'm being underpaid aren't I? Any speculations on what a fair salary would be?

Worst case I move back to Denmark. As good as my well-being could be over there, I feel like my life could turn out to be much more interesting if I give the United States a chance, hence my desire to stay here.

I apologize for the wall of text, but will very much appreciate any comments and/or advice. Do not be afraid to be blunt!"

I can't help but feel as though that's my mind lying to me.


Ever since about a year ago I've been starting to slip further and further away from the joy I once knew. Sure, I still have some times where I can actually say I enjoy life, but these times are growing fewer and father between. I'm currently living away from home, in Germany, until August. This year has been difficult, because my family, fiancée, friends from home; they aren't here. I have been losing interest in almost everything; sewing, drawing, video games. Sometimes I don't even turn on music while I mindlessly browse Reddit, just because I don't feel like it. I feel like I'm being crushed every time I get a rejection letter from an internship that I applied to as well. So far I've been working with the people in my program to land an internship that we all have to get in order to graduate in the program. 45 applications, a duration-of-stay question, and an interview later I still have absolutely nothing. My fiancée back in the US already has a summer position lined up, and I'm the last one in my program to get an internship.


I've never felt unhappier in my entire life. I went on MedMD quick to humor the notion that I might be depressed and took their survey. 29% into the survey, they stopped it and posted the phone number to the helpline (which I can't call internationally) and told me to call immediately. Clicking that little box that said ""Have you had increased thoughts of suicide?"" probably did that. Don't worry, I would never commit suicide; I won't ever let it come to that because of how anti-suicide I am, but the thoughts are still there almost like my mind is telling me *it's still a possibility...*


Now, I know a self-diagnosis isn't the greatest, but I think it might be right. Since I'm away from home I don't know how much reasonable access an American would have in Germany to anybody that could help. I'm even afraid to tell the people I know, though I have brought it up in the past that I might be getting depressed.


I don't know how to stop this."

(A bit long and rantish, sorry.)",depression_throwaway,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/qtufa/its_hard_to_find_any_reason_to_keep_trying_a_bit/,"Forgive me if this is a bit long and involved. I can't get my head around most of this, so it's easier to write it out in list form.

*My academic adviser fucked up and failed to tell me that I need six more credits to graduate. I am in my final semester, supposed to be graduating in May.

*My parents have told me they are not willing to pay for the extra classes I now need to graduate. They suggested I take out a loan to pay for the classes, but I have no job, no credit history, and no way to assure any loan service I'm going to pay them back. (And ha ha, student loan bills will start coming in right after I graduate. Those I can defer, but still.)

*I can't. Get. Any. Fucking. Job. I'm not kidding when I say I've sent out close to a hundred applications in the last two years--for paid positions, internships, anything. My resume isn't shit, either--I've been working at least part time since I was fourteen, and have been doing work study the whole time I've been in college. Granted, I don't have many extracurriculars to my name (in part because I spent most of my youth terrified of other people), but it's not as though I'm totally inexperienced. In two years I got one response from an employer. One. I couldn't handle that internship because of my course load.

*The next thing my parents suggest is the whole ""move back home, get a job, figure it out from there"" thing. I'm familiar with that situation millions if not billions of college grads have found themselves in--get a diploma, nowhere to work and nothing to do, go back home. If I didn't loathe my hometown so much, I could accept that. But elementary/middle/high school was hell for me. I was an outsider then and am still treated as such. I have made almost no friends there, and what friends I made have moved away. I have nothing and no one there.

*Worst of all--and this might ring hollow, but it's what has been making me cry the most throughout all of this--I might lose all ties to my best friend. I honestly can't imagine my life without him. I don't know what would happen to our relationship once I leave.

So after all that, I've given up. I cry uncontrollably at least three times a day. When I'm not crying, I feel utterly blank--not happy, not sad, nothing. I can't get myself to do anything. The inevitability of it all--losing my chance at a diploma, my only friends, everything I've known for the last four years--has me feeling utterly helpless. Why keep trying to get a job/internship if I'm just going to get rejected again? Why keep up with schoolwork if I'm not even going to be able to afford a diploma? Why keep up with any friends if I'm just going to have to leave them in two months?

I don't know what I'm looking for here. Just some support I guess. Please don't tell me that this is the time for me to completely reinvent myself and start all over or whatever, I respect that you're trying to help but I'm not feeling particularly optimistic and every time I try to be I just start crying. All I want to know is how to make this current situation suck less."

I just got an internship, where I will be driving an hour there and an hour back a few times a week. I am worried about my car making the trips. Already since January I have spent roughly 700 in repairs. It is a 96 Contour, and I honestly do not think that it is going to last much longer. Especially with driving more than I have been. I am looking into getting a new car, I would like to get a used. I think that I should spend the money and get a newer used car and take out a loan and be able to have it for a while, with hopefully less problems (roughly 2k down and a 8k loan). But my boyfriend thinks that I should spend much less and just get a car that is good enough to get me by until I get a better job and making more money so we can afford to get a better car. 

**Here are our financial basics:**

* Last year I made 16 thousand
* My boyfriend made 36 thousand
* Our house payment is 580 a month, we are going to refinance. Our payment should stay the same because we are going to get a 15 year mortgage. 
* All bills aside, we put 700 into savings monthly, not including our retirement fund.
* My student loan payments are going to be coming up, I estimate them to be about 300 monthly

We are on a budget and put weekly allowances for groceries, eating out, gas, etc. in envelopes so we do not over spend.  We're looking for an unbiased opinion to see what the general consensus is. Any help, r/personalfinance? "

The good news is that I just landed an awesome internship for this summer! :) It's relevant to my interests, and the pay is really good, so needless to say I'm very excited. However... the company will be drug testing me. :( This is not too big of a deal; I have considered taking a break from smoking anyways, but the problem is that I have been an active ent for almost 5 years now, and specifically the past almost 2 months I have been smoking my new MFLB multiple times a day. I know that if they test me anytime within I'd say a month I will fail the drug test. Do you have any suggestions on how I should detox or attempt to get it out of my system? I am looking into getting clean piss from a friend, but I am still going out and buying a detox kit ASAP as well as loading my body with fluids. Any other suggestions guys? I've been freaking out a bit since I found out yesterday.

Instead of going the traditional route of a 4 month summer internship, I've signed on for the next 12 months, and the pay is pretty good. That means I have 4 months off for the summer of 2013 before I go back to school.

I've always wanted to travel, so this is a great opportunity. Realistically once I graduate I will have either time, or money. Not both at the same time. Furthermore I've always had an interest in Australia and New Zealand, so that's the logical destination for me.

What kind of budget am I looking at? Round trip airfare from my homebase is ~$1800-$2000, starting my journey in either Auckland, Syndey, or Bangkok. Probably want to spend 7-8 weeks total, with 3-4 weeks in SE Asia. Hostels, cheap transportation and budget everything is what I'm expecting. I want the experience, not a luxurious holiday. 

I'm also using this job to pay for at least my next year of school, so I am budget conscious, so just from my brief reading in the last week, I'm thinking somewhere between $4-5000 on top of my return airfare should be adequate. I have an acquaintance who's in Australia right now, so I'll have to talk to her about what she spent when she gets back in a month or so.

Any other tips you have for these regions? Any personal experiences you've had that I won't read in the guidebooks? I only want to peg down my start and end date, everything in between will be last minute plans, but with a few goals of what I'd like to see.

Thanks in advance!"
qyhjq,3,2012-03-15,The worst migraine nap-dream. ,lemon_SQUISH,Dreams,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/qyhjq/the_worst_migraine_napdream/,"Some background: I had just done yoga and cleaned my bathroom, and I'm dating a guy who does not have a brother in real life. I'm in Arts in school, and have never wanted to be a doctor.

Just had a nap to relieve a migraine, had a dream that spanned a total of about 5 years. I just kept flashing forward to different times in my life, and it just kept getting worse and worse. 

So in the beginning of this dream, I was studying to become a yoga master. My mentor was this mean young man, and his yoga studio was a small shack in the middle of an industrial part of town. Basically, I spent my time in this tiny little shack cleaning the bathroom. Nothing yoga related, just cleaning this decrepit little bathroom, everything was broken, and only some of the toilets flushed, and no matter how much I cleaned it, it was dirty. Then, one day, I met an old woman who was also cleaning the bathroom. She was also ""studying to become a yoga master"" in this yoga studio, but she had been cleaning the bathroom since she was my age. I realized that bathroom would never get clean, and decided to cut my losses, and become a doctor!

Fast forward, and I'm doing an internship (in a hospital in the biggest mall in NA, West Edmonton Mall), getting mentored by this awesome woman, being really successful at doctor stuff, etc. Then I look down at my abdomen, and it's huge. I realize I'm very pregnant, but my boyfriend and I have broken up a few weeks ago. 

Fast forward again, and I'm living with my ex boyfriend, his mom &amp; her boyfriend, his grandma, his sister, and his brother (who doesn't actually exist). I decided to live with them because my ex's mom and grandma wanted to help raise our baby, which meant I could continue with my internship. BUT their place is also in West Ed. Mall, you go down a hallway, and it's just this room, with a bunch of mattresses on the floor. There is no furniture or anything, just mattresses to sleep on, and I have this baby, who I HATED.

Then, back at my internship, my mentor had quit for some reason, and was replaced by an eccentric Swedish man, who claimed Swedish was the only good language in the world, and all of my reports and presentations had to be in Swedish. I live in Canada, and only know the Swedish word for ""Thanks"" so that was rough. I knew I had no chance of completing my internship, but I just kept trying and trying, translating everything I wrote to Swedish.

Fast forward again, baby is now a toddler, and she cries non stop. We are still living in our West Ed. Mall room, and I'm sitting on the floor with my crying baby. My ex comes into the room, he looks upset. ""My grandma just had a stroke"" he said, and we are all sitting on our cots. All of a sudden, his grandma looks at her left arm, and says ""fuck,"" and we all know she's having another stroke. So my ex starts freaking out, and vomiting EVERYWHERE. All over the ground, yelling the whole time. Most of the them go off to the hospital again, and I'm left with my child, my ex's brother, and vomit everywhere. My kid is playing with this glass bulb thing she found, and then she sat on my lap, and looked me, and for a split second, I loved her.

We didn't have any cleaning supplies for the vomit, so we have to bus to a different mall to get them (ex's brother didn't care that there was puke everywhere, but he had nothing better to do). The store is closing in 2 minutes, and we finally have all our supplies ready to be purchased. Ex's brother (who by the way has been a total dick this whole dream) is messing around and embarrassing me, so I playfully punch his arm. He is FURIOUS, slowly turns to me, and says quietly ""I would love nothing more than to punch you right now. Actually punch you, and cause a lot of damage. But I can't, because you're a woman. So I'm going to do something better."" And then he took all the groceries I was holding, and threw them ALL over the store. He threw them like 30 yards. Since the store was closing, I didn't have time to go around finding them, and we had to go home empty handed. He was very aware that the mess bothered me a lot, it was a dick move.

So we get home, and I just start crying. I'm basically sitting in a puddle of vomit, with a crying toddler, crying my eyes out. Ex boyfriend comes home, his grandma died at the hospital. He ask why I'm crying, and I sob out ""My life. It wasn't supposed to be like this. I was supposed to be a yoga master, but now I can't even be a doctor because I don't know Swedish!"" He comforts me, and tells me to get some sleep, and it will be better tomorrow morning. Then his fucking brother starts riding around our little room on a quad. He runs over my ex's phone, and I pick the phone up, to make sure it isn't broken. I see he has a new girlfriend, and they've been sending each other lovey dovey texts and shit. He has this new awesome life with a childless girlfriend, and I'm living in a room with no furniture, sobbing in a pool of his vomit. Then I woke up."

I am a 3rd year student (maybe 2nd year... not sure how much my first year 7 years ago counts) and have a good GPA (3.7 last semester, and over 3.5 every semester since I've returned to school). I am excellent in math and graph theory, and theoretical computer science. My applied skills are good, but I'd doubt they are outstanding (I know what I need to do... I just have to Google to find ways to do it).


I am active at my university and I have begun the school's first open source program and have done work for various people including business owners and professors.


I have friends that have told me ""If we have an internship position available, I'm sure I can get you in."" These are friends I have made over the years playing various games. Other than that, I am from a smaller town which has few opportunities working with 1 or 2 people for the summer (and I'd much rather do Google Summer of Code).


I've had projects, which I do for fun, noticed by university staff, newspapers, and even Microsoft's Channel 9.


For the life of me, I haven't been able to get an interview with a larger company. I'm not terribly interested in game design... ideally, I'd like to get an internship with a company like IBM, Google, Microsoft, Facebook, NVidia, etc.


I don't think my resume is outstanding, but it conveys what I've written here. Clearly I must do something more to get noticed. I've tried to do networking with people from my ""target"" companies, but I've not done well (though having a few conversations). 


So... any tips for getting an internship or at the very least, how to get to an interview? (Note, I am Canadian, and I am from the West Coast)"

qy62z,8,2012-03-15,On Day 2,dissucks,leaves,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/qy62z/on_day_2/,"So... I've been smoking for the past 6 six years, I'm 22 now and just about to graduate university. The past two years I've been smoking pretty much every day (usually multiple times a day, bong rips are my main method). Before that it was 4-5 times a week. I'm feeling restless, agitated, and find myself getting angry at nothing. I've taken tolerance breaks before and while they can be a bit of a nuisance, knowing that I'm not going back to my daily habit seems to make it much worse, like I'm letting these feelings get the better of me. It sucks. My mind is racing and everything I do makes me want to smoke. I just feel like this is so stupid because it's just weed. To be honest, while I'm on day two, yesterday I took an amphetamine derivate to get some work done (I like to dabble with a variety of stuff, but none of these I use regularly), so I'm not sure if it counts. I also just smoked a cigarette (I'm not a smoker, I don't really enjoy it that much), and it calmed me down a bit. Even as I write this my sentences just seem to jump from one random thought to the next.

I've always justified my heavy usage through a variety of ways. All my friends do it (this is just because I regularly hang out with potheads, my friends who aren't smokers I just see infrequently), so it never really felt like a big deal. I do well in school, but haven't really had to work that hard. My major is largely test based and mathematical, and it's always come relatively. I've been accepted at a decent grad school for good money, so it's not like weed has ruined that aspect of my life. BUT, I know I could have done so much better, done more research, gotten all A+'s, internships, etc. I operate at the minimum level to convince people that my habit (really an addiction) is not a problem. I quit my job in november because I was sick of it, and haven't really been doing much since then except finishing up 2 classes and getting high. I wanted to go travelling this summer, but I've burned through what I had saved up so I could sit at home and get high. 

Reasons I'm quitting: I feel numb, I'm not even sure if I've felt real emotions in a long time. My Grandmother died in January (I think, my memory's shit), and I didn't feel anywhere near the same as when my Grandfather died. I enjoyed smoking initially because it calmed my sixteen year-old self down and really helped with anger issues. Now want to have real, deep relationships with people. I don't want the basis of my friendships to be our co-dependent use. Honestly even my friends who aren't regular users smoke when they hang out with me, mainly because I have some and want to get high. Money, I have no idea the amount of money I've spent on pot in the past six years. If I had to guess I would say it's around 5k (maybe more), including a beautiful $250 dollar bong and my $300 vape. I don't necessarily regret the money spent, but it just seems excessive for what pot's given me. I want to get my attention span back, I used to be an avid reader, going through 2 books a week during adolescence. Now I don't read at all (I just get distracted and do something else). 

Now, I don't think cannabis is bad, or anything of that sort. I just can't have a healthy relationship with it at the moment. At some point in the future I may want to indulge occasionally (never purchase for myself), but I'm not sure if that will ever be possible. I have such fond memories of the first times I got high, and they ridiculous things we would do sneaking around to take a toke. I don't regret my decisions, but enough is enough, it's time to not be dependent on a mind-altering substance. 

As I type this there's a part of my brain telling me all of this is silly and that weed isn't the cause of how I feel. It may be right, but weed let's me avoid dealing with a lot of things I need to deal with to be a happy person. My parents always said in order to be happy with other people, you need to be able to be happy by yourself, and I've never been without Mary Jane. I could honestly type endless paragraphs about my use right now, as it's pretty much the only thing on my mind, so I'll just leave it at this.

Thanks, and reading this sub-reddit has been a huge help."

Hes in New Jersey and I'm in Florida for College, i finally have a kick ass job and am adjusted to my school, he on the other hand does nothing, hes unemployed and he doesn't even want to try to attempt going to school. He does nothing all day but hustle trees.At one moment in our relationship i broke up with him and got with someone else, he was extremely hurt but he forgave me, and has helped me out through a lot of hard times that I've been through.   Recently i have been noticing things about him that I know I dont want. Hes asked me to leave school and my job to live with him in NJ again but Im finally happy where i am now, and the city in NJ were he lives is dangerous, I feel like if i leave here im going to regret it forever. I feel like i have always known NJ guy isn't the one for me, i feel like i havent really loved him for a long time. Meanwhile i have a friend whose in europe doing an internship but we have been talking, and hes kind of what im looking for in someone, hes getting his degree he has a job and wants to better himself, hes hardworking BUT hes just a friend im not trying to get attached to someone else.Also i know Europe has other intentions, its kinda one of those get in my pants but we can still be friends kind of situation. I care so much for the guy i have been with for a while, but I feel like im letting myself drown trying to help someone who isn't trying to help himself. How do I tell him that I want to help myself, and do me. How do i tell him that the feelings just aren't there anymore?"

And in the traditional sense of drunken Wednesday stupidity (well, it's tradition to *me*), YOU should come out to a fine, classy establishment with us and get shit-faced! And also because there's no better social lubricant between a bunch of strangers that point guns at each others' faces over the internet, than grub and alcohol.

Down for it? Leave it in the comments. Add me as a friend on Steam [asdf | DRUNK]. RSVP with a wax-sealed letter. I don't care, just make it known.

**Who exactly is ""Us""?**  
If Jereair and 1nked remember, they AGREED to make this meetup happen, so this is some real-deal shit. They can't even back out now without looking like total jerks who don't want the rest of you to have a good time.

**Where are we going?**
Somewhere local that has pretty good beers and pretty good food. I'm nominating either Stone Brewery or Churchill's Pub in San Marcos. If you think you know better than me, leave it in the comments.

**When are we going?**  
Unless anyone convinces me otherwise, we should make this magic happen on the last weekend of March. Coincidentally, this is also the first weekend of April. Maybe we party so hard past midnight and this turns out to be the best weekend you've ever had in both months, simultaneously. That's a two-fer, and you'd be kicking yourself in the pants if you were to miss out on such a steal. So if you didn't buy a new calendar for 2012 yet, that's 3/31, Saturday. Let's do 7pm, because that damn daylight savings messed everything up and I like to drink as it gets dark.

**How do I get there?**  
You're a big girl, you can use the Google Maps

**What do I wear?**  
A FUCKING HAT, ARE YOU KIDDING ME? PROBABLY OTHER CLOTHES, TOO.

**TL;DR;IMSTUPID:**  
You're going to be at Stone Brewery on Saturday 3/31 at 7pm. asdf | DRUNK told you to.

**So whaddya say, tf2west? See you there?**    
Even if it's just 5 of us, it's better than hanging out on the TF2 home screen waiting for that 24/24 to say 23/24!

**EDIT 3/16:**    
CRY SOME MORE. Some of you propose next weekend, **Saturday, April 7**. I don't care the date, as long as the majority is happy and can make it. I think a Facebook event is in order? I'm not friends with any of you internet strangers so not sure of how to proceed. Should one of you be promoted to Head Event Coordinator and do all of the work at intern salary? Apply within.

Anyways, more details to those who wanted it:  
Stone Brewery for beer action at 7p, and wandering in the gardens with beers until we get over it and want to go to a place with a full bar. Stone has appetizers and stuff you can get at the bar, so if you come hungry, bank on eating this sort of stuff. If you're trying to get dinner, good luck. The kitchen is remodeling so they are PACKED. Then off to Churchill's, not too far away. There's food here too and it's pretty good. If you've never been to either, you're in for a treat, I promise. All you have to do is either like beer or not be afraid to order something new to drink. If you ask for a Budweiser, you will be escorted out of both of these establishments. Also, don't forget that we're probably going to be outside all night, so wear warm things. If you show up in full TF2 cosplay, I will pretend that I do not know you.  

Yep, those are the rules when drinking with asdf | DRUNK. But, I'm telling you all these things so you don't embarrass yourself (or me), guys. Remember last time we were all gung-ho about an idea and acted without proper planning and preparation? Yep, that's how koth_halffort got installed on this server. I'm just looking out for my peeps, ya dig?

qxkhu,3,2012-03-15,I just need to vent. This feels like a good place to do it.,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/qxkhu/i_just_need_to_vent_this_feels_like_a_good_place/,"I guess I'll start off with this. Hi. I think I have some issues that can pretty much be summed up with the term anxiety. I feel like I'm always having to prove myself to people and I get really worked up over it. School, work, relationships, driving, fitness, everything. 

This first part is mostly about troubles with my weight anxiety, understandable if you'd like to skip over it. I know I'm not fat. Im not skinny enough to be considered anarexic. Ive never really tried bulimia, but I scare myself when I start thinking about how I could make myself puke. I'm about 5'4/5"" ish. My lowest weight was 108 five years ago. I was at an equilibrium basically between 110 and 115 and cried whenever I gained an ounce. I felt my biggest when I was at 108 and my boyfriend at the time told me I had fat thighs. This was about 4 years ago, shortly after my month long experience with what I guess could be called ""exercise bulimia"", which basically meant that I would vigorously work out on the eliptical for hours a day and burn way more in that workout alone than the strict 1000 cal diet I kept myself to. I know that behavior is destructive to not only my physical health but also my mental health. I'm in a great relationship right now, my boyfriend actually says I'm too skinny and shouldn't worry. I'm obsessed with the numbers though. I decided to stop worrying about it and get it out of my head by not weighing myself every day like I used to. Until a few weeks ago, I hadn't weighed myself in a year. I don't feel like it helped however. I was absolutely terrified to go to the doctors office because I didn't want them to tell me I gained weight, which I know I had. I passed out recently from little sleep, little food, lots of caffeine and added pressures from upcoming finals. Ended up going to the emergency room and I HAD to get a checkup done at that point. I am now 119 now. That's the most ive weighed since elementary and middle school, where my highest was 124. To keep things in perspective, ive been this tall since I was about 12 or 13. I'm 20 now. I didn't tell my doctor or anyone about how upset I was and how that was probably the main cause of the episode until I got home. I guess I tried to pretend I was okay and my boyfriend could tell because as soon as he saw me he asked what was wrong. That was the first time I told him any of these problems. He was there to support me and I'm very thankful for that. I still find myself relapsing though and feeling guilty whenever I eat something that isn't a low calorie fruit or vegetable. I've been looking at thinspo a lot recently and it doesn't help. I want toget back down to 108 so bad it hurts. I want to be really fucking tiny. My logic tells me I'm being absolutely ridiculous and to stop it, but I find myself wandering I thought about it and seeing girls at my uni and thinking DAMN. I wish I were as small as you. This mindset is really destructive and I know it. I just can't help it no matter how hard I try. It usual wins over my logical side and I end up just feeling really negative. I think I may have BDD. Girls I think are my size are actually way bigger than I perceive them to be. I wear a size 3 pants. I have a friend who I thought was my same size. Turns out she's a size 9. How do I get out of this?



School stress. I'm in my second year for a Chem degree. I was always told I was smart. I know I can be pretty lazy, but I get my shit done to my best ability. I want to pursue a masters degree but I'm afraid I'm not good enough to get an internship. C+ in the first semester of ochem. Im taking the second one right now and my grade isn't that pretty so far. I want to do better, but I just feel like I can't possibly absorb any more information when I try to study. And fuck. It's a chemistry class. That's my major. Why am I struggling? There's no excuse. Especially when I don't have a job. I'm starting to think about changing my major but I don't know anything else. It would also be a huge waste of time and money spent at this point. I'm not even sure if this is what I want to do anymore, but I'm stuck. Sometimes I freak myself out and think about how easy it would be to just drop out, run away. Sometimes even driving into a wall. That really scares me. It's only for a second. I'm not suicidal. I'm just scared of the future and want an easier way to pursue it. That train of thought has only entered my mind a couple times. Mostly I'm just thinking, fuck it. Im going to beauty school and doing hair. 


I've been thinking a lot lately about my future too. I think in scared because mostly I have no idea where I'm headed. No one else thinks about it like I do, so far in advance. At least anyone that I know. They're not thinking about masters degrees, getting married, internships, careers, morgatge payments, etc. Am I the crazy one? I mean fuck, I'm only 20. Pretty much living with parents and boyfriend rent free. Why do I worry about it so much?



Edit. Adding a bit more now.
Another thing that weighs on me a lot is that I've never really felt like I've contributed anything positive or productive to the world. Like I'm just a person that's here going through life and that's all I do. I don't feel like I contribute anything to my friendships/friend group and that they could easily lose me and not care or think twice about it. I don't feel like I have anything special or extraordinary to offer to anyone. I've tried actively contributing and supporting friends and all that good stuff but I feel like it just comes off as fake when I genuinely want to make these people's lives awesome. I dont feel like I really deserve anything that I have. Friends, things, opportunities, and do on. All these things are wasted on me, who isnt spectacular or special and doesn't deserve anything. This might possibly be grammatically unsound. Forgive me. I'm tired and it's really late and I can't sleep.



I feel a lot better now. I might add more but I should really get some sleep at least. I'd be amazed if anyone read through that wall-o-text. I needed it though. Maybe a hug too. And advice if anyone's ever been here before."

As my title alludes to, I have two opportunities this summer.  One is doing research in using ontologies to model things at a small, selective, liberal arts university.  The other is as an intern, mostly on databases and small application development, at a very large, global, jack of all trades bank.

Both are rather lucrative in terms of compensation, though the bank will pay considerably more and last longer(early may through late august and possibly later if it can be arranged), and the research opprtunity will last from mid may to late july.

My game-plan for the future is to work in industry for a couple to a few years, then apply to a graduate school for a masters in game design/programming (probably). 

Any opinions on which opportunity would be the better pick?  Would an employer look more favorably on a rarer experience such as computer science research, or on a more common, but more practical experience such as interning at said global bank?  Thanks for your help in advance!"

I'm [F] 20, and he's also M[20]. 

He's had one gf which only lasted 4 months because he didn't feel the same in the end. Our relationship lasted about &lt;6 months in October. He said he wasn't sure if he wanted a relationship and basically, I was never really his gf because it was never official between that, and I was ok.

I felt the whole time, he was feeling pressured by his best guy friends to be chivalrous to me - he didn't need to be. I told him that. PDA and calling me his gf made him uncomfortable. I told him he didn't need to call me his gf (even though he did to his family...) or do PDA. I told him he didn't have to do anything that made him uncomfortable and that I just wanted him to be happy. I felt he was pressured by usual norms and trying to make me happy (in the wrong way). Originally we saw each other every 2 weeks, until we both landed an internship and were able to see each other every weekend - which I believe made him feel like I was a chore. (He said sometimes seeing his best friends is like a chore). He's told me things I don't think he's even told his best friends, and I know he has personal demons to deal with.

Long story short, after we broke up, he wouldn't leave me be. He would call me every so often on and off for a month until I told him I needed my space. Months later, he contacts me. I tell him it's not enough time and call him ignorant. Weeks later I feel bad and tell him I'm sorry; he takes it as a sign that I wanted to try being friends (it's my fault and I acknowledge it). Couldn't take it - still felt sad, mad, bittersweet and lonely memories whenever he was in my life. Told him /I/ couldn't be his friend and I needed space. 

Weeks later, he called and asked if it was ok he attended a mutual friend of ours party, where he knew I would be (I said yes). We did not talk too much, but we talked. Recently, he contacted me. I told him he is not allowed. Ended up crying and calling him on the phone, telling him he couldn't call... but then it ended up being I didnt' want to hang up and nor did he, so we talked on the phone. I told him I missed him and he said he did too. And he said he felt like he needed to check up on me every so often, and it wasn't pitying me and that he felt lonely. 

/r/relationships, my heart wants to ask him for another chance. I want to be with him, I want him to take away my loneliness, and I want to take away his. I want to help him through his demons. I felt like with him, it added more of a meaning to my life, and I wasn't depressed (which I have) - I was happy for 4 months straight (until it started getting bad). I felt like I became someone I really liked around him. And I know he doesn't have that many people to talk to. I've dated someone since our breakup, but there were no sparks like there was with him.
Isn't it to love someone to accept them for their flaws? I get it now, I understand he's introverted and that he likes his space. I understand he felt pressured. I am willing to be prepared for this now.Nothing worse can happen, we already lost each other. He was one of very, very, few that knew me well enough, inside out.

Reddit, what do I do? Am I being foolish and just lonely? Should I man my ground and stay away? Or should I follow my heart?"
qx1bs,3,2012-03-14,"Is it wrong of me to drop an accepted internship for another, much, much better internship?",DrFuManchu,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/qx1bs/is_it_wrong_of_me_to_drop_an_accepted_internship/,"I accepted an internship for this upcoming summer from Company A at the end of November. I did this because I have no confidence in myself and thought I should take what I can get now, rather than wait for other better offers. I received emails from Company B about interviewing with them while they were on campus in February, and I took the interview because I thought it would be harmless and a very good experience since they give technically demanding interviews. I did unexpectedly well and received an offer from them. I wouldn't normally consider reneging, but the new offer is *far* superior. They provide incredible pay, housing and transportation support, and look really good on a resume (everyone knows the name of this company). It's an unbelievable opportunity.

Company A provides no housing or transportation support, which is a major issue for me since I will have to buy a car and find a place to live in a city I don't know. I knew this was an issue when I signed, though.

Extra points to consider:

* It has been a few months since I accepted, but still a few months till summer
* Company A may have a hard time finding a replacement since they were searching early on
* There's definitely no public transportation option at Company A's office
* Company A gave me a choice of which office to work at, but after choosing the office they forced me to a different office. This happened immediately after I accepted
* I have spoken to a school adviser. He said, essentially, that there won't be any side effects of breaking off the offer other than I likely won't be hired by them in the future (I'm ok with this), but it will be hard for them to find a replacement and he can't officially advise me to renege on an offer.
* Neither company knows I interviewed with the other. If I have to break it off, I would in no way tell them that it's because I'm going to another company
* This is my last summer to intern
* I understand that what I'm doing is likely very much frowned upon in professional ethics

Here's my main questions to you all:

* What would you do if you were me?
* Do I have an ethical obligation to Company A? Companies are willing to cut employees, and people interview for other jobs while hired all the time, but for some reason doing this on an internship feels extra wrong.
* If I break off the internship with Company A, how should I tell them? Send a general but apologetic email? Call the HR person who gave the offer? I don't owe them the full story, and it would complicate the issue to tell more than is necessary.
* How would you feel if you were the HR person dealing with a dropped intern?

I should note that I am leaning towards Company B, but I can be persuaded.
Thank you for any response at all, I am extremely conflicted and need objective help.

r01uq,0,2012-03-16,Advice for an undergrad student needed,avanish11,neuro,https://www.reddit.com/r/neuro/comments/r01uq/advice_for_an_undergrad_student_needed/,"Hi, I'm currently a sophomore at a community college, and I'm interested in entering the neuroscience/cogsci/psych fields, and would like some advice on just about everything.

First, some background: I did fairly well in high school, I had a 3.75 GPA, 1800 SATs, 30 ACTs, and I took 5 AP classes (most of which I scored a 4 or higher). Last year, I went to Drexel University in Philadelphia for a computer science major. Long story short, I hated my major and wasn't used to the amount of freedom I was given, and ended up with a 2.0 GPA that year. I ended up transferring to a local community college (general studies major). I took humanities, philosophy, and social science classes. My GPA last semester was 3.6, and I expect to do at least as well this semester. 

I'm planning on transferring to a 4 year school in the fall for either neuroscience or cognitive science. I'm applying to these schools: Temple University, Fitchburg State, Emory, Trinity College, Western Washington University, and Warner Pacific College. 

After undergrad, I'm planning on going to graduate school or medical school for something brain-related, possibly neuroscience, psychopharmacology, or psychiatry. I haven't made up my mind yet because I don't have any experience in the field. 

This is why I want to do an internship (in any cog/neuro/psych field) this summer, but have no idea where to begin searching for one. Any thoughts?

Also, I was wondering if there's anything I should know before entering the field, or if anyone has advice in general about undergrad, grad school, applying, etc. Any help would be appreciated. Thank you!"

I am primarily interested in working in either a financial services sector or a software development division, but I am open to other fields. I have a 4.0 GPA in major and am willing to relocate if the internship is paid. 

One of my greatest strengths is my quantitative skills. I have a good record in mathematics, having tested out of multiple classes at my university as well have won first in a variety of university-sponsored competitions. I ascribe my success in this subject to my long-formed pursuit in the content of numbers predicting and mapping the world. I believe that my drive will materialize into my work, producing excellent results.

In addition, I am fluent in English and advanced in Spanish. I also am proficient and have programing experience with a variety of computer languages such as Java, OCaml, and a few others. I reinforce this statement with my 4.0 GPA in Computer Science. I believe that by learning advanced calculations and computer languages, one also receives insight into possible applications and predictions. Therefore, I believe my programming and high calculation experiences are an important asset I have.

I am able to provide my resume and additional information upon request to continue the process.

qzuz1,7,2012-03-16,Questions for IOS engineer/developer,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/qzuz1/questions_for_ios_engineerdeveloper/,"Hello, 

I want to be an ios engineer but I don't have much experience. 
I went to school for a computer science degree (graduated in June). I did not intern anywhere because of my immigration issue at the time (couldn't get a work permit). 
I just got this resolved recently and looking for a job now. 
I didn't have any formal experiences but I have done some game programming side project and websites.


After college, I taught myself objective c, xocde, xcode interface builder and worked on an iphone app. It's a very simple app that counts scores for magic the gathering game. I downloaded a bunch of other similar free apps and improved mine to have better usability and nicer graphic. 
I released the app and it got about 1000+ something download in the first month or so. 
I then moved on to make a 2D game with cocos2d. The finished project was not that fun for me to play and I just decided not to release it.  
I also used Instruments to detect memory leaks, just to learn how to use the tool. 

I found ios developing to be pretty fun relative to other things and I think I would find my career more rewarding.

My question to you is :

- How did you become a developer?

- Is there a chance that I can get started without experience? How do I make myself stand out for entry-level positions? 

- While I am unemployed, what more about ios should I learn? What skills are particularly useful for an ios developer to have? What skills are valued by the employers?

- Other comments? I really, really, really want to make this happen. 

Thank you guys =)

qzqr2,9,2012-03-16,Graduating in May. I have no real projects of my own. Better to work on some after I graduate before entering the workforce?,SnailHunter,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/qzqr2/graduating_in_may_i_have_no_real_projects_of_my/,"I'm graduating with my BS in CS this May. I always hear people saying that you should have a portfolio of all the projects you've worked on in your spare time, and that employers really look for that kind of stuff.  I've had two internships, but I haven't really done any projects on my own. 

 I would like to make some of my own mobile apps (as I already have some experience doing this with internships), but right now I'm way too busy with school. Would it be better to take some time off after I graduate to work on some project of my own that I would be proud of before I start interviewing for jobs? More importantly, does it look bad to employers if they see that you took time off after you graduated instead of getting a job right away? What if I wanted to take a year off to travel, for instance? Would this hurt me?

The big reason I really haven't done much in my spare time is that, for one, I didn't even know how to program before I began my CS degree. And for two, the little spare time I've had while pursing this degree has been spent socializing to ensure I keep some semblance of sanity. I think the biggest reason though is that I just wasn't experienced enough to even consider making something interesting on my own. As a senior, I definitely feel ready to make some things on my own now, and I really want to. I started working on something during spring break, but now that school's back I just don't have the time. 

So, to summarize my question, would it better to take some time off after I graduate (maybe a few months or more), or perhaps just work part time, so I can work on a project of my own that I could be proud of and show off to employers? Does it look really bad if I have nothing to show except the stuff that I did in my internships (which isn't really that interesting)?

Also, what should I even say if an employer asks me about my own projects and I don't really have any?"

For the summer, I would like to find a job or internship related to computer science in order to get my feet wet in the field and use the summer productively (for financial aid reasons, I cannot take classes in the summer).

Where should I look? Or am I out of luck until I have some classes and skills under my belt?

 If I can't find a job in the field, I plan on finding any part-time job I can, and then using my free time to learn programming languages. I already know basic python and plan on continuing to study that more. What else would be most useful for me to start on?"
qzfei,24,2012-03-16,My Job Bridge Internship is a disaster,inverse87,ireland,https://www.reddit.com/r/ireland/comments/qzfei/my_job_bridge_internship_is_a_disaster/,"Hi all. I'm pretty sure I spoke here about my internsip in the past. Yesterday I decided to give it up. I was hired as an intern to build a website and do general IT admin for a company. Getting the website built was supposed to be my top priority but this wasn't exactly easy given the very slow pace of feed back I was getting from management.

By the end of December and the start of January I had provided them with everything the required and the general manager was happy with it. Then everything slowed down even more, the website was ready to go online I was just waiting for the go ahead which I never got.

So yesterday evening before I left I was turning off all the computers in the office. One of the managers had left their email open and a few other windows. As I was closing them I noticed a website template using graphics and images that I had made for the company website.

I know it wasn't the most professional thing to do but I had a look through all this stuff just to see what was going on. From what I can see The company I work for has been dealing with another web design company to build a website for them also!
So for the past two months or so I've been sitting at my desk like an idiot while they have hired someone else to do my job. I was never told about any of this. Whenever I asked about the progress of my project I was just told to work away at it and they would deal with it when they had time! 
I don't understand it if they weren't happy with it why wasn't I told? and why did they tell me to keep working at my project when they already have made up there mind to go with someone else?
I've no idea where I stand in any of this but I'm not very happy with the whole situation and I see no reason why I should go back on Tuesday.

qz1s2,1,2012-03-16,"A final, humble, plea.",[deleted],SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qz1s2/a_final_humble_plea/,"TLDR at bottom, but it really lobotomies the story of my situation.

Most of my life I've been completely miserable. I don't really know why, I just always feel alone, even with my best of friends at times. In high school I thought I was a complete loser...even as I walked off the field being crowned homecoming king. I always felt like an idiot even though I walked in late to my act without a calculator or a god damn clue and wound up with a 31 and used that to segue my way into a full ride scholarship, not to bad for an idiot I thought. I got to school and got heavy into drugs. They made me happy. They were not to be my ultimate problem though. That would be my parents.

They are divorced, have been since I was 4 weeks old. Dads rich, moms poor, lived with mom, visited dad, that old story.

I am at msu in my second semester, spring 2010. A bad LSD trip has convinced me to profess my hidden/repressed feelings for my best friend. She makes me feel like no body else can or will. Let me rephrase this again, more clearly; the only times in my adult life that I have been happy, were because this person, and this person alone, was simply there, talking to me, and genuinely caring that I existed.  She feels the same towards me, and I get to spend the greatest time of my life with her. Things are great. I'm getting off drugs, im happy, truly happy, and at peace with myself and others for the first time in my life. Fast forward one month. I get sick.I have to go home on medical leave, we end up taking a break, mutually, I'm so sick I can't leave the bed. The doctors say its mono. I cry in front of my mom over my loss of my new found happiness and love and she sends me to a psych ward. I get out 3 days later. I see a psych, get put on every medication you can name, get my sanity and mind pushed through zaps, loops, to the very edge. I get back to school in the fall. Things between me and the only girl I will ever love (20 since none come close) questions my sanity and is seeing someone. I drink heavily and fail. Get pulled out of school by dad. At this point he was running my finances, paying my bills. I thought he had control of my tuition grant. Nope, he just forged my name and lied, forcing me to come home, and go to community college for the past year and work for him full time, because he knows I don't have the will to do anything about it anymore.

My mom tried to kill herself last year. Luckily I was home, and with my encyclopedic pharmacology knowledge I knew I could stabilize her long enough until the emt got there, she ended up totally fine. She hated me for it. He wanted her friend to save her. Her friend never showed up, or if she did, it would have been much too late. A month after that I had to sleep outside. My mother, the one I saved, was going to press assault charges, for yelling at 1am when I woke up to her screaming at my poor crying sister balled up on the kitchen floor ""you are not sending my sister to the nut house and fucking her life up like you did mine because you are tired of being a mom"". She called her bf crying saying I was going to hit her then 911 and said out now. Had fun explaining to dad why I was leaping on the lawn o dad when he picked me up for work.

Oh yea, and those psych ward and psych visits? My mom hid the bills from me. My credit is shit and I'm still in debt. I honestly should have watched the bitched choke on her vomit. I'd be happier too, yea I'm fucked in the head, but you would be too if your mom left you with a babysitter that just locked you in the hallway closet screaming for fucking hours.

So here I am. I got my own apt and car now. Most if not all my friends have abandoned me, or ignor me, the girl of my dreams is now my long distance ex girlfriend I will never get over, and I haven't felt a happy or non-alone moment since I left college freshman year. I wake up every day wondering what I did to deserve this. I look at me, and my mom. I try to do the right thing every day, my mom throws m under a bus for a hundred bucks. She owes me her life and she fucking hates me. She's evil and does nothing but wrong, used that suicide attempt to guilt trip her new husband to the altar and is on her honeymoon in the virgin islands now. Me? The one responsible for letting her have all that? What good karma reward do I get? To wake up every day crying. Take orders from my fucked up family, at their ass backwards company, doing a job that anyone lse would get paid 6x the amount, but I get minimum wage to make web pages, owners manuals build machines, order parts, find new, cheaper parts, fix the network, all shit these old, technologically impaired ppl cannot do without huge outsourcing costs.

Here's the icing on the shit cake of my life. The girl I keep talking about visited over spring break. It was great to see her again and talk. It was kinda awkward, but in a good sense, if that even makes sense. Anyway, I get to saying how after ll this fucking shit I'll finally be able to get back on track and to school in the fall. Well fuck my face, she is moving back here in the fall to do her internship at our old high school. Fan. Fucking. Tas tick.


Now, I'm a logical man, I know there is probably no one who gives a fuck to read all that, and I dont blame you, you got your own problems and that shit is depressing, so let me try to tldr this, because I need help so bad reddit, and I've gone to th best, and the rest, it's up to you and me. This ldr is a gross oversimplification but,

TLDR: I was forced fom the love of my life by my parents, and I will never find anyone close to her, or get over her. I may significantly alter my long term life goals if I can still get her back, but I don't even know how she really feels now. She's the only person/thing that ever made me feel happy, or loved,or wanted, or like I fit in. She's the only reason I wake up and go through hell every day, crying, in complete agony. Without the hope of her, I'd kill myself right now. I know how wrong that I, but it's true, and no amount of drugs, legal or not, therapy, anything, has been able to change that, no matter how hard I try, no matter how much I want it to. Please help me not be that crazy guy that kills himself over a girl that doesn't want him reddit, idk if that's the case, but it may be, I'm so alone, just, please help me :("

I remember while in 5th and 6th grade going to bed and thinking of killing myself. I am a junior in college now. I have cut myself, I have tried to hang myself, I have punched myself, I have tried to over dose, and so on. 

I got a job once I turned 16. I was working 40+ hours a week up until college. This just made it worse. I didn't make many friends at school since I was always working. It was a shitty Subway/DQ job. I worked there up until college, then worked there over the next summer. Always 40+ hours a week. Last summer I got a different job since I didn't want to go back. This time at a deli. Was working 40+ hours a week all summer with people I hated. Just as bad as the other. 

Now for this summer. I am a Mathematics major and I have applied to countless internships, 10+ REU programs and I know I won't hear back from any of them. I have decent grades, but I'm not a minority, or female. Just an average white guy. My girl friend applies to two things and hears back that she is in an REU a month later. I will have to go back to working another 40+ hours a week this summer and hating myself every second of it. 

I have seen counselors at my school, I have seen one outside, I have been on three different anti-depressants, and nothing has worked. I can't put up with any of this anymore. "

r0kwt,2,2012-03-17,My ex and I broke up over a year ago but are still in love and loyal to each other...,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/r0kwt/my_ex_and_i_broke_up_over_a_year_ago_but_are/,"This is my first reddit post..I've been lurking for a while. I guess this is also a throwaway account. 

I could write a whole lot to recap our relationship and explain things but I'll try to keep it as short as possible.

Ex and I were really in love...dated over a year. Broke up last February. We are 23. 

Ex and I both got really stressed out towards the end of college. He was stressed out/depressed about family issues and about finding a job.

I was experiencing some EXTREMELY difficult emotional issues that were in part triggered by our relationship and in part triggered by my family. Traumatic things happened to me in my childhood and I kind of relived the emotions sometimes in our relationship--not my ex's fault, but because I never got therapy to really heal. I would hide my pain from him because I didn't want to burden him with talking about it for the thousandth time, and I would grow really depressed and irritable. Seriously, although I was in love with him it was a dark time for me and it had a strain on our relationship. This coupled with things currently happening with my family were putting me through some unbearable emotions. 

Ex also had his shortcomings, although was all around a good boyfriend. I think some of the inconsiderate things he did were largely exasperated by my emotional state and kind of snowballed into bigger problems than they needed to be. 

Ex decided things couldn't continue like this and spontaneously, without thinking for things longer than half a day, decided we needed to end things. He claimed that I wasn't losing him but he didn't want our relationship to be completely ruined. I sobbed, assuming no man would break up with me unless he didn't want me anymore, and left, completely heartbroken, unable to talk about things.

We kept in touch (he always calls me every day, no matter what)--although I tried to cut off contact numerous times, convinced he must not be in love with me anymore or not desire me anymore. I was unable to really stick to my guns for any significant length of time. I felt like the breakup was a blow to my self esteem, like I had been ""demoted"" from girlfriend to....who knows. He says that is ridiculous.

For the most part we talk every day, just as we did when we were together.

We have both been 100% loyal to each other sexually and emotionally since we broke up. A few times, in an emotionally charged moment, I've told him we should see other people and he says he doesn't want to, but if I feel like I need to go on dates, he won't like it but he can't stop me, but he won't date. 

Six months after we broke up he moved back home to a city a few hours away. After we broke up we were seeing each other about once a month. Since he moved, we don't see each other more than every few months. This is mostly because he is completely broke, and even his car has been wrecked (long story). We are both trying to get off our feet, I'm starting grad school in a few months, and he is preoccupied with an internship and living with his parents.

A few months after we broke up I started crying and asked why we couldn't be together and he said he felt extremely stressed about finding a job and he felt the timing was off. He said he didn't think we should restart our relationship until we could really sort things out and start off on the right foot.

I am now in therapy. I realized I really needed to fix my emotional traumas and I realize now just how much our relationship was affected by my traumatic past. I talk to him about my therapy and he is supportive.

I offered to drive to see him this weekend (I haven't offered to do that before). He was happy and excited about it, even though I felt a bit awkward about staying with him at his parent's house since i'm his ex girlfriend. 

It was going to happen but last minute there was a death in the family. He calls me and I am there to support him. We are still just as close as ever..we just aren't as affectionate as we used to be even though the feelings are there. We are more reserved now. We don't call each other ""baby"" like we did every day. We don't discuss how bad we want each other sexually on a regular basis. We don't say we love each other on a regular basis although we both acknowledge that we do. We've recently talked about how we should start making the effort to see each other more often and spend some quality time together again, although this won't be easy, for obvious reasons.

 I know it seems obvious that he still loves me and wants to be with me but do you have any insight or advice? I want to be with him although I acknowledge that this is an inconvenient time period in both of our lives for a relationship. I'm glad we still talk but sometimes when I think about how things used to be, and how affectionate we were when we were together..it hurts.

r0kt8,1,2012-03-17,Recent high school grad outperforms two msft programmers,[deleted],talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/r0kt8/recent_high_school_grad_outperforms_two_msft/,"It was the summer of 1996.

My dad got me a job as an ""engineering intern"" at an avionics company that built computers that would be installed in airplanes (i.e., Data Flight Recorders, among other components).  Their main product was a ""data loader"", a $100k system that works as a CD-ROM drive for these computers (loads data not 640MB optical disks and then inserted into these computers).

The main problem was the proprietary programs worked on this computer, but an easy-to-use menu needed to be built for integration purposes (to have a complete product).  Two former Microsoft programmers were tasked with writing this menu program and came up with an issue.  Although these proprietary programs worked, the menu program exceeded the 640K limit for using base memory and would cause the entire system to crash.

Learning most of my skills from changing key bindings in DOS (as practical jokes), I was able to create a .BAT file that used colors in the background and could make a finished product.  Granted, it was text-based and used ANSI color schemes, the current product the MSFT programmers had looked no better.  And as my script was a .bat file, it took no memory overhead.

I felt really bad after the fact as the asshole boss fired both of the programmers for incompetence.  I went to college and found a different career.  However, I heard one of them made a lot of money from creating a key innovation in VOIP, so perhaps I won't feel too bad.

The main reason why I'm posting this story is to remind people that 640K was almost more than enough memory that was needed at one time.  I'm sure people who have been in computers longer will say 64K was adequate--or the space on a punchcard."

I, from what I've heard, think that the environment at UCSC is the best suited for me, and that the experiences and education I would get there would dwarf those at nearly any other university.

Right now I'm a student. I'm in my 4th year in a very difficult major at a good university, so I have to spend a lot of time studying. I'm also an intern at one of the largest corporations, and I have a job lined up after graduation. So, while future prospects look good, I'm poor as fuck right now. My parents are just as poor as me, so I can't ask for money. I'm living in a super small studio apartment and live very frugally, so I get by. 

My girlfriend is currently in school too, but she lives with her family. They're really abusive and she wants to move out, but her internship is unpaid, so she's poorer than me and can't afford to. Her family often kicks her out then forget about their argument after a week and let her move back in. During those few days, she usually crashes with me. It gets soooo cramped, but she's got nowhere else to go, so I'm fine with it.

The problem is that she eats all my food. I live off of beans, rice, eggs, and ramen noodles. I can't afford to feed us both, even if it's just one week a month. I'm perfectly ok with her staying with me, but I really need her to throw in a few bucks for food or buy her own.

How do I ask this? I don't want her to think I don't care about her or make her feel unwelcome, and she probably doesn't have a few bucks anyway.

tldr: I'm poor. My girlfriend is poor. Sometimes she stays with me. She eats all my food. I want her to pay for it. How do I ask her?"

It is too porous and risks contamination! I have began collecting stone bricks and glass to rebuild parts of the damaged SeaLab and would ask any collaborators to remember to sterilize their building materials with fire before use!  Safe materials are: Stone, Stone Brick, Brick, Glass, Obsidian, Lapis Lazuli, Iron, Gold, Diamond.

That said, the Op. could use as much sand, glass, stone, stone bricks, cobble and coal as any of our interns or allies can spare.  We are not actively rebuilding the SeaLab as priority 1, but we are interested in stabilizing the structure so that we may re-open it to the public -- even if official Op. experimentation moves to our SkyLab.

As the title says, I have been living in a medium sized city in Sweden all my life. I am 26 years old, in january 2013 I will have completed my education at my local uni.

I have about five years of work experience (retail) along with five years of studying to become a teacher in secondary school. Now the thing is I want to get away from my hometown and I have always wanted to go to the United States. As for time frame I was thinking that I'd like to be away for a year or so.

I'd like to consider myself employable. however, I realize that I can't just get a job since I am not a citizen so I was thinking along the lines of getting an internship somewhere. The job does not matter.

I could also see myself taking some classes, but I am already in debt from studying five years here in Sweden. It is not a big debt, but I have used up my student loan quota.

The reason I want to go i simple. I'd really like to visit the US to get a feel for the culture and meet the people, broaden my views. I think it would make me a better teacher in the end (Social Sciences and English).
On a more personal note, I am tired of doing the same thing day in and day out, meet the same people. My week is basically work, study, party, (occasionally) meet girls and it is killing my soul. I want to do something more stimulating. Call it my own personal journey or something crappy like that.

It might be a bit naive of me to think that going to the US is possible for me, but one can dream right?
Oh, and if there are any unmarried american female redditors looking for a blond blue eyed swede with an accent, maybe we could make an anchor viking baby :)

So what are my options?

Thank you beforehand for any advice!

I want to go to the US to work or study, what are my options? Thanks!"

I'm looking for some advice.  Even an answer like ""You're asking for too much."" helps me.  I just need some perspective and advice.


First, here are a few observations I have made about my city.  

We are an ""engineering city"" with a decent amount of tech jobs.  Many of these revolve around government contracts.  In order to win these contracts, it seems that the employers are only hiring more senior levels or helpdesk with little to no juniors.  Companies here are not wanting to train anyone.  They just want someone who can walk in and do the job.  


I've had multiple companies fly me in for interviews.  I've fielded call after call from recruiters out of state, but I can't seem to get anything going in my own city.  


A little background on me.  I am currently working in a web hosting tech support position while finishing the last semester of my degree.  I have worked co-ops and internships all throughout college, and have about four years of total IT experience from these positions.  I'm kind of a generalist, which is why I had my degree focus in information security.  I'm trying to really land a good junior sysadmin position and really expand my learning.


I've been running little servers at home for years - asterisk, BSD file servers, LAMP, Active Directory, NAS boxes, and the like.  It's hard for me to learn something just to learn it, so I come up with a way I can incorporate it into my home network to make it run more like an enterprise.  This has worked with great results for the most part.  These are things that my college degree aren't going to teach me.  


Now, I'm trying to get to that next level, but I'm having trouble out of most companies.  I actually have a job offer.  It's what I want to be paid out of school, and it's significantly more than my current job and the co-ops I've worked for around $15 / hour.  The job really calls for an IT generalist, but is going to require a lot of moving around -- every two years on average.  I'm actually wondering why this company is willing to ""take a chance"" on me when I get cold shouldered by the rest.  


Here is what I don't want - I don't want another tech support position.  I can post my resume if it'll help, but I really think I have experience beyond the support desk.   Am I asking too much to want to be hired into a junior sysadmin position, considering I will be fresh out of college?  Is the formula of being hired into tech support and moving up after a few years the way I am going to have to go?  Should I just shut up and take the good offer I'm given out of state?  


I would seriously appreciate some sage advice here.  Most of the people here are on experience levels I only hope to be on one day."
r1fwb,13,2012-03-17,Is it a smart idea for me to purchase company stock in my current situation?,wolfbaden6,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/r1fwb/is_it_a_smart_idea_for_me_to_purchase_company/,"I currently purchase company stock offered through an employee stock purchasing plan, but after reading through the advice, I'm somewhat leery of it. Here's my current situation:

- Will be graduating college this May
- No student debts/loans to pay back
- No credit card debt
- I owe my parents money for a car they helped me purchase 2 years ago. They gave me a 36-month repayment plan and I have 11 more months to go
- My only other bills I have are monthly cell phone bills and those run me $30/month
- I commute to and from school once a week, and I drive to and from work about a few times a week, so I'm spending about $40/week in fuel costs

I make about $500 every other week and from that $500, I have $70 automatically taken out for company stock. My employer also provides me with an additional 15% of my $70, so I'm getting $80.50 in company stock every other week.

I don't have any emergency fund saved up. Due to some lengthy periods of poor spending habits and a few unpaid internships with fairly large expenses attached, I have only just now begun to get back on my feet financially.

Should I continue to purchase company stock? I work for a massive, stable company, so I have no fears that the price of stock will suddenly take a dive. I'm just wondering if what I'm doing is smart, or if I should stop and really just start saving?"

r47du,2,2012-03-19,"Student-teacher, feeling anxious",[deleted],Teachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/r47du/studentteacher_feeling_anxious/,"So I am a 22year old ESL teacher in the second year of my university's program, and today it was my first time teaching a whole class using my own planning. There is another 3 weeks left in my practicum.

It's not that it went badly today... It went pretty good actually, considering the lack of planning I had done. I had a 15-20 minutes class-discussion with them about Kony 2012, then I made them watch a 20minute video, had a discussion on it and introduced The Debate, which is what I'll be working with for the next 3 weeks with 3 different groups.

Here is my problem... Even if everything went well (my associate teacher told me I had a good presence, seemed confident and everything, just lacked planning and preparation and it showed a bit), I'm still really stressed out about the three weeks ahead, but even more about the real world. I'm double-guessing my profession, and wonder if I'd be happier doing something else. I've never felt like this, but the anxiety I'm feeling towards this internship is bringing me down.

Anyone felt anxious for no apparent reasons on their first REAL internship? I feel that if I connected with my students better most of the stress would go away... I don't have the connection with them I thought I would. Anyone has any tips or any advice for me, or just anything to cheer me up? 

My groups are all 10th grade french kids, who have very VERY limited English. I HAVE to speak in English at all times and sometimes it's very hard to make myself understood."

I got my award letter today, and thinks are looking grim. My family and I would have to pay $11,000 out of pocket and get $22,000 a year in loans ever year, which we may not be able to do.

Which means that I will probably have to begrudgingly accept my full ride scholarship at NIU. However, I really, really do not want to go to NIU for a wide variety of reasons (Liberal arts degree, don't like the companies that hire from them, lack of challenge, I'd be in the top 5% of students there, classes I could just as easily find at ITT Technical Institute, crappy campus, etc). I visited the U of I campus and fell in love immediately. :/

So, I was wondering how you all pay for college. Loans? Scholarships? Paid internships? Work study? And for computer science people specifically, is your program worth the extra $120,000 I would have to pay to attend it?

Edit: Thanks for all of the advice guys! I'll figure some way to work it out. Another question, how much do CS internships pay over a summer? How early can you get them? My understanding is that the earliest they come is the summer before junior year. Thanks again."

I go to school at UF, and got an opportunity to do an internship for a Kentucky Circuit judge (essentially just a trial judge), as a sure thing, living with my fiancee and her family. Essentially, no major costs of living there, no income either (though I do get credit hours).

Alternately, I have a few upcoming interviews for attorney's offices here in Florida where I live, which would again incur no major costs of living there, with no income either. However, I do not have anything locked down as of yet. 

I don't have family in Florida, so I worry that being able to display strong ties to the state may be a challenge for OCI interviews for my 2L year. Would going for the 1L position in KY harm my FL prospects in any material way? I need to decide this week, before I'd know the outcome of my interviews here.

I'm in my 2nd year of Computer Science, and I've applied to a few internships, and not got any. I have the impression that this is because I don't have any work experience (no part time jobs or previous internships).

What could I do to help fill that gap to hopefully get me a summer internship? I was thinking that contributing to something opensource may work (I use Freemind a lot, so I was going to go for that).

Any advice would be appreciated."

Needless to say, a lot was on my mind. I went in at the earliest possible time to sign up today, got there well before anyone else, and I walked out with three guaranteed interviews.

On its own, that would be pretty great. HOWEVER, the head of my program who was there in charge of signup pulled me aside before I left and said: ""You're a good man, CriticalDerp. A sharp man. Good things are coming your way. You just have to have all your ducks in a row, and I think you're doing just that.""

Ho. Lee. Fuck. Massive confidence boost right there on top of finally getting an interview. Gonna celebrate tonight with all kinds of LoL, Guild Wars, and pretty much everything I can conceivably do with my boy. ;3"

r3wil,3,2012-03-19,"About to change my major, tell me if I'm crazy.",Dancetrooper,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/r3wil/about_to_change_my_major_tell_me_if_im_crazy/,"So I've had my heart set on being a Computer Engineer since high school. The curriculum so far is great. Programming isn't exactly my strong suit, but it's a valuable skill and I'm glad to know more than the average college student.  I love the hardware aspect of my major, and I'm much better at the electrical engineering side than the computer science.

But there seems to be this problem when I try to go out and find internships or even have casual conversations with people about what I'm doing in school.  When I'm speaking with employers, a lot of them have a hard time understanding what computer engineering is. Maybe I just get the herps and derps of recruiting, but this problem has come up enough as to where I'm probably going to switch to Electrical Engineering.

When I talk to anybody, the conversation goes something like:

Me: ""I'm a sophomore in computer enginee...""

Recruiter: ""OH SO COMPUTER SCIENCE K WE WANT ELECTRICAL ENGINEERS, LATER""

Me: ""No actually, most of my curriculum is electrical engineering classes, and it really only differentiates itself from electrical engineering during the last few semesters of school.""

At that point, they kind of understand, but seem to still be confused or horrified by what I'm doing, and continue to assume that I sit in front of a computer and program all day. I'm convinced that Electrical Engineering with a minor in Computer Science would be a significantly better choice, and it will clear up the confusion people are having with what I'd like to do upon graduation.

For the summer, I took a full-time research job at my university instead of an internship. This may or may not have been a horrible idea, but once I officially switch my major, I'll have to stay in school an extra semester or two and figure I can make up for the lost internship/co-op during that time. I didn't want to take a computer science internship, which is basically all that was available to me. I feel as though electrical engineering positions will be given to electrical engineers, and computer science positions will be given to computer scientists(and I feel like the computer science positions are much more abundant).

Anyway Reddit, this might be a rash decision, but I want people to know that I'm more interested in hardware and electrical engineering than computer science. I was hoping to get some feedback on whether or not this is a bad idea, or if other people have had the same problem."

I have looked at the Google Summer of Code program from [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/r19tn/what_should_i_be_doing_right_now_with_regards_to/), but I do not know if I can commit 40 hours a week this summer.

My tips for freshman/sophomores is to apply, apply, apply! I didn't meet the requirements for my school's internship program, but I just applied to a bunch of companies directly even when I didn't have ALL the qualifications.  I carefully drafted individualized cover letters to the internships and individual companies where I tried to highlight my skills that would apply to the specific job. I also included many of the words in the job description in my cover letter and resume in order to get past filters since I was primarily applying to large companies. 

I also have a blog that highlights my writing skills and some projects that I'm doing outside of my school curriculum. 

I hope this helps any other students looking for internships! I don't have offers yet, but I'm confident in my interviewing skills. Now to find a cute suit and pair of heels for the interview!! "

I used it to collect the usernames of people who had commented on my videos or my channel but hadn't subscribed. I sent them a message thanking them, and asking to subscribe if they liked it. I sent out about 1200 messages but stopped after a while because it was a very buggy program, and it had very very low yield. So, no... I wouldn't recommend spamming random people.

Hello. I have been reading and learning about the Russian Revolution and other revolutions. Its seems to me that the use of Red Terror was a serious violation in Human Rights. Then I began to think about my own definition of Human Rights and Morality. If I have been raised in a Capitalist Environment, then have I grown up have those views ingrained in myself. That is, do I have a Capitalist view of Morality and Human Rights?

It is here I must ask you this:

Is it possible to have a successful revolution (I am not going to define how this is carried out, only that after the revolution, The Workers own the Means of Production, or some governmental system is in place to eventually achieve that goal) with out violating Human Rights via Terror etc?

Is the notion of Human Rights a Capitalist ploy?

What is a Socialist Morality? Does Socialism have a ""ends justify the means"" morality?

Is it right to torture, summarily execute, or intern Capitalists?

Thank you for your responses. This post doesn't have some sort of Anti-Socialist agenda, I am merely trying to find answers to my questions.

This post is also rather vague. This is on purpose. I want to get as many responses and as widely a variety as I can. Please, I want to hear from all the Socialists (Marxists, Leninists, Trotskyists.. etc... etc).

Quick Edit: What I meant, is that I want to hear from all shades of Socialism.

Is it appropriate to submit this link as it's the only thing I have, or would it just be wasting HRs time?  

Part of me thinks it's better than nothing, but the other part says it really isn't relevant at all.  

PS This is for an entry level position, if that matters.  My only ""real"" work experience is from an internship I had before, but also with largely unrelated work.  

Thanks for any input!

Bonus Question:  I've read differing opinions on having Objectives in resumes.  Me personally, I try to use to just get one little ounce of ""hey I researched your company in there"" by putting like... ""Analyst position with company xiu, using a passion for marketing to *reach new customers by employing innovative strategies*.""

I would like to move somewhere to Western or Central continental Europe (who doesn't?), though honestly I don't care if it's Australia instead. I hear good things about the netherlands.

I've spent 6 years of my life in Germany (I was a bosnian war refugee) before coming to the US. I have relatives (not immediate family, but plenty of blood-relatives) in Germany, Bosnia, and Croatia. I used to be fluent in german, but I still have intermediate language skills and could pick it up very quickly if I were to try learning again. I frequently travel abroad and I've spoken to many friends, strangers, and relatives in many countries. Netherlands is one of my top picks, as is Austria, Germany. I love Croatia, I know the language fluently, but I fear there are few job prospects.

**tl;dr: my questions start below**

Anyway, seeing as I want to do this, I figure I need to find work or internships abroad, or build my resume here. I've seen AIESEC and I'm wondering if they'd have opportunities for someone like me, seeking an eventual permanent move, who is graduating at the end of the year? 

I've also heard that there are a lot of countries desparate for similar technical jobs. I apologize, because I'm sure this has been asked before, but where do I start? I don't know where to start *looking* for work for someone like me. What are some good sites or organizations that can help me? My end-goal is a permanent move or EU citizenship, but I know this takes a long time. Help me figure out the fastest way to reach it.

Now, my current job and past internship deal with general IT support in an office setting. I have limited web design experience professionally, but I've taken several courses in the subject and logged hundreds of hours in the languages the potential company uses.

r512s,7,2012-03-20,I am the master of bad timing.,[deleted],BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/r512s/i_am_the_master_of_bad_timing/,"I'm a 24 year old male, and she's 20.

I started dating my ex about a year and a half ago. When we first started dating, there were issues. I we both had issues with exes, though mine were much more predominant than hers. I was afraid of falling in love again after the first girl I truly fell for absolutely destroyed me. She fell head over heels in love with me.

So after a year, I broke up with my ex (I'm going to call her B from now on) because I was having doubts. She mentioned moving in and I didn't know what to think. We soon got back together a week later.

Things were fine up until February where I broke up with her again. I hadn't fallen in love with her and it scared me. I thought I could do better, I didn't want to hurt her, or because the sky was blue, I don't know why I did it. 

And just like last time, we drifted back together. Except this is where things get bad for me. I realized that she meant so much more to me than I was allowing myself to believe. I was afraid of getting hurt, but after a month, I came to realize that I had fallen in love with her. It was wonderful, I had finally found what I had been looking for. She kept telling me I was the perfect guy, but during this time she was trying to move away from me emotionally, and didn't show it. She didn't know I was growing more attached. Then, She then tried to sleep with my friend who didn't know what was going on between us so I have no right to be upset with him. 

So in the span of two days, I realized that I had finally fallen for a girl years after I was emotionally crippled by my old ex, only to have the girl I had fallen for tell me she tried sleeping with my friend but he was too nervous to go through with it but she wanted it regardless. 

This was last week. Since then, I've been such a mess. I want to be angry, but after speaking with my friend, he really had no idea that anything was happening between us, and I believe him. B and I were supposed to let the other know if we wanted to see other people to give us a chance to start distancing ourselves. 

So now, she wants to see other people and I want nothing but for her to come back. I suggested we try for one month. To see if she can't feel something for me again. No dice. The past two nights I spilled my heart to her and she kept saying she was sorry, and crying but just couldn't shake the feeling she didn't want a relationship right now and she wants to see other guys. 

I'm usually a very angry person when things don't go my way... but now, I just feel empty. I'm just existing and nothing more. I don't know what to do. How to react to all of this. Not that I'll get any answer here that I haven't already heard or thought of myself, I just wanted to type this out. Feel free to comment if you wish.

**Edit**: Just adding a little bit more information and TL;DR

I am seeing a therapist and a psychologist but I hate both. The therapist doesn't tell me anything that I don't already know. Doesn't give any helpful advice, and I'm seriously considering not going to her anymore. As for my Psychologist, all he wants to make sure is that I don't go into recreational drugs and hardly knows me. I hate anti-depressant medication and I don't think I'll ever take it again.

This past week I could barely eat anything more than a quarter of a bowl of cereal. I feel sick all the time. I don't want to speak to anyone but I have a full-time job. (luckily I'm an intern and I get left alone for the most part.) I just want to forget everything. I want to stop thinking. 

I'm addicted to relationships. Everything else in my life is great. Health, a good job (I get paid a fair bit for this internship), I'm in school, I have friends, and yeah. There isn't much I can really improve other than finding a worthwhile relationship. I don't know how to be happily single. Right now, I'm so conflicted. I know I shouldn't want B, but I do. I can't see myself going after another girl. I hate the girls I meet. They're bitchy, conceded, fat, ignorant, cruel, immature, just so many attributes that make me sick. It's so hard for me to find someone I'm attracted to. 

**TL;DR - Had an amazing girl for a year and a half but didn't realize it. When I finally realized that I was in love with her, she's moved on and tried sleeping with my friend.**"

I will be graduating with a CS degree in a couple months and have already accepted a position at a consulting company where I will be doing C#/ASP.Net development. They use MVC. I was hoping to get some advice as to how I can best prepare myself for this position.

**Where I am now:** 

* I have done quite a bit of DB work. I am comfortable designing, managing, and querying DBs.
* I have moderate experience with C#
* I have a basic understanding of HTML
* I have a couple years of experience doing Java, Python, and C++ dev at internships
* I feel that I have a solid grasp on data structures, algorithms, networking, and most everything else that comes with a CS degree
* About 3 months experience making a ASP.NET/C# tool
* Annoying amounts of experience with source control

**What I don't have:**

* Deep understanding of HTML/C#
* Any understanding of CSS
* Any experience with MVC
* Proper design for these web-based projects
* Ways to apply object oriented programming to these projects properly
* An understanding of what else I should list here...


I know this is quite a bit and I am sure what I will need to know will depend on my company, but I was hoping you guys might be able to provide me with some sources (books, sites, etc.) so that I can begin forming a solid foundation of understanding so that I can begin making an impact sooner at my new company.

Thanks again for any advice you might be able to lend!

Of course, I mean covering the expenses of my main necessities.  Entertainment and traveling will be extra.

In terms of housing, I have the option of 270€ a month at some hostel that was recommended to me and this seems a bit much to me.  Therefore, I have been searching on wg-gesucht.de (any other sites like this?) and I should be able to find something much better than a hostel that's closer to 200€.  Other than hostels and the classic apartment/roommate search, are there any other options out there that I'm overlooking?

I will have to commute to the TU everyday, how much will public transportation run me per month?

What about food?  How much should I expect to pay for groceries vs. eating out?

Vielen Dank!

r4f71,1,2012-03-19,"My State Department Personal Narratives, oh god they suck, due Wednesday 3.19.12",[deleted],Proofreading,https://www.reddit.com/r/Proofreading/comments/r4f71/my_state_department_personal_narratives_oh_god/,"Ideas for state department:
1. Substantive Knowledge: 

1. Substantive Knowledge: The Foreign Service seeks a diverse workforce with broad job skills and a depth of experience to represent the US overseas. Briefly describe why you chose the career track you selected.

I believe that cultures are a puzzle.  Not necessarily an overarching series of themes, but rather a feeling that one can only understand or begin to recognize after prolonged living in another country.  This is why I want to become a consular officer, to learn more about the world and simultaneously better myself.  I have made a point to always expose myself to diverse backgrounds.  I abhor homogeny and believe that America's strength lies in its multiculturalism.  When I lived in Ireland I joined a musical society and worked with other Irish people in order to produce a musical.  I did this to immerse myself in their culture.  I am currently dating a Latin woman and I went to high school at a predominantly African-American school.  I have planned my own trips and activities abroad; I have even done so for friends.  I majored in Western European History, but my studies did not end there!  I have travelled and experienced other cultures on my own.  Operating and surviving on my own was a thrill and a challenge.  And I would use this knowledge and curiosity to immerse myself in foreign cultures to help other Americans remain safe abroad and at home, while at the same time helping them learn and grow from their experiences in foreign cultures.   My resourcefulness and curiosity makes me an ideal consular officer candidate.   

2. Intellectual Skills:  In the Foreign Service you will confront challenging situations that require identifying the problem, collecting relevant information, and formulating or advancing innovative solutions to resolve the problem. Describe a time when you responded innovatively to unanticipated circumstances to solve a problem. (What was the situation? What steps did you take to think through the situation? How did your action address the situation? What were the results?)

Work at Quatrefoil, being able to teach myself programming and adapt to the situation in able to effectively complete what was required of me.  I was given an internship at a company based on my strong computer skills.  However, I had never tried programming before.  The company needed to create a shell user interface for a crane simulator.  I sat down and basically taught myself how to code.  Instead of constantly questioning my boss for solutions, I found them on my own by consulting guides, asking my co-workers, and using online resources.  I was able to complete the program in the time required.  This is not the only project that I completed at Quatrefoil, I also set up and programmed a light display which required learning how to wire motion sensors and other circuits, and I also created an interface to calculate body mass index for the National Healthy Museum.  My work can be seen to this day on display at the Liberty Science Center in New Jersey and Discovery Place in North Carolina.      

At Vocus, I proposed several solutions in order to help media research on various countries.  I have constantly received more responsibilities from my manager; she has often approached me for help finding difficult contacts or determining the viability of outlets.  I also have proposed and been able to implement many innovative changes, such as using Google translate to search in local languages for relevant information or using a program to develop macro scripts for the research application.  Moreover, when a French contractor was unable to finish research on Germany for Vocus, I volunteered because of my German language skills.  I gave cultural information to the rest of the team and even tips to deciphering the German language.  Our research team finished processing Germany at a much faster rate than the French contractor and helped to convince upper management to continue our project and even fund it further.  I have even been offered a job to help refine and manage the data.  

During my senior year in college I had no time to continue studying German.  I had deeply enjoyed learning a new language and unlike my previous attempts in High School, a decent amount of it stuck.  I decided instead to continue learning on my own.  I taught myself through a course named Assimil.  Unfortunately the next course was written in French, instead of ending my study there I translated the entire course into English for my own personal use.  With the knowledge I gained from both translating and the actual course itself I am now able to read novels in German; during my studies in college I could barely figure out word endings and declensions.  Now, I continue to study on my own by saving almost every word I do not know to a flashcard program on my computer.  My regular regiment of both native content and active vocabulary learning has led me to further consider a career with the State Department and now I feel confident enough to one day possibly be stationed in Germany or pursue a Master’s degree.  
  
3. Interpersonal Skills: In the Foreign Service, you will be called upon to interact effectively and diplomatically with people in difficult situations. Describe how you have used your interpersonal skills in a specific situation to resolve a problem or achieve a goal. (What was the goal or problem? What specific steps did you take? What was the result?) 

During my time at the Maryland English Institute I was given the task to help tutor a student named Mazen.  Mazen was from Saudi Arabia and was having trouble adapting to the situation.  The goal was to get him to follow instructions and complete his homework, and hopefully help him on his way to understanding more English.  I spent the better part of a week attempting to frame things in a way that Mazen would understand, including framing exercises in a way relevant to him: this included asking him to write about the Saudi King and attractions in Mecca, Riyadh and so forth when he refused to complete a rubric about a favorite sport player or celebrity.  Mazen was more responsive to my tutoring than the teacher and I believe he received some value out of my tutoring.  Unfortunately, he was not able to complete the course.  I actually don’t know what happened to him, fuck.  
	

While at the University of Maryland I was assaulted while attempting to reclaim my property.  My girlfriend’s roommate had allowed an extremely intoxicated man to enter into their apartment.  The man stole my property.  We called the resident assistant when we found him hardly conscious in the hallway of my girlfriend’s apartment.  When I convinced the man to return my property he had sudden second thoughts and charged at my girlfriend.  I was able to restrain him with minimal physical harm, despite injuries to me, and walking away peacefully.  The Residential Association attempted to charge me with instigating a fight, however I was able to represent my case clearly before a board of peers and the charges were dropped.  

In Spring 2011 my friend and I decided to go to Mexico during our spring break.  When we arrived the hotel was completely inadequate; it was dirty, and it did not have the amenities that were described.  I called our travel agency, all while calming my friend who was distraught because she had lost her phone, and explained the situation.  I told them that the hotel did not match the advertisement and explained to them detail by detail what was lacking.  I was insistent yet calm and eventually we were given a new hotel and an apology from a manager.  A similar event required me to coordinate with the better Business Bureau in order to correct fraudulent charges a company made on my debit card.  In both situations I remained patient and presented my case, while availing myself of such resources as the Better Business Bureau.     

During my time at University College Dublin I planned and led several trips on my own.  This included planning a trip with my roommate to London and leading him around the city.  I also planned friends’ trips logistically, showing them how to book hostels and rail tickets.  While in Paris, I helped guide my friends around using the public transportation.  To plan the trip I purchased airplane tickets, found a hotel, and researched what to visit and how to get there.  Towards the end of the semester I planned a nine day trip around Central and Southern Europe, through Munich, Budapest and Rome.  I made all the reservations myself and planned trips, excursions, and even nights out.  All these trips were an astounding success and we managed to do all of them relatively cheaply, finding budget airfare and hostels.  When plans went awry I took control of the situation; and communicated my way back to the airport after we missed our train stop.  

When I visited Budapest in the winter of 2009 we almost missed our non-refundable flight to Rome.  Our train tumbling through the darkened outskirts of Budapest, my travel mate and I were finally resting our feet after a long day of roaming the city.  I was sure that they would announce each station over the intercom; unfortunately they did not.  Our train ended up going forty-five minutes in the wrong direction.  I approached the conductor calm, but urgently showing him our ticket.  He seemed to understand that we had missed the airport but he did not offer any other options, instead of frantically running around I calmly paid the difference in fair and began to question those around us in the little Hungarian I knew: Do you speak English?  Luckily, the man in front of us did.  He helped direct is to a taxi cab and while we were waiting I explained to him where we were headed and how much time we had.  My outgoing nature and my ability to remain diplomatic and explain the complicated situation saved us in the end and we arrived at Terminal 2 five minutes before the check in counter closed.   

4. Communication Skills: Communication skills are critical to successful diplomacy. Describe a situation in which you used your communication skills (either in English or another language) to further an aim or achieve a goal. (What was the situation? What steps did you take to deal with the situation? What was the result?)
	 
At the Maryland English Institute I helped adult foreign nationals understand basic English vocabulary and grammar.  These students’ first languages were a colorful collection; many spoke Arabic, some Spanish, and even Japanese and Korean.  I used my communication skills to help them learn topics like the “past perfect tense” and tutored one student who was having trouble.  Instead of trying to frame topics in foreign terms I gave this student things to write about which were relevant to him: such as the King of Saudi Arabia, local musicians, and cities in Saudi Arabia.  In vocabulary class I used a flash card game to tutor a group of Saudis.  I also helped lead group work in class.  In doing so, I framed the project’s goals and expressed complicated geo-political concepts concerning the European Union in simple terms.  The groups were very cooperative and many of the students that I tutored enjoyed their time with me and at the Maryland English Institute.  I occasionally ran into former students around campus and they would always great me with a smile and a handshake.  

5.  Management Skills: Foreign Service Officers are often required to manage projects, demonstrating the ability to plan and organize, set priorities, employ a systematic approach, and allocate time and resources efficiently. Describe a project you managed or helped to manage and how you sought to achieve the project’s goals. (What was the project? What steps did you take to manage the project? What was the result?)

During 2006 and 2007 I worked at Quatrefoil Associates, a museum design company.  The company needed to create a shell user interface for a crane simulator; in order to finish this I taught myself from scratch how to code.  My manager gave me direct control over the entire process, from the use of hardware to the designing of the program.  This required coordinating with the company's graphics designers on both form and functionality.  The expectations of the project were fairly strict so I had to define and order graphics with specifications in mind.  I also had to determine what was realistic concerning animations (like a load screen) and a splash (intro) screen.  I also coordinated with other on-staff technicians in order to integrate joystick control: I found the appropriate software and coded it into the interface.  My work can be seen today at the Liberty Science Center in New Jersey.  My entire work at Quatrefoil is an example of taking initiative and being able to correctly manage complext projects while matching deadlines and being able to coordinate several different aspects into one whole.  

(This might get left out)The crane simulator was not my sole project at Quatrefoil; I also set up and programmed a lights display which required learning how to wire motion sensors and other circuits, and I also created an interface to calculate body mass index for the National Healthy Museum.  My work can be seen to this day on display at the Liberty Science Center in New Jersey and Discovery Place in North Carolina.  

6. Leadership Skills: Leadership can be defined as motivating others, encouraging creative solutions, establishing positive team relationships, or significantly influencing the direction of the work. Describe how you have demonstrated leadership, either on one particular occasion or over time. (What was the situation? What steps did you take to show leadership? What was the result?)

At Vocus, I proposed several solutions in order to help media research on various countries.  I have constantly received more responsibilities from my manager; she has often approached me for help finding difficult contacts or determining the viability of outlets.  I also have proposed and been able to implement many innovative changes, such as using Google translate to search in local languages for relevant information or using a program to develop macro scripts for the research application.  Moreover, when a French contractor was unable to finish research on Germany for Vocus, I volunteered because of my German language skills.  I gave cultural information to the rest of the team and even tips to deciphering the German language.  Our research team finished processing Germany at a much faster rate than the French contractor and helped to convince upper management to continue our project and even fund it further.  I have even been offered a job to help refine and manage the data.

r4eg3,1,2012-03-19,Day One,No_Touching_Willie,NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/r4eg3/day_one/,"Hello nofap redditors. I'm rather glad I ran across this sub today. Here's my story.

I began my addiction to pornography when I was 12 and discovered Google image search. I soon discovered fapping, (all without any sex ed or parental sex talks unfortunately) and I've been addicted ever since. I'm now 19. I'm a born again Christian and have always struggled with the fact that masturbating goes against my morals, but I've never quite been able to completely, well, beat it! My longest nofap streak I've hit was two weeks, which happened after I had a completely awe-inspiring religious experience, and during those two weeks I felt wonderful! Not a single urge to fap. And then I just caved, without any real temptation. I think I almost wanted to congratulate myself, or see what it would feel like after two weeks, just one of those stupid rationalizations. Since that streak failed I stopped fighting the urge and just acquiesced to my addiction again.

Now I've met this girl who I've been talking to for almost 6 months, who is a great Christian girl,and I'm applying for internships, and I'm dissatisfied with the distancing that my pornography addiction causes in my relationship with God.

So here I am. I won't say that now I'm finally in it for the long haul, or today will be the time I'll finally beat it, because those statements rarely come true, and then it's all the more frustrating when failure hits. But I'm stepping back into the ring, and that's a start!

Thank you for providing me with the community I need start my battle again!

r7ivz,9,2012-03-21,Need some advice. Not doing a very good job getting a job.,rainymonday512,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/r7ivz/need_some_advice_not_doing_a_very_good_job/,"Let me begin by apologizing for such a long post.

I posted a while back before having an interview with Google. It didn't go very well because my weakest area is programming. I understand this is the core of software engineering. I've done a bit of stuff on TopCoder and have continued working on my projects when I have time. TopCoder, however, seems a bit silly unless you're trying to practice algorithms. (Why not instead work on a project?) I'm currently trying to update an HTTP 1.0 proxy in C to 1.1 and add caching. (This was originally a project from last semester.) I am also working on small components of a distributed file system using RPC in C++ for a distributed systems class this semester. But that's just an assignment. I also have some Java experience, and know/can leverage most of the simple/intermediate language features, but haven't done anything of scale. 

I've had a couple of phone screens for software engineering positions that seemed to go well enough, but were for positions that I didn't directly apply for, so didn't really line up with my strengths. I have also received a number of no's just from my resume. Really what it comes down to is that my weakest point in terms of experience and expertise is programming as far as software engineering is concerned. On the other side of things, I've applied to a couple of IT positions. I was a manager at a university helpdesk, can do some scripting, and know some linux (not a lot, but enough to be useful). But in IT I don't have the experience in networking, database administration, ad, etc.

I'm still applying to places and have one interview coming up that lines up pretty well and seems like it might go well. But I feel like I am applying for the wrong positions entirely. I really like problem solving and feel I have a strong grasp on all of the undergraduate courses I've taken, but since many are missing from the department, I haven't taken a good OS, networking, or compilers class.

I like to think of myself as smart (I get good grades, etc.), but that doesn't seem to be very helpful at the moment. I also feel that whenever I am presented with a problem, I am pretty good at finding a good solution, given a little time to myself. I would have applied to graduate school were it not for student loans, but my plan is to pay off loans before going back. And when I do apply I think I'll go for EE, because I am much more interested in working with the technical details of things than high level abstractions.

I am wondering if anyone has suggestions in terms of what I really should work on in order to improve my chances for software engineering-ish jobs. I know that if I want to do IT, I should take courses and the like. Perhaps it's foolish for me now to be working on something in C because it takes such a long time to get everything correct and do all of the testing without making your own suitable abstractions (considering I have limited time)? Any suggestions for places to which to apply? Suggestions in terms of career path?

I appreciate any direction that I can get. Thanks.

r7f3h,0,2012-03-21,Why am I not seeing size gains?,Anal_Justice_League,Fitness,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/r7f3h/why_am_i_not_seeing_size_gains/,"Hello r/fitness.  First time poster here! :)

I have been lifting for a good 16 months now, with mixed results.  The first eight months or so I saw moderate strength gains, but little in the way of physical results.  After taking three months off (due to an internship) I got back into a new routine, as suggested to me by my friend.  The results have been both positive and negative.  The routine is on a seven day cycle as follows:

Day 1: Upper Body Power Day

    Pulling Power Movement: Bent over or Pendlay rows
    3 sets of 3-5 reps @105
    Pressing Power Movement: Flat dumbbell presses
    3 sets of 3-5 reps @60
    Assistance pressing movement: Seated dumbbell shoulder presses
    3 sets of 6-10 reps @50 
    Auxiliary curling movement: Cambered bar curls
    3 sets of 6-10 reps @90
    Auxiliary extension movement: Skull crushers
    3 sets of 6-10 reps @70

I know it's a bit superficial and cliche, but my biceps haven't grown an inch in over a year.  Even with moderate training, I would have expected to see something, even small.  They were 12.5 inches around last year, and remain that size to this day.  Unfortunately, I lost the log book in which I kept my old weight max's, but I do remember that the most I could do on a machine (I do mostly preacher curls with free weights now) was 100 then, but two days ago, I managed to get up to 140.

Day 2: Lower Body Power Day

    Assistance extension movement: Leg extensions
    2 sets of 10 reps @260
    Assistance pulling/curling movement: Glute ham raises or lying leg curls
    2 sets of 10 reps @170
    Seated leg press
    4 sets of 5 reps @950
    Auxiliary calf movement: Seated calf raise
    2 sets of 20 reps @640

My friend suggested that I start to take D-aspartic acid as a supplement.  In the three months that I have been doing so, I have seen weight increases in most every exercise, but have seen explosive growth in my legs.  I'm not sure as to whether this is a placebo effect or not (I have a hard time believing I went from repping 550 on legs to 950 in only three months) but I have seen some serious increases in all four leg strength exercises.  I don't do squats (even though I know I should) because even after hours of watching other peoples forms and having them watch mine, every morning after I do squats, I wake up with a raging headache.  

Day 3: Rest

Day 4: Back and Shoulders Hypertrophy Day

    Pulling Power Exercise speed work: Bent over or Pendlay rows
    6 sets of 3 reps with 65-70% of normal 3-5 rep max  @65
    Hypertrophy pulling movement: Seated cable row
    3 sets of 8-12 reps @110
    Hypertrophy pulling movement: Dumbbell rows or shrugs bracing upper body.
    2 sets of 12-15 reps @60
    Hypertrophy shoulder movement: Seated dumbbell presses
    3 sets of 8-12 reps @35
    Hypertrophy shoulder movement: Upright rows
    2 sets of 12-15 reps @60
    Hypertrophy shoulder movement: Side lateral raises with dumbbells or cables
    3 sets of 12-20 reps @20

Day 5: Lower Body Hypertrophy Day


    Hypertrophy pressing movement: Leg presses
    2 sets of 12-15 reps @600
    Hypertrophy extension movement: Leg extensions
    3 sets of 15-20 reps @170
    Hypertrophy curling movement: Lying leg curls
    2 sets of 12-15 reps @110
    Hypertrophy calf movement: Seated calf raises
    3 sets of 15-20 reps @400

Day 6: Chest and Arms Hypertrophy Day

    Pressing Power Exercise speed work: Flat dumbbell presses
    6 sets of 3 reps with 65-70% of normal 3-5 rep max
    Hypertrophy pressing movement: Incline dumbbell presses
    3 sets of 8-12 reps @40
    Hypertrophy fly movement: Incline cable flyes
    2 sets of 15-20 reps @50
    Hypertrophy curling exercise: Cambered bar preacher curls
    3 sets of 8-12 reps @60
    Hypertrophy curling exercise: Dumbbell concentration curls
    2 sets of 12-15 reps @25
    Hypertrophy extension exercise: Seated tricep extension with cambered bar
    3 sets of 8-12 reps @55
    Hypertrophy extension exercise: Cable pressdowns with rope attachment
    2 sets of 12-15 reps @80

Day 7: Rest

I am 6'3"" and weigh about 205.  I eat 300g +/- carbs a day, 200g +/- proten and consume enough calories to gain weight while working out despite my tremendous metabolism.  I take NO Xplode and as I mentioned before, D-aspartic Acid.  Any help would be greatly appreciated!

Thanks!

1) Stay where I am on the team I'm on and take the full time job. My last review I just did I got the highest marks possible. I'm not sure but I think my starting salary would be 40k/yr
2) Go to the university of Missouri to finish my bachelors degree in computer science. I would have to take out student loans approximately 40k in debt.

____________________________________________

**The Story**

We met in college my Senior Year her Freshman Year.  It was a blind date (read: no social skills on my part) set up by my best friend and his now wife to be a double date with seeing a movie and coffee.  Things started off real slow and progressed as a normal relationship should.  I ended up graduating college 1.5 years later and moved up north, about 5 hours away from her to pursue my career.  Like every long distance relationship, it started off very well with us both making time to see each other on weekends.  After about a year of this distance thing, the relationship we had started going sour.  She left to study abroad and we spent the first 2 months of that fighting and seriously contemplating our relationship. Up until this point too we were talking about getting engaged, and every indication I had from her was she couldn't wait for that to happen  (read: ignorant and complacent).

We managed to patch things up and I flew over there, traveled and brought her home to the states again. Things were great after that.....for a while. Fast forward to one year ago when shit really started to hit the fan.  She was really distancing herself from me and, ignoring the relationship and I was letting her. **I was to afraid to confront her or even talk about how I was feeling**.  It eventually got to the point where she wanted a ""break"" to figure things out, me thinking this would help, let it happen. It turned out she wanted the break so she could go out on a date with a co-worker that had been flirting with her. During the break too was our supposed 4 year anniversary (St. Patrick's Day), where she went out with this guy at 5am to the bars and proceeded to post pictures of her hanging all over him.

After the break we started talking again and semi got back together but it wasn't the same, fast forward another cpl weeks where we went to a 3 day concert in the middle of the desert. We took her car and drove with one of her friends, the whole time she was acting like a complete **** towards me. By the end of that night I had had enough of her bs and laid into her, ended up breaking up for good when I found out she made out with the bar guy etc... (read: Mistake on how I approached the situation)  The next two days culminated in her stranding me in the middle of the desert 9 hours away from home, with no car, to ride home and no where to sleep.  

One week later I had to go pick up some stuff from her house and she did everything but got down on her knees begging for me to come back.  **I agreed and things were starting to get repaired a little.** We went out the bars one night and she got super drunk and started yelling at me because she thought I was seeing someone else....she then told me out of spite that she had sex with the bar dude the Monday after the concert.  To wrap this up she moved down to southern caliifornia for an internship. Up until the week before we ended things she was loving and excited to be with me, I came to find out she was dating another guy down in SoCal while we were trying to work things out.

**What All This Taught Me**

I learned a ton about who I was through this whole ordeal, most importantly however that I was **too afraid of rejection** to speak up or even talk.  I was getting rolled over in every aspect of the relationship which translated into my life outside.  I became depressed because my life was spiraling out of control and I **felt** I couldn't do anything to change it.  That was the single biggest mistake I made through everything, **I stopped believing in my self**, I had hit rock bottom, felt hopeless and didn't know what to do.  My life for the last 4 years was based around another person, causing me to forget who **I was** and what made me who I am.

I eventually realized, through a lot of introspection and surrounding my self with close family and friends, that I had a lot going for me and I was pretty freaking awesome and **nobody but myself could change that**.  I was a single, 27 year old male supporting myself, living in the heart of the wine country in California with a successful job, a car and my own place to call home.

I started putting my self out there in social situations, because the single greatest thing I realized was  **I am never going to overcome this if I don't try**.  I have taken one of my favorite quotes by a famous hockey player and turned it into my personal Mantra

&gt;You miss 100% of the shots you don't take. - Wayne Gretzky

Yes some of those shots you do take, leave you crashed and burned, but what do you have to lose other than hearing ""No"" or ""Sorry"". Take every situation you are in and learn from it, its the only way you can help yourself.

From that point forward I told my self I will never be that weak, uninspired person again.  I joined a philanthropic club in town, started working out and eating healthy and stopped stressing over the little things in life, because its pointless to do so.  Most importantly I focused on who I was and what made me happy, and haven't lost sight of that since.

Feel free to ask any questions of clarifications, I am an open book and hope this story can inspire you in some way."

r6b03,1,2012-03-21,Am I dating a psychopath? Or is he just a spoiled only child?,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/r6b03/am_i_dating_a_psychopath_or_is_he_just_a_spoiled/,"I (F/21) have been dating my boyfriend (M/21) for almost 2 years now.

He is an extremely charming, gallant person with a lot of friends who worship the ground he walks on. His parents (who are angels) also worship the ground he walks on. They've tried to conceive for 9 years before he came as practically a miracle and they treat him as such - he can do no wrong. It didn't help his situation that he was certified a genius (MENSA) at age 6 and pretty much lived the rest of his life as a genius, getting into a prestigious ivy league school and landing really prestigious internships. He's also extremely good-looking and, aside from a brief awkward period during adolescence, always had model looks.

His parents didn't have much money growing up, so he wasn't (and isn't) spoiled materialistically. His parents pay his tuition, but other than that, he pays all his expenses from his summer job that he works his arse off at.  He knows the value of a dollar and does not like spending a lot of money on himself, but he showers his friends and his parents with lavish gifts. 

He exudes warmth and sweetness, but he has his times when he retreats from the rest of the world, especially when he is overworked. In fact, whenever one of his friends, or his girlfriend (me) is struggling, he is extremely attentive, caring, sweet, concerned, and helpful - when he is in a ""cornered"" position and can't escape - i.e. when I call his cell and he answers and says he has time to talk, when I skype him and he has no idea what it's about beforehand. When he knows I'm hurting or going through a hard time, he avoids interacting with me on impulse. He never follows up - i.e. ""how are you feeling?"" - unless I give him shit for being a jerk and never following up - THEN he follows up the next day because he doesn't want to lose me. He's obsessed with saving face (he's Asian, that might have something to do with it). 

He can be quite the asshole, it's as if he doesn't realize how some of the things he does can hurt people - it's usually the things he DOESN'T do that hurt people. I don't know if it's because he's a psychopath or because he has the ""I am the center of the universe"" mindset that excludes everyone else's concerns from his radar?

His parents both insist he's actually extremely empathetic and sensitive, and that he's also an introvert (his flamboyance and extroversion are just a persona) and tends to internalize things, so although he cares in his heart, he feels no need to express it externally.

He is very loyal and devoted to me. I don't think he would ever cheat, although he does have a mischievous streak. He doesn't like taking risks usually, but sometimes he does something completely crazy like cross-dress in public or skinny dip in 2ºC weather (it was with only guy friends though, and no, he doesn't have a gay bone in his body, he just likes the attention I think). He is a master manipulator, and can honestly do no wrong. If you accuse him of anything he goes ballistic and somehow always manages to turn ME into the monster for accusing him of such a thing - he makes me feel like whenever I have any concern whatsoever, I'm ""crazy"". When he is criticized, and his parents said he's been like that since childhood, he cannot deal - however, he quietly modifies his behaviour if the critic makes sense, without ever acknowledging them being right. He would never admit someone else is right. He does apologize though when he's obviously wrong.

I just spoke to one of his closest high school friends and she told me that he has had the tendency to retreat when others are hurting as long as he thinks no one is noticing - thus he is pegged as the ""fun-to-goof-around-with"" friend. He's very loyal and dependable to his friends and those he loves, however, if you want any care or concern from him you have to force it out. Because of this, I wonder if it is genuine. 

He loves animals and the environment, and he would never harm a fly. He claims to be a feminist but all his female friends unanimously agree that he is not. (To be fair, he was raised with a very old-fashioned, somewhat chauvinist father - although his father is extremely sweet - he is merely a product of how he is raised - his dad is elderly, born in the early 30's, and quite traditional). He treats people very well though, although he can be manipulative, idk if he does it on purpose though. 

[Please read this](http://www.lifeafterdatingapsycho.com/blog/2011/03/signs-you-might-be-dating-a-psychopath.html)- ever since I read this I got quite scared that he can indeed be a psychopath. 

All of these match how I feel about his behaviour, except for numbers 7, 9 (except he always expresses a distaste for my friends - maybe if I lived with him it would be true?), 12, 14 (although it has been suggested), and 18 (he cares so little about me that he never even asks what I'm up to - whenever he talks to me it's almost always about him), 

I notice that especially 21, 20, 13, 10, 8, 3, and 1 are very very true for us.

What do you think?

EDIT: I really do love him, our chemistry is amazing, he is extremely respectful to me sexually (he even told me he'd wait for me as long as I wanted, even if it means until marriage). He's a really fun person, very loyal and devoted, although he can be very self-centered. The good times are incredible. The bad times leave me feeling like a total unloved piece of crap.

I am currently sick now, and had to go to the hospital. I couldn't reach him for several hours, only when I got out of the hospital was I able to reach him on his cell (he had his cell off his person, clearly). He has not asked me how I am feeling and it's been two days. I finally called him and yelled at him and he told me he's sorry, that he has a lot on his plate too, and hasn't been sleeping because of his workload being too intense. He was the one who initially suggested I go to the hospital when I started complaining about my problem, but I put it off until It got very serious. He feels that he already gave me advice and stuff, and already showed he cared...etc.  It's  as if caring about me is a chore! That's not normal from someone who is supposed to love me!

**tl;dr:** I don't know if my boyfriend is a psychopath, or just an immature, spoiled only child who will grow up when thrust into the workforce. He has many of the qualities on [this list](http://www.lifeafterdatingapsycho.com/blog/2011/03/signs-you-might-be-dating-a-psychopath.html), except the really serious ones - he'd never lay a hand on me or anyone else and in fact has a soft spot for the disenfranchised/weak, and he is extremely honest (I think). All on the list apply to us except 7, 12, 14, and 18 (that's because he is too self-absorbed and doesn't give a shit what I do as long as it's not cheat on him), although these descriptions are a lot more severe than our situation."

r68ek,3,2012-03-20,"Reddit, I've been in a 3 year relationship, on the verge of marriage. We're taking a break and it's stressing me out to the point of depression. Help?",puckpuckpuck,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/r68ek/reddit_ive_been_in_a_3_year_relationship_on_the/,"Okay, here goes nothing Reddit. (This may be a long one.)

(I will first off admit I am a little drunk, so things may not be grammaticality correct, spelling, etc.) 

I have been in a relationship with this girl for 3 year. We have live together for 2. We had two dogs and two cats. Basically, we were on track for marriage. We have previously moved two other times, and were about to prepare for our third (and at the time final) move. On a couple of days before our third move, we had a talk about our relationship after I got out of work (I generally work late nights as a intern). We've had this talk before  about where our relationship is going before - while we had both discussed marriage before and wanting to go forward with it after I had finished college (she had graduated back in December, I had a year left). It basically came down to ""We needed to take a break."" 

She left that night to a friends. From there on out, I went to live at my mothers. We had many conversations that week that were emotionally charged and involved lots of crying. After the move, we met for dinner and drinks). We were both incredibly happy to see each other, with much affection from both parties. Since the break, we both managed to stay in contact, not just because of the move, but because of the obvious. After the dinner, we made plans to see a movie and just hang out at the mall (a bizarre choice on behalf of the mall admittedly), but those previous two encounters were distant and awkward. We were both tired, I from stress and her from having to take care of all the animals (I am not capable of taking care of any of the animals due to having a maximum of animals at my Mothers). Yet, in many conversations before, she had stated being sad about us not being together. She had admitted that she was sad because it was ""almost like she had lost a friend"". 

Yet, I was a lot off worse.

The reason for the break was because both of us had to deal with personal habits we needed to deal with. I am generally not neat, I don't eat well, I manage my finances piss poorly, and I intern for a company that is an amazing opportunity but bend ass over backwards for the in an attempt to get a job next seamster (or at least a paid internship as my current job pays nothing and gives no hours at all). She also needed to learn how to be independent of me, as she could not carry a conversation without even mentioning me. 

Or course, since I didn't want to force her into anything I obliged. 

Since the break, I have become increasingly depressed. I continue to use alcohol and food as a crutch. I am no longer happy anymore. She was the only thing that kept me happy apparently, despite having such great opportunities with work and college. I try to distract myself with work, but it only works when i'm there. I've gotten back into writing music, but once I hit writers block, all these thoughts come back. I skip class frequently. I lose sleep due to the stress. 

The big problem is that she can't keep her decisions straight. A week into the break, she wants to end EVERYTHING. I haven't even made any of the changes she had suggested. Her reason behind this was due to be being drunk at the time of the phone call and not having moved anything out of our previous house. Days later, we had realized we had a miscommunication about everything - she knew I was going to a beer fest and we had not discussed a date when I would move everything out. 

Our previous two outings together were very distant. She had wanted to go out just ""as friends"". I obliged, just so I could see her. Yet, it hurt for me not to get any affection from her. 

I have seen her once time since, last week. 


Since I have not been getting any sleep due to it, I was in a daze when I saw her (I had to get her money for final bills at our old place). She had noticed I was not right, and asked twice if I was. I, of course, played poker face and lied. ""I'm fine. I'm just tired.""

Co-workers and friends have even noticed my depression. They of course help, but I am the type of person that wants input from anyone that can give it, no matter their stance, position, or relation to me. 

So, I think that's it Reddit. Questions are encouraged, along with inboxes. I love this community and would love some sort of help. I still do love this girl and have invested a ton into this relationship to end it. 

Thank you.

At first it was an ideal job... started as an intern and got a wide exposure to different environments. Now? I find myself stressed to the max and wanting a new job!

Complaints start from our poor bonus system, no time compensation for weekend work during the week, being on call for a week (text alerts and client 'emergency' calls). We're required to get certificates to keep partnerships with Microsoft and Cisco... however; we're given no training and required to study on our own time (reimbursed for the test IF you pass).

I often feel my calendar is too jammed and I don't have time to finish things that I started. It's extremely frustrating when I find myself cheating on something and taking shortcuts because I'm limited on time. It's frustrating going to a client site and doing tasks such as moving computers to new desk and climbing underneath...

We do have internal support such as service manager, receptionist, sales, but often feel they're out of the loop not knowing technology itself. When someone quits, it takes FOREVER to get replacements if at all.

Can anyone shed some insight if these type of items are common for employed consulting? Should I be looking elsewhere? Anyone converted from IT Consulting work to full time defined position with one company and regretted it?

Don't get me wrong, this company isn't a complete bust and does better than what I'm describing. They've been around for 10+ years which is quite the accomplishment in a small / medium business. I enjoy working in IT but feel I may be at the point where I need to try another company. I'm rather clueless on what my job requirements would be for a single company of larger size to be honest.

**EDIT: Sorry, after reading this post over... I may just be looking for a place to cool off and vent out some frustration to others that can relate!!!**"
r623h,10,2012-03-20,Soooo...I may or may not have had a super awkward interview. ,haneliz,lgbt,https://www.reddit.com/r/lgbt/comments/r623h/sooooi_may_or_may_not_have_had_a_super_awkward/,"I'm a grad student and I am interviewing for internships for next year. I decided that I would LOVE to work with the LGBTQIA community. This particular internship involves individual and couples counseling as well as facilitating groups, etc., at the local LGBT center in my city. 

I just got back not that long ago from my interview. It went pretty well- I feel pretty qualified for the position (as I have a background in LGBT issues/history, and..well...I'm not exactly straight, I guess). In my awkwardness surrounding NOT having a good label for my sexual identity, I ended up just describing myself as an ally when she asked why I was interested in working with people on the spectrum. 

Later on, I asked my interviewer about this agency's policy on staff members being ""out"" to clients (because currently I am at a drug treatment center and we are NOT allowed to disclose if we are in recovery to our clients- something that differs based on the agency and its philosophy). I do have a girlfriend (I'm female) and I was unsure if it was appropriate to hint at this (or even to hint at an orientation either way). Somehow, I think the interviewer took this as my saying that I would have to ""come out"" as hetero to all of the clients instead of LGBT. 

She went on to give a spiel about if I were heterosexual and I intend to have to defend myself to other people and constantly let them know I was straight (""No, no...I'm not gay, I swear!"") or if I would be uncomfortable being in pictures that would identify me as working at the Center, etc., that this wasn't the place for me. She pretty much got the wrong idea all around (as I present very heteronormative) and I wasn't sure how to set her straight (no pun intended, I swear) and be like NO I'M NOT WHAT YOU THINK I AM! :P So I just let it go, and I'm just hoping it didn't hurt my chances there.

All in all, probably one of the most awkward interview experiences ever. 
 
EDIT: **TL;DR: I interviewed at an LGBT Center and the interviewer thinks I'm straight and had to make sure I was okay working with the gays.**

I've heard generally positive things (and yes, I've heard about the programming team), but I would love to know more. If anyone has, or had, any experience, I'm anxious to know what you think. 
Any tips or information on helping me in deciding on what university to attend would also be highly appreciated. "

r8l63,8,2012-03-22,Student org for IT majors is recruiting,mercury_83,MSCD,https://www.reddit.com/r/MSCD/comments/r8l63/student_org_for_it_majors_is_recruiting/,"'Sup, Roadrunners?

I'm working with the school's CIS department to try revitalizing the AITP [(Alliance of Information Technology Professionals)](http://www.aitp.org/) Student Chapter. Commuter campus, so...you know, it's not exactly easy. But I figured I'd leave this here just in case any interested parties happen to stop by.

It's $30/annual for students. On a basic level, AITP membership lets you attend monthly seminars in Denver where you get to listen to a few lectures relating to trends/happenings in the tech industry, get some grub, and rub shoulders with professionals for potential networking and job opportunities. 

Kind of useful and probably pretty boring to most. 

We would like to turn the student chapter into something more useful, though. Help people pick up some of those skills that are essential to entry-level jobs, networking for internships and jobs, help out with class material (the programming doesn't quite *snap* into place for some), provide exposure to concepts and tools that Metro won't teach, or generally just share our collective knowledge and experience in order to benefit everyone involved. I've even got a few computers collecting dust in the corner that I'd be willing to donate as guinea pigs for people to practice things like installing/configuring Linux, hands on practice with taking computers apart and reassembling them, or any other things that some may not have the resources for.

There's potential there if people are willing to make it work, and these things always make for nice resume material (which we could also help you write).

Now for the painfully honest part... The group fell apart after the last batch of officers all graduated last year (or two?). So, this would be starting from the ground up. There are currently three people (myself included) signed up and associated with the chapter, and one of them I can't even get a hold of. So this is all very much in an alpha stage and not even breathing yet. The only thing needed is interested and physically present bodies (not often), though.

If you're down, you can sign up on the AITP website linked above. I'm reluctant to drop emails addresses on a public site like Reddit, so if you'd like to discuss anything just reply here or send me a PM, and I'll try to get back to you ASAP. Alternatively, you can just stop by the CIS department on campus and they'll direct you to one of the faculty advisers. 

Thanks for your time, everyone!"

Is this bad for getting an entry level job?",Chrono-chan,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/r8g1q/my_unis_software_engineering_dept_offers/,"The program's broad courses teach the basics of CS through certain languages.  For me, it was some basic Java and PHP (which is scary since everyone here seems to hate PHP here, but don't worry, I 'got' Java before seeing the 'bad habit' conventions of PHP)

They really push the SDLC here, and hammer in the importance of documentation, and design, not the intricacies of programming or languages.  Rather than give small assignments, there are lots of big semester/half-semester-long projects that go from idea to implementation.

I actually really enjoy these early parts, like documentation.  I fear the implementation because the programming courses are so so broad and in some ways basic.  I feel like I can't get a job, especially entry level, because I would fail any language proficiency questions asked.

I seem better as serving the 'real' programmers through coordination and leadership.  I know the least, but since I really get into the projects and dive in head first, causing stronger programmers to look to me for answers, which is a very interesting phenomenon.

I have not had an internship, but I did get hired for a few semesters with the head professor in the program, mostly doing visual design (I was previously an animator) .  I may have an opportunity to work for a web based start-up (though some people say stick with the Uni jobs), and I'm super excited to program more, especially on my own projects.  

With this basic information is there any advice you can give?
Is this 'broad' education 'bad' for getting an entry level job?  

tl;dr
My strengths are communication, asking tons of questions until everyone understands what's going on, and documentation, rather than programming.  However, I don't know how to leverage this in getting jobs.  Any advice as to how I can 'sharpen the spear' more?"
r8f20,1,2012-03-22,"I just got offered a paid internship position, and I don't how good I should be at programming to accept.",[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/r8f20/i_just_got_offered_a_paid_internship_position_and/,"There is going to be a conference in the city I live in and I really wanted to go but it is very expensive. So I asked the organizers whether I could go as a blogger (because bloggers get in for free) and wrote a sentence about my academic background, which includes currently doing a BSc degree in CS.

I got a reply that my background sounded interesting, and since I am doing a BSc in CS they'd rather offer me an internship if I have any programming or designing skills. This is an online newspaper, who also host conferences. And I am thinking of telling them that unfortunately I don't have many programming skills, but I don't know what an intern would have to know.

I mean, I have taken one intro to programming class and I am taking the continuation of that class right now, during this semester. I can write very simple stuff in C++, Java and maybe python. But I mean really simple stuff, like solving Project Euler questions, and the longest code I've written was 2 pages long, it was, again, to solve a maths problem. I have worked with regular expressions, but I always have to look them up online, I can't memorize them and I think I am a fast learner, but I really do only have the basics.

I would really love to work at this place but the most awful thing to do would be to tell them that yes, I do have some programming skills and then go there and be a failure. What would an intern need to know?"
r88ce,6,2012-03-22,"Please...Soon I hit 30. Eating disorders have both made and ruined my life. I have no purpose now. Apathetic, except to destroy myself. Anyone? Live with my mom, single, unemployed, sleep 14 hrs a day, IAMA nothing. ",beller0ph0n,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/r88ce/pleasesoon_i_hit_30_eating_disorders_have_both/,"
I am...so...at my end.

I'm a 29 year old guy, single, unemployed, living with his mother, ashamed, apathetic and completely lost in sadness, regret and self-loathing. 

I finally graduated college a year ago, after moving away to Chicago by myself, where I went to a good school, got good grades, made friends, was happy and excited about my future. The problem came in 2000 after I graduated HS, when I started trying to lose weight. I have always been the ""fat loud funny guy"", which, hey, its nice to be that guy, but sometimes, you just want to be ""normal"" or ""good looking"" or ""taken more seriously"", so after HS I started learning about weight loss and working out. Soon I dedicated my life to it and the days quickly revolved around calories in vs calories out. In Chicago I developed exercise addiction, bulimia and anorexia. Food was now my enemy. As a guy, it is so weird and socially taboo, the fact that I've spent nights huddled over a toilet purging myself after binge eating. 


Soon, however, my weight started yo-yo-ing and I began to lose control. Binge eating was a big part of my early childhood and I was now doing it on weekends on occasion. I began being able to ""catch myself"", that is, after a weekend of binging, I'd fast for a week or so and exercise even more vigorously than before. 

College ended and upon moving back home, into my mom’s modest house (because I was to busy exercising to find a job in Chicago), I fell absolutely in love with this girl Ive known since HS, but because I was so fat and ugly back then, I've never allowed myself to try with women. At all. Ever. 

We started hanging out a lot, I'd always drive 30 minutes to where she was to go get coffee and being out with her, people always thought we were boyfriend and gf, it felt nice. She told me I could be her boyfriend when I got a job (I had a PT warehouse gig, which wasn’t good enough). Soon she got another bf, while I was again on the backburner. At this point I had begun taking myself off benzo's, as I've always had severe insomnia problems and had pretty much always taken a sleeping pill of some sort since high school. Coming off benzos would be the hardest thing I've ever undertaken, with exception to what Im going through now. I began having withdrawals, depression, inability to sleep, fear, incredibly anxiety, hallucinations, twitches, the whole shabang. I checked myself into a mental hospital to be safe as the combination of getting off that crap and me seeing her go through 2 boyfriends without batting an eye made me begin having suicidal idealization. 

I got out, eventually got psudo-stable-ish off the benzos and finally got a good job in computers. It felt like the beginning of a career, for me. I was pretty happy. We made a date to go get coffee, her telling me ""I heard you got a job, Mr. Big shot!"" which to me was everything I had been waiting for. I texted her the day we were to go hang out and she said she had forgot and was at a bar for her friend’s birthday and my heart was broken.   

A few days later, on fb I see that she is, again, in a relationship with someone, this time, it being quite serious with a guy in la who, for all intensive purposes, does what I should be doing (film) but obviously he's applied himself and worked hard whereas I've only worried about my weight. 

Next I lost my job. I wasn’t even there for 3 months. It was the first job outta college, the most important job of your life, supposedly. Its really the only job I've ever had that was serious, too. This was nearly a year ago, now.

Since then, I've made powerful steps towards completely destroying myself. I've tried to kill myself with overeating and though I havent succeeded yet, I am emotionally dead. Binge eating is prevalent in my life again. And when I say binge eating, I mean it emphatically. I would go to multiple fast food restaurants in one day, get the food, take it home, sit on the couch and just gorge. I easily threw back TENS of thousands of calories a day(spending $40-60 a day of my moms money to do so). This was my protective barrier. I would make myself so physically unappealing again that I would never allow myself to interact with girls or believe in myself for doing so, ever again. The plan worked too good. 

I did this for 8 months or so. I stopped playing ball, stopped going to the gym, stopped caring, about everything. This soon evolved into not going outside, not looking in the mirror, not wanting to hang out with friends, not wanting to do anything but sleep, cry and overeat, giving the beast more fuel to hate himself. I threw out all my fat guy clothes a long time ago, but I wouldnt even be able to fit in a majority of them now anyways, because Im just that big. I was never an XXL in high school, but to my chagrin, I am now (and then some). I only squeeze into a few gym shorts, sweatshirts/sweatpants and a hockey jersey. Trying on and buying new “big &amp; tall” clothes is just too depressing, I haven’t even brought myself to do it yet. I was a fat kid, then an athletic mid twenties guy, and now am nearing a clinically obese 30 year old, the roller coaster ive taken is just too much.

I'm bi-polar and have had 2 short episodes of mania this past year but the rest have been the deepest, darkest depression I can imagine or describe. Because of my experience with benzos, i am apprehensive to get on anti-depressants of mood stabilizers (i tried them when I was young and they were nothing but problems). Ironically, the greatest anti-depressant I ever gave myself was becoming addicted to exercise and maintaining my 162 weight, muscle mass and tone. That was the happiest ive been.

I'm so fearful about my future. I don't look for jobs and when I do, its so discouraging seeing the experience requirements and what not, realizing that instead of getting jobs and internships to put on resumes, I was exercising, which holds no merit today. Still, i don't apply or even draft up a resume, out of apathy or fear of rejection. I cant imagine what I’m going to do in an interview, when they ask me what I’ve been doing for the past 9 months or so, since my last job. I can’t tell them that I've been incredibly depressed, and have been busy destroying myself, emotionally and physically. But its worrisome as, clearly, I don’t care about self preservation. I no longer bathe or brush my teeth, let alone try and craft a future for myself. I'm 1/10th a human.

The apathy, towards both things I once loved (basketball, golf, friends, comedy) and the things I really should be working on (my future, career, relationships, myself, etc) keeps me under the covers all day, every day. I don’t know how to escape this. I can't escape my thoughts, this room, this house, this town or this sadness.

I think about getting back on sleeping pills and that's obviously quite scary, but I cant just wish myself to fall asleep at midnight or 2 or 4 or even 6. Sometimes, because of the way I feel, they way my brain is thinking and tormenting me, I just cant sleep until absolutely physically depleted. And obviously I will never be able to go to the gym and start working out unless I’m awake before 8 o’clock at night. This is no way to live.   


I don’t know how to fix my eating problems, how to tackle my resentment/regret towards myself, how to deal with my sleep issues, not to mention weather I should once again give a run at the lab rat game of anti-depressants or how to be able to step back into the gym and devote myself without thinking of all the negatives, time lost and pain I’ve accumulated. Id love to be able to say that I will one day love myself in this obese body, but I cant and I wont. I know, after feeling what I felt, leading the life, NOT of a fat man, that I will never be happy as a fat person again. I was the class clown, always confident in my ability to be funny, its what I wanted to do with my life (comedy) since childhood yet now, because I’ve changed myself from fat guy to swan to super fat guy, I just cant be myself. I cant even be funny or anything but terribly cynical. 

TL:DR: As of now I am a single 29 year old, the fattest of his life, living at his moms house, no job, no aspiration to find a job or friends or a significant other, completely wrapped in a cocoon of regret and extreme self hatred for all that I have given and taken away from myself. I am now a cynical being, whose religion is apathy, finding joy in absolutely nothing that he used to, feeling every day that the sweater is unraveling a bit more, and all it needs is one final tug on the string. Not sure about meds. Therapy doesn't really help. I am on my way to becoming a homeless person, i say this not in jest. There may be a bigger chance of that happening than of me taking my own life, which, i don't know if that's good or not. If anyone wants to talk...

**The Five Minute Interview**

It's been fourteen years and I've never told a soul about this until now.  Not that it matters much; they wouldn't have believed me and you probably won't either.  But, it's true.  I was there and I saw it with my own eyes.  To this day, I still am awakened at night from nightmares of it.  And, when those tight-lipped memories bubble into my subconscious, they share as much with wet dreams as nightmares.  But, I digress.  Let me start from the beginning.



It was the winter of 1997 and I had just moved to D.C. with my first husband, Lee, during that summer.  We had finished our undergraduate degrees at Texas A&amp;M, me with Journalism and Lee with Pre-Law, and Lee had been admitted into Georgetown's Law program.  The plan, ill-fated though it was, was for me to get a job as a journalist to help pay for Lee's tuition while he ""invested in our future"".



I was young, twenty-two at the time, a native Texan so constitutionally a greenhorn about the District that I believed my husband and I would have an easier time as an interracial couple there than at College Station.  In all my youthful enthusiasm I honestly thought I would easily land a job at a major rag, maybe even the Post.  After all, I had graduated Summa Cum Laude and was involved in all kinds of ""filler"" for my CV.  It should have been a cinch.



Needless to say, I spent the first three months getting a lesson in what the old boy network in D.C. thinks about Southerners, especially Southern women.  By the time Lee was registering for Winter term, we were dipping way too deeply into our savings and I needed a job.  With dejection growing frighteningly familiar, I tried the unthinkable to my recently emancipated mind: the college paper.



The then-editor of The Hoya took a liking to me for all the wrong reasons and hired me as his Assistant Copywriter, which essentially meant that I'd do the writing that he that was interested in but was too lazy to write himself.  Although I was thankful to get the job, this seemed like a downgrade from life in College Station and after a few days the editor, with his preternatural scrutiny of my every mood and curve, picked up on this and decided to play the friend.



""What if I told you that I've got the inside scoop on the biggest story of next year,"" he said, feigning breathlessness.



""I'd say you like to tell what we call 'Tall Tales',"" as I smiled courteously and suppressed my eyes rolling.



""Oh, this is the tallest of them all, honey,"" he continued, ""and yet it's the genuine article, if you get the pun.""



I coughed out a laugh.



His voice hushed to a whisper and he leaned uncomfortably close, ""President Clinton's errant cock has caught up with him.  The word up the street is that he's been having an affair with a White House intern and this isn't going Gennifer Flowers, either.  He's made plenty of enemies and they intend to put him under a rock for this one.""





Well, now this was interesting.  If it was true, of course.  Maybe you'll remember that a lot of folks were nodding their heads and saying ""duh"" when they heard news.  It wasn't like it was out of character for our President.



""I'm in.  What's the scoop?""



""Hon', I don't know all the details yet,"" as his grin broadened, ""but, that's what you're getting paid for.  What I can give you is a damn good lead.  None other than Hillary Clinton herself is coming to Georgetown to give a speech tomorrow and I want you to try to find out some details about what's going on in her personal life.  She knows about this and the coming shit-storm for sure!""



""Wait, you want me to follow her?""



""Don't be an idiot, Sheri.  She's got Secret Service and all that crap.  I've gotten her PR person to agree to you interviewing her for five minutes afterwards.""



""Holy shit!""""



He looked happier than a Jersey bull sucked off by Dolly Parton, ""Now, look, you can't go and ask her directly about anything because we're not supposed to know.  But, what I need you to do is get inside her skin and see if they're worried.  This bigger than just an article.  There are... people... who want to know.  Anyways, it doesn't matter.  Can you interview her?  Ask her some crap and probe how she's doing?""



""Y-Yes... of course!"" I tried blustering over my embarrassment and genuine nerves, ""It's no big deal.  I minored in Psychology.  I should be able to read her like a book.""



""Uh-huh,"" he dipped and smiled, ""you just get over to the Columbia room at fifteen of two tomorrow and make it happen.  Got it?""



I quickly nodded and mumbled affirmatively.



""Remember, you can't let on that you know.  I've been assured you'll have time up close with her, at least a couple minutes worth.""



  *   *   *   *



I watched the seconds hand tick upwards on the wall clock, ticking each step of the way.  2:16.  Christ, lady, how long are you going to be in there.



Her handlers told me that she needed to take a personal call and would be with me as soon as she was done.  I hadn’t so much as seen her and my nervous bladder was becoming dangerously full, though I didn’t dare move an inch from my seat.  I was going to get this story, come hell or highwater.





“...so you can meet here then?  Downstairs?  Alright, give me a few.  Yep, OK.  Bye,”  Hillary said as she stepped out from behind the door, looking distractedly at the ceiling as she walked and clicking her phone shut with a decisive clack as she fixed her gaze on me.  And, the performance began.



“So, you’re Cherry?” she intoned, extending her flecked hand as her cheeks blossomed into a convincing, many-ringed imitation of a smile.  This was before Botox, after all.



“Yes, Ma’am, ‘Sheri’,” I corrected as gently as was humanly possible, “I’m here from The Hoya to ask a couple questions about your speech.”



“OK, great.  Do you mind if we walk and talk?” she pretended as she briskly stepped towards the hallway, “I’ve got to meet someone in a bit and can’t be late.”



“Of course!” I hurriedly followed along with my Montblanc and pad clutched in hand, “Could you tell me about your plans for promoting SCHIP in 1998?”



“You know, we’ve got many things planned, um, hold on a moment,” she turned to the two Secret Service men shadowing us and added, “Guys, I’m going to need about thirty minutes.  RP at the driver?”



There was a long pause as if there was an inaudible sentence and then the two men in black said in unison, “Yes, Ms Clinton.  Understood.”



They disappeared behind us and we walked silently for what felt like minutes when she suddenly continued, “Anyways, if we’re going to make it a reality for ten years it will take bi-partisan support.  So, of course I will need...”



Her phone buzzed in a strange rhythmic pulse, almost like a code.



“I’m sorry, I’ve got to take this.”



We continued walking as she turned away from me to answer.



“Uh-huh.  Yeah.  Okay.  No, I like that a lot.  Uh-huh.  Sounds like fun.  It’s got to be fast though.  Wait, could you hold on just a second?”



Suddenly she stopped and with simulated embarrassment she turned back to me and covered the mouthpiece of her phone.



“I’m sorry, Sheryl, but could you wait here for a moment?  There’s someone who has something for me down here.  It won’t take long.  Write some notes or something.”



I was helpless to protest as she opened a nondescript brown door and stepped through, shutting it softly behind her.  I bit my lip and crossed my legs, my bladder directing my thoughts to where a bathroom might be.  As I looked around, I heard a slight squeaking sound and stared as the brown door leaked open, spilling a faint light up from its contents.



I waited silently for a moment and, hearing the faint echo of the First Lady talking on her phone, I edged suspiciously towards the door.  It beckoned now, stopping a full inch open, allowing me to see that behind it were metal stairs leading downwards.  As I bent towards the door, my hand almost unconsciously reaching for its handle with my heart pounding, I could almost make out what she was saying.



“You know what it requires... I know it to will be enjoyable... He had his fun, let’s have ours...”



And, then, like a beam of light, I heard another woman’s voice, “I’m ready to begin.  We’ve got a wait ahead and the sooner we start the better.”



Without a clue who was down there with her, my hand, slippery with sweat, pulled the door open ever so gently and, refusing to let my brain think it through, I stepped stealthily into the stairwell.  And, to this day I don't know what the hell I was thinking.



Hillary spoke, “When Bill left here in ’68 he knew big things were in store for him, just like Barry feels over in Chicago.  But, we can’t forget what we’re really about.  That clown John Paul’s time will be up soon and the families will be one again with a new Duce at the head.”



“Barry’s ready for that.  I’m ready, too.  I accept the rite and all that it entails.”



Who was this other person Hillary was talking to?  I crept down the stairs as slowly as I could until I could just begin to make out her face.  Her strong, even manly black features balanced mischievous feminine eyes that switch from stunning to withering in a temperamental instant.  I’d learn several days later that this was Michelle Obama.



Hillary cleared her throat and produced a small, yellowed book from her coat pocket and, drawing a deep breath, began reading in a solemn, serious voice.



“In 1430 our Endless Mother, Joan d’Arc, was accused of mating with Dunois’ donkey, among other blasphemies.  The fraudulent church of course could not understand the ritual of Saturn and so wanted to squash it, even though it secretly arose from their very own pope’s perverted sacredness.  This honor, this privilege of uniting Heaven and Earth remains to the sisterhood even today.”



WHAT?!  I gasped and felt for a moment like I was going to pass out while trying to process this unprocessable information.  Were they pausing?  Had they heard me?  Fear numbed my panic as I steadied myself on the railing and waited, desperately hoping they would continue, uninterrupted.



“Sister Michelle, the Seven Starred House was come to meet with yours today.  We have brought the Golden Ass, as has been ordained.  Prove your submission to greater path of the Order and in this moment wed the donkey with your gifts.”



It was then that my stupefaction cleared sufficiently for me to see that Michelle was wearing a long, light brown robe, several shades lighter than her own chocolate tone.  The robe had a silver fringe and lowered hood and, with me more in shock than had I been abducted by aliens, she pulled the robe cord open and stepped smoothly into pure nakedness as the robe fell behind her.



Her supple, muscular body stood erect, her pear-like breasts attenuated with her gaze, which was directed at something just out of sight.  Past the point of no return, I lowered myself downward, scooting a couple stairs until I saw something I had not seen since College Point, a gray Cypriot Donkey.



Hillary led the donkey to Michelle with a silver-looking rope attached to his tack.  It was easy to see that the donkey was a “he”; the donkey had an enormous grey and white penis longer than its ears sticking out between his furry legs.



Now, growing up in Texas, I’ve seen plenty of animal cocks and they don’t just go sticking out unless there is a female animal of their kind around or they’ve been specially trained to breed, like for artificial insemination.  This donkey, with his hard cock easily as long and thick as my whole arm had been trained for sex and what happened next made that doubly clear.



Michelle put her forehead to the donkey’s and cooed, scratching his ears before sidling along him and kneeling, her sable hands massaging his rear leg in circles that inched towards his cock.



“Hurry, Michelle.  There’s more to the ritual and little time.”



Ms Obama didn’t look up at Hillary, but nodded and smoothly stroked her hands across the beast’s leg to his massive, curved shaft.  She gripped the donkey’s huge member with both her hands together and milked it forwards towards the glans.  The donkey’s eyes blinked rapidly and Michelle, without hesitation, bent her face towards the donkey dick, opened her mouth very wide, and began licking and sucking on the pulsing head of his cock, still stroking his giant root.



Hillary meanwhile removed her pantsuit and stepped into some kind of metallic shorts with complex silver and golden patterns.  Attached to the front of these shiny bloomers was a large but short, tawny white cock made from what looked like ivory.  Hillary dipped her hand into a metal bowl of oil and liberally coated her artificial phallus.



“Let Heaven and Earth meet and the animal and divine again reign in passionate, frothing ecstasy,” she incanted as she got behind Michelle, who was on all fours as she continued to ardently give the donkey head and a handjob.



With an “amen” from both women, Hillary pushed the ivory cock into Michelle’s frizzy pussy and Michelle stopped sucking just long enough to emit a moan before she returned, smiling now, to felating the donkey.  Hillary looked down with unabashed pleasure as she fucked her initiate, writhing in pleasure as the donkey’s slippery pre-cum began to drip from Michelle’s dilated lips.



I’m not proud of what happened next.  In fact, I’m very ashamed of it and I wish it wasn’t part of the story.  But, when I decided to tell the world about what happened, I determined then to state the whole truth and not leave anything out.  Even the most embarrassing parts.



I’ve had a lot of time to think about it and I think I was extremely sexually repressed when this all happened.  Lee and I hadn’t fucked in weeks and growing up Southern Baptist the only thing worse than fucking was dancing.  I’m not saying it as an excuse, but keep in mind that I was, I think, more horny during that winter than probably any other period of my life.  And, we all know, Bill Clinton included, that being horny can affect one’s judgment.



Point being, I was in such shock seeing the extremely lewd acts in front of me that I hadn’t even noticed that my right hand had strayed to between my legs and down my panties.  My knee-length skirt was hiked carelessly to the side and my fingers pressed hard on my pubis as I slid my fingertips up and down across my slippery clit and sopping pussy lips.



I may have been even more surprised by the sight of my finger fucking myself to such obscenity than the otherworldly scene in front of me.  But, I couldn’t stop.  And, even if I could, I didn’t want to.  My hand thrusted up and down between my legs and I arched forward, beginning to cum as Hillary quickened the pace of her fucking Michelle and both women sung their ecstatic rite.



Just as I reached my orgasmic tipping point, strong, large hands gripped each arm and literally lifted me off the seat of the stairs and started downstairs!  I yelled instinctively, but one of the brutes stuffed a musky soft fabric into my mouth and I could only procure a muffled objection.



Then, to my abject horror and yet indescribably relief, I peed myself in front of the two woman as my captors reached the bottom of the stairs.  My face flushed with fiery embarrassment as I felt the hot, wet piss stream all over my legs and ass, soaking my skirt and dripping on to my flats.



When I opened my eyes, both women and the donkey were in the same gyrating sexual dance and the two Secret Service creeps were holding my arms.  Hillary smiled at me and licked her lips.



“Every ritual needs a sacrament.  You look worth every penny we paid that moronic husband of yours.  Don’t worry.  We won’t hurt you,”  Hillary stated authoritatively, “but, you’ll need to play your part for this to be fun.  And, just to erase any doubts about what you’re worth, you’ll be getting a generous... kickback.”



She laughed and the agent to my left roughly pulled a huge wad of cash from his jacket, throwing it on the ground in front of me.  Without delay, the men led me to a thick wool blanket and firmly lowered me to it.  The one who had produced the cash now took out a small tool, like a box cutter and in smooth, professional movements cut my clothes from me in a matter of seconds.  Suddenly naked laying on the bed, the Secret Service men stood up at my sides and the women eased to a stop in their bestial sex and stood up together.



Striding towards me, Michelle Obama soon stood over my recumbent figure, each of her feet by a shoulder of mine.  She got to her knees and squatted her dark pink pussy over my face, leaning forward and balancing herself on the back of a chair.



“Lick my pussy, heathen.  Make me cum with that philistine mouth of yours,” she commanded with beguiling strength as she pulled the gag, which turned out to be a pair of green panties, from my mouth and lowered her steamy cunt on to me.



I had never been with another woman, but I was too far gone now to do much else other than comply and so I raised my face to her glistening pink pussy and licked it like I had many times wished my own pussy to be licked.  Her pussy smelled like cantaloupe and it was wet with her slippery horniness, which soon covered my lips and chin as she slid her crotch back and forth over my fluttering tongue.



As I began to suck on her large clit, I felt my legs being pushed open and Hillary’s hands traced their way from behind my knees down to my ass cheeks.  Squeezing my buttocks and stretching my asshole open, her hands slid from my ass to meet at my aching pussy.  Still very slick with my piss and horniness, she slid three fingers from her left hand into my hole as her right hand slathered more oil on her strap-on cock.



Hillary pushed the head of the ivory cock into my tight pussy, stretching it to a barely comfortable fullness as the top of her pussy pushed hard onto mine with each thrust on her attached dildo.  Michelle grabbed my hair and pushed my face hard into her pussy as I heard motion around me.



“Oooooohhhhhhh...... YEEEESSSSSSSSS!!!!!”



Michelle came hard on my nearly smothered face and when I emerged for air I saw that the two agents had positioned the donkey over us, with his huge cock dangling right behind Michelle’s ass as the men stroked it and their own poles, which at some unseen point they had unzipped and begun masturbating.



Hillary leaned back allowing them room as she started fucking with deeper, longer strokes and the men’s hands dripped oil on my exposed belly as they moved the donkey’s cock just a couple inches from Michelle’s asshole.  One of the men begin probing two of his fingers in the nubile woman’s butt, generously lubricating it.



Soon all four fingers on his hand slid easily in and out of Michelle’s asshole and were replaced with the fat, oblong head of the donkey’s cock.  Michelle quickly vibrated her fingers on her clit as the men began pushing the huge penis into her ass.



“Mmmmm.....   Oooooohhh.....   More!!”



The men continued to slide their hands up and down the donkey’s shaft and balls, allowing the donkey only to enter about five or six inches into Michelle’s yielding asshole.  The future First Lady propelled her ass up and down on the animal’s dong, matching the rhythm of Hillary who was getting more and more vocal as she pushed her ivory cock into me.



“Eat my pussy, you heretic!” Michelle said as she roughly pulled  my head back up to her pussy.



As if in response, Hillary announced while she thrust her cock into me faster and faster, “the most sacred part of the ritual now begins!  Let us mix the profane and the sacred, the dirty and the clean, until we are one with the gods.  Purify us with what is taboo.  Expose our souls to the most divine truth: the mundane!”



All four of these shocking Bacchanalians then said together, “amen”, and even the donkey brayed as it came, overflowing Michelle’s lovely ass with thick squirt after squirt of donkey cum that poured out all over my breasts, belly, and down to the tops of our copulating pussies.  Michelle thrust her butt outwards over me as the animal spunk spilled from her gaping asshole and grunted, discharging a loud, wet fart from her rear.



She grunted again, and a huge squirt of donkey cum, mixed with her fresh brown shit exploded from her asshole and onto Hillary’s breasts and face.  Hillary licked her lips and slid downwards to lay right on top of me as Michelle moved forward.



“Mmmmmmmmm.....  Kiss me, disbeliever,” Hillary Clinton ordered as our bodies smeared the wet, slimy mess of donkey cum and shit between us and she tongue kissed me vigorously.


I could taste the sourness of Michelle’s shit in the salty glaze of donkey cum as Hillary fucked me faster and faster.  With a reckless abandon I’ve never felt before or since, our lusty, smelly rutting mounted to a mammoth orgasm Hillary and I shared for what seemed like minutes as my mind flooded with the most intense pleasure I’ve ever dreamed of.



When I awoke, I was in a warm, clean blanket and had been cleaned of all sign of what happened.  I never again saw or spoke to Hillary, Michelle, or either Secret Service men, but I was given the wad of cash and a very clear message that I would never be believed if I tried to tell anyone so why mess up my own life trying to mess up theirs.



I left D.C. that night, divorced Lee in a record two weeks, and moved to Belize before Spring where I’ve lived ever since.  I don’t intend to mess up anyone’s life by revealing this story and I’m sure you won’t believe me.  But, it certainly gives me at least something to think about when I figure that the Monica Lewinsky affair was probably the least scandalous thing about the White House.  And, even when it wakes me up in the middle of the night, I’d rather finger myself remembering that day than eat fried chicken.

r82ps,27,2012-03-22,There is hope. My update 7 weeks later. ,[deleted],leaves,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/r82ps/there_is_hope_my_update_7_weeks_later/,"Hey r/leaves! I hope this post finds everyone in good health and fighting the good fight against MJ addiction. This sub-reddit greatly aided me in my endeavor to quit seven weeks ago. I would like to relate my experiences with MJ addiction up to now.




I have smoked since I was 17. I did not start the heavy abuse till I was 21. I started smoking MJ daily along with tobacco in the form cigarettes and spliffs (MJ and Tobacco). I really lost motivation for anything. My addictions genesis can be placed on breaking with my girlfriend of 3 years. This is a big pitfall by me, I turned to MJ to cope with our problems. I lost motovation to succes or do anything really. 




I began playing World of Warcraft, pretty seriously too. I started raiding 4 nights a week and toking. Combining those two addictions is far worse than any type of addiction I have experienced before. I was in my own dream world, a hazy fog with only the pursuit of purple pixels in my immediate future. I started to think more and more that my life's ambition of getting a minimum paying job and playin WoW was a reasonable one. 




I stopped playing WoW after I had a depressive episode. I crashed really hard people. Taken out of school a semester before graduation, put on anti-depressants and started seeing a psychiatrist. My parents, bless their souls, really helped pull me out. However, I still toked.




 I went back to university to finish my last semester. I decided not to smoke for my last semester. I was a semester from graduating prior to my bout with depression. Thus, upon my return all my friends were gone. It was a lonely semester but it allowed to focus on work. It was during this time that I realized my reliance on drugs (MJ prior, anti-depressants and tobacco) really messed with me. I quit my anti-depressants cold turkey but still smoked cigarettes. I graduated and returned home.




 I had graduated from university with a degree in a field I did not wish to pursue. I began to be interested in politics and realized that I wanted to make a difference in the government by helping to get decent individuals elected to office. After graduation, I landed an internship on a prestigious senatorial campaign staff for the summer with hopes of receiving a full-time position. 




But I also returned to smoking pretty often with friends. Towards the end July, my smoking spiraled out of control. I quit my internship because of that all too familiar lack of motivation. I was playing video games and started working at a restaurant as a waiter to supplement my video game and MJ purchases. I subsequently quit the job a month later due to heavy MJ use that rendered me useless.




During this time I met a girl who I began dating. Unlike any girl I have met, she understood and tolerated my MJ and tobacco habits. I only smoked with her once so all the other times I was with her, I was sober. The time I spent with her allowed me a glimpse of the other side of life that I used drugs to shy away from. The life of love and happiness generated by being with another person who understands your soul. I tell you this because she was/is my support system. 




In January of this year I made a promise to myself to quit cigarettes. I did it and have not smoked once since December 31st. I supplemented my cold turkey quit of tobacco with heavier MJ use, browsing r/stopssmoking for support and talking to my girlfriend about all the feelings I had been going through. Anyway, the MJ abuse full blow. It got to the point where I did not want my parents knowing I smoked MJ so I would hit my bowl in the bathroom that had an exhaust while sitting on the toilet. I felt like shit while on the shitter-a new low.




Finally, in February I decided to quit MJ. I came here to r/leaves for support. I quit cold turkey on Febraury 1st because I was unemployed, living at my parent's house, felt like a sack of shit and just generally sad about where I was in life. I had to make moves at some point. 




So I began my journey to sobriety. I frequented r/leaves everyday. This sub-reddit helped me immensely through the tough times when I would want to give in. Your stories assured me withdrawal was just as bad as 
I felt it was. I am confident in saying that MJ withdrawal is the hardest addiction I have ever kicked. It is harder than tobacco, anti-depressants and pain killers for me at least. It really sucked. I was angry, irritated, emotional and all sorts of sucky for 3-4 weeks. 




At the behest of this community I began working out and looking for jobs. I was productive, that's key. I found that you have to replace the time you spent smoking MJ with something else. I had a support system with my girlfriend. I talked to her about all the feelings I had going through this process and she listened. She was the rock I leaned on during these hard times. 




All my best friends smoked as heavily as I did, so I was hanging out with them less and less. It's tough as balls to be in the MJ smoking environment when you are trying to quit. I didn't hang out with them for the first 2 weeks of me quitting MJ. It's not a sign of weakness, just a necessary step. 




Anyway, after quitting MJ I started to feel the positive affects. The lift of a foggy haze, the renewed energy, one less mouth to feed (weed) and finally, the improved mental capacity. 



So now the update of how I am doing in life now. I have been doing fantastic. I got a job on a congressional campaign staff in a Republican district that has the very real possibility of going from Red to Blue. And I'm on the blue side. I moved out of my parents house. I work from 9am to 8pm everyday doing what I love. I have natural highs and lows during the day but the highs are a lot more frequent. I have really excelled however. They love me here and in my short time here, I was already promoted. I was told if I keep my level of work up then they'll have no choice but to keep moving me up and giving me more responsibility.    The hours are long but for the first time in a long time I feel happy in my life. 




I'm going to conclude this by saying, thank you r/leaves. I show all my friends who asked me how I quit, this sub-reddit. Everyone who posts here, whether you receive a response/upvote or not, are doing a great service to those in need. 




From the bottom of my heart, thank you for helping me. It's been a long journey so far but I have no plans on stopping this car ride that we call life-the sights are too damn beautiful."

I know many of you are college students and some are most likely not even in the field yet but merely searching around.  I think it's quite obvious that the job market for quality engineers is stable and growing despite a weakening economy.  Regardless of the financial benefit I know more happy engineers with their careers than any other profession (I don't know any professional athletes, though).  It's a great path to take.

If you have questions about school or the interview process I know there are plenty of others here that have recently completed or are currently involved and I'm sure they'll comment on their availability for you.  I am a medical devices hardware engineer currently but have experience in HW and SW from two separate extended internships.

I'd also like to know something for those who stopped by here that are currently employed as EE's...are you happy with your job?  What would you change?

Thanks!

Hey /r/forhire. I've just started applying for summer internships, so I figured I may as well look for some offers here too.

I'm currently a sophomore at Carnegie Mellon intending to major in CS, with a decent level of experience in both Web dev and systems (most recently, I owned the [Stripe CTF challenge](https://stripe.com/blog/capture-the-flag)). I'm looking for development/engineering work, but if something *really* compelling comes along on the sysadmin side of things I'll take a look at it too.

I'll work anywhere in the US or abroad (provided I can get a visa), but I'd really like to spend the summer in either Silicon Valley or pretty much any major European/Asian city where I can mostly get around with English. Like I said in the title, I'm also really interested in startups, so if you're contacting me from a startup let me know what you do and who you're funded by!

If anyone is interested in setting up an interview, just shoot me a PM or email me at rlester@cmu.edu."

[Willing to share any close calls with us?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/r9ts3/i_run_a_small_ngo_that_works_primarily_in_uganda/c444ojw?context=5)|I wrote this recently about an experience I had in Haiti after the earthquake...closest call I've experienced to date...
 |It was nine days after the infamous earthquake shot the nation of Haiti to the top of the world interest charts.
 |I was with a small medical team treating open wounds in a massive tent city near the center of Port-au-Prince, the capitol city.
 |This particular day, things did not go according to plan.
 |As I reached the top of the hill with my translator, Peter, and completely out of earshot or eyesight of the rest of our team, we were surrounded by about twenty very angry men. They were armed with blunt objects, clenched fists and were ready for their voices to be heard.
 |A man who was self-appointed ringleader got right in my face and began screaming...
 |“Why are you here?!”
 |“We don’t have any food!”
 |“We don’t have any money!”
 |“We are hungry!”
 |“My daughter is very injured!”
 |“Why hasn’t Obama come to help us?”
 |The men pressed closer, and by this time my heart was racing. 
 |I wondered how much longer until the beat-down began. 
 |I wondered how long it would take until I was unconscious.
 |I was speechless. My mind was flipping through a rolodex of things to say but every sheet came up blank.
 |So I prayed.
 |What happened next still astonishes me, and as I remember the moment, it still doesn’t feel like it was really me.
 |I placed both my hands gently on his shoulders (which, by the way, is the very LAST thing you should EVER do to the person who is ready to beat you down.)
 |The group of men all stopped and stared at him, waiting to get his reaction.
 |Then, out of my mouth stumbled these words...
 |“I am so sorry...I have no idea how painful and difficult all of this is for you, but I need you to listen to me...”
 |All eyes on the leader.
 |“Ok,” he replied, “I will listen to you.”
 |More words stumbled out...
 |“I don’t have any food...if I had enough food, I’d come back and feed everyone in this city, but all I have is medicine and I need you help...”
 |He looked me in the eyes, “Ok, we will help you. What do you need us to do?”
 |We explained what we were doing, they agreed, and I pushed my way outside the mob and began putting distance between us as quickly as I could. No sense sticking around a hornet’s nest, right?
 |But suddenly, a realization hit me, and I stopped.
 |If I leave now, I’ll only remember that man as the “angry guy in the tent city”.
 |I turned and called to him, “Hey, what’s your name?”
 |“My name is Isaac,” he called back, “do you want to meet my family?”
 |“I would love to meet your family,” I replied.
 |Isaac led me by the arm to a dusty sheet draped over some wooden rods, pulled back the flap and there they were. He proudly introduced me to each member. 
 |He wasn’t the “angry guy in the tent city”...he was a loving husband...caring father...a man defending his family. Just like I would have done.
[Thank you for taking the time to write out this story.  I find it completely amazing that you were able to relate to him after all that, I wonder if he felt the same way about you. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/r9ts3/i_run_a_small_ngo_that_works_primarily_in_uganda/c4451mm?context=5)|I'd like to think so. It was the most surreal situation I've ever experienced.
[That's.. incredible..   Have you been in a dangerous situation in Uganda as well? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/r9ts3/i_run_a_small_ngo_that_works_primarily_in_uganda/c4456vt?context=5)|Nothing quite like this. I'm sure the day will come.
[What are the biggest problems with treating a former child soldier?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/r9ts3/i_run_a_small_ngo_that_works_primarily_in_uganda/c442rux?context=5)|From what we've experienced, it's reintegration. Helping them establish a new sense or ""normalcy"" that doesn't have anything to do with ""kill or be killed"", or being used as bait, or psychological abuse.
 |We work with a partner Ugandan organization that will actually take many of these children (the majority of which do not have immediate family, or are not wanted any longer), and house, educate, and treat them in a safe, family-oriented environment. 
 |We work with another child psychologist who uses a lot of art therapies that have also been very effective.
 |Where our projects are based in Central Uganda (an area known as the Luwero Triangle), it has the highest population of abandoned or orphaned children in the entire country. We've discovered this is a direct result of the aftermath of the Bush War in the 1980s. When the current Ugandand president Museveni led a coup in 85-86, he also used child soldiers to take down the government. What's interesting is, while I don't know anyone who speaks favorably of Kony or the LRA, they were very supportive of the Bush War tactics. TL;DR - we don't like child soldiers if we don't agree with the politics.
 |When the dust settled in the Bush War, the leftover children returned to their villages to find many of their families had fled. When these kids hit puberty, they began fathering/mothering children, but no one was there to help them really learn the ropes of life. This has led to all kinds of problems. 
 |The struggles they have are deep seeded. They've seen/experienced/participated in things none of us will ever quite understand. From watching their parents shot right in front of them, to actually being the shooter themselves, to being raped a dozen times a day. Helping them to the point of processing and healing is long, and only for the most patient and caring.
[Fuck, those all sound like terrible problems to have.   Definitely gives some perspective to those of us complaining of our firstworldproblems.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/r9ts3/i_run_a_small_ngo_that_works_primarily_in_uganda/c4457v2?context=5)|It certainly makes our first world issues seem quite insignificant and silly.
[How is someone physically able to rape someone that many times per day? And, from a mental perspective, how does it affect their sexual development later on in life?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/r9ts3/i_run_a_small_ngo_that_works_primarily_in_uganda/c445d2y?context=5)|It's different men. And, depending on the fortitude of the child, it can range from absolute destruction of their sexual development to leaving them relatively unharmed. Physically, however, can still be a challenge. Some of the rapes are brutally inhumane.
[You should teach those kids the stock market and turn em loose on wall street and take a percentage.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/r9ts3/i_run_a_small_ngo_that_works_primarily_in_uganda/c44a0jf?context=5)|GENIUS! Now I just need some brokers to help me set that up...
[How much money do you make?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/r9ts3/i_run_a_small_ngo_that_works_primarily_in_uganda/c44410u?context=5)|Last year I made $13,000 from my organization (and I have the W-2 to prove it). My goal is to make my entire salary from something OTHER than my non profit so I can put as much as possible into the work on the ground.
[Want do you believe to be the most concrete difference that you are making?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/r9ts3/i_run_a_small_ngo_that_works_primarily_in_uganda/c44410u?context=5)|Most concrete difference is in building trust and relationships. When we first began, a professor from Coventry Uni in England told me to spend at least 45 minutes in conversation with Ugandans before they'd stop telling me what they thought I wanted to hear, and started sharing what they really thought. He was right. Once trust is developed, progress can be made.
[Do you pay your interns?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/r9ts3/i_run_a_small_ngo_that_works_primarily_in_uganda/c44410u?context=5)|All our staff / interns (including me) raise support.
[What do you see your self doing in 10 years?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/r9ts3/i_run_a_small_ngo_that_works_primarily_in_uganda/c44410u?context=5)|In 10 years, I'd like to be a bigger voice for effective work in areas of poverty and culture, but continuing to work with the people in Uganda I work with now. (They've become GREAT friends!)
[As a financial manager for several non-profits, I get annoyed at people who demand justification for salaries, especially administrative salaries. No good comes from starving the employees of social service programs. A staff of martyrs is not effective. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/r9ts3/i_run_a_small_ngo_that_works_primarily_in_uganda/c445fdc?context=5)|You speak truth.
[Can you please give me some context for the 13k, how much is used for expenses, do you have a high standard of living?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/r9ts3/i_run_a_small_ngo_that_works_primarily_in_uganda/c44a5h4?context=5)|13k was my personal salary, out of everything we raised. And no - I don't have a high standard of living (well, not compared to most Americans). We live in a small house, have two used paid off cars, and no debt.
[Are there any hot hippie chicks working with your NGO?  If so, have you banged them?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/r9ts3/i_run_a_small_ngo_that_works_primarily_in_uganda/c442vg5?context=5)|My wife is hot, and was nicknamed hippie chick quite some years back.
 |I bang her. Frequently.

[I saw your comment discussing how Ugandans feel about KONY 2012, but what are *your own* thoughts on Invisible Children's campaign? Please excuse me if this has been answered already. I only had the time to roughly skim the comments.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/r9ts3/i_run_a_small_ngo_that_works_primarily_in_uganda/c444s4d?context=5)|I’m concerned about a renewed “saviour” mentality. (i.e., here we come to fix all your problems because we’ve decided you can’t fix them yourselves.)  I’m hopeful that the KONY2012 campaign has awakened an incredibly healthy conversation about how we can work together for genuine good in the world. Warlords like Joseph Kony simply must understand that these kinds of brutal legacies will not go unnoticed any longer.  I’m hopeful we can take what IC has started and make it better with time. Just like companies produce better / updated versions of their products, so we must produce better versions of our humanitarian efforts as well.
[Thanks for doing what you do, by the way.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/r9ts3/i_run_a_small_ngo_that_works_primarily_in_uganda/c444s4d?context=5)|Working for good is messy, and we get it wrong…often. But snuffing out the flame of injustice is always a worthy cause, as long as our personal pride or ideology doesn’t overshadow the ones we’re investing in along the way.
[*I’m concerned that the people at the very center of this story (in the African nations affected) will be ultimately left out.*  *I’m concerned about a renewed “saviour” mentality. (i.e., here we come to fix all your problems because we’ve decided you can’t fix them yourselves.)*  Wasn't this tried multiple times? With not so good results? And then taught in schools to kids?

[What prevents Ugandans from helping themselves?

A lot. In fact, I've met some incredibly genius people living there. Many of the villagers we interact with actually CHOOSE to live in their village instead of moving to the ""big city"". They like the simpler life and I can't fault them at all.
 |I'd say the main issue we run into is simply access. All we try to do is provide access, then see what they do with it.
 |When we help install a clean water well, the village puts together a committee to oversee the well, they elect officials, develop rules, collect maintenance fees from villagers and run the entire program themselves...we just provided access...they did the rest.
[Thanks for the answer. Sorry, what is ""access""? For a water well, do you just provide the money? The engineering plans? Build the well yourself? Run the well? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/r9ts3/i_run_a_small_ngo_that_works_primarily_in_uganda/c4450u9?context=5)|Funding.
 |We have a Ugandan staff person that hires local engineers / well companies to do the work.
 |We have another Ugandan staffer that runs a week long hygiene training for the entire village (that we fund).
 |At the end of the week we turn it over to the village and they (with our help) take the next steps.
 |We provide periodic followup.
[Why can't they build a well themselves?  Do they not have ugandan contractors?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/r9ts3/i_run_a_small_ngo_that_works_primarily_in_uganda/c446bji?context=5)|Functioning national government? Eh...not for the people I work with...which is why we work where we do.
[Do they have a functioning national government?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/r9ts3/i_run_a_small_ngo_that_works_primarily_in_uganda/c446bji?context=5)|And yes - they CAN dig a well themselves, we're simply helping them along. They're not stupid or incapable, just ignored.
[I was unsure if there was something holding them back, or some skill to adequate well-digging.  I wasn't implying anything mean.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/r9ts3/i_run_a_small_ngo_that_works_primarily_in_uganda/c446veh?context=5)|No worries. Just wanna make sure I adequately explain....we tend to take things like that for granted!
[Are all the former child soldiers that you work with better for their experience? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/r9ts3/i_run_a_small_ngo_that_works_primarily_in_uganda/c442wt1?context=5)|It depends. We've interacted with a few that are now adults with families, and when you encounter them, you can tell they switched off their feelings a long time ago. This frequently leads to abandonment, alcoholism, abuse, etc. Their wives feel a great burden for their well-being, but are often resolved that it may never change anything.
[ are they mostly empathy-lacking sociopaths who wouldn't flinch seeing a family being murdered due to their exposure to such acts on a daily basis?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/r9ts3/i_run_a_small_ngo_that_works_primarily_in_uganda/c442wt1?context=5)|One particular family we spend time with in our main project village watched their father shot to death in the foyer of their home...yet, they all live very normal lives, and we haven't noticed any lingering emotional damage at all.
[How did you end up doing what you do?  Thanks for doing this AMA!  Your answers are a treat to read.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/r9ts3/i_run_a_small_ngo_that_works_primarily_in_uganda/c4435m1?context=5)|The desire to work in the humanitarian field began when I was very young. In my early 20s, I worked with youth in several Christian non-profits, but finally got fed up with the religiously bent projects, quit, and started SafeWorld. It's been the hardest, most challenging, rewarding thing I've ever done.
[What do you think would be the most effective way for someone now to start working at an NGO?  I would be very interested in working for a charity overseas but don't really know where to begin!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/r9ts3/i_run_a_small_ngo_that_works_primarily_in_uganda/c444rms?context=5)|I'd spend some time really thinking through the what's and why's of your desire...then begin searching from there...and get ready to not make ANY money :)
[Having worked for religious and secular non-profits, what do you think are  pros and cons of religious and secular non-profit organizations?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/r9ts3/i_run_a_small_ngo_that_works_primarily_in_uganda/c446kqx?context=5)|I'd say the biggest challenge is when an org (of any affiliation) veers too far into a particular agenda that people begin falling through the cracks. 
 |Pros for me (in a secular NGO) is that I can sit at many tables of conversation I couldn't if I espoused religious affiliation. 
[Do you know any specific places to go, websites where NGO's might pick up volunteers from for example? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/r9ts3/i_run_a_small_ngo_that_works_primarily_in_uganda/c445hm3?context=5)|I happen to be developing just that kind of site as we speak :)

 |Reality is - we're all broken people trying to come up with the ""perfect solution"". It won't happen, but my personal philosophy is to go in quietly, build trust and relationships, listen more than I talk, THEN take action. So far it's worked well.
[Last bit: Why do you think that people began using child soldiers? What makes them such a valuable asset? How 'big' is the child soldier problem in respect to the daily hardships (food, water, and medicine)? If people had fresh water, decent food, and decently equipped hospitals and pharmacies, would most of Uganda's problems go away?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/r9ts3/i_run_a_small_ngo_that_works_primarily_in_uganda/c445sxy?context=5)|Children are easy to control, and there's a lot of them. In the grand scheme, I think they just blend in with the grand scheme. They're used all over the world for violent ends, but I believe medicine and education are by far the greatest needs.
[What's up with that Zombie disease going on over there?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/r9ts3/i_run_a_small_ngo_that_works_primarily_in_uganda/c444w0u?context=5)|I'm not quite sure.

[I visited your website and it says 90% of donations goes to project work and 10% to administration/savings. Those numbers are too round to be actual average expenses and I can't find any audits posted on your website. Charity Navigator doesn't have your organization listed or your parent organization as far as I can tell. Could you point reddit to any more information about your NGOs financials? Also, just out of curiosity, do you guys do any kind of impact evaluation like surveying how many people are still using the bed nets 6 months later, if the bore holes you drill continue to function one year later, does waterborne disease incidence go down?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/r9ts3/i_run_a_small_ngo_that_works_primarily_in_uganda/c445q7y?context=5)|For the last 3 years we operated as a branch of a larger organization and as of January 2012 became our own entity. I have PDFs available for the last 3 years of our specific accounts that I'd be happy to share.
 |As far as 2012 goes, at the end of the year, we'll fund an external audit and make all these numbers available ASAP.
 |We do indeed do followup on our projects. So far every borehole we'e dug continues to operate properly and water quality is good. We're just beginning mosquito net followup, but in the first 5 villages we've covered, they're still being used (we do a training for the nets before we distribute so villagers understand function and proper use).
 |Waterborne disease has indeed dropped, but we equate that more with our in-depth hygiene training rather than the wells.
[Is your job really stressful?  Do you empathize with the desire to run naked into a busy intersection ala Jason Russell?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/r9ts3/i_run_a_small_ngo_that_works_primarily_in_uganda/c444oe3?context=5)|There are days :)
 |The job can be very stressful, mostly because the world is an incredibly complicated place, yet in America we (as non profit leaders) are asked to make everything so simple that people can understand and be compelled to give. On the other side of things, completing projects are often more expensive than you planned...take longer than expected...and include a huge balancing act to make sure you're not running over the people you're attempting to help while trying to appease donors' wishes.
[Would you say that some attention is better than none?  I totally understand what you're saying, but it also seems like a good excuse for apathy.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/r9ts3/i_run_a_small_ngo_that_works_primarily_in_uganda/c446mha?context=5)|I'm convinced humanity doesn't ever need an excuse to be apathetic. We are pretty much experts at it. 
[There is a lot of time, money and energy spent tracking down war criminals like Ratko Mladic but that doesn't seem to get as much criticism as the campaign to bring Kony to justice.

Thanks for doing this AMA!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/r9ts3/i_run_a_small_ngo_that_works_primarily_in_uganda/c443woc?context=5)|Counselors that specialize in working with children are invaluable. International relations, social work...education. All very useful degrees.
 |Invisible Children is one of hundreds of potential organizations. Reality is, most organizations that do incredible works aren't often heard from...which is for the best. My personal opinion is that too much publicity can ruin a good thing.
[What is the age range of the child soldiers?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/r9ts3/i_run_a_small_ngo_that_works_primarily_in_uganda/c443469?context=5)|I believe the vast majority are between 6-15 years of age.

 |Right now we're working primarily with a parish if 8 villages in Luwero Triangle, but we also have impact in Kampala, Manafwa and Gulu.
 |In all total projects, we've employed nearly 100 locals at different times. Currently, we're working on developing more long term employment opportunities (but that takes more time than I previously realized)
[I want to help by donating money.

The prism with which they view culture, religion, and politics will never match ours. What they consider peaceful, we consider chaos...every nation seems to have an ebb and flow to it, and I think Uganda has been relatively peaceful for a while. That could change any day.

[Why is that?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/r9ts3/i_run_a_small_ngo_that_works_primarily_in_uganda/c443845?context=5)|Currently there are a few opposition parties that are ""testing the waters"". Some of the protests are turning somewhat violent (although not out of control)...

WHat are the biggest issues facing the people of Uganda today?

I’m concerned that it’ll become “just another hyped up thing”. (Because we’re pretty good at that in America.) I’m concerned that a NGO is participating in assisting a military operation. (However nuanced their participation might be.) I’m concerned that the people at the very center of this story (in the African nations affected) will be ultimately left out. I’m concerned too much time and attention and resources might be spent on the wrong things. I’m concerned about a renewed “saviour” mentality. (i.e., here we come to fix all your problems because we’ve decided you can’t fix them yourselves.) But… I’m hopeful that the KONY2012 campaign has awakened an incredibly healthy conversation about how we can work together for genuine good in the world. Warlords like Joseph Kony simply must understand that these kinds of brutal legacies will not go unnoticed any longer. I’m hopeful this will lead to healing and restoration of thousands affected by brutal injustice in the focal region. I’m hopeful we can take what IC has started and make it better with time. Just like companies produce better / updated versions of their products, so we must produce better versions of our humanitarian efforts as well. Working for good is messy, and we get it wrong…often. But snuffing out the flame of injustice is always a worthy cause, as long as our personal pride or ideology doesn’t overshadow the ones we’re investing in along the way. Human trafficking, child soldiers, and sex slavery are three abhorrent practices that cannot ever become acceptable. I believe Invisible Children at the very least has raised that point well.

ran8i,0,2012-03-23,Possibly wont graduate for going over word count on a paper. What can I do?,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ran8i/possibly_wont_graduate_for_going_over_word_count/,"I've been holding off on posting this for a while, but I've gotten to the point where I need help. I know reddit is a friendly, caring community, most of the time, so I know you guys will have so decent advice for me. 

Let me start by introducing myself, I'm a senior in college. I've been attending Fresno State for the last 4 years, and I'm typically a good student. 3.7 GPA, and I usually get all A's and B's. I'm working two jobs, one at the school paper, and one at the local paper and I also and working an internship with Pokernews.com. This should be my final semester at State, but I've encountered a huge problem.


It started about a month ago when for one of my professors asked up to write a paper. I wrote the paper with no questions asked, and submitted it before the deadline. After submitting my paper, I realized I was a few words over the 1000 word word count, 35 to be exact. 

I spoke with the professor about this the day after I submitted the paper. I told him the problem, and even asked if he wanted me to resubmit a shorter paper. He told me not to worry about it, so I didn't.

I get my grade on the paper a few weeks later, and I had received a 0 on the paper with the only comment being that I had gone over word count. 

Immediately after seeing this, I sent him an email, reminding him of the conversation we had. 

This is what I sad: 

&gt; Professor XXXXX,

&gt; I spoke to you about the word count of my paper after class one day. It was at 1035, and I asked you if that would be acceptable or If I could go and fix it. You told me not to worry about it, but when I looked at my grade, I had listed a 0. I am wondering if there is anything I can do about this? Please get back to me. 

He responded this:

&gt; I remember this conversation.  I told you to not worry about it.  But you made an assumption; I did not say you would get credit, I just said don't worry about it.  And although you apparently didn't understand this at the time, I said that because there was nothing you could do at that point.  You would have had to fix the paper, and resubmit before the deadline, which had already passed when you talked to me.  The deadlines and rules about word count are strict. I would never tell someone that the rules don't apply.  Sorry if there was a misunderstanding.  However, this does not have to influence your grade that much, if at all.  As long as you complete all 5 of papers in the course, this zero you got for going over word count will be replaced by the average of the other four papers.

While this would usually be fine, I had work a double shift one weekend, and didn't submit a paper, thinking it would be ok and that I would be fine to not submit one paper. Now this 0 is coming back to haunt me, and it is making it almost impossible to pass the course, I would have to get a perfect on every last quiz and paper just to get a mid range D. 

I went and spoke to him the next day, asking if there was any possible way I could receive credit for the paper, and explaining that without the paper grade it would be nearly impossible to pass the class. 

His responses was I'm sorry, there's nothing I can do, the rules have to apply to everyone.

While I understand his sentiments, it's not as if I didn't submit the paper. I did the work. I submitted the paper on time. I studied the material and learned what I needed to write and do the paper obviously, but because I was 35 words over word count, I now cannot pass the class. 

Sadly enough, this is one of the last classes I need to graduate, and if I fail, I will not get my diploma. While it wouldn't necessarily be a huge deal, I could take another semester and retake the class, I sadly cannot afford to do that.

My question reddit, is what can I do from here? Where can I go? Who can I talk to? I've already spoken to my parents about the issue and they are supportive of me. I also spoke to my adviser who suggest I speak with the professor, which obviously didn't accomplish anything.

Is it fair to punish a student, possibly a lifetime punishment, for simply going 35 words over a word count? The point of school to me is to learn. I learned the material, and did what was asked as me, but because I slipped and missed a word count now I cannot graduate? I can understand losing a few points for going over word count, but to receive a 0 on a paper that I spent time and effort on is just ludicrous to me. I turned my assignment in on time. I was always taught that going above and beyond what was asked of you was how you got an A. 

Apparently, I was wrong. It's how you get an F. 

Also why would he tell me not to worry about it, if I should have been worrying this entire month?

Redditors, have you ever encountered something like this? What is my course of action here? I would really appreciate some advice, and some feedback, and I know this is a great place to look for it.

Check it out if you haven't heard of it.,[deleted],Miami,https://www.reddit.com/r/Miami/comments/ra6gb/any_other_musicians_going_to_the_south_fl_music/,"Hey, fellow artists (or curious redditors who clicked the link). Just wanted to make you aware of the upcoming Get Together for musicians and anyone in the scene. It's going to be at Churchill's Pub, Wednesday, March 28.

I'm not a promoter or organizer for the event, I just happened to attend the one last month and found it to be great help and a lot of fun. This will be the third, and they do it every month at a different venue. There are other bands to meet, bloggers, reviewers, radio interns, promoters, venue owners, etc... It's not a competitive environment at all, unlike feeling like I need to gather a show before another band, it's just a fun get together to make connections in the scene.

[Here is the Facebook event.](http://www.facebook.com/events/192901717480202/)

[And the get-together page.](http://www.facebook.com/flmusicgettogether)

I know Miami has a lot of great musicians and I've seen some in r/miami. The only thing I think I need to warn is that if you're a producer/dj/primarily electronic artist, you might not have the warmest welcome. It's great for indie, punk, metal, whatever. Basically if your music would be played in a club and not a venue. This isn't my opinion, just a lot of the members have that ""if it's a computer, it must be easy"" mentality stuck to them. But let's not comment on that here."

We've been together for about a year and a half. We've gone through a lot together and we love each other. At the time we started dating I was in school and she was in graduate school. I was being supported by my parents so I could afford to take her out on dates and to dinner. Since I graduated I've been supporting myself and through a series of unfortunate events was forced to move out of the rent free accommodations I was staying while attending school (my grandma's house) and am working for $8 an hour. 

I can barely pay my rent and bills now and usually we have been splitting the bill when we do go out, but for a period of time she was the one to pay as I was unemployed. She has brought up the fact that she has to pay numerous times and I try to explain to her that I just cannot afford to take us out. She knows that my patents were supporting me at the beginning of our relationship and I guess she got used to being treated that way, me paying for everything. 

She constantly says we don't see enough of each other (twice a week sometimes more) but we both work full time, her at an unpaid internship while getting her masters and receiving loan money. I try to explain that we are both working now and it won't be like it was when we were in school. She says it's not a relationship.

She also constantly brings up marriage and while I do discuss it with her and tell her that I do see us being together in the future, I don't quite understand the point of marriage if we aren't planning on having children. It doesn't mean I don't believe in it, I just feel like no way am I ready for that and I don't like feeling pressured to do something because society says you should. Maybe I'll come to understand it more when I get older but I honestly think there is no benefit to marriage in this modern world.

She is a great girl and I am happy being with her but lately it has been difficult, she has said she isn't happy, mainly because she has had to pay when we go out. Now mind you I am the one that is doing the driving always, with gas at $3.99 a gallon, I am always the one to visit her, that doesn't seem to factor in for her. She compares me to her ex boyfriend who sounds like a loser bum who she also had to pay for everything, but he wasn't working at all. She compares him to me also when I get depressed.

I don't know what else to do to make her happy, I can't afford to buy her dinner, but I did take her to see the lorax and bought her five guys recently so I mean I am trying. I feel like we get along great and always have fun when we are together. 

There is one other thing that is starting to get to me now. We haven't had sex. She is a virgin and has cerebral palsy and each time we attempted it hurt her too much. She went to her obgyn and got a gel that will numb her so it won't hurt her so much because she is extremely tight. We do perform oral on each other but no penetrative sex. I have been a very patient boyfriend and have never pressured her or made her feel guilty about it but I do not know how much longer I can go without. I am a very sexual person, her not as much. I just want to have sex with my girlfriend whom I love. I feel like that could be taking its toll on us also.

I know that was a lot to read but I needed to vent. Other than those things we really have great communication overall and we rarely fight. Any advice would be appreciated.

TLDR: girlfriend of a year and a half upset that I can no longer afford to pay for everything. Insistent on talking about marriage when I'm not ready or in a good place to even consider it. Have yet to have penetrative sex.

r9pze,1,2012-03-23,"This time, I'm going for greater than the gold.",jrk08004,NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/r9pze/this_time_im_going_for_greater_than_the_gold/,"Hello there. I've stumbled upon this subreddit multiple time lately from various other subreddit comment threads. Usually these threads show a complete lack of understanding for this type of goal, but I understand well. I'll tell my tale, with hope that it can continue to help, as I had never fully revealed everything until now. Sorry if this is a bit long.


I'm new to this subreddit, but not new to the idea. With a strong background in Roman Catholicism, I have always been *against* doing these things, but had found that it was becoming more difficult to stop. Sadly, when I was around 10, I stumbled upon pornographic content while looking for a certain video game online. This of course led to my inevitable and eventual downfall. Over the years it would get worse, sometimes multiple times a day I would indulge. At the end of the 8th grade, my Godfather died at 56. I was quite close to him, even though we lived far apart. It started to get worse from there. 


However there was some light at the end of the tunnel.


I went to a Catholic High School, where I somewhat quickly obtained the nickname ""Pope"", because of my questioning if I should become a priest or not. At first I think they were trying to make fun of me, but little did they know at the time that I appreciated it because it was helping me realize that I'm supposed to be an example. I tried really hard to quite porn and fapping. At the end of the year I went to a summer religious retreat that had a talk about all of this stuff. They were rather cool about it: There was no ""STOP OR YOU'LL BURN IN HELL!!"" speech, but rather a ""We've all done it, we all know why, but there's a better solution than continuing down that path"". After that summer I stopped viewing pornography. This was a wonderful success, because at least I wouldn't be corrupting my mind with new images.


The next year, new summer, the term ""Pope"" had become a term of endearment for me instead of slight mockery, as everyone knew me by this name. I managed to stop swearing, using curse words after this year. I know this isn't entirely related, but it's a form of self-control for sure.


Junior year rolls around, and I'm focusing extra hard on trying to stop. This is difficult, but one of the reasons is that I don't want to be reliant on physically pleasuring myself for sexual relief, and instead be able to transform these feelings into love for the girl that I had not met yet. Romantic eh? Well, I wasn't letting myself date in high school because it would've been quite a bit of extra work. Also, I lived 45 minutes from school, so it was unlikely that I'd find anybody close-by there. The year ends, but no definite success.


Senior year is here. I manage to go entire days without doing anything. I remember the amount of time I could go without getting longer. At first 1 day before relapse, then 2 days, then 4. Before I knew it I was going a week or two without relapsing. I was on the fast track for success. I picked up a game of DDR to help exercise to, since I was a bit overweight, and focused more time into exercise and less into sexual thoughts. I lost 47 lbs (~25 kg) (242 down to 195 (~120 down to ~98)) by the time college started. I was going months at a time without any urges.


It was at this time that I met the girl who is now my fiancée (we've been dating for 3 years and 7 months. After I met her I hadn't done anything for 4 entire months and then some, when winter break hit and I was overcome with boredom. Saddened by that defeat but still determined, I kept trying to fight it. I never hit 4 months again, though I had been able to often go about a month at a time without. She and I have never had sex, and won't until we're married in another 2 years. We both want to graduate from college, and have traditional Catholic views about our marriage. (We're open to other people wanting to do whatever with theirs, for example, gay marriage is just marriage and should be allowed by the state/any churches the want to, etc. We're both fairly moderate.)


Here's were it gets bad again though. So now I'm studying abroad in Germany. Yay study abroad, but that means no seeing my fiancée for 11 months in person. The separation anxiety of only being able to see the person I love on Skype, and the lack of the human touch, has caused me to relapse immensely; throwing away almost all of the successes that I've made in the past. When I'm with her, my sexual energy is transformed into the love that I was going for earlier. Alone, however, I'm left with nothing to quell the urges. I've had days again of multiple indulgences, and days in a row of these. There have been plenty of stressors lately about housing, internships, grades, etc. I had a bout of depression, but after most of it cleared up I'm feeling a bit better. Still, I'm trying to refocus on returning to how I was when I met her; completely fap-free and proud of it. Aside from my religious reasons, I really just don't feel good about myself whenever I do it. Looking in the mirror is hard, feeling happy is hard. I want to be free from this.


I'm currently pushing 3 days of no activity. I figured one way to combat the urges is to refuse to make myself food for the following meal if I do it. While fapping does relieve some ""need"" for sexual pleasure, it doesn't seem to outweigh my brain's desire to not be hungry. I'm hoping this tactic will work. People know I like to eat, so it'll make people really suspicious if I suddenly start saying I'm not hungry during meals.


I know this was extremely wordy, but thank you for reading if you got this far. I've come here for a kind of moral support group. Being abroad doesn't let me connect with the friends I normally could in person, but I know that this group will understand for sure. If there's anybody that would like to be like a ""responsibilibuddy"" to me and I for them (I don't know if you do that kind of thing here or not), then  let me know and I'll gladly oblige. It's always easier with more than one.


This time, I'm going for greater than the gold."

My primary choice is Mechanical engineering co-op but since it's so popular the minimum GPA is unusually high (~3.1). Last semester I had 2.8 and this semester I've been trying my best to get that raised.

In case I don't make the minimum GPA, I am undecided between mechanical tradition and electrical co-op for my second choice.

I'm quite interested in electrical as I am somewhat interested in circuits, but I'm very interested in programming.

Anyways, I'm not entirely sure about the traditional path. I really want to gain engineering work experiences as much and as fast as possible. I know you can take internships but I'm not too familiar on how that works.

What do you guys think?

EDIT1: Also bonus question, are there engineering companies that hire first year students as interns? I live in Edmonton if that helps. I just want to do something productive this summer!"

I am a sophomore CE major at Johns Hopkins looking for something worthwhile to do this summer.  I already applied to a few REU programs (Research Experience for Undergraduates), but I was already turned down from one program.  Also, I think these programs are aimed towards students intending on going to graduate school, and I don't know if that's what I want to do.  I'm getting a little worried that I'm not going to be doing anything this summer (and taking classes instead).

I was wondering what I should be doing to increase my chances of getting hired/selected for an internship.  I feel that just putting my name and resume into these big job databases are not very helpful, and there may be something better I should be doing.

I have a pretty good GPA, but I haven't really had any hands-on experience, and I see these internships as a way to get hands-on experience.  What should I be doing?

rc0db,6,2012-03-24,"Another first car post, $9k max, considering 05 Subaru Legacy 2.5GT",[deleted],cars,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/rc0db/another_first_car_post_9k_max_considering_05/,"So I'm a 20 year old college student, I've had a sizable amount of money put away for awhile I never needed to use(scholarships). I haven't owned a car of my own(mainly because I don't want to pay insurance when I never needed it, I live on campus), but since I picked up an internship for the summer I'm going to need some of my own wheels.

Like I said, $9k is the max, $8k is more of what I'm aiming for. I'm not too picky, here are my musts:

1.) Reliable/Low Maintenance

2.) Reasonably good looks

3.) Interior better than what early 2000's American cars provided(I'm a sucker for a decent interior)

And some bonuses

1.) Little bit of power is welcomed(around 200hp)

2.) AWD

3.) If low power, good gas mileage(27~)


Imprezas and WRXs caught my eye, but seem expensive for what you're really getting. BMW E46s also caught my eye, but maintenance seems a little high even if the engine and transmission is reliable.

The only cars I've found that interest me are

2005ish Mazda3

2005ish Subaru Legacy 2.5(and possibly the turbo GT)

I was leaning more towards the Legacy 2.5GT if I can find a clean one in my price range, but was wondering why a car with a nicer interior, turbo engine, and nice exterior is cheaper than the 2005 WRX? Are there major reliability issues I'm missing? 

My commute is going to be roughly 75 miles a day."

I'm in college now, my 6th semester going for a B. Tech in IT, so I'm looking for a summer job. I've tried working in non-computer based jobs in the past, and I just don't want to waste the skills I've developed anymore. 

I'll be going back to school after the summer for a single semester, then back home to do an internship, and then start my career. I'd love to be able to do all these things within one awesome company.

Here are some of the things I'm good at:

**VMware ESXi/vSphere/vCenter** - I've been working with server virtualization for at least the past 2 years. Currently, I've got a 7 host ESXi cluster running in my home for training/lab purposes. Basically, a standalone vCenter server with 7 other boxes running ESXi 4.1. I've got neat things like DRS, FT, HA, and power DRS running on it as well. I've also got a whitebox iSCSI server to provide redundant datastores for my cluster, so I'm familiar with the working of iSCSI as well, and how ESXi interfaces with the technology (NFS too.) Currently, my cluster has 27 VMs on it. Most of them are 2008 R2 servers, along with 10 VMware View workstations. I usually only have ~7 of them running, which provide basic windows services to my home network. (AD, WSUS, game servers, server monitoring (PRTG), media storage, and HTTP/MySQL services. [Here, have a screenshot of that.](http://i.imgur.com/teh9U.png) (Awesome, right?) I've got VCP-5 training, but haven't gotten around to taking the cert exam yet. I'm working on that one.

**VMware View** - I've fiddled around with VMWare View, vmware's VDI solution, and I've got a working lab setup on my home network. Really cool stuff, and I'm pretty familiar with how one goes about setting it up and getting things running. I've also taken training for view, but haven't had the time to take the cert exam for that either.

**Windows Server 2008 (R2)** - Like I said earlier, I've got a bunch of 2008R2 servers running on my home network. I run AD DS (with a bunch of group policy stuff), DHCP, DNS, WSUS, WDS, and DFS. I've also got a contracting project coming up that involves setting up a first server solution for a local small business. Basic AD DS, WSUS, and WDS. It involves SBS 2011, not 2008R2, but they're basically the same OS. I've already got that all set up and running in a virtual machine on my workstation. So, I've got experience doing that sort of thing. Once again, I've got MCITP training, but haven't been able to take the cert exam for it yet. Oh, before I got into VMware stuff, I ran all my servers on Hyper-V inside 2008 R2, so I've got a fair amount of experience working with that as well.

**Cisco/networking** - I've got Cisco Academy CCNA training. Haven't got the cert, again, but I should be getting that *soon*. Since I've been in college, I've also been working with Enterasys network gear for the past 6 months or so, as I've been doing an unofficial internship at my college (for fun :D). Routing, switching, wireless, I love all those things. Networking is what I enjoy doing most, and what I'm trained in doing best out of all the various skills here.

Last but not least, I've got an A+ certification. I know, not the most useful in an enterprise environment, but it means I know how to diagnose/repair workstation and server systems, so that's a plus.

So, there's mostly everything about me you might want to know. If you've got questions, or an awesome job you might think I'll be interested in, just send me a PM, or send an email to n.graham1024@gmail.com. Thanks :)"

I just graduated with a marketing degree and am finishing up a marketing internship for the Australian govt in Washington. I'm adamant about not wanting to live in Washington and want to make a move to a bigger city with more opportunity in the industry. I've generally narrowed down my choice of cities to NYC and LA with the possibility of Chicago. How hard is it to get into a marketing associate/assistant or a social media role in these two cities.

Couple things:
-I've had two marketing internships in LA before as well as a marketing management role for a successful start-up in Orlando. I'm fairly experienced for a new grad and have a portfolio with some graphic design experience as well.
-I'm very mobile with some money saved. I have a truck and want to make the move and apply once I get to the location.

I know NYC has better opportunities but I've always loved LA. How much harder would you say the opportunities are for a new graduate with only a few meaningful contacts in both cities?

If anyone has any advice I'd really appreciate it!"

I'm launching an online video publication on music, culture and nightlife with a partner of mine, and we're looking to create the definitive voice for things to do in Vancouver; something you can just quickly go to and not only discover something to do for the night, but see some of the shows you might of missed and discover new sounds and places the city has to offer.

Our website is epicvan.com, which is currently in closed beta (which we show for our partners, so venues, promoters, labels and artists), it will launch within a month and a half. In it, you can find the link to our Vimeo page, in which we have a couple pre-launch sample videos.

I'm wondering if anyone would be interested in doing some volunteer videography for downtown nightclubs, people who we'd love to take on as interns and ideally put on a fast-track to pay as soon as revenue comes in.

While it's an internship, we currently offer some great perks for anyone interested in music or nightlife: we go backstage to meet the artists for a video interview, there's (of course) no cover (even for the biggest events!), free drinks (for most locations in the city), and after just one round of initiation you'll be able to bring a friend to spend the night at the event with.

If something like this interests you (you enjoy going downtown and being up late), please shoot me a message! We like to have a lot of fun, and if concerts are your thing, you will as well.

For one trip I want to go to Spain, France and probably Portugal. 

For the other one I'm thinking about travelling down Italy and then taking a ferry or flying over to the Greek islands.

I also want to go to the Neatherlands, Belgium and Croatia but I have to see where that would fit in best.

When do you think is the best time of year for each of those trips? Is there anywhere particular worth seeing in winter? I was thinking about working in the skifields from when I finish the last internship in Dec to when I have to go back home in Feb because I think it would be fun and relatively cost neutral. 

Thanks for your help :) if you have any tips on cool places to visit in these countries please share!"
rb03r,0,2012-03-23,"My review of Mel Gibson's new film ""Get the Gringo""",[deleted],movies,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/rb03r/my_review_of_mel_gibsons_new_film_get_the_gringo/,"I typed up a review of this film for my internship, and  I figured some people on reddit might be interested in what the film is about/what a fellow redditor thought. I'm not a fan of the man, but his movies are usually something I enjoy to watch. This film was extremely different than Gibson's past work, but it was a solid film overall.


***GET THE GRINGO REVIEW***

Get the Gringo is unorthodox, in-your-face, and a lot of fun to watch (when it’s not trying to disturb you). It rivals other high-octane action comedies with its absurd action sequences (the shootouts often conjuring the spirit of Hot Fuzz) and its dry, often dark comedic qualities. With its macabre imagery and odd sense of humor, this film will not appeal to all audiences, but it’s the kind of enjoyable romp that most should appreciate.  
 
The film centers on an unnamed career criminal portrayed by a gritty, obscenity-spewing Mel Gibson. At the tail-end of a high speed pursuit, Gibson smashes through the US-Mexican border and ends up booked in a corrupt Mexican prison, losing the $7 million he had stolen from a San Francisco crime boss in the process. His experience on the “inside” while stateside seems to be of little value initially (“Inmates with guns? That’s something new…”), but with some tenacity and improvisation, Gibson manages to make valuable alliances and connections to the prison’s ring leaders. 

Gringo’s main source of tension comes from Gibson’s chance relationship with a 10-year-old prison-dweller, who was born on the inside and whose rare blood type makes him a valuable resource to the prison’s top criminal: Javi (portrayed by Daniel Giménez Cacho), a man who smokes and drinks in excess, and plans to use the boy as a forced liver-transplant donor. Gibson, while saying the course of rational self-interest, returns to the prison after a purchased escape to recover his money and rescue the boy and his mother along the way.  

The writing in this film isn’t always consistent, and can seem almost self-aware of its occasional campiness (“The name’s Richard Johnson”, “No sh** Sherlock”, etc.), but the quirkiness of the film as a whole keeps the occasional jarring line from creating too much dissonance. Overall, the acting is solid, especially among the Spanish-speaking actors. This isn’t Gibson’s finest performance, but his delivery reflects the film’s tone, ranging from carefree and confident assertions to deadpan comedic voiceovers (a la Nicholas Cage).  

Grunberg’s directing emphasizes the visceral qualities of the film while also enhancing the mood and tone of his scenes. Images of debauchery, sloppy drunkenness and drug-use are portrayed with shaky handheld cameras, while tight action scenes are shot with wide frames emphasizing the outrageous scope of the battle royales. There are a few very cool visual moments (the continuous single-take following Gibson as he burns down a drug den, steals its money, then stalks away) and some clever visual gags (literally “cutting the small talk” when Gibson’s conversation with a company executive abruptly cuts away to Gibson incapacitating the man) among many other moments that set the film’s visual style apart from comparable films. 

Despite its few shortcomings, Get the Gringo is a well-paced story with plenty to laugh and cringe at. This is a strange and over-the-top experience, but the solid execution makes it an experience worth having. Once you get over the barriers to entry, it’s easy to buy in to the silliness and violence. All you have to do is approach the film like Gibson’s character approaches life: “Ah, what the hell.”

resmz,6,2012-03-26,What is it like to be a programmer/developer? I want to study Information Technology - In which field do you think i should deeper my knowledge?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/resmz/what_is_it_like_to_be_a_programmerdeveloper_i/,"Hello and thank you for taking your time helping me out :)

Iam 19, will have my *highschool-like* degree in a year which i have to complete with an 12-month internship in a field i'd like to study. I will finish this on the beginning of '14 so i'll have to take another 6 month internship for the blank time. I love mathematics so for this side iam save

A few months ago i started researching about programming and development and started my first programming experience ever with a few days of qbasic and then took on C++, additionally i peaked into the very basics of html/css. Though, I did not invest the time i want to(especially on the web part), because i had a somewhat stressful time due to personal matters and due to lack of friends with the same interests.

Thus, in about 2 1/2 years iam attending a college and am currently intrested in Information Technology with focus on the practical part(programming, software dev, algorithms). The colleges here tend to use Java for projects(still c/c++ for the beginner phase).

I later want to do something in one or more of the following: web- / app- development, software development, scienctific computing, open source(?), research, side projects like games or sth.(still a wide field)

So my questions are

* What is an average work and offwork day for you as a Programmer/Developer?

* Do you have time doing things not directly job related(while or off work)? - learning other useful things(eg more programming languages), Doing sports, thinking of other things, seeing the world and stuff like that.

* is PHP programming a save/fun field?

* under what circumstances, how long, how intensive and at which age did you start and are you happy with ***what*** you do and what you ***get*** now?

* Should i stick to C++ until iam in college or should I already swap to Java? Or is it better to focus on math first?

I'm a senior in college and I've never been able to get hired for any sort of real position or internship. I only worked one job at a movie theater.

I work exceptionally hard on my school work, I've always taken challenging classes. I am excellent for my age in nearly every level of computers, it hardly even matters what I'm majoring in (database/programming type stuff) because I'm just as good everywhere else.

I take a lot of business classes: Group projects, speeches, and written essays. I am very talented in all of these. I don't have exactly the awkward personality a lot of my computer colleagues have yet I still have their skills.

I can't find any real way to convey this other than, to put in toddler words ""I did good in... Computers. I did good in... Business classes. I work hard"" (obviously I describe it a little better, but it doesn't show how superior I am to the average person)


I don't do any clubs or anything though. That is one area I suck at. But for good reason: I spend most of my free time studying psychoanalysis which I use as my own sort of counseling volunteer position.

It is a very large ""hobby"" of mine, complete with databases and actual ""sciency"" stuff. Can I market that somehow? 

I just don't know what to do; I apply to a bunch of jobs which is frustrating because they take like literally an hour each to go through their stupid website and filling out the information. Then I get an auto-rejected email or if I even make it to an interview, there's some asshole nuclear scientist who's applying for the level 1 internship position that gets the job instead of me and I end up with absolutely nothing to do all summer for work, and no money to do anything to build work skills.

Hi, I’m Locke. I’ve seen this question posted ~20 times, including once by myself, to /r/cscareerquestions over the last 6 months or so. As I have just gone through the entire process, I’m here to guide you along the way and answer questions about your wonderful exciting summer of sitting inside for 40 hours a week.  

**The answer (If you just want to know):**  

Possibly, but probably not. In a nut shell, this is just the truth of the matter. Read the actual guide if you want to know why.  

**The Story (My journey towards a summer internship):**  
If you don’t actually want to read about me, I’ll try to parse out the relevant bits into a summary at the bottom, but I find this kind of thing much easier to explain in context.  

I am a freshman at the University of Georgia, which unless you follow SEC football, you’ve probably never heard of. It’s a large research University located in Athens, GA. Our primary research is in binge drinking, but we’re also known for our biology and medical research, and occasionally something fun in our very small CS department (~200 students). I’m in the Honors program, pursuing a Bachelor’s\Master’s crossover, to get both degrees in four years. (Hooray for 37 hours of AP credit!)  

 I started my search early, in early October, looking everywhere I possibly could for internships. I crawled through all of my favorite big tech companies (Microsoft, Google, Apple, etc. etc.) and found a few promising gems. First, is the [Google Freshman Engineering Practicum]( http://www.google.com/jobs/engpracticum/fep/), which is exactly what it sounds like. A 10 week internship out in Mountain View, CA. Next was  the [Explore Microsoft](http://careers.microsoft.com/careers/en/us/internships-explore-microsoft.aspx) program, which similarly was a 12 week internship in Redmond, WA. Well now I was all excited, between these two tech giants, and the fact that I’m very smart, there’s gotta be something cool there right? Well, we’ll see.  

From there, I looked for whatever resources I could. I leaned on my parents, aunts, and uncles to possibly find me internships at their companies, or with the companies of friends. I sat down and crawled through hundreds of job postings on sites like [Dice](http://www.dice.com) and [Monster](http://www.monster.com) looking for internship postings in my area. Don’t look outside your area, unless they’re a big tech company (See above), they won’t pay for you to relocate for the summer.  

I found some decent success through these sites, and sent out [resumes](http://i41.tinypic.com/69dsi9.jpg) to everyone. Note, the translation to a .jpg in that got a little weird. Please give employers your resume in pdf format. Also, complete props to a post a few months ago that I shamelessly stole this resume format from.  

From there, I turned to my last two avenues of discovery. These are the ones that I’m going to have the least to tell you about, as they’re specific to your university. Your University’s career fair, and your University’s job website. I checked my career fair, and looked for CS companies. Well, we don’t have any. Shit. What about large companies that have big IT departments? Well, there are a fair number of those. So I got in my suit (You MUST wear a suit to a career fair) and went and talked to one or two of them.  

And finally, my University’s job site.  This was a gold mine for me. You could narrow it down to major, type of job (Internship versus full time) and then just mass email resumes.  

So first thing, fellow programmer, to do is to do everything I just listed above. This will take you a while. And then once you do it, you’ll have to do it again. As a general rule, I checked the University job site once every few days, from October until now. That’s important, because new jobs get submitted as time goes on. I had personally thought the recruiting process started in the fall, but from what I’ve seen it actually picks up in the spring.  

Oh! I just remembered. Here’s something unscrupulous I’ve done. If around where you live has a big tech school that you don’t go to, piggy back on their recruiting process. It’s probably open to anyone online. For example, I used Georgia Tech’s website to look as well as my own.  

Okay, so. After I did all that, I had the following list of companies that I had submitted some kind of literature to:  

- Google  
- Microsoft  
- IBM  
- AT&amp;T  
- HP  
- Chick-Fil-A  
- Home Depot  
- Lockheed Martin  
- ThyssenKrupp IT Services, North America  
- Verizon Wireless  
- McKesson Provider Technologies  
- ADP (Automatic Data Processing)  
- Sybase  
- Windham Brannon  
- Macy’s  
- MedAssets  

Don’t be surprised if you don’t recognize every name on the list, I submitted a resume to literally every company within driving distance of my house. Here’s the response I got back from them all.  

- Google: No  
- Microsoft: No  
- IBM: No  
- AT&amp;T: Originally no, and then I got a call from a random HR manager in March  
- *HP: Phone interview*  
- Chick-Fil-A: No  
- *Home Depot: Phone interview*  
- Lockheed Martin: No  
- *ThyssenKrupp IT Services: Phone interview, in person interview*  
- Verizon Wireless: No  
- McKesson: No  
- ADP: No  
- *Sybase: Phone interview*  
- Windham Brannon: No  
- Macy’s: No  
- *MedAssets: Phone interview, in person interview*  

So, yeah. Lesson here is learn to accept rejection, you’ll get it a lot. Of the companies who responded to me (Which was only about half of the “no”s, the rest didn’t even bother), most said that they weren’t interested in a freshman intern. Doesn’t matter my skill set or programming ability, they simply aren’t interested.  

The reason the companies gave me for this is that most companies use their internships as recruitment programs. Nobody is thinking four years down the road as far as hiring new recruits. They want new developers after the summer you work for them. This fucking sucks, but is the truth of the matter.  

Now, as for the interview process itself. I won’t say I’m an expert on interviews. But I did go through 6 interviews of one sort or another for an internship, so I’ll fill you in on my experiences.  

As a general note of things that were covered in every interview so I don’t repeat myself:  

*General questions:*  

- Tell me about yourself. – This question sucks. I’m sorry, it just does. I would generally respond “That’s a rather broad question, do you mean academically, programmatically, personally…? I’m not really sure what you’re looking for.” Until I realized that they always meant programmatically. Tell them about your programming background. Mine went something like this:  

“Okay, I’m a 1st year at UGA in the Honors program, doing an accelerated Bachelor’s Master’s program to get both degrees in four years. I began programming when I was 12 doing basic scripting stuff relating to IRC chat rooms (Editor’s Note: Yes, I know that the C stands for “chat”. They generally don’t.), and then from there branched out into basic JavaScript and began being interested in computer security. From there beginning just before high school I branched out into Java and C++ to learn more object oriented programming, and began working on larger projects. Since then I’ve been working on becoming familiar with Python, C#, and Ruby.""  
 
Invariably, this leads to the next question which I know all of you don’t like:  

- Tell me about a project you’ve worked on in the past that you were particularly excited about doing.  

I’ll be honest right here. I have past projects to draw on. If you don’t, make it up. That is probably unethical, but if you can talk about a project like you have worked on it, even if it never got out of the design stages, it still shows the level of interest they’re looking for.  

Anyway, my answer would either be “Oh well I’m excited about the Android app I’m working on right now” or “Well I made this bot to sit in chat rooms in middle school that ended up being by number of lines by far my biggest project” and then I would elaborate.  

This is an important question. Not only will they gauge your programming ability by the depth of the project you worked on, but they’ll gauge your interest in programming in general and the work they do. If you can figure out what they do ahead of time and tailor your story to make it seem like you really like their work, all the better.  

Technical Questions:  

- The definition of inheritance - Every, single, interview. Both phone and in person. I found this easiest to elaborate by saying the definition, and then giving an example.  
- The definition of polymorphism – See above  
- Some keyword question (For HP it was C#’s “protected”, for MedAssets it was C++'s “struct”, etc). Know your terminology.   
- Some kind of database question (How do you sanitize SQL inputs, what are the advantages\disadvantages of using this kind of database, etc.)  
- Some kind of data structure question. Not the same as above. This would be like, tell me why you would use an array over a linked list, and vica versa.   

In interviews in general, you need to be relaxed. I know this can be hard, especially if you’ve never interviewed before. My general advice here would be to talk to other people about programming. Talk to people who know more than you. Talk to a professor, a grad student, a senior who's about to work at Google or whatever. Find someone, and just talk to them about code. The interview will more or less be no different.  

Surprisingly, in all of the interviews I only got asked a few actual programming questions where I had to write code. They didn’t want syntax perfect, but they wanted it to be more refined than pseudo code. I know everyone hates this, but I have to do it for tests too. It’s best to just memorize your basic syntax. The questions I had to do by hand were the following:  

- Here is a 12X12 multiplication table. Write a program to output this table.  
- Modify the program above to work with any size table.  
- Modify the problem above so that if the number is divisible by three, output “fizz” instead of the number, and if the number is divisible by five, output “buzz”. (This is the classic fizzbuzz problem).  
- Write a program to take in a string and reverse it.  
- Let’s say I have an arbitrarily large linked list. What would you do to check if someone had looped the list back on itself (Pointed one of the pointers to an earlier node).    

All of these except the last one shouldn’t be particularly challenging to a second semester CS student. I was honestly very surprised with how easy the programming challenges were.  

From there, you’ll either get a call saying we would like you to come on or we wouldn’t. To conclude my story, I did get an internship! I won’t say with who in case one of you wants to stalk me, but I’m very pleased with it.  

**Miscellaneous information you might want to know:**

- In my research into internships, I got a decent grasp of what interns get paid. In New York and California the internships I looked at were at $30/hour. Around here in Atlanta, I’m getting paid $15/hour, and another one I tried to get was $18/hour. So, definitely good money, and scales based on where you live.  

- The big tech companies are the only ones who pay for relocation, so look for something in your area. Nevertheless, it’s awesome they do that.  

- Internships are generally between eight and twelve weeks, depending on where they are, and not particularly accommodating to your schedule. I’ll end up only working about 3/4ths of my summer right now, due to when their internship block of the summer is. Oh well.  

And that’s all I got! If you have any other questions or if I’ve left out something big from this guide, please either post here or PM me! I’m happy to share whatever knowledge I have.

rg6su,1,2012-03-27,My weekend from hell.,JackOhBee,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/rg6su/my_weekend_from_hell/,"Reddit, this will be long and rambley. You have been warned.


I have been with my girlfriend for nearly 2 years, we met last summer and hit it off right away. Within 2 weeks of meeting I pretty much moved in with her for the rest of the summer, and it was the best time in my life hands down. We have two completely different views on the world and have completely different beliefs. I am a left winged, stoner and atheist while she is very religious, right winged anti weed girl. We didn't care, we loved each other for who we are and our differences have never triggered fights but thought out conversations. At the end that first summer was our first major challenge, she was going back to school which was a 4 hour drive away. We were both scared that it wouldn't work, that we would grow apart, find someone else or even just forget about each other. That wasn't the case, we made it work and it worked out great, we would skype every night and once a month one of us would make the drive to see each other. By the time summer came again everything was amazing, she even got an internship in town so she was here from May until January.


This is when everything started going wrong. As a graduation gift her family was sending her on a 6 week back packing trip to Europe where should would be traveling by her self for the entire time. Her parents told her to book everything and they would pay for it all. During the coarse of the 7 months she was here for her internship she would go on and on every day about how I have no idea how excited she was for this trip, even when she was dropping me off at the airport to visit Disneyland for the first time in my life, she told me I have no how excited she was for ""the vacation I've dreamed of my entire life."" Now I know you guys have no idea who the hell I am but I'm 24 years old and my entire life I've dreamed of going to Disneyland and riding the Matterhorn. 

Christmas comes and she books her plane tickets for the Europe trip. She graduates school 4/28 and her flight is leaving 5/1. I would only have 1 full day with her before she would leave for 6 weeks. Wanna know what makes this better? My birthday is 5/12. We've been together long enough at this point for her to keep that in mind when booking the reservation. Her flight home would be landing at 8PM on our anniversary too. Not only am I going to be alone on my birthday, but I'm really not going to see here to celebrate our anniversary.

THE PLOT THICKENS, just before she leaves for school again she tells me that she was been accepted to teach English in Spain for 9 months, meaning she would miss the following birthday too. She claims that its been her life dream to do this, even though when we started dated her life goal was to move to Washington DC to work for the government. I told her that I didn't want to go but I would support her no matter what she chooses. I was worried that being that far away for that long that she would meet someone, either start a relationship or even just a one night stand. I know how paranoid I sound with that but I don't think its out of line to have those fears.

This is where the weekend from hell begins. It's Valentines Day week and I'm driving up to see her on the 15th. (I'm the guest services supervisor for a major hotel and getting vday off was impossible.) I was up all night working on making her that melting crayon thingy that was all over the front page of reddit that week, stressing because it wasn't working out and I didn't want to show up empty handed. I got to WalMart and spend over $50 on Vday swag (at 70% off mind you) so I can have something for her. The moment I get into town my car dies. Dies. As in the mother aint coming back. She picks me up from where I was and we enjoy our evening together. The next day she had class so I stayed at her place until she was done. While I was alone I played around with her iPad and found emails that she had been sending to some guy. She made plans to meet up with him and even ended one email with ""I'll buy condoms on the way so we don't have to use yours."" This was sent before Xmas, when she was staying in MY house. These emails when on for a few months and she even said in one emails ""I feel guilty even though I shouldn't because we are both clearly attracted to each other."" I confronted her right away when she got home and the nasty fight that you can imagine came about. She claims that nothing happened and I did find that to be genuine. She sobbed and begged at my feet for a hour to forgive her, that I was the love of her life and she fucked up and didn't want to loose me. 

All I wanted to do was get away, be alone and process everything that had happened. But i couldn't. My car was dead in the shop, and it wouldn't be ready for 5 days. This is college housing, she had no couch for me to even sleep on. I never got a moment alone, not to cry, not to think, not to be angry at the world. She was always there apologizing non-stop the entire weekend. I shut down and went into autopilot in a way I never have before. I just went on almost as if nothing ever happened. We fucked, went out to dinner, and even at the Vday chocolates I bought her. I thought maybe my car dying was a sign from the universe that we were going to be ok and grow from this, become a stronger couple then we were before. I didn't want us to end, but once I got the phone call that my car was ready I knew it was over. I knew that would be the last time I would kiss her goodbye. I didn't want it to be but I knew deep down that it was over. We didn't break up, we tried to work it out. Spring break was a week and a half later and she was going to be back in my town. We made plans to meet at Disney World, but the night before she said she forgot and made plans with her friend to go to the parks. I meet up with them in the park and the moment I saw her I felt nothing. I was empty and hallow, I couldn't even go into my autopilot bullshit self to get through the day. I couldn't take it any more and ended up breaking up with her in the parking lot in front of her best friend.

I was a wreck for weeks and I'm still not my normal self. I still love and care for her deeply, I even reached out to her last night to extend my compassion for her hurt. I don't hate her, I know how cliche it is but she was my best friend and i do not want to loose that friendship. I want her in my life, but not in a romantic way. With the distance I can see now that she wasn't the right match for me, just as i'm not the right match for her. But this is still rough, I honetly saw myself marrying her. We had plans to move across the country together, to start a life together, and now here I am. Alone, with no plans for my future. I was putting all of my eggs in that basket and now I don't know what to do with myself. I'm seriously considering just saying ""fuck it"" and moving California to get as far from here as possible. 

Im not sure if this is the right subreddit or not, I don't know what advice I could even be give. We broke up, we are over. But I miss her. I still love her. I can't stop thinking about her.

For those of you that read this, thanks for listening (reading?) me ramble on and on. I just don't know what to do with myself, but even just typing this all out has helped me feel a little better."

I'm a 24 year old male, unemployed, and living about 90mins south of a major city in a very small town.




**My education so far:**

I graduated from high school in 2007 and went to college for an IT based degree (finished 09/2011).



**My work history:**

In high school I worked landscaping and I taught guitar at a local music store (2004-2007). The owner I did landscaping with moved out of state in 06', and I had to stop teaching because of my college schedule. In 2008 I worked for a small business that ended up not having enough work to justify having a staff member, and several months later the business went under (I was there 2 months, 8 hours a week). 



**What I apply to:**

Ever since I started college I have been actively looking for some kind of work. I apply to every job under the sun; whether it is minimum wage, unpaid internships, or something in the IT field, I apply for it.

I've actually started keeping track of every job I apply to because I'm curious about the ratio of jobs to phone calls I'll receive (because applying online seems fruitless). From mid-February 2012 to this day I've filled out 317 applications and received 0 phone calls.

I have tried to use temp services but they have never offered me any work. Recruiters tell me I don't have enough experience (for the IT jobs) and they don't offer me any of the 'everyday' jobs because of my degree. I will work my ass off for any job offered to me, if I'm getting paid for something I'll put everything I have into it.

I would really like to move on with my life, but after nearly 4 years I really don't know what to do anymore. 

Can someone give me some advice?

I would be supervising the team that I have worked with for years. I’ve always sort of been in an authority position just without the title. I like these people for the most part. 

Here are my worries. I would have to spend the next few months learning the new role and would probably have the position official by end of summer. (Which means I don’t think I would see a pay increase till the end of the summer, nor a shift change, I asked to go to four tens.)
I would spend less time at home because my hours would change to 830 to 500 (if they don’t approve schedule change) and occasionally staying late to close down the building when needed. (probably not too often though) possibility of travel about once every 3 months. The added stress of being a new supervisor to people that I was on equal field with previously. Feeling like I was losing out on my baby’s milestones. 
Stressful evenings because of cooking, cleaning, taking care of baby with getting home later. Boyfriend does help me out but I feel like the role of mom should be left to me. 
SO is also moving up in his company and is in management training 3 days a week with other managers (he is not a manager yet but they have been prepping him for that position) My commute sucks, its 45 to 50 mins each way. 

I cried after picking up my daughter from daycare (3rd day). I get so sad when someone else is telling me about her day. Thankfully I didn’t cry till I got home. It really bothers me that I’m not there with her. 

SO makes really good money a lot more money than me, we can technically survive on his income alone. My income is just extra money that would pay for daycare, fixing up the house, vacations, maybe a minivan in the near future. Even if I were to take this job I would still not come close to what SO makes. If I were to quit we would have to cut down on certain things, we already cancelled cable, and we don’t eat out often. On paper budget wise I could stay home. 
I would lose my really great insurance. 

I was considering being a sahm and was pretty set in my decision just didn’t know when to put in my notice because of my help being on maternity leave as well and a couple other people have gotten promoted in my dept and we are down people. I wanted to leave the company on good terms and feel guilty if I were to leave at a bad time. 

The pro’s are- I would be making more money. I think I would get about a $2 or $3 raise, maybe more my boss wasn’t sure because it wouldn’t be his decision. I would be salary. 
This is good for my career. I put myself through school as a single mother paying cash the entire time for a bachelor’s degree so I wouldn’t have student loans. I graduated in April of 2011. I worked my butt off going to school full time and working this job full time while also maintaining a house and mothering my teenage daughter (she is 15) 
A little background so no one is confused. My boyfriend and I moved in together in August of last year so I was no longer a single parent at that point. We bought a house in Dec of 2011 and have been living and parenting our children very happily ever since. 

SO and I have talked and talked about this, ( I thought it was coming with being offered the new job) SO is a ‘provider’ his words and would rather have me sah. However he says he will support me in whatever decision I make. 

I’m so stressed over this and honestly feel like I’m stuck in a rut. My boss told me that I’m the only person internally that they are considering for this job and if I don’t accept it they will hire outside the company. 

The company I work for is actually really great, pretty family oriented. We get lots of vacation time and days off and the benefits are pretty good in this economy. 
I’m already vested in the company with my 401k, and once I’m here 7 years ( in Jan 2013) I will start accruing 2 days off a month instead of 1 ½, in addition we usually get about 15 days off a year paid for holiday, work shuts down over Christmas for minimum of a week. 
Plus my teenage daughter may be allowed to intern this summer in a different department. My bosses are looking into it currently. She would be making 10 an hour and she is excited to be able to work and put the money away. 

My work will not allow me to work from home, and will not allow me to switch my schedule to better accommodate my life at this point. 
Advice PLEASE!!!

I'm in need of some advice or recommended reading, software packages, experiences from anyone in the renewable energy industry, or anything that will help steer my self-study direction.

I have plenty of programming experience and a knack for mastering new concepts and technologies almost instantly.

I'm currently enrolled in a mechatronic engineering course. It's still fairly generic and easy to switch to a different stream, but I find that I have enough free time on my hands to do my own research or studying on the side anyway.

I wish to someday make a living by doing environmentally sound work that I love: it has to be interesting, require creative problem solving, and it absolutely must be a field that requires constant learning.

My questions are:

1. Which positions fit the above description that will be available for a fresh graduate in 4 years?
2. What should I read up on or know how to do in order to hit the ground running in the positions mentioned above?
3. How can I increase my chances of getting a relevant internship (or if I'm ridiculously lucky a bursary) after my first year of study?

Any input will be very highly appreciated!"

I for one was completely wasted for my sisters law school graduation, and I was recording the whole thing.

I'm set up to graduate a year early (it's only my second year here). I'm considering taking the accelerated masters program, which would mean I could graduate in a normal 4 years with a masters instead of just a bachelors, but I'm not really sure how much that would really help me. I've got a pretty high overall GPA and a very high in major GPA, I'm involved in various CS related clubs on campus, and I've got an internship lined up at IBM for this summer possibly continuing on through the fall. Money is not an issue in terms of going to college 4 years instead of 3.

I'm torn on whether I should go ahead and get the masters, or move on from school and start real life. On the one hand I'm ready to stop going to school and start working and such. On the other hand I don't mind school, I like learning and I genuinely find what I'm learning in my CS classes very interesting. I'm also not a huge fan of writing, so the idea of a thesis is a little daunting, and I'm not even sure what topic I'd like to research. All I've really taken so far is the core CS classes. I'm taking all my CS electives the next two semesters, so I'm not sure what my specific interests are. I know I don't really care about game design, HCI, or other graphics oriented things. I find cyber security interesting, but I won't be able to take a course on it until another semester or two, so I don't really know for sure I'll actually like it. I also like general software development and like scientific computing, data mining, practical uses of computing, etc.

I guess my question really comes down to what do I really stand to gain from having a masters opposed to just a bachelors both in terms of interesting jobs and salary.

Thank you so much! "

I'm currently working on a PHP based blog as well, but this little project was something that was quick for me to do and have something concrete done. So, here it is:

https://github.com/mrskitch/Change-Maker

It's for retail folks who have to manually count out a cash drawer at the end of the night. It accepts the amount of each piece of money in the till, as well as the total to be left for the next day, and outputs an array that tells them what to pull! 

Right now it's setup with a ""presentation"" index page that asks for user input. That input gets put over to a ""business"" changemaker page that verifies the data and then runs the functions and outputs a the message to pull. If a entry field is blank or was submitted somehow besides POST, it puts the user back at index and asks to enter all fields.

Hope it looks good to you pro's out there. I'm working to either get an internship or junior job by summer time. Thanks for checking.

UPDATE: committed a new version to github with some fixes. There are a few more that I'll implement but was low on time. Readme coming soon as well!"
rh3rp,0,2012-03-28,"Reddit, I need legal advice. I want to sue my school.",[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/rh3rp/reddit_i_need_legal_advice_i_want_to_sue_my_school/,"Before I begin, I want to state that I know legal advice on Reddit is not always good idea. I'm in a frustrated mindset, and I want opinions on my situation and whether I should look into a lawyer or not.

Background:
I've gone to a college for a long time (started in 2005). I took one year off to get my life priorities in order and come back (I'll admit, I slacked as a freshman). When I came back to school, I got into my major of choice and proceeded to kick ass and take names. I pulled my gpa up and started doing well.

Fast forward to the last year, I finished up every requirement except the internship. I was having problems finding one, and I really wanted to graduate. The internship program at my school strictly states that I need to complete my internship in the summertime, I had just moved to a new city and didn't find one until 1-2 weeks after the deadline. I tried contacting the school to find who to appeal to but no luck.

**Beginning of August** - I managed to get a hold of the dean of the department regarding my situation. I had found a temp-tern position and decided to write an appeal. I'm told that nothing can be done until the middle of September due to lack of staff. So I wait...

**October 15th** comes around and I received an email from the school saying I was being discontinued (I received no forewarning), I file for leave of absence and try to explain my situation. I contact the dean of the department again, and he lets me know that he wishes I would've contacted him sooner (I regret my delay, but I was very busy with moving/new job so I didn't notice my school email). He informs me to contact the new internship director regarding my situation.

I email the internship director, and am told that he will keep me posted as the department tries to find out a resolution for me. So I wait...

**November 11th** and I still had not heard a reply, so I send him an email asking for an update.

**November 14th** and I get an email saying he has not heard a decision yet, and will followup on this same day.

**December 1st** I'm hired into the company full time.

**December 6** - I email the dean asking for an update. Noting that the new internship director had not responded and I have since been hired.

**December 7** - I'm told he will look into the matter and let me know.

**December 18** - I ask for another update from the dean and get a response. He lets me know he that the new internship director has been contacted and will follow up with me.

**January 06** - The new director contacts me with a cryptic message saying ""the decision has not changed"". He recommends an appeal to the dean if I am not satisfied.

*At this point I feel like I'm being given the run-around.*

**January 9-12** I contact the dean again with an appeal. He once again refers me to the internship director. The internship director never gives me a clear answer so I get frustrated and mention that I should be forwarding all of this to the dean of the school. The internship director never responds. So I email the dean asking for another update (while apologizing for my frustrated remarks. Rereading my emails it's easy to see that I was angry when I sent a response to the director).

**January 13** - The dean lets me know he's looking into the issue and will get back to me. The internship director responds that they have worked out a plan and I need to sign up for spring term.

**January 29** - I get another notice that I'm going to be discontinued and will have to reapply if this is the case. I submit another leave of absence form and get approved.

**March 15** - My friend notifies me it's the end of the quarter. So I send the internship director an email asking for advice on the next steps.


**March 25** I send another email because I had received no response. I receive an email saying I have the go ahead to start the filling out the internship contracts and I need to follow the internship requirements.

**March 26th** I respond that I have spoken with HR and they've agreed to fill out paperwork for the past few months that they agreed to for the internship position (like they had said before). I forward this information to the internship director.

**March 27th** I receive another update saying I will have to start the internship over completely. 

*So I call the internship director*

I restate my situation... That I missed the internship by 1-2 weeks because I could not find one, submitted an appeal, was referred to him...
He states that because he was not in control at the time, he can't do anything and that I would need to restart the internship completely. I let him know that because the assignments are not through the employer, it would make more sense for me to have the employer fill out the necessary documents based on my 3 months as a temp-tern. Then he starts getting angry, he says ""If it was fully up to me, I would not let you in. If this was the business world I would fire you for not following up"".

I mention to him that I had tried following up but he had never responded to me. I had waited months at a time for a response, and that I had been given the most roundabout way of getting to a solution.

He continues with the rude comments about me being a slacker, how I'm unprofessional, and he wouldn't hire me because I've waited so long (He's increasingly rude at this point). I ask who I can speak to that's above him, but he doesn't give me any names. He simply states that he is the one to talk to.



So.... Reddit, I ask you for advice. I told my employer that I was finishing up my degree back in August when they first took me as a temp-tern. Now that I've been hired, I can't exactly go back to an intern position, and yet this is all I'm told to do. Even though I have already done all the hours and I'm sure my employer would be able to fill out accurate feedback of my time there.

Am I wrong for being slow to the game (yes). However, I do not feel that this sort of behavior from school officials should be tolerated. Especially when I've spent around $100,000 out of pocket to attend.

Please advise!

I am interested in applying for the scientific research summer internship position that was listed through the University of ___ Career Services Office. I am sending my resume, so you can determine whether I qualify for the Internship with the Urban Wildlife Institute.


I have had a great deal of laboratory experience in chemistry, biology, physics, soils, and ecology. My laboratory experience pertains to both field techniques as well as indoor lab skills. I possess excellent troubleshooting skills which can assist with trapping, using remote-triggered cameras, radio equipment, and almost all essential computer skills needed for the position. In addition to assisting with the wildlife research, I can easily work well with other in a group project, as well as working individually on a project, where I have done so in the many Environmental courses I have taken. As a Natural Resources and Environmental Science major I believe I am qualified by my knowledge of Ecology, the Illinois fauna, and my commitment to wildlife conservation. Also, as an active member of the Illini foresters and Red Bison two environmental clubs at the University of Illinois, where I participate in wildlife management, and the conservation of fields in the Champaign area, there we steward areas with some lopping and pruning. 


I believe that I would an asset to your program. This internship would provide me with the ideal opportunity to assist at your organization and to expand my research skills. I am willing to whatever institute related activities as necessary, as well as work outside and early morning hours. If so, I hope to schedule an interview at a mutually convenient time. I look forward to speaking with you.
Thank you for your consideration. 

Sincerely,

advice?",ferrarisnowday,lostgeneration,https://www.reddit.com/r/lostgeneration/comments/rgxei/shafted_by_my_schools_internship_requirement_any/,"I'm writing this partially to vent and partially to ask for advice.  I'm posting this to /r/lostgeneration because I'd also like to spawn a discussion on internship requirements in general.  I think the best way for me to tell the story is chronologically in the way it happened to me.  It will be wordy, but I hope I can make it coherent so that you can follow the ups and downs.

**Jan. 2011**

Classes for my Master's program start.  I'm working through a contracting agency, not exactly happy with my job situtaion at the time.  I'm aware that my degree requires a 200 our internship in order to graduate.  I figure the school can help hook me up with companies, and it will be worth it because I can hopefully get hired in or at least make good contacts and get industry experience.  You know, the typical internship stuff.

**May 2011**

Holy shit!  I've just been hired in to a full time job directly in my current field of study!  I'm feeling awesome and am flying high.  I even begin to feel like I don't need the MS after all, but I decide to stick with it for a few reasons.  1.)  My work will pay for roughly 1/4th of it.  2.)  Should I ever switch companies, the MS will help on my resume.  3.)  An MS can also help meet requirements for higher pay grades in the future.

**August 2011**

I officially ask my advisor if I can use my current job as the internship.  He says yes, and I officially register for the internship.  I submit all the forms, and I'm officially in the class titled ""&lt;my program name&gt; internship"" (not actually a class, by the way, it's just credits).  Now, I'm a full time student that semester, but I decide to drop a class.  It was too simple, I have an Information Science undergrad degree and the first day of this class was about the difference between hard disks and RAM.  With the way my school prices credits for full time vs. part time, which could be a post in itself, I decide to postpone the internship, too -- so I drop the ""internship"" course, as well as the overly simple IT course.  Doing this rearrangement me about $3,000 on my degree overall, not just that semester.

**March 2012**

This whole time, I've been feeling ripped of that I should have to pay nearly 3 grand just for my school to acknowledge that I already work in the field.  I decide to write the Associate Dean of Graduate Studies a polite e-mail explaining how I feel.  I offer to take an extra course in lieu of the internship, as I already have far more than 200 hours of experience in the field.  Surprisingly, she says there is a form that I can fill out for a $100 fee that will give me credit for the internship since I already have the experience.  I go and get this form, but am slow to turn it in.

Side note:  why didn't my advisor know about this money saving form when I asked if I could be let out of the internship requirement!?  This is just the first example of the university showing an inability to empathize with the students and the huge costs of school.

**Later in March 2012**

I suddenly receive an e-mail from my advisor saying that the department chair has now stated that even though I work in the field, not only must I pay for the internship, I can't even used my job as the internship!  I *must* find an internship at an outside company.

* Nevermind that I already have 2,000 hours of experience directly in the field.  10x what the internship requires.

* Nevermind that you already let me actually *register* for the internship course in the Fall, using my current job.

* Nevermind that this is a program aimed towards working professionals.  Roughly 2 out of 3 students have full time jobs, many of them in the industry or even in the field directly.

* BUT MOST OF ALL:  Nevermind that I carefully budgeted and scheduled when to take my credits so that it would be as cheap as possible with my school's pricing structure.  Taking on this internship and still graduating on time could very well cost me $3,000 - via kicking me from part time to full time in my final semester.  I *could* try to cram an internship in the summer.  But frankly, I shouldn't have to.  Months ago I was told by my advisor that I wouldn't have to.  And just this month I was told by one of the Deans that I wouldn't even have to pay for anything besides a $100 exmpetion fee.  Why the dean is overridden by, or yielding to, the department chair, I have no clue.

Anybody have similar experiences?  Any advice on how to take this up or if I should just cut my losses and give up on it.

Any thoughts on why my school is so lame-brained as to require internships from people who already work in the field - even as their fellow full time students without jobs get by with just a 200 hour internship?

Any thoughs on schools requiring interships in general?  Why should students have to essentially find their own internships, and then pay the school thousands of dollars just to acknowledge it?

**TL;DR School can't get their act together about the internship requirement, probably costing me both money and time.  Misery loves company - share your stories if you have them.**

EDIT:  One last thing, the department chair has to accept and approve of a scholarly paper (mini-thesis) written by each student before graduation.  Pissing her off would be a bad move.  I need to handle this diplomatically, if I do anything at all."

He is interested in working either from the bottom up in an excellent, well managed, restaurant with fantastic Chefs. He is extremely motivated and has mentioned a few times that he will work the lower levels of the kitchen hierarchy for free. He is serious. He is an all-around great guy, with common sense, wit, energy, zeal, and a practical head on his shoulders. 

Does any Chicago Redditors know anyone personally at one of the many fantastic restaurants where my friend can start for free, yet remain in that one place, while moving up the ladder to a paid position and eventually a respectable chef position.

I would like to watch some web shows along that vein. I like reviews and benchmarks of hardware, I like when people make new exciting builds for specific purposes (instead of the i5 2500k+evo212 cooler+8 gigs ram+560Ti build over and over and over). I love case modding.

I have never built my own computer, though i've been lusting after various components since 2005. I dont have the money to and I was in college so the only time I DID have the money to I spent it on a laptop. I feel that within the next year or two i'll get some sort of funds, probably from an internship or a ""fuck it, fast food"" job. I want to stay up to date and current on hardware.

Another bonus would be IT related stuff, specifically home IT. Ways to get a media server or NAS, home automation and metrics, etc. Just really cool interesting uses for computers apart from gaming and casual stuff."

I have recently received offers, and reduced them down to 2 offers.

First one is from a startup company in Bay Area, that has unique products (virtualization &amp; Big Data area). They offer some good perks, benefits, but they lack 401(k) plan. Instead, they will give some stock options. The salary is less than 90k, which is comparably low with respect to the living cost in San Jose. But I am sure their product is quite unique and IPO of company will get you some money from options. The office isn't really great, but people in there seems to be  smart. A lot of masters, PhD people..

and the other one Amazon in Seattle (good benefits, bonuses and ok-salary in Seattle). Large cubicle offices, wet weather compare to San Jose. Amazon seems to be growing and expanding its coverage into various areas, like clouds and services.

This is going to be the first job that I will be having. I am looking for a career rather than switching job every year. I am thinking of going for Amazon, but I cannot decide for sure. Because I do not have any previous intern experiences nor have never lived in San Jose, and Seattle. 

Any recommendations for this choice?

Would it be helpful to build up my experiences in Amazon and then jump into Bay Area some day later? Or would it be better idea to risk little bit for startup and start my career in Bay Area?

I was more concerned about break-ins and muggings than anything when I moved into the rented room of the small white house in a very nice old gated community about fifteen minutes from the down town. I knew something was wrong when I asked my land lord why he was renting the house out. He said that his daughter wouldn’t stay there anymore. I didn’t want to ask anymore, because I assumed they were just fighting, and I am not the best at consoling people being a very quiet and shy guy.

I moved in about a week ago. The weather was great for March. The sun was shining and there was not a sign of snow anywhere. After I had set up my TV and settled into my room it seemed like things couldn’t get any better. I was out on my own in a nice house all by myself. I knew that my house mates wouldn’t be moving in for another week. I felt great, but then night came and the scrapping started.

I remember I was watching television and I didn’t really notice the sun setting and the darkness filling the room. I was dossing off when I first heard it, but the sound sure as hell woke me up. It was a scraping worse than nails on a chalk board. It was like a rusty blade slowly cutting through a human chalk board that was screaming out in pain.  The sound would persist for a second and then go away for just long enough to think it had gone away forever, but it always came back. 

As an engineer I tend to be a rational person, which is why I didn’t GTFO as soon as possible. Instead I searched around for what the sound could be. I looked out the window and saw nothing going on outside. I looked in the closet and around the room, but found nothing. That’s when I noticed that as I got closer to the radiator it got louder. I put my ear up close to the radiator and realized that the sound was resenting from it. I decided that I should check the boiler.

I am not the bravest of men, so I lit ever single light I could on my way to the basement. At the top of the landing I looked down. It was a dusty room with cement floors and what appeared to be a work bench all around the small room. The only light was a pull string bare bulb at the bottom of the landing. I could hear the sound grow as I opened the basement door, and I knew it was coming from down there. I took carful steps down the bare wood steps quietly listening to the screech when I saw what I am now convinced is a bench grinder and sparks flying from it every time there was a screech. I moved closer thinking that somehow it had turned on and a piece of metal was nocking agents it, but then I got a closer look at what was rubbing against the grinder.

It appeared to be a large machete floating in air and rubbing its self on the blade. Like some unseen person was sharpening his weapon. I thought my eyes must be playing a trick on me, so I slowly pulled the pull string for the light. Immediately I heard a loud raspy, “WHAT!” and saw the blade spin around as if the invisible holder turned to face me. I barely had time to react as the blade came towards me it swayed back and forth as it crossed the floor. My mind was telling me run, but my legs were frozen in fear. I was only able to move just as the blade was raised in the air. I had time to put my forearm in front of my face before the blade struck. I fell to the ground in a heap. I was frozen sprawled out on the ground blood gushing from the gash in my arm. I saw the machete lower like the invisible man was kneeling to take a look at his victim. I held my breath as I felt the warm air of the attacker on my neck as he surveyed his work. 

It stood up and I saw the blade bob up and down as it walked up the stairs. The door slammed and there was silence. I don’t know how long I lay there, but after what felt like hours I slowly lifted myself to my feet. I slowly crept up the step and poked my head slowly out of the door. All the lights I had turned on were out. The blade was resting on the kitchen counter with my blood still on it. I, still trying to be rational, crept out to try and grab the blade to make sense of it all. I had just put my hand on the blade when I heard the voice again, “How many fucking times do I have to tell you! THAT’S DADDY’S!” I ran as fast as I could out of there. 

Needless to say I need a new place to stay.

rldso,1,2012-03-30,"squidward, suicide.(not fake, very disturbing)",[deleted],nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/rldso/squidward_suicidenot_fake_very_disturbing/,"******read whole post**********
*COPIED OUT OF CREEPY PASTA FOR MORE VIEWS THERE*


Red Mist is a controversial real-life bootleg tape featuring an unaired episode of Spongebob Squarepants. Like the long-lost but recently discovered ""Suicide Mouse"" tape, Red Mist was purportedly created by a now imprisoned Scottish animator for the series who intended to pass the tape off as the season four premiere episode and featured the death of Squidward.

DESCRIPTION OF TAPE
*warning tape is desturbing*
     Red Mist begins with Squidward preparing to practice his clarinet in his room as Spongebob and Patrick play merrily outside. Squidward wraps his mouth around the clarinet and is only able to play one note before being interrupted by someone knocking on the door. He walks down and opens the door and discovers that a traveling salesman is at his door. The salesman, a Scottish fish, asks if he could have a moment of Squidward's time. Squidward tells him that he isn't interested and slams the door in the man's face, walking back to his room. The salesman begins knocking again, and Squidward opens the door angrily. The salesman, looking very upset, tells Squidward that ""the red mist is coming"" and precedes to walk off, confusing Squidward. Squidward walks back to his room and finally begins playing the clarinet. After performing several off-key notes, Spongebob and Patrick begin laughing outside, interrupting Squidward yet again. Squidward walks over to the window and shouts at the two, telling them he needs to practice for a concert he will be performing at. Spongebob and Patrick apologize with tears in their eyes and walk back to their houses. Squidward, unsure of himself, walks back over and begins playing his clarinet again, this time uninterrupted. The scene then fades to red over the course of twelve seconds.

     Perhaps by glitch, the same scene is repeated once more which is somewhat common in rough cuts of animation. However, this time, the eyes have been replaced with new, more realistic eyes with red pupils, clearly not real but more realistic than CGI or animated. The audio is also completely absent from this scene, save for occasional clicks. 

After the repeat of the previous scene, a new scene begins with the same red eyes, but at the theater where Squidward is playing his clarinet. The frames in the animation skip every four seconds, but the sound remains synced. After an unruly performance of a song he dubbed ""Red Mist"", Spongebob and Patrick are seen in the crowd booing Squidward, very uncommon for them. The scene pans to reveal the same Scottish salesman sitting next to them, also booing, as Squidward walks back to his home with his head in his tentacles. What's odd is that the scene actually shows him walking to his house, with nothing happening in the background, for three minutes and fifty seconds before abruptly cutting to red for another twenty seconds, just as he arrives at his house. 

A new scene appears, back to the original cartoon eyes, with Squidward sitting in a chair in his room that night, with a blank look on his face for roughly thirty seconds before starting to sob softly. Again, the audio is completely missing for most of the scene, until the sobbing begins. This is when the sound of a slight

breeze through a forest can be heard in the background. It also begins very mildly zooming in on Squidward's face, only noticeable if you compare ten seconds of frames side by side. The sound of him sobbing can suddenly be heard, very loudly and severe as the screen twitches in on itself briefly. The salesman's laughing can also be heard echoing in the background.

After another thirty seconds, the screen blurs and twitches violently and a single frame flashes over the screen. Upon pausing it exactly on the frame, the viewer can see a real-life photo of a deceased six year-old boy laying in the forest in his underwear, whose face has been mangled, eye has been popped, and stomach cut open with entrails laying beside him. Next to him, the shadow of the photographer is clearly visible with part of the photographer's hand appearing to the right of the screen. 

After this photograph is seen, it cuts back to Squidward sobbing, much louder than before with what appears to be blood running from his eyes instead of tears and the sound of the salesman still heard. The sound of the wind in the forest is also played at a much louder volume, but now with the sound of branches snapping and the screams of a young boy heard. After twenty more seconds, another single frame appears, this time of an eight year-old girl in the forest laying on her stomach in a pool of blood, with her back cut open and entrails piled on top. The shadow of the photographer is also visible. 

The scene reverts back to Squidward, now with the same realistic red eyes from before, completely silent and no longer sobbing. The sound of the forest can no longer be heard. Another three seconds later and it cuts back to the sobbing, this time piercing loud and with the sound of the forest heard. The screams of both a young boy and young girl can be heard mixed together as the song ""Amazing Grace"" plays on both the clarinet and the
bagpipes. During this, seven frames are seen in black and white of the boy from the first photograph laying in the woods. Over the course of the seven frames, the hand of the photographer reaches in and grabs the boy's entrails, as his remaining eye focuses on the man's hand and even blinks once. 

This cuts back to Squidward again, this time staring at the viewer as the sound of the salesman echoes ""DO IT"" and ""the red mist is coming"" repeatedly. After forty seconds of this, the camera quickly pans out to reveal Squidward holding a realistic gun, looking as though it were Photoshopped into the scene. Squidward lifts the barrel into his mouth and fires, with blood shooting out from his head and then the screen cut to static. 

DELIVERY OF THE TAPE
On November 7, 2004, after the initial animation of the storyboards were completed in Fife, Scotland, the tape was delivered to the lead animators and sound editors at Paramount Studios in Hollywood, California during the middle of the night. The tape was taken into the editing room where it was watched by said animators and editors, as well as two sixteen year-old interns. The tape, which was supposed to feature the rough cut of ""Fear of a Krabby Patty"", instead began with a title card using the name ""Red Mist"". While thrown off at first, the animators continued watching, discovering the tape had been heavily tampered with as some sort of cruel joke. 

As a result, three animators (Barry O'Neill, Grant Kirkland, Jr. and Alyssa Simpson) were sent to the hospital, one editor retired (Fernando de la Peña) and one intern (Jackie McMullen) committed suicide. The tape was sent to the police, who determined that it had been made by Andrew Skinner, a disgruntled animator from Fife, Scotland, who has since been charged with nine counts of murder, including the murder of the two children seen in the tape. Oddly enough, after going through the data on the VHS, police discovered that the last edit to the tape had been made exactly twenty four seconds before it was watched by the Spongebob staff.

One copy of the tape was made (before police confiscated the original) by Chaz Agnew, writer of this article and the sole surviving intern from that night. Agnew has made various attempts to distribute copies of Skinner's tape and hopes to secure clearance rights to release it on several online auction websites soon.

I couldn’t find a job then so I took an energy engineering internship just to gain some experience.  I was hired full time but laid off about a month later (4.5 months total).  I again could not seem to find a structural or civil position.  I went back to take a semester of graduate courses ($7000 out of pocket) and applied to grad school.  I did not get into grad school but finished the semester with a 3.43 gpa.  I have volunteered in the community and been waiting tables through all of this to build my resume and keep ahead financially.  I am also EIT certified, was pretty involved in 3 student groups in college and have always been working part time.  I’ve had people edit and look over my resumes and cover letters.  I’ve even done an informational interview or two.  

Today I was rejected for a bridge engineering internship where the interview had gone very well.  I’m at the end of my rope.  I can’t even get an internship and I don’t know what else to do.  I am looking for advice from people in the industry.  What program do I need to have experience in to get hired?  Am I able to sign up for DOT seminars and possibly get certifications from them?  Is it just a matter of persistence (I’ve applied for maybe 50 positions total)?  Any advice or uplifting words would be greatly appreciated. I am feeling pretty rejected and useless right now.

rla5p,0,2012-03-30,Civil Engineer ----&gt; Software Developer,triple654,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/rla5p/civil_engineer_software_developer/,"**Apologies for the length of my post, [the process of writing everything down has helped me think things through](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2012/03/rubber-duck-problem-solving.html) anyway, will be extremely grateful for any kind of advice**

I am a recent graduate from a Civil Engineering (MEng) course from a University in London (based there as well); 

Prior to university I didn't know anything about code or the process behind programming, as soon I was introduced to my first programming module (simple mathsy stuff in MATLAB), I realised that I liked solving problems computationally and would work a lot harder on these modules than on anything else. If I had had enough confidence in my decisions I would have tried to change to a Comp Sci course but I persisted and completed my MEng in Civil, however I always picked modules and my dissertation theme on the more computational side of things.

Since a lot of my fellow students (and I assume to some extent the industry) were really averse to programming; I thought I would find a niche as being a more computationally inclined Civil Engineer; however I soon realised I was totally uninspired by a lot of what you would call the ""bread and butter"" of Civil Engineering, so I never really sought out to involve myself with anything that would further a career in Civil Engineering, even my dissertation was more about bio mechanics.

In my last year of uni, I ended up helping a designer friend code some actionScript for a Flash Website Uni project and I started doing the programming for his web design clients. This then lead me to an internship with a small digital marketing company; initially for a general job. I then immediately found away of saving them money by custom building a lot of web applications they were paying for monthly and in the process learning new, more useful web languages; javascript, php, ruby, sql .. etc. 

They then hired me full time, for a very basic wage,  to create them a suite of web apps they could sell to their customers (much of the suite being my own ideas as to what their customers would want); So I did this in about 6 months, it turned out to be popular among their clients, opening up a completely new revenue stream for them. 

But i decided to leave because a) I didn't want to be the only technical guy in a non-technical company and b) even though i was very grateful that they allowed me to trial my own ideas and learn a lot in the process, I didn't really agree in their business model (it relied heavily on using ""social media"") and c) I had never planned for this to be a long-term commitment and I wasn't particularly happy there. They convinced me to stay on as a ""freelance consultant"" while I looked for another job.     

Up to recently I was convinced I would try to get graduate programs in Engineering or Consultancy or even Finance (*shudder*) but I was seriously uninspired until I had a revelation and realised that at every career/university choice I had always elected to do something where I could code to solve a problem. So why not try to go into Software Development or something similar?

So my questions are: 

How much does it matter if I don't have a Comp Sci degree when applying to serious software/technology jobs? 
Based on what limited experience I have would I ever be seriously considered?
What is the best way to demonstrate (or even find out if I have) ability in this area? 

**tl;dr: Graduated from a Civil Engineering Masters, want to become a professional software developer.. am I crazy?.. any advice?**   "
rkyvc,1,2012-03-30,Honest chances of med school in the future,Arx0s,medicalschool,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/rkyvc/honest_chances_of_med_school_in_the_future/,"I'm currently a sophomore (2nd year) in a liberal arts college near Boston. I just switched from Computer Science / Math to Biotech/Pre-Professional/Math. I realized that I hated programming, and would never enjoy a future in it, so I went to one of my other dreams in life; becoming a surgeon. 

To be frank, my GPA isn't good right now (because I've been taking courses that I absolutely hated). However, in my junior and senior years, I'll only be taking classes I find interesting (physics, biotech, anatomy, orgo chem, etc...), so I'll definitely have the motivation to get the best possible grades. 

Assuming that I get good marks on my MCAT, have plenty of shadowing, hospital volunteer work, and internships, and get excellent grades after switching majors, will I have a chance of getting into medical school?

Realizing that I really just needed to get home, I hail a taxi to get me back to my porn.

Well, we're like a block away from my dorm when I go into my wallet...and I don't have any cash (or if I did it was nowhere near enough to expect him to be willing to call it even). I attempted to explain my predicament to the taxi driver, and I offered that I would have no problem resolving the problem by having him take me to an ATM so that I could pay him. Basically trying to make it clear that this was an honest fuck-up on my part and that I did not have any intention of stiffing him.

His response was basically to start screaming at me to get out of the taxi, and it was pretty clear he thought I was trying to stiff him. Which I guess being a taxi driver in the GWU/Georgetown part of town he probably gets often enough from drunk college kids (and I'm sure it didn't help that we were going to the GWU dorm I was staying in), but I can't really say that I feel bad or as if I otherwise ripped him off.

Basically considering that I was trying to make it *very* clear that I had every intention of paying, that the lack of cash was an honest goof (I guess credit card readers like in NYC or Chicago would be too much to ask considering that DC only recently got off the ""zone"" system for taxis--if you never dealt with it it was basically the ""rape the tourists' wallets"" system), and that I wanted to go get cash right then and there to fix the problem...at that point I can't feel guilty about what is basically his refusal to take my money.

Hopefully some of you have more interesting stories. :p

The interview was incredibly easy; it wasn't even like a real interview. He asked if I have at least some basic knowledge about computer (like installing programs and replacing computer screen), then he proceed to said that I should be qualified base on my education background (I am a civil engineer). He said that they will provide training for 2-3 months, depending on how fast I learn.

Afterward I pass the training, I will get paid about $2000 per month. He offered me the job right on the spot, which I thought was just way too easy. I am wary about this whole situation.

rkc8z,0,2012-03-29,How do front-end engineers stack up?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/rkc8z/how_do_frontend_engineers_stack_up/,"Hey everyone,

I've got a bunch of questions about front-end [web] engineering.

**Background:**

I started making simple websites when I was ten. When I was twelve, I started learning HTML/CSS. For a while, I made static websites and concentrated a lot on learning design, since I originally wanted to be a web designer. Eventually, I realized that I was much more of a programmer than a designer, so I chose computer science as my major when I started college.

**Now**

I'm now finishing up my junior year of college. Computer science is awesome, and I've learned a whole lot, especially about web development. I had two jobs last summer doing web development, and I've participated in a bunch of hackathons. I've also been the webmaster of a few organizations here at my school. Because of my experience Photoshopping and web designing, my friends usually ask me to be the front-end developer in projects that I'm involved in. In my group of friends, I'm know as ""the front-end guy."" However, I consider myself an ""end-to-end"" web developer, since I'm just as comfortable with the back-ends of websites. It just so happens that I'm the best front-end developer out of my group of friends, so that's what I get stuck doing most of the time.

As of now, I've *literally* applied for thirty summer internships. Out of those, I've either been denied or ignored by at least 23 of them (waiting on the rest). These applications were all for software engineering internship positions. I'm definitely not dumb, and while my GPA isn't stellar (3.35, mostly due to one bad semester freshman year), it's not the worst in the world.

I've been interviewing with one company recently for a front-end engineering position, and I'm pretty sure that I'm going to get it. It's going to deal a lot with data visualization in JavaScript, which I think would be cool (and the company is awesome), but it still bothers me that there's a chance that my only offer for this summer will be for a front-end position.

**Questions**

1. Do I have any reason to feel like front-end engineering isn't as prestigious/difficult as other types software engineering?
2. Will taking a front-end engineering internship ruin my chances at becoming a non-front-end software engineer later in life, even if most of my job will consist of data visualization (as opposed to putting divs in the right spots)?
3. On average, is a front-end engineer as valuable as a non-front-end software engineer?
4. In your experience, how do front-end engineers stack up against other software engineers in terms of programming ability? (I have this strange feeling that people consider front-end engineers not much better than designers at programming).
5. I admit that I've had a few bad interviews, but I've also had some pretty good ones. My friends and I are amazed that I've been denied from so many places. Is there a good chance that I haven't received another internship offer because companies think that someone who's worked so much on the front-end doesn't have the skill to work behind the scenes?

Thanks,
Gerard

tl;dr - Do people think I'm a sucky developer because of my experience doing front-end web development?"

rmdct,9,2012-03-31,18 years old with credit card debt. Need some reassurance/advice here?,[deleted],personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/rmdct/18_years_old_with_credit_card_debt_need_some/,"So my situation isn't very bad, but I am still freaked out by the fact that I will be accumulating interest on my student credit card once the APR goes from 0% to 16% next month.

Basically, I had my first internship last summer and I earned a good deal of money, $12,000. I really didn't want my parents to have to be sending me money during the school year for my soph. year so I made them a promise that I would pay all my bills, utilities, food expenses, books, health costs ETC. and only take out loans for tuition. 

Of course, over the summer I was extremely naive and ate out alot, got a ton of new clothes, bought tech toys, and didn't budget properly at all. This was also the case first semester of school because I started mindlessly using that first credit card, and it screwed me up. I have since then bought a couple of things that I shouldn't have, like a tablet PC and a bicycle to get my classes faster, but I actually have a budget... In addition, I underestimated my monthly costs like crazy, so I ended up having to get 2 credit cards. I have one card with $3K on it, whose APR will shoot up from 0% to 16% when I have to pay off the month of June in July. The other card that I am using has $1200, and has an APR of 10% for another 11 months.

I currently have a job that pays me $13.50 an hour and I can work a max of 20 hours a week (it is research, so hours are flexible) until the end of May, where I go to my internship starting June, where I will be getting paid $31/hr and definitely working 40 hours a week. 

My monthly expenses, budgetting in bills, rent, food, travel, and credit card minimum payments add up to $700 a month, which has all been going on this other card that I have.

I really want to be able to pay off these cards as fast as I can, however I need to focus on doing well in school, but I know I can't just ignore the debt right now. I guess I sort of need an action plan/advice as to how many hours I should force myself to do my research work in addition to my huge courseload in order to feel that I am working towards eliminating my debt as fast as possible?

Should I be worried here? I guess my goals here are really to A: figure out if I need to be doing more research assistance stuff to get the money faster, B: If my new budget is realistic enough, C: a good plan for if I should buy something that I feel would help me improve efficiency (like a bicycle) or if I should try and save as much as possible....


My budget:

Rent - 313$/m
Internet - 22.5$/m
Water - 15$/m
Heat/Elec - 40$/m

Food
Groceries - $120/m

Travel (going home to visit my family)
Bus or Train - $50/m

Misc expenses (shampoo, hygiene, notebooks, etc.) - $50/m

Paying off cards bit by bit - $100/m right now, will increase to $1000 once I am at my internship (is the plan)

My income:

I've been treating one of my credit cards as temporary income until my new job up until this point. BUT I KNOW I SHOULDN'T HAVE! But judging by the responses I just need to put both of my credit cards away

It has $1400

I have $410 in the bank currently which will be going to my rent and utilities, I will also be getting a paycheck for like $150 dollars too.

My income is like this:

I get more work to do as I make myself available to my group. I want to make myself more available but I am extremely paranoid I will be stuck working and get behind in my classes, so I haven't been working nearly as much as I should have been for the past 3 weeks with midterms and such. 

Usually I would do 12 hours a week, which would bring in $600 a month. I haven't been accumulating any more debt since december, and I've been able to sustain myself for a while with this extra card helping me when I couldn't work for a week or had too much homework to do. I'm an electrical engineer at really difficult school, so I have quite a bit of school work do be doing. (thus the insane internship).  

But I feel I should be working more. Now I know I cannot rely on my cards for anything and I need to make sure to be working more to pay them off faster? I don't know... :(


Also the internship goes into the fall semester (8 months) that's why I was trying to go easy on myself with working... It is a very hacky plan though, and I need to understand better habits.


EDIT 2: I decided that I'm going to put away the cards and be extremely frugal for the next few months until I get to my new job, where I'll just pay the cards off immediately. According to my calculations I won't have more than $100 dollars of interest as long as I pay them off within 3 months of having my job. I think this is the best option for me at this point.

Questions|Answers
:--|:--
[1)  Why are you hosted by GoDaddy if you are so against SOPA?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rkyav/i_am_richard_morgan_the_software_engineer_running/c46nvkt?context=5)|There will also be much lower turnout in a runoff. Romney cannot secure enough delegates before our May 29th Primary to ensure that he's the nominee, which means that Texas will still be in play. Lamar Smith has endorsed Romney and has a home in MA, where rumor has it he spends more time than here in Texas. Romney appears to be the front-runner down here, and people who would vote for Romney are probably more likely to vote for Smith than for either Mack or myself. In a runoff, however, there will be much lower turnout, and no one will be voting for the President anymore, making it much more likely that our guys will turnout, not Smith's. Also, our voters are motivated and will turnout twice, while Smith's voters will vote for him largely due to his universal name ID and the fact that they've voted for him for decades. Something else is with two of us, we can cover twice as much ground. Our district is quite large. It includes San Antonio, Austin, and a whole lot of countryside. Mack lives in the countryside, and I'm hoping he can lock up those votes. Meanwhile, I'm in Austin, and I'm focusing here. I haven't seen Mack at a single event, so if he's working as hard as I am, that means we're covering twice as much ground together as either of us would alone. I'm more worried about my supporters getting confused when they see two Richard's than I am about us splitting the anti-Lamar Smith vote.
[2) Are you worried about 2 'Richard M.'s splitting the anti-Lamar Smith vote? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rkyav/i_am_richard_morgan_the_software_engineer_running/c46nvkt?context=5)| 
[3) How do you respond to these comments about why we shouldn't take you seriously, namely that ""Richard Morgan is NOT a candidate to take seriously. He's someone looking to cash in on splitting the vote. He has similar positions to Lamar while not being Lamar.""](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rkyav/i_am_richard_morgan_the_software_engineer_running/c46nvkt?context=5)|2) I don't see it so much as splitting the anti-Smith vote, rather I see it as giving the anti-Smith voters two alternatives. There are people who will prefer Mack, and there are people who will prefer me. By giving people two options, there is a better chance that they will vote for one of us, rather than reluctantly voting for Smith if they disagreed with either of us on important issues to them. Incumbents are more likely to die in office than to lose a Primary. The best way to beat Smith is in a runoff, not in the Primary. To force a runoff, we need to get a combined 50% + 1 vote. If that happens, whichever two candidates received the most votes will go into a runoff.  3) I have some things in common with Smith and some things in common with Mack. Again, it gives voters two choices, and I believe I'm a safer choice. Mack has a following here, but he also has lots of people who will never vote for him. Ever. If things have appeared a little disorganized or rushed, it's because I was the last to enter the race, and both of my opponents have been preparing a lot longer. The first several weeks were hectic, but now that I have a framework and some volunteers in place, things are settling down.  4) [It seems like you filed for your candidacy at the last possible minute. You also had to pay $3,125 to file. Did you pay for this yourself?] ([Link to www.reddit.com](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rkyav/i_am_richard_morgan_the_software_engineer_running/c46o6lf))
[*Edit: Also, can you expand on some of these?  Your stances on these positions are pretty weak - how will you go about doing this stuff? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rkyav/i_am_richard_morgan_the_software_engineer_running/c46nvkt?context=5)| 
[Do you beileve in evolution?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rkyav/i_am_richard_morgan_the_software_engineer_running/c46o333?context=5)|It's my personal belief, so I'm not sure what impact it would have on policy-making at the federal level, but I don't.
 |Rather than get into a debate about why or why not, I would just leave it at this. As an engineer, the universe seems more like the result of a brilliant creator / designer than the result of chance.
 |I knew it wouldn't be a popular answer here, but I find it somewhat disappointing that a simple, honest answer regarding my personal beliefs on one issue would cause so many people to write off everything else. This is why politicians pander.
 |I'd also like to point out that I believe all three of us (Smith, Mack, and myself) running in the Primary share the same view on this question. There are many other areas where we disagree.
[1)  Why was SOPA/PCIP wrong specifically?  2)  What is wrong with the Patriot Act?  3)  Where should the line (if at all) be drawn between religion and government?  4)  What are your views on abortion?  Why?  5)  What are your views on defense spending?  Why?  6)  What should be done about social security/medicare?  Why?  7)  What is currently wrong with the American education system?  What can be done?  8)  Is there anything wrong with the privatization of America's prison system or the statistically high level of prisoners in it?  What can be done to correct any problems you feel there are?  9)  What do you feel about gun ownership?  When should and shouldn't a person be allowed to be armed?  10) Do you believe evolution is the most accurate and reasonable explanation for the diversity of life on earth, including humans?  If no, what other system do you follow and why?  11) Do you think that humans have altered the worlds climate?  12) What should be done to workers who have been found to have entered the country illegally?  Also what about their families?  13) Do you feel unions are essential, good, irrelevant, or harmful to workers and long term business in the US?  Why?  14) What should be done in regards to the conflict in Afghanistan?  15) What should be done in regards to terrorist organizations known to be operating out of Pakistan?  16) What should be done in regards to Palestine/Israel?  Why?  17) Do you feel Iran is attempting to become a nuclear power?  Why?  18) Do you feel Israel is justified in it's threats against Iran?  What, if any, involvement should the US have in this?  19) Where specifically in the US budget are we spending too much, and where specifically do we need to spend more, and why?  20) What is the single biggest threat to the American way of life?  21) Do you feel gay couples should be legally allowed to be married and/or adopt children?  22) Should sex-ed be a required course in school?  23) Do you feel there is corruption in government.  If yes, how can that be fixed?  24) Was our involvement in Libya the right thing to do?  Syria?  25) How many nuclear weapons do we need?  26) How should the tax burden be arranged?  27) What has Obama done wrong?  What has Obama done right?  28) What is one question which you are uncomfortable being asked because it is controversial which I have not included here, and what is the answer to that question?  (edit, added question27)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rkyav/i_am_richard_morgan_the_software_engineer_running/c46ptd7?context=5)|This is a long one. I've got to run some errands, but I'll answer this soon.
[What is your opinion of the War on Drugs?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rkyav/i_am_richard_morgan_the_software_engineer_running/c46o5ij?context=5)|In my opinion, I think it's bad policy, and I believe history will judge us for it. We should have learned from Prohibition. My opponent has a record of refusing to hear bills he disagrees with, and I disagree with him for that. Rather than block Ron Paul's bill for consideration, he should have let it come up for a much-overdue debate. Let all the facts come out, and then let our Representatives vote. And to those who support the War on Drugs, I think it's important to point out that ending the federal prohibition is not the same as ending all regulation. It's simply returning that authority to the states so that they can each regulate it as they see fit.
[This was a typical political answer. I know you think it's bad policy, and that we should at least debate/discuss the issue, but I want to know how do *you* feel about the war on drugs?   Do you think it has been a complete failure?   Do you think drugs should be legalized, if not at the very least, marijuana?  Is this a criminal issue? Health issue? Moral issue? Individual rights issue?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rkyav/i_am_richard_morgan_the_software_engineer_running/c46p7dq?context=5)|A) Pretty much. b) I think we should decriminalize marijuana at the federal level. c) It's a matter of rights. It's not the federal government's role.
[*refusing to hear bills he disagrees with.*  Some people ignore evidence they don't agree with. Sound familiar?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rkyav/i_am_richard_morgan_the_software_engineer_running/c46qt92?context=5)|There's a big difference between disagreeing and refusing to allow the conversation.
[*It's not the federal government's role.*](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rkyav/i_am_richard_morgan_the_software_engineer_running/c46tta8?context=5)|I think there's a big difference between prescription drug safety and the Department of Justice [shutting down an Amish farm for selling fresh milk](http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2012/feb/13/feds-shut-down-amish-farm-selling-fresh-milk/print/). I oppose the latter.
[So, you would probably go the next step and stay the fed. has no rule in food safety or prescription drug safety, yes? Say a state had a long standing record of letting either of these items enter the market in a contaminated state... well tough nookies, yes?  The market will figure it out?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rkyav/i_am_richard_morgan_the_software_engineer_running/c46tta8?context=5)|I also have a big problem with school officials [taking away a child's home packed lunch due to USDA guidelines](http://www.carolinajournal.com/exclusives/display_exclusive.html?id=8762).
[What direction do you think the Internet is headed if these bills were to pass?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rkyav/i_am_richard_morgan_the_software_engineer_running/c46nckt?context=5)|Congress as a whole is taking us in the direction of China / Iran / Egypt, what with censorship, tracking of online activity, a recent internet killswitch proposal, prior proposals to ban encryption, etc. These two bills were terrible, but they're part of a bigger trend that undermines our freedom. IMO, it's not enough just to push back on these bills. We need to reverse the trend and write bills (with extensive feedback from the tech community) to limit the government's reach and require them to get a warrant before reading our emails, tracking us through our cell phones, etc. I'll verify in just a minute.
[Also, verification?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rkyav/i_am_richard_morgan_the_software_engineer_running/c46nckt?context=5)|Verification added.
[But isn't one of the problems with the bills that they are proposed under the pretense of another goal? You're right that ""congress as a whole"" is doing this, but do you have any specific plans for a paradigm shift regarding these shady strategies?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rkyav/i_am_richard_morgan_the_software_engineer_running/c46ogt2?context=5)|Yes, but that's a problem with lots of bills, not just technology-related bills. We need to write smaller bills. We need more debate. We need to write bills that focus on one thing. We need to make sure we use very specific language in the bills rather than leave things vague. We need more transparency. The general public should be able to see the bills with plenty of time to provide feedback, and we need people who will listen.
[Can you please elaborate on a few other issues/views that are fundamentally different than Mr. Smith?  SOPA / PCIP is an important issue, but there are others I would like to hear your views on as well. Anything else that really sets you apart from him?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rkyav/i_am_richard_morgan_the_software_engineer_running/c46nvbi?context=5)|I'm against the NDAA vs he voted for it. I'm against HR 347 vs he voted for it. I'm against the Patriot Act vs he voted for it. I'm against No Child Left behind vs he voted for it.
 |In short, I see Mr. Smith as a big-government Republican, and I see myself as a limited-government conservative. I'm very concerned about all the rights the government has been taking away from us, and I'm against bureaucracy.
[In your opinion, why is congress so adamant in censoring the internet without any regard of the damage they can cause?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rkyav/i_am_richard_morgan_the_software_engineer_running/c46nmdd?context=5)|I don't think they really understand the impact these bills would have. Let's look at their backgrounds--you have 181 businessmen, 172 political science majors, 148 lawyers... and 6 engineers. Senator Wyden and Congressman Issa were two of the strongest voices against SOPA, and they both come from science backgrounds.
[Would you accept donations from corporations to lobby for their interests? If not, do you reasonably think you stand any chance to make a difference? If yes, aren't you doing the same Lamar does, only for different interst groups?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rkyav/i_am_richard_morgan_the_software_engineer_running/c46o4wo?context=5)|There is a big difference between accepting contributions vs letting those contributions influence decision-making. I've already pledged not to keep more than 60% of the salary, so hopefully it's clear already that money is not what motivates me.
 |I did not come from a rich family, and I've worked 80 hours a week since I was 14 between my job and school. 7-8 years ago, I was counting pennies so that I could buy myself a Whopper at the end of each week. At 19, I had a great job. At 23, I bought a great house. At 24, I got promoted to senior front-end developer--the only senior developer under 30. With each success came a temporary satisfaction but a greater feeling of disappointment.
 |I realized a couple years ago that money didn't satisfy me. I'd reached my financial goals and was well on track to my goal of an early retirement and freedom, but I didn't want to spend the next 20 years going through the motions. I spent a few months overseas doing volunteer work, where I witnessed the effects of government corruption and after coming back I began to get involved in politics. That's my passion. I like fighting for the things I believe in. If people want to donate so that I can keep doing what I'm doing, then I think that's great, but money is not going to change what I believe in.
[As someone coming from engineering who is running against a man who is hated for his stance on internet bills, your campaign so far seems to have a laser focus.  How do you compare to Lamar Smith on other issues important to your district that do not relate to internet freedoms?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rkyav/i_am_richard_morgan_the_software_engineer_running/c46nhwo?context=5)|According to the Austin Chamber of Commerce, 25% of payroll in the Austin are related to tech jobs, so I think it's important to point out that my technology background is more than simply opposing SOPA. It's about fighting to make sure policy doesn't get written that hurts these startups. I was watching C-SPAN the other day when the crowdfunding provision in the JOBS Act was being debated. I noticed that Senator Merkley from Oregon kept talking about the potential for predators to take advantage of investors if crowdfunding sites weren't regulated. Here were some of the thoughts that came to mind that I didn't hear anyone mention: - Crowdfunding platforms have an incentive to prevent fraud, because if their investors get burned, they'll stop using that platform (in favor of a better platform that has more features or less fraud). I truly believe competition works. - If registering with the SEC would actually solve all problems, then wouldn't companies choose to do so voluntarily? - Engineers and tech startups have more or less solved spam. Can't we at least be given a chance to solve this on our own?
[Realistically, what are your chances of beating this guy?  He's been in office nearly 25 years.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rkyav/i_am_richard_morgan_the_software_engineer_running/c46o27u?context=5)|I think the chances are fairly good. Most people I've talked to have no idea how many things he's voted for that they disagree with. The biggest challenge is spreading the word and informing people.

[How much of an impact do you think the offshoring of sofware dev has had, and will have in the future on the us and other western countries? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rkyav/i_am_richard_morgan_the_software_engineer_running/c46neey?context=5)|Certainly offshoring has had an impact, and I expect that trend to continue, especially as companies start taking advantage of video conferencing so that executives feel like they can keep an eye on overseas offices. Still, good programmers will always have jobs, and the need for good programmers is growing faster than we're producing them. From the reports I've seen, and from my first-hand experience and talking with other programmers, there are no shortage of jobs for good programmers. (If you've seen differently, come to Texas.)
 |As the need for programmers continues to grow, I suspect a shortage of programmers here might motivate employers to move those jobs overseas, and I would support this strategy of bringing skilled workers here so that they could contribute to our economy, rather than sending our jobs to them: [Link to www.ktvb.com](http://www.ktvb.com/news/Congressman-introduces-bill-to-fill-high-tech-jobs-131894928.html)

This means I have to search twice, once to find a bill, and again using the ""browse by bill number"" method, to get a link I can share that won't expire. For some pages, I can't even find any method which will give me a permanent link. As a software engineer, what will you do to fix this (or get someone else to fix it)?  Why does Link to gis1.tlc.state.tx.us have at least 36 districts listed when Link to www.fyi.legis.state.tx.us says there are only 32 congressional districts? How many congressional districts are there? Is there something less confusing one could use to find out who their Representative is? With the district changes, does one vote based on their old district, or the new one they're in? Does an incumbent's district number change, or just the boundaries of the district they're in?

I would also like to start groups around certain issues where people who care about various issues can get regular updates. I've had my own frustrations with thomas.loc.gov, so send me suggestions, and I'll do what I can.  I respect Darrell Issa a lot. I also like what I've seen of Jason Chaffetz. I would be willing to replace most incumbents. There are relatively few who I think have done an outstanding job. I dislike incumbents that appeal to fear and urgency rather than holding a rational dialog.
 |Texas had 32 districts until the recent census when 4 new districts were added due to our population growth. Some incumbents chang district numbers, but Lamar Smith has filed in district 21 again.
[What college did you go to?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rkyav/i_am_richard_morgan_the_software_engineer_running/c46rnen?context=5)|1) I went to Dallas Baptist University. I was hired there when I was 17 and took night classes while working during the day after a semester at community college.
[What was your degree?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rkyav/i_am_richard_morgan_the_software_engineer_running/c46rnen?context=5)|2) I studied Computer Science and took a number of business / marketing classes.

(not Jan. 18, but earlier in 2011)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rkyav/i_am_richard_morgan_the_software_engineer_running/c46tiid?context=5)|I had a job, and I was active on a couple other campaigns, so I hadn't planned to run against him till I realized he didn't have a challenger. I explored for several weeks, during which time I found out Mack was also exploring, so another factor was whether I thought Mack could win. Another challenge is I didn't know where the final district map would be till the week before the filing deadline. If I had filed several months ago, I have no doubt we would have raised TONS of money during the SOPA debate.

I've been very active in politics behind the scenes, and the people I've worked with know where I stand. SOPA is a big enough issue that I think I'm the best candidate for this race. If I hadn't decided to run for this, I would still be working behind the scenes on another congressional race.
[What else motivates you to run besides SOPA/PIPA?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rkyav/i_am_richard_morgan_the_software_engineer_running/c46ua4x?context=5)|Out of control spending, high taxes, entitlement programs that need to be improved, the fact that our generation is inheriting some major issues, and we don't even have a say.

rlvv6,9,2012-03-30,[Update] Blood Glucose readings ... a project for science going for the next 24 hours.,abraxsis,keto,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/rlvv6/update_blood_glucose_readings_a_project_for/,"From my previous post [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/rdj2a/weve_discussed_glucose_levels_but_what_if_they/) you might remember that my blood glucose levels seemed strange to me. After some logging I discovered that on average my levels were staying between 101 and 104, all the time. Even when I was fasted for 8 hours. As such, I began using myself as (yet again) a human guinea pig since it piqued my interest. Below are my fasting glucose readings for the past days (including today)

* Tuesday: 103
* Weds: 105
* Thursday: 104
* This morning (Friday) reading was 111.

Then, I began my experiment. I began by getting a rich carb/sugar source that I liked, in this case apple fritters from Walmart. Literally, one of my all time favorites. Been about 4 months since I had one since they all clock in at about 40g of carbs each. Between 9am and 10am I consumed 4 of these fritters and 1x 20oz Diet Pepsi. This is approximately a carb intact of 160g inside of 60 minutes.

I went on to my internship site, an inpatient psychiatric crisis stabilization unit. I say this because they are a medical facility and often care for diabetic clients. As such, they have three glucose meters to cross check those diabetics with severe problems.

I did no exercise other than driving and walking in the building. I say on a couch in an office during a meeting. I ate nothing after the 4 fritters. After 2.5 hours had elapsed, approx. 12:30pm I proceeded to check my glucose levels on 2 of the 3 available machines plus my personal machine. Two machines gave a reading of 102 mg/dL the third registered 101 mg/dL. After 160g of carbs my levels actually DROPPED from my morning reading. Even the on-site nurse practitioner was like, ""Wtf? Youve not had carbs in weeks so it should be spiking, just a little bit at least.""

I allowed an additional hour to pass and tested again. Again, 2 of the machines read 103mg/dL and the 3rd read out 102 mg/dL.

For my science brain this just wasn't making any sense. So I trudged further and declared that today would be an official cheat day ... for science.

I ate pizza for lunch around 2pm, 1x oatmeal cream pie @ 3pm. left work at 5pm. Travelled home, ate 2x oatmeal cream pies, a bowl of reduced fat (the horror!) butter pecan ice cream, and finished the evening off with a few muncho potato chips at 7pm. I chose 7 pm so I could begin a full 12 hour fast versus the ~8hr fasts I have been doing the past week. At 9pm a glucose check on my single, at home, meter read 128 mg/dL.

At 10pm (approx. 10 minutes ago) they read 150 mg/dL. (For anyone interested my blood pressure is also elevated at this point at 138/78 mmHg and my pulse is 76, both up from my usual 120/60 and ~55bpm)

**11:30pm Update** Blood Sugar is now 117 mg/dL, blood pressure is 131/71 and my pulse is down to 68.

I am now **5** hours into my fast, I did use a small drink of non-caloric beverage to swallow some meds at 9pm and I'll likely have some cold water just before bed

**8:05am Update** Glucose reading have dropped back to 106 mg/dL. Blood pressure and pulse have returned to normal. Next step, is to the gym.

At that time, I'll resume a strict keto diet checking my levels every 2-3 hours. I'll post all of those here.

Just some random science points for those curious ... when checking on 3 meters all the blood came from a single finger with the actual lancet pricks being evenly spaced from one another in a triangular pattern. Blood was expressed and placed within each meter within 5 seconds of its exposure to air.

I realize this isn't a completely scientific test, but I think in addition to giving me a good idea of what carbs do to my system after being severely limited for so long, this little experiment let someone see how levels can change in response to what we consider significant amounts of carbohydrates. Sadly, what I have eaten today, which likely tops 500g of carbs, is what many Americans eat every single day. The stress this places on the pancreas and even the cardiovascular system is insane!

**After doing some researching I found several references to higher than normal fasting glucose levels in low carb dieters. In particular ...**
&gt;**One caveat here is that very low-carb diets will produce elevated fasting blood glucose levels. Why? Because low-carb diets induce insulin resistance. Restricting carbohydrates produces a natural drop in insulin levels, which in turn activates hormone sensitive lipase. Fat tissue is then broken down, and non-esterified fatty acids (a.k.a. “free fatty acids” or NEFA) are released into the bloodstream. These NEFA are taken up by the muscles, which use them as fuel. And since the muscle’s needs for fuel has been met, it decreases sensitivity to insulin. So, if you eat a low-carb diet and have borderline high FBG (i.e. 90-105), it may not be cause for concern. Your post-meal blood sugars and A1c levels are more important.**

* **Just a final note, Ill be editing the lower half of this post as I complete each section of the experiment. So be sure to check back tomorrow evening.**

rlq6g,124,2012-03-30,The worst part is that nobody will ever believe you.,23523,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/rlq6g/the_worst_part_is_that_nobody_will_ever_believe/,"Thank you everybody. After [I poured out my soul yesterday](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/rjilx/just_going_home_after_work/) and saw all your responses and realised that maybe people understand I felt much better. I hope it will be the same today, because things did not exactly turn out for the better. I wrote a few replies during my work day. So you might have read those already and you guys gave me a few things to think about. Things didn't go upwards from there but somehow I am more composed today. For the last maybe two or three hours the hair on my back is standing up straight, I am tense as seldom before, and I am scared to a level I can't even describe. But I know now that I'm not insane, I know that something is happening and maybe its the adrenaline that's pumping through my blood, but my head, now, it seems clear. All day I couldn't concentrate on my work at all, I just thought about the last evening and the events, and my mind kept going back to that moment that seems to have shaken my whole belief system in its foundations. I don't believe in anything supernatural but I definitely know now that I'm not crazy. Although everybody else thinks that now.

It all got worse when my boss came into the office. He was supposed to be out all day on some sort of conference but he cut it short because he said too many people called in sick. I'm actually fairly close to him. I know him from a few years before I started here, he is the one who got me the job. That somehow allows me to talk with him on a level of equals and to ask questions and say things that others here wouldn't dare. I guess for people not close to him he is a bit intimidating because of his big frame and the way he doesn't blink much. But there is something else about our long connection that is worth mentioning here: He also is willing to share things with me. He lets his guard down while usually he maintains his authority. 

When he called me into his office I thought he had noticed how poorly I worked today, maybe even that I checked on reddit every hour or so, hoping for somebody to give me a clue what might have happened or for somebody to tell me they experienced similar things. When he called me in I thought he would send me home or tell me to get my act together. I didn't expect him to say ""I need to ask you something"". And even less did I expect him to say ""I think something weird is going on"". He told me how in the last weeks people had been calling in sick at a higher rate than usually. To call in sick, you must know, the policy here is to call your supervisor directly. Since he is responsible for quite a few of us and is close to some other managers he is fairly well informed about what's going on and shares a lot with the other managers. But, he said, this is something I need to keep silent about, that he didn't want to talk about this with anyone else. It's just because he values my opinion and knows how rational I usually am, that's why he wanted to talk to me. I guess he too wanted to make sure that he wasn't going crazy.

""You know"", he said, ""you know how Esteban called in sick last month?"" I nodded, so he continued: ""that's when I noticed it first"". I asked him what he meant and instead of answering he just said ""please, don't think I'm crazy. I don't need you to believe me, I'm just trying to understand if it's me or if it's something else. Maybe I'm thinking too much into this"". I let out a half-hearted laugh and said of course I knew he wasn't crazy. If anything I must be the more crazy one of us, I thought. By this point, you know, i already had seen [horrorfangirls reply](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/rjilx/just_going_home_after_work/c46lcc8) to my post from yesterday. I was certain the handle was on open and that the security guard had commented on it. So I knew that either I must be completely insane and hallucinating the whole thing - but then, why am I not waking out of this - or, there must be.. something.

My boss, Paul, sighed and spoke on. ""It's when Esteban called in sick. That's when I noticed. You know how he is, even when there would be a sword in his chest he would still be making jokes. This guy can't be serious, he always is cheerful and happy and joking."" I nodded and felt how I tensed. Paul got visibly more nervous. ""It was when he called.. I'm not sure how to say it. It was his voice. It was monotonous. And he didn't make any jokes. I mean, I don't expect people to be happy or to make jokes when they call in sick, but he was just.. off. His voice didn't sound strange, it was definitely him, but he was so damn monotonous. I know company policy doesn't allow me to speak about health issues, that's a private thing. But I just need to say it, you know, he didn't really give a reason. He just said 'Hello Paul. It's me, Esteban. I will be sick for a while.' I asked him why and without even a moment hesitation - there was no 'uuh' or even a small pause - he just said 'I will be sick for a while'. That's all he said. I asked again and he repeated the same sentence again when I asked a second time, you know, it's not that he needed to tell me, but I thought he trusts me and would have told me what it was"".

I wanted to reply that that was indeed strange and that it was odd and that I wouldn't have expected that but I didn't have time. Paul got impatient, he talked quicker, visibly more shaken: ""And you know, the same with Grace. I wouldn't really expect her to be emotional or tell me her issues, you know how withdrawn she is. But she called in only two or three days later, only two damn days later, and I had nearly forgotten about the thing with Esteban, I had sorted out his replacement and I had nearly forgotten, but then Grace called and all she said was 'Hello Paul, It's me, Grace. I will be sick for a while'. I nearly fell off my chair. The *exact* same words. And, worse, the same voice. Of course, no, it was her voice, not the same voice. But it was the same style of speaking, it was as if she was completely without emotion. I didn't even have time to ask anything, she just said it again, 'I will be sick for a while'. And then she did hang up."" Where Paul had nearly fallen off his chair, I had just turned to stone. I could just feel how every single cell in my body had frozen, how the only thing rushing through my body were hormones of fear. You know, the fight or flight instinct. It's not that Paul did anything. And I didn't see anything. But I felt terror so deep inside me it was in my bones. And Paul had not even finished.

""And since then, as you know, they both didn't come back to work. I tried calling both of them a few times, but neither answered the landline or their mobiles or even their emails, hell I even tried facebook."" I was gasping at this point, I remember Pauls words as clear as anything can be, but what I said I don't remember. It must have been something soothing, something where I tried to excuse what happened, play it down, as I usually would, but it must not have come out right. Paul just snapped ""Oh come on, I'm not a child. I don't need you to tell me it will all clear itself out. Actually, I don't want you to, because I know its a lie. I know, because three other people called in sick. The two guys from the far end table, you know, the ones who always stick with themselves. They called in sick last week Thursday, around 10pm. They left me messages on my voicemail. Identical messages. Messages identical not just to each other, but to the freaking two I told you above."" I think at this point my heart skipped a beat. And Paul who I had known for several years as maybe the most rational, the most calm person I knew, went on, and I could hear a slight panic in his voice: ""But today. Today was the kicker. Have you seen Martha today?"" I thought for a moment, my mind moving as slow as seldom before, as if my brain was working at a quarter of its normal speed. I thought of Martha, the pretty polish girl who sat in the office opposite of mine. Sometimes she distracted my from my work, not by saying anything, but just by being there. How could I ever not realise she was missing. But today, I tried to think back, did she say her usual smiling ""good morning""? No, I don't think so. She didn't ask my office whether we'd join them for lunch either. I must have been so upset, so sleep deprived and exhausted and mentally restless from last night that I didn't even notice she was missing. I realised how out of my usual self I must have been. ""No"" I said. ""No, I certainly didn't"". ""I would have been surprised"", Paul said, ""because she called me. It's maybe twenty minutes ago."" He was silent and I knew his answer already but I still asked, I don't know why I asked, maybe it would have been better not to hear it. ""She said 'Hi Paul, it's Martha. I will be sick for a while'"". He added with a weak voice ""that's all she said"". As if I didn't know that already.

We both just sat there, quietly. I have no idea how long we sat there, literally staring at each other, both looking in the other's eye. We were both trying to find any hint that the other had an answer. There was no need to ask the question, it was obvious. It was impossible and yet it was obvious. And Paul didn't even know my story yet.

After what seemed like ages I somehow got out of this mode, I shaked my head slightly and just opened my mouth to say ""I have to tell you something too"", when he jumped up, abruptly, he must have hit his legs against his wooden desk, I heard the sound, but he didn't even seem to notice. ""Let's go"", he said. ""Let's get out of here"", and before I could get out of my frozen state he had already pulled me up and out of his office and he shouted along the corridor with half-open offices ""guys, everybody, we make it a short Friday, let's get home"". There was some quiet cheering but people mostly seemed confused. It's not as if we didn't take short Fridays, occasionally, just usually he would send us a note at least the day before. I think it's because he didn't want to be alone either, but we both just stood there, smiling awkwardly, probably drenched in sweat and smelling of this slightly sweet and bitter odour you can only smell when a person fears for their life. Pretty much everyone was ready to leave within less than two minutes, like people in most offices on most Fridays they had just just been sitting and wasting time while  waiting for the clock to jump to the right number. Just two or three were slower, the group of us, maybe 9 in total, including Paul and me, we started walking and I could hear the others rushing to catch up with us after a few moments.

Somebody, I think it was Thomas, asked whether Paul already told the rest of the team, on the other floor. Paul just wiped it away with a ""yeah, sure"". I don't think he was even listening. Finally being able, to get the courage and strength to tell his story to someone must have made him feel it and see it in a different light, must have made him see it in the extreme, in the clarity and in the whole awkward and scary whole of it - just like I experienced it yesterday. Telling your story is cathartic, I always knew that, but I never realised until then that telling a story also makes you feel the story, makes you experience the things, in your mind, as if they just happened. It was less than a second after Paul had answered, that this feeling hit me, came back to me, this feeling or.. this moment, this moment of Cecile being pulled off my shoulder. It's when I noticed in which direction we walked.

I froze on the spot. I froze, and I must have turned even more pale and even more cold than i had been all day. It didn't take long for someone to notice, it was the new intern, he had just started two weeks ago, and he was one of those two or three who were a bit slower. I guess he must have been searching something in his bag or so, because he walked straight into me, just hit his head at the back of my left shoulder. I don't remember if I really felt it, but I woke up from my daze in that moment and of course everyone turned around when they heard the distinct bone-on-bone sound of him walking into me. They stared at me while I opened and closed my jaw helplessly a few times, without any sound coming out, it was like my tongue was doing something independent from my lips and jaw and lungs. Paul said, sternly and rudely ""I said let's get out of here"". I guess the rudeness took everyone by surprise since they didn't know *why* we left early. They must have assumed it was because he was in a really good mood or maybe a birthday or maybe he was a bit sick and just wanted to get home early himself. I could see the surprise glances flying between the others, the intern behind me squeezed out a muffled ""sorry, sorry Mark"". I don't know what Paul and I looked like, I just stared at his face, and he at mine, both of us pale and even to the others the dread in our eyes must have been obvious. ""No.. no.. not the elevators."" I pressed out. ""P.. please"".

Paul was having none of it. ""I said we get out"". He spoke but to me it sounded like he was screaming, shouting, like he *wanted* to shout. He grabbed my arm and forcefully dragged me along, my voice failed me again, I tried to speak, say something, but there was nothing I could do, the rest, obviously stunned, fell behind for a few moments, for a few moments, exactly until Paul barked ""Go"". One word was enough, the situation was so tense - and none of them could have known why - the situation was so tense, just from these few moments, these raw emotions that obviously must have shaken two adult men into the most unusual behaviour they - we - had ever shown. I tried to pull back, but my feet kept walking while Paul kept pulling my arm, he must have been hurting me but I didn't feel it, all I could think of was that there is one single place I did not want to be, one single place that I knew was now the wrong place to be.

It didn't take long, I guess, I can't really find the following moments from my memory. What I remember though is the moment the finger touched the button. I'm not sure who's finger it was, I didn't look a the finger, it's the button I stared at because I knew what it meant. Just a moment later an elevator opened - on the left side, in the middle. It had been standing there. ""At least it's not *that* one"" I thought, or I guess I must have thought it, because somehow now I was pulling forward. I knew there was no way out of this, no way out of this except to tell everyone the whole story, and I knew, I just knew, after our odd behaviour that everyone would just think I was insane in that very moment. Paul and I got in first. Someone, probably Thomas as well, suggested that the rest of them would wait there for the next elevator - we really must have scared them. But Paul ordered them in, and, in a weird mix of hesitation and hurry, they all came in. The elevator nearly closed the last two out but something got in front of the sensor - maybe someone stretched out their hand? - and the door opened again and they came in.

The new intern - I really should know his name by now - pressed the button for the ground floor and probably was surprised when Paul just pushed it as well, as if he didn't notice the intern's finger. Me just standing next to him, right at the wall, far away from the center of the elevator, far away from the emergency exit. Especially the intern must have been surprised when Paul kept pushing the button again and again and again and again, quickly, one time after the other, faster and faster, as if pushing it more would somehow make the elevator speed up.

We moved downwards, with the typical clonking sound you hear when the elevator starts its journey, and I could feel the tension in the small cabin, I could feel how our bodies were churning out stress hormones at an unhealthy rate, how our hearts were all beating twice as fast as normal. How everybody, even as they didn't know anything that Paul knew, much less even, what I knew, just had one thought, one goal: To get out. You know this moment of fear, when you don't want to think, do, say anything - you just want to run? That is, and I'm not doubting that for a second, that is what every one of us felt. That's what every one of us felt - when it happened.

Exactly the same loud, screeching sound of metal scraping metal. The sudden, hard stop. All lights went out.

That's when I broke. I'm not sure if I heard the small metallic sound that I had heard the day before, the sound that had burned itself in my brain like none ever before, the sound that I associated with whatever it was that had taken Cecile. I'm not sure if I heard that sound, among all the other noise, but I guess I must have. Or maybe I just reacted to the situation, to the night with barely any sleep, to the day that I was ruminating and worrying, to the accumulated tension that had kept me awake until then against my exhaustion and fear.

That moment my brain turned itself off, I became something else, something purely emotional, something primal. My lungs - not me, my lungs - let out a roar, a scream, a sound that was a mix of anger and hate and even more anger while my fist, already cold from terror, clenched hard. I was screaming as never before while my arm hammered my hand hard against the glass mirror on the wall, I could feel how I was pushing against the metal frame of the elevator behind it, how glass pieces were cutting through my skin and flying all over the room. There was no light but I felt as if I could see, I simply knew where everyone was, I could feel, I could *see* the expressions of fear on my colleagues' faces, I could see how Paul jumped back, probably right onto the intern, but, mainly, most importantly, away from me. I was jumping up and screaming at the top of my lungs ""LEAVE ME ALONE. LEAVE ME ALONG, HAVEN'T I SUFFERED ENOUGH?!!?"" My fists must have kept hammering against the mirrors and walls, I must have kept screaming, but all I can remember from then on is how I felt, how my insides were boiling with a mix of terror and rage, how every muscle, every fibre, every cell of my body awoke in just one moment, how I jumped up so strongly that my elbow hit the ceiling and how I came back down with a loud, crunching sound that shaked the whole elevator. It fell. It moved. The elevator moved, fell, I should say, because from the hazy blurr that I remember I remember feeling this special feeling, you know when you are on an airplane, and suddenly the floor seems to fall down, away from your feet, and then it takes just a fraction of a second for you to follow, but you feel it, I felt it. That didn't stop me, of course, I kept screaming, I can't remember breathing in at all, all I did was I threw all the air that was inside me, together with all the tension and anger from a day of pure terror, I was pressing all this out, trying to throw it at whatever it was, at whatever this thing was that had terrorised me, that had taken Cecile, that must have taken the others. I was never before so alive and at the same time so not in myself, I wasn't me, just this primal being full of anger and terror. I didn't notice the lights turning on, I don't remember seeing and I don't remember not seeing either. I just knew where everything was in that dreadful room, I knew where it all was, even when I saw that now it was not just the reflection of my face that was full of terror, but also the faces of my coworkers, all of us covered in shards and cuts and with skin that looked as if someone had drained the colour out of the world. The difference being that I was scared of *that*, but they were scared of *me*.

Maybe I screamed until we arrived downstairs, the ground floor, safety, until the doors started to open and until my bloody and snow-white hands pushed between the opening door. I basically ripped it open, just with that one goal of getting out, just with that one goal of getting *away*, of running, of running as far as I could, of running until my breath would fail me.

Someone was following me and I knew it was Paul, it was not just that I knew he was a great runner, and that I could, when the fog from my mind slowly cleared, hear the regularity of his steps that only a trained runner has. I knew it was Paul because I knew that he would have been the only one able to move, the only one who knew enough, who could understand enough, to be able to run after me when I sped out of that elevator, when I jumped the security gate and pushed the guard aside and ran against the exit door so hard that it flew to the side against the frame of bulletproof glass.

I knew it was Paul, and when I realised that I finally noticed my body again. It hit me heavy how tired, no, exhausted to the maximum, my body was. I started to feel the first cold air of the evening flying past me. I started to feel the pain of my feet, then my hands, stinging with pain. My muscles, they must have been cramping for a while. I have no idea about how long, but I ran at least two miles, in a straight line, I must have crossed busy streets and walked past pedestrians but I have no recollection of that at all. I just slowed down, like a runner ending his race behind the finish line. I tried slowing down to a walk, when I felt my knees giving in, when I fell backwards, on my hurting hand that stung again in pain, but at least it kept me sitting until Paul moved my back against a car.

I might have blacked out for a moment, or maybe I just don't remember. You know, our brains can't really process too many things at once, and when there is too much coming in your brain just shuts down for a moment, resetting itself to be able to function. I remember being next to Paul, both of us breathing hard, my chest hurting, if from the screaming or the running or something else, I have no idea. But I felt the catharsis. The terror had left me, I would have laughed if I had had the energy for it. We sat for a while, people walked by but I didn't even look up to see who they were or how they would react to us, two well-dressed men, sitting there full of shards and blood and pale as snow and breathing with deep gasps. I could feel Pauls head falling on my shoulder and I knew he didn't care either. 

It took us a while to get back up. Paul supported me, my right foot felt - feels - like something is cutting deep inside my flesh, like some broken bone. But we didn't care about a doctor or a hospital. We just needed to get somewhere with a Whiskey and silence and privacy. We didn't even talk about that, I guess we just both knew the other wanted the same. We got a taxi, Paul did it, I couldn't even think straight, I could only feel, could only try and process all this emotion that was now, slowly, fading away. I could feel my body calming down, very slowly, my heart pumping hard to refill the energy reserves of my muscles and cells.

I told him, tonight, I told Paul everything. I told him what happened, with the elevator, with Cecile, with writing on here and how you made me realise I wasn't crazy. We cried while we sat in his apartment, talking, getting it all out, emptying our hearts with all the fear and terror we had felt. I realise that he probably had been worse off then me. It was the unknown that scared me so much, the not understanding - and he had it seen building up for weeks. He said I should write it off my soul, to go back to here and share my story - and he would do the same with his diary. Writing helps, he said, it gets your thoughts in order. It helps to process the things that happened, it helps to put your memories in order. Paul got a call from two or three of our colleagues, I don't think he answered. What would he tell them? That I am insane, he would have to say. That a harmless broken elevator was what triggered some sort of insanity from all those hours of overtime I've been doing, a mental breakdown, a burnout from work and party and worry and lack of sleep.

And, I guess, that's what we will say. I would like to tell them my story. I like my colleagues, they are good people. And I would like to warn them, in case this.. whatever it is.. is still there. We escaped from something, but I don't know how or why. I would like to tell my colleagues what happened, tell them, warn them, and I really want them to understand me, I don't want them to be scared of me or worried about me.

But I know I have only two options: either I will plead insanity, temporary insanity - that I had a breakdown from all the stress, and when the elevator stopped it just triggered it. IfI say that they might have pity and they might forget that I covered them in shards and someday they might be able to sit in the same room with me again. Or I could tell them what I told you. I could tell them what happened. And then they would certainly never again believe even for a moment that I could be sane. They would laugh, awkwardly and dismiss what happened today as nothing, or, more exactly, as just me being crazy. They would live their lives as if nothing happened, just with one person less in it.. and I fear then something will happen to them. I will tell them it was just a breakdown, because if someone is only insane for a moment, then you will always have a small grain of doubt. You will always think that maybe, after all, this person that was always normal and is now normal again, you will think that maybe in that moment he wasn't insane, that maybe there is something true about it. At least then I can hope that they will be careful. 

I know yesterday many of you pushed me to do this. I will try to find some sort of authorities that I can talk to, that I can forward this text with a few more details about the place and people involved, so that they can send someone who knows how to deal with.. strange things. There is something, I know it with certainty. But I know I can only tell them anonymously, because, simply, I know no one will believe me and I don't want to end up in an asylum. Now, while reflecting on it, I realise this may be the hardest part. For the next weeks, months, years, maybe my whole life I will have to pretend nothing happened. I will meet thousands of people, maybe someday I will marry and raise kids. And I realise now that the scariest, hardest, most impossible part, the worst part about experiencing something unbelievable, about what I experienced the last two days - the worst part is that nobody will ever believe you."
